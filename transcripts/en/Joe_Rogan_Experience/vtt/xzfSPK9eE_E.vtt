8
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.011
<v Speaker 1>commute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes being stuck in your car or </v>

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>m and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go there right now,</v>

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get one free audio book.</v>

16
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>A book I recommend is called the war of </v>
<v Speaker 1>art by Steven Pressfield.</v>

17
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give it out to people.</v>

18
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I have a stack of them at my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

19
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it's all about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about overcoming resistance,</v>

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>which is something that holds a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us back when we procrastinate about </v>

21
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel crappy about it,</v>

22
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>but when we get things done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel great.</v>

23
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>But how many people actually follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and continue to get things done?</v>

24
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of reasons why.</v>

25
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:32.401
<v Speaker 1>And Steven Pressfield is a brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer and the way he gets into it,</v>

26
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>it'll sync with your head so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be like,</v>

27
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my issue.</v>

28
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>And then from then on you're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to know what the issue is </v>

29
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>immediately when it massive manifests </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

30
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And you'll look at it in a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

31
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:51.571
<v Speaker 1>I've told so many people about this book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had so many people come back </v>

32
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.231
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book completely changed the way I </v>

33
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:55.231
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

34
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:55.231
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>for creative type folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

36
00:01:56.141 --> 00:02:01.141
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's amazing for anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that whole resistance </v>

37
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.961
<v Speaker 1>thing in procrastination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that sort of a plays a part in a</v>

38
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>lot of people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has anything to do with</v>

39
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>just being artistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He relates it to writing and art and </v>

40
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>creating things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it probably goes to a lot of</v>

41
00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:18.661
<v Speaker 1>different things that you do in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that you put your focus </v>

42
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:18.661
<v Speaker 1>towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you enjoy.</v>

43
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audible.com</v>

44
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>forward slash joe were also brought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by onnit o n n I t.</v>

45
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot of new stuff in including a</v>
<v Speaker 1>club bells and mace balls and of course </v>

46
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>we have kettle bells and battle ropes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

47
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what it is.</v>

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially like a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance website.</v>

50
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:45.121
<v Speaker 1>Like what we're interested in is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things and increase athletic </v>

51
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.961
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that increase mental </v>

52
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:48.961
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are called nootropics.</v>

53
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And we saw one of those called Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

54
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>If you've heard this all before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

55
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to keep saying it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

56
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's no other way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still clubs look like weapons.</v>

57
00:02:57.881 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're starting to add weapons to on it.</v>

58
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>That's just the no weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will help you wield the weapon,</v>

59
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but what they are is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ancient Indian exercises.</v>

60
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

61
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a boy that used to do them with </v>

62
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>hardwoods like hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

63
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:21.091
<v Speaker 1>probably thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the awkward shape of them and the </v>

64
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>balance of them makes you a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthens up your forearms and your </v>

65
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

66
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great exercise as far as like </v>

67
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and hand strength and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

68
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Club bells are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be surprised at how difficult they</v>

69
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:41.401
<v Speaker 1>are to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only used five pounders throw that </v>

70
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>hard to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for,</v>

71
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>with a 25 pound club bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a serious workout in.</v>

72
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we look at weights and you know,</v>

73
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>we looked at like lifting weight and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

74
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>and people are all impressed if they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift 300 pounds and you know,</v>

75
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:58.081
<v Speaker 1>a bunch to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter if you can't </v>

76
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:01.231
<v Speaker 1>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that I'm interested in is all </v>

77
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:04.770
<v Speaker 1>different exercises that have been shown</v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually increase athletic </v>

78
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.341
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm interested in is improving the </v>

79
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:11.011
<v Speaker 1>way your body moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're interested in </v>

80
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:13.951
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we sell the extreme </v>

81
00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>kettlebell cardio DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have many different weights and sizes</v>

82
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>of kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have medicine balls,</v>

83
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>we have wall balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are these big giant,</v>

84
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 1>also looked like medicine balls.</v>

85
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>You throw him against the wall and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>host of different supplements.</v>

86
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Anything that we've found anywhere that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe increases performance </v>

87
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:36.961
<v Speaker 1>increases your mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a supplement called new mood </v>

88
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that it increases your body's ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce serotonin.</v>

89
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has five htp and l Tryptophan in it,</v>

90
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

91

00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>which is tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tonight.</v>

118
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Tonight we're at the icehouse 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM show.</v>

119
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thompson girl.</v>

120
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Christina pundits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make it.</v>

121
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't make enough,</v>

122
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.970
<v Speaker 1>but when</v>

123
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 2>we had a huge show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

124
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have you.</v>

125
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.610
<v Speaker 2>We have Maddie Khurshid returning to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy stage doing comedy recently.</v>

126
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Matt Medicaid used to open up for Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 2>back back in the day and he was one of </v>

127
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 2>my favorite comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was hilarious.</v>

128
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and various hilarious,</v>

129
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 2>so he's going to join us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also have Sam triply Johnny Pemberton</v>

130
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 2>and Tony Hinchcliffe and Josh fattom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benji.</v>

131
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

132
00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Ten o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're freaks and we'll see you there.</v>

133
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have on the podcast Dr Amad Goswami.</v>

134
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Am I pronouncing her name correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sir?</v>

135
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get to the bottom of shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

136
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>We're going to learn some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to enlighten us.</v>

137
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Set.</v>

138
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

139
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>

140
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.910
<v Speaker 2>We are here with Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goswami.</v>

141
00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate it.</v>

142
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of your videos online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of your your work and it is</v>

143
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.250
<v Speaker 2>some very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fascinating and for a person is </v>

144
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.021
<v Speaker 2>dumb as I am confusing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of quantum mechanics and the </v>

145
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 2>just when someone uses the word quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you find that a lot of folks that </v>

146
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.050
<v Speaker 2>just eyes glaze over?</v>

147
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not anymore because you know the most </v>

148
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.240
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most complex complex concepts</v>

149
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 3>of quantum physics is quantum leap is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the discontinuous condition.</v>

150
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 3>When that gives an idea of how foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is to a mind which thinks in the </v>

151
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Newtonian fashion you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motion is continuous and quantum leap is</v>

152
00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 3>discontinuous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's used everywhere today.</v>

153
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

154
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 3>You know if anything unusual happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say took a quantum leap,</v>

155
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.400
<v Speaker 3>so that has the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they mean by that?</v>

156
00:07:56.401 --> 00:08:00.180
<v Speaker 3>I think they just mean like a big jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they just been a big challenge.</v>

157
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a discontinuous jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably would hesitate and what </v>

158
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.291
<v Speaker 3>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that exactly mean by </v>

159
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:09.291
<v Speaker 3>discontinuous jump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to go back a little.</v>

160
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so think of electrons going around the </v>

161
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 3>atomic nucleus in anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

162
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.680
<v Speaker 3>When electrons jump from one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>orbits to another arbit,</v>

163
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>it does not go to the intervening space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However much surprising to your </v>

164
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.931
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mind that is just suspend your </v>

165
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.961
<v Speaker 3>disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that the electron is here and </v>

166
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:37.521
<v Speaker 3>then the electron is there and the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>arpit nothing in between in space and </v>

167
00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:37.980
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

168
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 2>not so it just some sort or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

169
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>They teleport themselves or are </v>
<v Speaker 2>teleported.</v>

170
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science fiction language capture a </v>

171
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.330
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where do they go in between?</v>

172
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 3>We have to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

173
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.980
<v Speaker 3>they go to the domain of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what quantum physics brings that </v>

174
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it seems to be just this one space</v>

175
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 3>time reality that we call it nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not true.</v>

176
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.130
<v Speaker 3>There is another reality which must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>called supernature transcendent reality.</v>

177
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Just like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual traditions are saying,</v>

178
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 3>just like the psychologists are saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the turn of the century,</v>

179
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 3>19th century pride discovered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept of unconscious,</v>

180
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 3>unconscious conscious to all levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

181
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 3>The spiritual traditions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent,</v>

182
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 3>even again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two levels of reality.</v>

183
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Quantum physics in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the yard,</v>

184
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 3>1925,</v>
<v Speaker 3>26,</v>

185
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 3>discovered the same thing three times </v>
<v Speaker 3>the charm.</v>

186
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 3>This time we better observe the idea and</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to live with,</v>

187
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:46.041
<v Speaker 3>but there are two levels of our reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quantum physics says one level is level </v>

188
00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 3>of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wherever taken is possibility.</v>

189
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Nothing concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no king,</v>

190
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 3>no king this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then this level of reality,</v>

191
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 3>who are we of course live where we find </v>
<v Speaker 3>things manifest,</v>

192
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 3>what things look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're particles,</v>

193
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete,</v>

194
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 3>solid liquid gases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of these are concrete objects.</v>

195
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 3>We have become used to them as concrete </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>

196
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 3>but they begin as possibilities in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent,</v>

197
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>so to break it down for the lay person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the lowest form or the </v>

198
00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:24.451
<v Speaker 1>smallest form of the universe that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can measure when we get to subatomic </v>

199
00:10:24.701 --> 00:10:28.750
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we can look at subatomic particles,</v>

200
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.460
<v Speaker 1>they defy the laws of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They exist in the same space at the same</v>

201
00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:34.810
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two different places.</v>

202
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.880
<v Speaker 1>They can be both moving and still and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can teleport themselves</v>

203
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.730
<v Speaker 3>a little more complex than it actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

204
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 3>It's less complex than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Less complex than thou because we have </v>

205
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.581
<v Speaker 3>to realize these objects can be shown to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be at two places at the same time,</v>

206
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 3>but only in possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

207
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.960
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to think about it.</v>

208
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 3>I try and I just broke my brain because </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work possibilities familiar to this </v>

209
00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:15.011
<v Speaker 3>is why we did a couple of hours to write</v>
<v Speaker 3>her own days because they're a little </v>

210
00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:20.000
<v Speaker 3>bit strange what is possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we know what possibilities.</v>

211
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Possibilities are things that glimpse at</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

212
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.080
<v Speaker 3>but nothing that we can put our finger </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it because this so they become fact,</v>

213
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:33.740
<v Speaker 3>but right now it's just an idea right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

214
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 3>It's just an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

215
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.810
<v Speaker 3>it begins with our reality begins with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these possibilities.</v>

216
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.490
<v Speaker 3>A possibility of an electron being </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere in the room.</v>

217
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Our knowledge is limited.</v>

218
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.410
<v Speaker 3>We only know that it's possible to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>the electron here.</v>

219
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.670
<v Speaker 3>They're at the ceiling maybe at here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

220
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know,</v>

221
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 3>but it actually will be if I actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to see it,</v>

222
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 3>try to measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to observe it,</v>

223
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.940
<v Speaker 3>and that's the second domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second domain is the domain of </v>

224
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.481
<v Speaker 3>manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When an observer tries to measure where </v>

225
00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:13.201
<v Speaker 3>the electron is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the observer will find it at a definite </v>

226
00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 3>place as a particle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the manifest reality.</v>

227
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 3>So something that is a wave of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility being,</v>

228
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:24.991
<v Speaker 3>having the capacity of being everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>without measurement becomes the concrete</v>

229
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 3>object that we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

230
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a thing there it is at a definite </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

231
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 3>So by only by measuring it and measuring</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

232
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm only by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very hard thing to understand.</v>

233
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.850
<v Speaker 3>It is very hard to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it if you're measuring it and </v>

234
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>that's when it becomes a a concrete </v>
<v Speaker 3>object,</v>

235
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.710
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

236
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Just assuming it wasn't a concrete </v>
<v Speaker 3>object before you measured it and that </v>

237
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.961
<v Speaker 3>it's always a concrete object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the team you hadn't measured it </v>

238
00:12:57.961 --> 00:12:57.961
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

239
00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Today we have a new era of physics in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which we can propose something which you</v>

240
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:09.090
<v Speaker 3>cannot actually see what the consequent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't listen to this.</v>

241
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Please let the consequences of it can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>

242
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.580
<v Speaker 3>So our theories are so good that what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have visualized as theory,</v>

243
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.230
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of it is predicted so </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well that we got to believe this </v>

244
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.781
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no choice because the </v>

245
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:32.160
<v Speaker 3>consequences of predicted like one part </v>
<v Speaker 3>in $100 million to that kind of </v>

246
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.331
<v Speaker 3>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the kind of theory that just </v>

247
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:39.811
<v Speaker 3>boggles your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never had the capacity of </v>

248
00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 3>predicting something this accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the picture says that,</v>

249
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:48.601
<v Speaker 3>well they started as possibility and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they become actually to have no </v>

250
00:13:48.601 --> 00:13:48.601
<v Speaker 3>option but to accept it.</v>

251
00:13:48.601 --> 00:13:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Although I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

252
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

253
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.300
<v Speaker 3>it sounds strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean anytime you're talking about </v>

254
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.300
<v Speaker 3>supernature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people will say,</v>

255
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already knew land,</v>

256
00:13:57.251 --> 00:14:02.251
<v Speaker 3>but you are not in Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are in quantum reality where quantum </v>

257
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 3>reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

258
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:07.831
<v Speaker 3>land also real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is also the thing that people need </v>

259
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:09.320
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

260
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had a really hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjusting any of this stuff,</v>

261
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.460
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that people need to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at first I think is the idea of </v>

262
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 3>superposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that,</v>

263
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 3>what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that they have measured things </v>

264
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 3>both moving and still at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have shown that things can leap</v>

265
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 3>from one place to another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our real reality as far as science,</v>

266
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 3>as far as like accepted pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>universally,</v>

267
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

268
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.080
<v Speaker 3>there's no debate in the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>community about the movement of </v>

269
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Subatomic particles right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody subatomic particles involving </v>

270
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 3>discontinuing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no debate.</v>

271
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.430
<v Speaker 3>So that becomes tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That becomes Dr.</v>

272
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Goswami,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes</v>

273
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.830
<v Speaker 1>the laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

274
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that is a real tricky thing to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap your head around Vl trippy thing </v>

275
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 1>that when you go the smaller you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it becomes magic,</v>

276
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.960
<v Speaker 1>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes something that doesn't exist </v>

277
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:09.960
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In our rational world,</v>

278
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.560
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More and tricking them.</v>

279
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:17.561
<v Speaker 3>Debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me claim the full claim of quantum </v>

280
00:15:17.561 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>physics is not only saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller you go,</v>

281
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.800
<v Speaker 3>but they've brought chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you realized that the reality at </v>

282
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 3>the macro scale is made of this small </v>
<v Speaker 3>tanks,</v>

283
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.390
<v Speaker 3>so of course they affect is visible much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more easily measured in this part,</v>

284
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.380
<v Speaker 3>the small things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when the small things make big </v>

285
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:37.380
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>

286
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 3>microphones and you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our body that is,</v>

287
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.220
<v Speaker 3>they're all quantum objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we also,</v>

288
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 3>when nobody is observing us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including ourselves,</v>

289
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.780
<v Speaker 3>like when we sleep deep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no body is observing me.</v>

290
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am only a possibility.</v>

291
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:02.230
<v Speaker 3>The only reason I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can find myself in the same bed every </v>

292
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 3>night when I wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason for that is that because</v>

293
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm a macro object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my waiver possibility,</v>

294
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 3>although it expansive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as always must expand.</v>

295
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.050
<v Speaker 3>You have seen water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've expanding,</v>

296
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Detroit Bebo my pebble have what?</v>

297
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 3>The water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water waves will expand,</v>

298
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing happens with west.</v>

299
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.720
<v Speaker 3>The possibility we do tend to expand </v>
<v Speaker 3>when as soon as you go to sleep as a way</v>

300
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:33.721
<v Speaker 3>of a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the waves are so sluggish or macro </v>

301
00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:37.451
<v Speaker 3>objects for me to move substantial </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance that somebody can discern it.</v>

302
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It'll take the edge of the universe so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't discern it.</v>

303
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 3>It moves like 10 to the minus 16 </v>
<v Speaker 3>centimeter,</v>

304
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.980
<v Speaker 3>but today with leisure beams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can actually measure such small </v>

305
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.731
<v Speaker 3>distances that these macro objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even macro objects move while Newtonian </v>

306
00:16:57.201 --> 00:16:58.080
<v Speaker 3>physics of setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

307
00:16:58.081 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're addressed.</v>

308
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 3>What are common sense to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

309
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are not moving.</v>

310
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 3>But with leisure beam we can actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure that between your looking and my</v>

311
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:11.561
<v Speaker 3>looking just great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second objects actually moves which </v>

312
00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:13.110
<v Speaker 3>appear to be stressed and have a totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

313
00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we live in a heavy,</v>

314
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:16.970
<v Speaker 3>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy,</v>

315
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 3>wonderfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a creative world wide creative because </v>

316
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.131
<v Speaker 3>this movement also suggest something </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic that there are new </v>

317
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:32.201
<v Speaker 3>possibilities and if we could capture </v>
<v Speaker 3>those new possibilities and make them </v>

318
00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 3>manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes prednisone of creativity.</v>

319
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.810
<v Speaker 1>So this what you're saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects like this desk are not,</v>

320
00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:44.700
<v Speaker 1>in fact still what are slightly moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly moving all the time and what is</v>

321
00:17:44.701 --> 00:17:47.850
<v Speaker 1>the number that they're moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far it.</v>

322
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly at the center</v>

323
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 3>of mass of this table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

324
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:56.661
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty massive property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moving a block tend to the minus 18 </v>

325
00:17:56.661 --> 00:17:59.590
<v Speaker 3>centimeters in a dishonorable time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a minute</v>

326
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.000
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just sort of moves back and forth.</v>

327
00:18:02.001 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole world we really do live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like a holiday.</v>

328
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Well Hello Graham is not always the good</v>
<v Speaker 3>better for pet.</v>

329
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 3>It is for this case because the objects </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of appeared in more than one place.</v>

330
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.240
<v Speaker 3>In that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hologram,</v>

331
00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:19.790
<v Speaker 3>the information appears everywhere on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hologram.</v>

332
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.360
<v Speaker 3>So these objects carry information which</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in more than one place potentially.</v>

333
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 3>It is more than one one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why we say that we have </v>

334
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.291
<v Speaker 3>discovered a new world of potential from</v>
<v Speaker 3>which our ordinary reality is created,</v>

335
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.170
<v Speaker 3>so ordinary reality is not as fixed as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they taught it to us.</v>

336
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:44.350
<v Speaker 3>If you allow the objects to go more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more into quantum domain in the realm of</v>

337
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.360
<v Speaker 3>expansion into new possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that while it has not expanded before,</v>

338
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.240
<v Speaker 3>not so much with tables and chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine too,</v>

339
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.890
<v Speaker 3>but we taught tarts with our feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we can really get into creativity.</v>

340
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you go into the quantum domain </v>

341
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:03.620
<v Speaker 1>with your creativity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

342
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 3>That's when then I have to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the creative process.</v>

343
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the creative process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>

344
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 3>researchers have found that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>four stages.</v>

345
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.170
<v Speaker 3>The first stage everybody knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>preparing.</v>

346
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.360
<v Speaker 3>That just added up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked with you.</v>

347
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 3>I get some knowledge from picking your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand.</v>

348
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I listened to a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen to audios,</v>

349
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 3>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet of course,</v>

350
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 3>and get some knowledge about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>

351
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:37.730
<v Speaker 3>and then creativity such as find a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>French thing happens the most creative </v>

352
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 3>people that are not just doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>preparation.</v>

353
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:47.090
<v Speaker 3>They also sit quietly and do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really sit quietly and do nothing.</v>

354
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 3>They call it the period of incubation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bird sits on an egg,</v>

355
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 3>doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Magic.</v>

356
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 3>It was a tremendous surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody understood,</v>

357
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:04.050
<v Speaker 3>why do we need to sit down in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity after all his action?</v>

358
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Why do we need to sit down quietly?</v>

359
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 3>You need to do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then quantum physicists come along </v>

360
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.110
<v Speaker 3>and realized that in between our </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

361
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:18.111
<v Speaker 3>these objects talks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are possibilities of meaning that </v>

362
00:20:18.111 --> 00:20:22.421
<v Speaker 3>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like always as talking about the </v>

363
00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:23.430
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where before if a toy pebble in a pond,</v>

364
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.180
<v Speaker 3>the water goes to expand as expanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>crest lines.</v>

365
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.390
<v Speaker 3>So same thing happens with the thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>they expand in meaning become wave.</v>

366
00:20:33.341 --> 00:20:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Some multiple meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities of multiple meaning,</v>

367
00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 3>multiple meaning expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding,</v>

368
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 3>expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more they expand,</v>

369
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 3>the more meaning this packet of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility or contained and so you have</v>

370
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 3>a better idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better possibility,</v>

371
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:53.341
<v Speaker 3>better probability of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of capturing a new meaning because if </v>

372
00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 3>you have a bigger possibility pool to </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose from,</v>

373
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 3>obviously your chance of being creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>is greater.</v>

374
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:04.410
<v Speaker 3>This is the idea that has explained how </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity comes to us.</v>

375
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Then when the actual answer appears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new meaning that we are seeking,</v>

376
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.560
<v Speaker 3>when it appears in the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I see the gestalt of all the </v>

377
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 3>new meanings that'll give answer to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

378
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.670
<v Speaker 3>then I fake it.</v>

379
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Then I choose it still in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious.</v>

380
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 3>That's where my causal power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity lies in the unconscious,</v>

381
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.800
<v Speaker 3>but now it becomes conscious with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone.</v>

382
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.400
<v Speaker 3>This is the quantum leap at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>continuous change from possibility to </v>

383
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.040
<v Speaker 3>actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I actually captured the new job.</v>

384
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I actually captured the new thought and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's so surprising because it's </v>

385
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:44.360
<v Speaker 3>new creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>researcher,</v>

386
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 3>scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha insight.</v>

387
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.330
<v Speaker 3>You have a heart of our heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that the imagination is a</v>

388
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 3>quantum realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagination takes us to the jail.</v>

389
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.320
<v Speaker 3>More possibility if we can do it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious into the unconscious.</v>

390
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Conscious imagination is still a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stepping stone to they're doing a </v>

391
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 3>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we imagined consciously,</v>

392
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:13.070
<v Speaker 3>that is like stoking the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That eventually gets into the </v>

393
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.221
<v Speaker 3>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where things have this </v>

394
00:22:17.221 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 3>capacity of propagating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding,</v>

395
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.760
<v Speaker 3>wavelight becoming bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pools of possibility for consciousness </v>

396
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.901
<v Speaker 3>to choose from and when we choose a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility might arise or the whole </v>

397
00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 3>combination of new possibilities my </v>
<v Speaker 3>learner might arise which are contained.</v>

398
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.600
<v Speaker 3>The answer to my question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very interesting way to break </v>

399
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 3>down creativity that I've never heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

400
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

401
00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it is not that old.</v>

402
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a paper on it in 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

403
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.930
<v Speaker 3>but you know how communication is today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very complex because there is too </v>

404
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.420
<v Speaker 3>much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

405
00:22:50.421 --> 00:22:55.421
<v Speaker 3>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a fantastic theory that explains </v>

406
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:55.421
<v Speaker 3>all the aspects of creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>material,</v>

407
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.910
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiments,</v>

408
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.010
<v Speaker 3>kegerator data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

409
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 3>the other theories are just inadequate </v>
<v Speaker 3>to explain the creative process.</v>

410
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just very mysterious.</v>

411
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I call it the Doobie Doobie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do process because you need to do,</v>

412
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but you also need to be doing nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create,</v>

413
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.620
<v Speaker 3>to create the key or the creation </v>
<v Speaker 3>process has always been fascinating to </v>

414
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.660
<v Speaker 3>me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying this for awhile.</v>

415
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Then I think we don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the idea of the imagination of </v>

416
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 3>what's in the mind as being just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

417
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 3>pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make believe daydreaming like that.</v>

418
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:36.661
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things come to mind when we think </v>

419
00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:39.151
<v Speaker 3>of imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything physical that exists was </v>

420
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:43.201
<v Speaker 3>created in the imagination of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination is a machine for creating </v>

421
00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The imagination created power.</v>

422
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.980
<v Speaker 1>The imagination created satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are all because of the </v>

423
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without the human imagination,</v>

424
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 1>there would be nothing.</v>

425
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Well yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now we look at it frivolously,</v>

426
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.740
<v Speaker 3>but quantum physics is taking a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit further it.</v>

427
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Imagination is a good starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>

428
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 3>lack of imagination is still in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious talk,</v>

429
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.960
<v Speaker 3>so we have to understand that when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have conscious talks of imagination,</v>

430
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.640
<v Speaker 3>then we are proposing the unconscious to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at new stuff,</v>

431
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 3>process new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what we are doing.</v>

432
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 3>What imagination takes us is from </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary reality,</v>

433
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:31.630
<v Speaker 3>mundane reality that a familiar stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination inbetween hopster.</v>

434
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's imagination.</v>

435
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:40.181
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to confirm to the to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mundane stuff necessarily read.</v>

436
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.900
<v Speaker 3>We can imagine very arbitrary stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what it does,</v>

437
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.910
<v Speaker 3>it starts the beginning of a thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>process where talks can become more and </v>

438
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 3>more and more and more weird and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more and more and more new,</v>

439
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.890
<v Speaker 3>but they're no longer process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no longer possible to process them </v>

440
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:00.050
<v Speaker 3>into conscious because then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

441
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 3>we just kind of do it.</v>

442
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:06.330
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are still limited by what we know </v>

443
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.670
<v Speaker 3>they known imposes too much constraint </v>
<v Speaker 3>on what we can imagine in the domain of </v>

444
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:16.691
<v Speaker 3>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as it gets into the </v>

445
00:25:16.691 --> 00:25:19.091
<v Speaker 3>unconscious unconscious stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more reimagine the imaginary stuff will </v>

446
00:25:19.091 --> 00:25:23.891
<v Speaker 3>interact with other imaginary stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 3>talks will mix and this mixing waves </v>

447
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 3>together will produce patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self logical patterns of interference of</v>

448
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:32.951
<v Speaker 3>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even mentioning super position with </v>

449
00:25:32.951 --> 00:25:35.300
<v Speaker 3>super superpose and creating many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many more new possibilities than before </v>

450
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.730
<v Speaker 3>and one of these possibilities may very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well be brand new that the effort has </v>

451
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 3>been manifested before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's always a mystery.</v>

452
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.200
<v Speaker 3>How do we go from the known into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown?</v>

453
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:50.710
<v Speaker 3>The way we go is this taking advantage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what we call quantum thinking,</v>

454
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.790
<v Speaker 3>thinking where we take advantage of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>quantum domain.</v>

455
00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.850
<v Speaker 3>They told me in a possibility where a </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility interacting with possibility</v>

456
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 3>create sub completely new stuff that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>never manifested before.</v>

457
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you say that you believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is non nonlocal,</v>

458
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by that?</v>

459
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if discontinuity.</v>

460
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.130
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are already familiar with </v>

461
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.130
<v Speaker 3>discontinuities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you want to know even most,</v>

462
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.420
<v Speaker 3>most unfamiliar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most intriguing.</v>

463
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.490
<v Speaker 3>You know this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like Voodoo.</v>

464
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 3>This is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now getting into real cracks of the most</v>

465
00:26:32.491 --> 00:26:35.400
<v Speaker 3>surprising thing in quantum physics that</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprised even Einstein.</v>

466
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Einstein in his whole life could not </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe this concept of nonlocality,</v>

467
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 3>which he himself discovered with two </v>
<v Speaker 3>other later on.</v>

468
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 3>How did they discover it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to discover just theory.</v>

469
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding what the tour addition.</v>

470
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.080
<v Speaker 3>He never shouldn't say never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could probably do the experiments in </v>

471
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 3>his young days when he was a graduate </v>
<v Speaker 3>student,</v>

472
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I did took that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theories don't do an experiment.</v>

473
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do is this,</v>

474
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.460
<v Speaker 3>a creative exploration of the mind by </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day to find new ideas,</v>

475
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 3>the new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they then to predict stuff.</v>

476
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.070
<v Speaker 3>So I starting a idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is 1935 mind to understanding </v>

477
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.130
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that if quantum objects to quantum </v>

478
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 3>objects interact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become correlated.</v>

479
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 3>And this is a new word that he used in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that paper.</v>

480
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 3>He and his collaborators have Rosen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos,</v>

481
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:34.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that really sound in that </v>

482
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mathematics,</v>

483
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 3>that if two objects once become </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlated,</v>

484
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.750
<v Speaker 3>they kniffen when they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting,</v>

485
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.960
<v Speaker 3>even if they move away from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even then they can communicate,</v>

486
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 3>not in the usual way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not interacting with signals.</v>

487
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Then the ducks fuse will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I are interacting right now,</v>

488
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.640
<v Speaker 3>but we are interacting through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity of soundwave,</v>

489
00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 3>sudden electrical wires to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>microphones.</v>

490
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
<v Speaker 3>That's all true signals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these objects communicate without </v>

491
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.180
<v Speaker 3>signals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their communication use as a medium </v>

492
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 3>that can only be outside of space and </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

493
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Because in space and time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Einstein himself gave us a theory of </v>

494
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.711
<v Speaker 3>relativity which says that nothing can </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact without exchanging signals </v>

495
00:28:24.711 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 3>going through space and time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these objects,</v>

496
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:33.501
<v Speaker 3>quantum objects once correlated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the capacity of signal less </v>

497
00:28:33.501 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

498
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:39.170
<v Speaker 3>This is what is called non local signals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that local going through space,</v>

499
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:44.330
<v Speaker 3>taking them out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they measure that these particles </v>

500
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.230
<v Speaker 3>are communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the key is in that they measure the </v>

501
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.741
<v Speaker 3>communication and the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is no signal because the </v>

502
00:28:51.741 --> 00:28:55.641
<v Speaker 3>communication took place faster than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>speed of light in all local signal going</v>

503
00:28:56.401 --> 00:29:01.401
<v Speaker 3>to space and time must travel either at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light or less than the </v>

504
00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:06.291
<v Speaker 3>speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if something can be shown to travel </v>

505
00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 3>faster than the speed of light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be non local.</v>

506
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And this is what a physicist discovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the laboratory I learned in 1982.</v>

507
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Finally verified by Einstein was dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago,</v>

508
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.900
<v Speaker 3>1955.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he never knew that his theory was one</v>

509
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only prove to variety,</v>

510
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 3>but really revolutionized the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>world of physics by bringing in concepts</v>

511
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness.</v>

512
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.910
<v Speaker 3>So what did they measure when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>measuring information that transfers </v>

513
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 3>between two particles?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they measuring?</v>

514
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 3>The experiment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a little bit complex?</v>

515
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Probably for a store like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

516
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.120
<v Speaker 3>but I can give you stuff for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know if it's intriguing.</v>

517
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 3>They definitely are also easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand because there is no signal is</v>

518
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:57.751
<v Speaker 3>easy to understand how to detect it is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little more difficult because you have </v>

519
00:29:57.751 --> 00:30:01.951
<v Speaker 3>to talk about four times and Portland's </v>
<v Speaker 3>come with a characteristic </v>

520
00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:06.090
<v Speaker 3>characteristic called polarization and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get more and more technical and I'm </v>

521
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:08.740
<v Speaker 3>sure your listeners will get a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>dry.</v>

522
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 3>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll run away.</v>

523
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.150
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't go that far.</v>

524
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

525
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:19.040
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we had it and address certain atoms </v>

526
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 3>with relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they met.</v>

527
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I pair of photons one going </v>
<v Speaker 3>this way,</v>

528
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 3>one going that way.</v>

529
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:30.030
<v Speaker 3>So what these experimenters did one </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment or was measuring this photon </v>

530
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.411
<v Speaker 3>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one was measuring the photon </v>

531
00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:38.310
<v Speaker 3>over there in the laboratory is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated by a laboratory distance </v>

532
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.260
<v Speaker 3>several meters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way the communication went,</v>

533
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 3>they could flip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what takes,</v>

534
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:52.951
<v Speaker 3>gets a little complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could flip the prioritization </v>

535
00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:56.101
<v Speaker 3>access of the one of the photons and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other for transportation access seem to </v>

536
00:30:56.111 --> 00:31:01.111
<v Speaker 3>have flipped instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could show this by the technology </v>

537
00:31:01.181 --> 00:31:02.770
<v Speaker 3>that we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

538
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.800
<v Speaker 3>So it was faster than the speed of light</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that shows that there's not a local </v>

539
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 3>communication that shows around local </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication between these two tiles.</v>

540
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:15.750
<v Speaker 3>In case you're wondering what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quanta of light in this could bundle </v>

541
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.850
<v Speaker 3>stoplight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

542
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:19.270
<v Speaker 3>how does that correlate to nonlocal </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness?</v>

543
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.630
<v Speaker 3>How to correlate to nonlocal </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is the strangest thing </v>

544
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.970
<v Speaker 3>that physics is bringing.</v>

545
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.440
<v Speaker 3>The the reason common consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>enters physics was clear even to </v>

546
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:36.871
<v Speaker 3>Heisenberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was back in the 19 twenties when </v>

547
00:31:36.871 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Heisenberg discovered his theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He himself said that,</v>

548
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.980
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening when we measure a </v>

549
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.081
<v Speaker 3>quantum object before measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we knew the object only vaguely.</v>

550
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Possibly the object is here somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we knew.</v>

551
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 3>We could only talk about possibility and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probability,</v>

552
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 3>but after we measure is a change in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge about the object.</v>

553
00:31:57.971 --> 00:32:02.971
<v Speaker 3>We know what the object is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have measured so from vague knowledge</v>

554
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 3>to concrete knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what the measurement is about.</v>

555
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>notice the word knowledge was used.</v>

556
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 3>What is knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

557
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:17.250
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the word consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from two Latin words come which</v>

558
00:32:18.341 --> 00:32:23.341
<v Speaker 3>is con with and the rest of the work </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from the Latin words,</v>

559
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Cuba as C I r,</v>
<v Speaker 3>e,</v>

560
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 3>scooter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means to know.</v>

561
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.490
<v Speaker 3>So consciousness is the entity we </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitch.</v>

562
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:38.550
<v Speaker 3>We know so in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening when we measure it?</v>

563
00:32:39.201 --> 00:32:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Change in consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So hence,</v>

564
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 3>Heisenberg himself was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that measurement process must involve </v>

565
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to prove it.</v>

566
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.380
<v Speaker 3>John von Neumann,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

567
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 3>took the crucial step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He showed that the to change an object,</v>

568
00:32:56.901 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 3>a material object from possibility to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actuality that concrete math,</v>

569
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 3>you could not do this with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And material interaction,</v>

570
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.560
<v Speaker 3>no material interactions can ever change</v>
<v Speaker 3>a possibility with,</v>

571
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:17.140
<v Speaker 3>into a particle of actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll think about it if material </v>

572
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.981
<v Speaker 3>interactions cannot do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is needed is some nonmaterial </v>

573
00:33:20.981 --> 00:33:25.271
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean those molecules are </v>

574
00:33:25.271 --> 00:33:25.271
<v Speaker 3>conscious in some sort of way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

575
00:33:25.271 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 3>that means that consciousness within </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness must be otherwise.</v>

576
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 3>There'll be duality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are not,</v>

577
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 3>we don't set that molecules are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

578
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:35.690
<v Speaker 3>but we some molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have to be.</v>

579
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Speaker 3>We did consciousness because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is the ground of being and</v>

580
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 3>molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>atoms,</v>

581
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.270
<v Speaker 3>solid objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>

582
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 3>everything is within consciousness as </v>
<v Speaker 3>waves of possibility.</v>

583
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Then we can think of this force that </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes possibility to actuality as a </v>

584
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:56.860
<v Speaker 3>conscious choice because what is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility where,</v>

585
00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.870
<v Speaker 3>but a packet of multi faceted potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of stuff can happen,</v>

586
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multi-Facets and consciousness users,</v>

587
00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 3>that particular facet that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>concretized,</v>

588
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:12.370
<v Speaker 3>that becomes sexualized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in this way we have found not only </v>

589
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.601
<v Speaker 3>the force that consciousness implies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that changes possibility to actuality,</v>

590
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but we know the nature of that force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It consists of choice,</v>

591
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.800
<v Speaker 3>consciousness chooses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so why is non locality coming in?</v>

592
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.610
<v Speaker 3>So how does consciousness choose in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment like a space?</v>

593
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Here is a possibility of photon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here is another possibility of Fortuyn </v>

594
00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:40.390
<v Speaker 3>consciousness must be choosing them </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously because otherwise </v>

595
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no non local communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the local</v>

596
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 1>communication proves that there is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of consciousness going on,</v>

597
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:54.310
<v Speaker 3>but a non vocal communication troops </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is some form of matrix that </v>

598
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.740
<v Speaker 3>it that is involved with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication that is faster than the </v>

599
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.400
<v Speaker 3>that pervades faster than the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>light communication and therefore must </v>

600
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.831
<v Speaker 3>be outside of space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a connection that we can't </v>

601
00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:09.641
<v Speaker 3>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a connection that we can </v>

602
00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.891
<v Speaker 3>theorize about and that connection has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be consciousness because it involves </v>

603
00:35:11.891 --> 00:35:13.010
<v Speaker 3>a change about knowledge</v>

604
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Gulf consciousness the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally because what you're saying </v>

605
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.650
<v Speaker 1>is an instantaneous distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

606
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I think what a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of as consciousness is,</v>

607
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.690
<v Speaker 1>is being sentient.</v>

608
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

609
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 3>But this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the.</v>

610
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.690
<v Speaker 3>This is the original consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the.</v>

611
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 3>This is the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the base,</v>

612
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.380
<v Speaker 3>this is the base to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is why we connected to spiritual</v>

613
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:44.990
<v Speaker 3>tradition so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must have heard that the new science</v>

614
00:35:44.991 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 3>is connecting science and spirituality </v>
<v Speaker 3>and once it gets down to the Voodoo,</v>

615
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 3>they almost have to know when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to those quantum particles,</v>

616
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

617
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:55.760
<v Speaker 3>what else you got?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you got over here,</v>

618
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.270
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sit down.</v>

619
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like in Buddhism,</v>

620
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:01.820
<v Speaker 3>terroristic score,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

621
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.680
<v Speaker 3>just surprising lines that you hear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that sort of job.</v>

622
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 3>What does your face before you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>born,</v>

623
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you see the possibility in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel,</v>

624
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.580
<v Speaker 3>what does your face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the face of an electron before </v>

625
00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 3>it is born of what is the sound of 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>clapping,</v>

626
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:20.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

627
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 3>One Hand clapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

628
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Very poignant sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

629
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim in quantum physics was the sound of </v>

630
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.111
<v Speaker 3>one hand clapping possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sound of one hand clapping is no </v>

631
00:36:33.111 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 3>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sound possibility,</v>

632
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 3>only possibility of sound or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>is there.</v>

633
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Because if he hears something that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be sound right.</v>

634
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.720
<v Speaker 3>If it takes the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if it makes contact with something </v>

635
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:44.720
<v Speaker 3>else in the realm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

636
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.910
<v Speaker 3>I still don't understand how that </v>
<v Speaker 3>relates to human consciousness being non</v>

637
00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:52.640
<v Speaker 3>local instead of contained inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

638
00:36:52.641 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 3>so I'm coming to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

639
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.310
<v Speaker 3>so then they say the consciousness as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground of being.</v>

640
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 3>When it chooses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get actuality.</v>

641
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.440
<v Speaker 3>So when you force one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the polarity of one to change,</v>

642
00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:10.410
<v Speaker 3>the other one chooses to stay with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay with it,</v>

643
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.790
<v Speaker 3>and that's a concrete measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Concrete measurement,</v>

644
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:19.791
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And possibility became measured </v>

645
00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:19.791
<v Speaker 3>concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're saying that the,</v>

646
00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:22.830
<v Speaker 3>that the medium that chooses is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>medium called consciousness.</v>

647
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.840
<v Speaker 3>The unconscious straight at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now when the measurement action has </v>

648
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 3>taken place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>

649
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 3>There has to be two observers with </v>
<v Speaker 3>brains in those locations because </v>

650
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 3>consciousness just does not measured </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbitrarily.</v>

651
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

652
00:37:38.331 --> 00:37:42.210
<v Speaker 3>the idea of those of it changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be conscious to change.</v>

653
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 3>It can't be just a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is consciousness and there is this</v>

654
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:50.661
<v Speaker 3>observers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is not only we need the </v>

655
00:37:50.661 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 3>concept of nonlocal consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>connecting the objects,</v>

656
00:37:51.901 --> 00:37:56.901
<v Speaker 3>connecting the observers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we also need the need to get the </v>

657
00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:59.250
<v Speaker 3>concept that at the same time there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonlocal consciousness,</v>

658
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 3>nonmaterial consciousness chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

659
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.230
<v Speaker 3>there must also be the observer because </v>
<v Speaker 3>without the observer,</v>

660
00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you never see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever.</v>

661
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Can you ever imagine finding something </v>
<v Speaker 3>without an observer without a censhare,</v>

662
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 3>so you have to measure the effect of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Observer.</v>

663
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.220
<v Speaker 3>The Observer is Austin got the presence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the observer changes the experiment.</v>

664
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.440
<v Speaker 3>The presidents of separate which changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experiment.</v>

665
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Presidents of the observer is essential </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the experiment itself.</v>

666
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Not only nonlocal consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says central,</v>

667
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.720
<v Speaker 3>but so is the observers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to factor that in when </v>

668
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720
<v Speaker 3>considering the possibility of nonlocal </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

669
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.990
<v Speaker 3>You have to factor that in when </v>
<v Speaker 3>considering the possibility of </v>

670
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.410
<v Speaker 3>actualizing actualizing the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>without individual consciousness </v>

671
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 3>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No actualization ever x place.</v>

672
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 3>So nonlocal consciousness is a question </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

673
00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

674
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Speaker 3>it's an unconscious existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are processed,</v>

675
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 3>but nothing concrete happens in nonlocal</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

676
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Only when the observer is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then this concretization that we are </v>

677
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 3>calling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use the word collapsed,</v>

678
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:19.170
<v Speaker 3>the webs collapse into the particle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this imply that before you </v>

679
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 3>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing else did as well.</v>

680
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does this imply?</v>

681
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 3>So it implies something very strange to </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolve.</v>

682
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Initially what it implies is that before</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked you yourself did not exist </v>

683
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.230
<v Speaker 3>before you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't even exist.</v>

684
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But can we assume that all this other </v>

685
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.420
<v Speaker 3>shit was already here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

686
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 3>So the looking process of looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>process of collapse,</v>

687
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 3>pub sub changing possibility and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually do not only creates the object,</v>

688
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.170
<v Speaker 3>it creates the very subject that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced you.</v>

689
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:02.250
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to all the other people that you </v>

690
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 3>live in the neighborhood with these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these buildings were real before you got</v>

691
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:06.550
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

692
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

693
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.790
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

694
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.820
<v Speaker 3>they're real as possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that not real as actually in your </v>

695
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.380
<v Speaker 3>world or in the world period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is your world the whole world?</v>

696
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Will it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebodies got to be present in order to</v>

697
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:25.621
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I cannot say that only me can </v>

698
00:40:25.621 --> 00:40:25.621
<v Speaker 3>create actually.</v>

699
00:40:25.621 --> 00:40:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're essentially saying that if you'd </v>

700
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:29.490
<v Speaker 3>never seen something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't exist.</v>

701
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get there.</v>

702
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a sentient objects.</v>

703
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Someone someone has to observe before </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility become sexuality.</v>

704
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone has to make it somewhat.</v>

705
00:40:41.911 --> 00:40:46.911
<v Speaker 3>There's a building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we are sort of the quantum </v>

706
00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:46.911
<v Speaker 3>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

707
00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 3>We have the quantum connection to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

708
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.060
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonlocal consciousness all exists,</v>

709
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

710
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.440
<v Speaker 3>but that does not change possibility to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actuality only in the presence of a </v>

711
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.121
<v Speaker 3>concrete observer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostability changes to actually put two </v>

712
00:41:03.121 --> 00:41:07.411
<v Speaker 3>and two together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens in the presence of an </v>

713
00:41:07.411 --> 00:41:10.240
<v Speaker 3>observer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nalco nonlocal consciousness collapses,</v>

714
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 3>gives us our clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without Observer,</v>

715
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 3>there is no collapsed update possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>into actuality,</v>

716
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.560
<v Speaker 3>but then look at it from the other angle</v>
<v Speaker 3>without collapsed.</v>

717
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.440
<v Speaker 3>What is the Observer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no concrete.</v>

718
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brain is just a possibility.</v>

719
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:29.870
<v Speaker 3>This circularity is the key to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding who I quantum measurement </v>

720
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 3>can takes place in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the circularity,</v>

721
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:35.810
<v Speaker 3>this circular kind of logic.</v>

722
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:40.900
<v Speaker 3>The circular logic is what manifests </v>
<v Speaker 3>what manifest reality from possibility </v>

723
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.600
<v Speaker 3>it all of these devices like the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain or human living or living Celt,</v>

724
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 3>living cell of an Amoeba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even simpler stock pictures,</v>

725
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.620
<v Speaker 3>all this heavy mysterious entities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have theorized about but could not </v>

726
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 3>explain the basic characteristic late </v>
<v Speaker 3>life sanctions.</v>

727
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Now we can understand how they occur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They occur to quantum measurement </v>

728
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 3>involving the circular logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dark Hofstetter,</v>

729
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:14.310
<v Speaker 3>who is an artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>researcher,</v>

730
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.460
<v Speaker 3>wrote a marvelous book in 1988 called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Godel Escher,</v>

731
00:42:17.461 --> 00:42:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Bach in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conductor.</v>

732
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:24.100
<v Speaker 3>These circular logical systems as </v>
<v Speaker 3>tangled hierarchies,</v>

733
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 3>so as surprising as it sounds to joe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just throw out to you,</v>

734
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:34.930
<v Speaker 3>brain has a tangled hierarchy within it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a specialty and because it has </v>

735
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:41.471
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is capable of experiencing </v>

736
00:42:41.471 --> 00:42:44.890
<v Speaker 3>consciousness as being the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It captures the subject of </v>

737
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:50.381
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness identifies with the brain </v>

738
00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:54.730
<v Speaker 3>and brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the brain is involved in the </v>

739
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 3>measurement process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we who are carrying that brain will say,</v>

740
00:42:56.841 --> 00:43:01.841
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at the electronic just as </v>

741
00:43:01.841 --> 00:43:05.891
<v Speaker 3>you will brain looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking at Ahmed as I'm looking </v>

742
00:43:05.891 --> 00:43:07.850
<v Speaker 3>at Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does that come from?</v>

743
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Before the measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are just consciousness,</v>

744
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.860
<v Speaker 3>nonlocal consciousness and possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>within it.</v>

745
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also understand that although I've</v>

746
00:43:16.721 --> 00:43:21.721
<v Speaker 1>never been to downtown Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real dudes have been there to take </v>

747
00:43:21.721 --> 00:43:22.270
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

748
00:43:22.271 --> 00:43:23.950
<v Speaker 1>people built it and they wrote books </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

749
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.280
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have to go there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it as an observer to know </v>

750
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.080
<v Speaker 1>that it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

751
00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.850
<v Speaker 1>someone has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone had to,</v>

752
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:39.170
<v Speaker 3>if everybody and try to all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden just fall asleep including all </v>

753
00:43:39.541 --> 00:43:44.541
<v Speaker 3>sentient creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there will be no concrete detroit.</v>

754
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:48.690
<v Speaker 3>That does not mean that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the truck comes to life again comes</v>

755
00:43:48.691 --> 00:43:52.140
<v Speaker 3>to our consciousness again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as objects,</v>

756
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.830
<v Speaker 3>it will become a different detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No changes don't occur that fast.</v>

757
00:43:55.831 --> 00:44:00.831
<v Speaker 3>You remember the waves of possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very sluggish for macroscopic </v>

758
00:44:01.021 --> 00:44:06.021
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they try to capture will appear at </v>

759
00:44:06.021 --> 00:44:07.440
<v Speaker 3>the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same colors,</v>

760
00:44:07.441 --> 00:44:10.170
<v Speaker 3>the same houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same streets and all of that.</v>

761
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Except that mistake occurs in thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is always there.</v>

762
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.860
<v Speaker 3>It's there.</v>

763
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I still am not understanding how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human consciousness could be measured or</v>

764
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:31.270
<v Speaker 1>proven to be nonlocal when the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we believe is the center of all </v>

765
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 1>this activity</v>

766
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.550
<v Speaker 2>that we equate the consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very effected if it's shut </v>

767
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.140
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's damaged and know that it affects</v>

768
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.930
<v Speaker 2>consciousness profoundly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is,</v>

769
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:48.170
<v Speaker 2>what is the basis for believing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this consciousness is not proven </v>

770
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out just asking like what?</v>

771
00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Let's turn our light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're really saying.</v>

772
00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.460
<v Speaker 3>So I at the brain make it a presentation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that consciousness that we are </v>

773
00:45:01.161 --> 00:45:04.130
<v Speaker 3>calling nonlocal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you build a picture of what it is.</v>

774
00:45:04.131 --> 00:45:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Same for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

775
00:45:06.261 --> 00:45:08.090
<v Speaker 3>think of it as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

776
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:10.570
<v Speaker 3>you have seen our archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

777
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:15.670
<v Speaker 3>The island stand out over the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but underneath all the islands are </v>

778
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:19.691
<v Speaker 3>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So think of as connected by this </v>

779
00:45:19.691 --> 00:45:22.640
<v Speaker 3>overarching nonlocal consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then we are also individual brains,</v>

780
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making.</v>

781
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:28.931
<v Speaker 3>Each of us are making a representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the consciousness that we call our </v>

782
00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:32.480
<v Speaker 3>subject taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a subject to the object,</v>

783
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:37.630
<v Speaker 3>but I'm an object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use the subject so we both have that </v>

784
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.551
<v Speaker 3>as a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we know that we are non locally </v>

785
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:43.130
<v Speaker 3>connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a neurophysiologist or the university</v>

786
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:45.560
<v Speaker 3>or Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the verified this.</v>

787
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.150
<v Speaker 3>How do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

788
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:52.270
<v Speaker 3>let's meditate together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said with the idea that we will be </v>

789
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:57.190
<v Speaker 3>communicating without signals directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>without signals,</v>

790
00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.920
<v Speaker 3>so we meditate for 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we're sent over to what is called </v>

791
00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.780
<v Speaker 3>faraday cages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cages are cages chambers,</v>

792
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.050
<v Speaker 3>which are electromagnetically in </v>
<v Speaker 3>pervious.</v>

793
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.580
<v Speaker 3>No electromagnetic wave can go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the walls of this package,</v>

794
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.550
<v Speaker 3>so you and I are sitting in individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>product pages.</v>

795
00:46:16.551 --> 00:46:21.551
<v Speaker 3>What that means is that we cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with any kind of </v>

796
00:46:21.551 --> 00:46:21.551
<v Speaker 3>electromagnetic signals</v>

797
00:46:21.551 --> 00:46:23.950
<v Speaker 2>so you can't send a message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a text message,</v>

798
00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

799
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.010
<v Speaker 3>cannot send a message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can extend an electromagnetic method</v>

800
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.720
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it,</v>

801
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.870
<v Speaker 3>nothing can get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we are still meditating with the </v>

802
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:35.211
<v Speaker 3>idea that somehow we'll communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly without signals and now are </v>

803
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 3>both of our brains that are connected to</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual eeg machines,</v>

804
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.100
<v Speaker 3>electroencephalogram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

805
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.240
<v Speaker 3>brainwaves and one of the subjects is </v>
<v Speaker 3>shown a series of light flashes that of </v>

806
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:53.631
<v Speaker 3>course will produce electrical activity </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the occipital area of the brain and </v>

807
00:46:53.631 --> 00:46:55.860
<v Speaker 3>the brain web operators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ge will pick it up,</v>

808
00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.240
<v Speaker 3>have heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It appears in time come in in a graph </v>

809
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.361
<v Speaker 3>which is called a evoked potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we extract the signal out of all </v>

810
00:47:05.361 --> 00:47:09.180
<v Speaker 3>the brainwaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminating the noise so far,</v>

811
00:47:09.181 --> 00:47:13.160
<v Speaker 3>no surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other subject is not fun.</v>

812
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 3>This is what the surprises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so please listen carefully.</v>

813
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 3>The other subject is not shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A series of light flashes,</v>

814
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 3>no light process at all.</v>

815
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:25.490
<v Speaker 3>The other subject is connected with </v>
<v Speaker 3>first subject only via this intention </v>

816
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will have direct communication.</v>

817
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 3>So how do you know direct communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>has occurred?</v>

818
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 3>The brain with some this subject not </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed to light waves,</v>

819
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:43.350
<v Speaker 3>just brainwaves of this subject was </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetating basically are picked up from </v>

820
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:48.841
<v Speaker 3>the electrodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were a machine connected to that </v>

821
00:47:48.841 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 3>brain and then analyzed in exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way.</v>

822
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Eliminate the noise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract the signal.</v>

823
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.500
<v Speaker 3>The two signals extracted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one from a subject who has seen light </v>

824
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:04.681
<v Speaker 3>flashes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one promise object which has not seen </v>

825
00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:07.601
<v Speaker 3>light flashes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tool can be extracted potentials.</v>

826
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:13.470
<v Speaker 3>One is the evoke potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one's called transferred </v>

827
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:17.010
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They overlap almost exactly like 70 </v>

828
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:21.440
<v Speaker 3>percent overlap is often the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent overlap of on sale.</v>

829
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.880
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll not only have the same strength </v>

830
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:26.880
<v Speaker 3>but also the same place.</v>

831
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.400
<v Speaker 2>So explain to the layman this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

832
00:48:29.401 --> 00:48:31.980
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're experiencing light flashes.</v>

833
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 2>The only one is experiencing one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is experience land,</v>

834
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.130
<v Speaker 2>not just the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is all right,</v>

835
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but the other one is has a reaction in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind,</v>

836
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.760
<v Speaker 2>his brain and new way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

837
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:45.870
<v Speaker 2>the light flashes</v>

838
00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.920
<v Speaker 3>reaction in his brain anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which shows that the effect of the light</v>

839
00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:54.921
<v Speaker 3>flashes electrical activity somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>without signals has been transferred </v>

840
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.740
<v Speaker 3>from one brain to the other.</v>

841
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Why was it then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm assume that consciousness is </v>

842
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:07.640
<v Speaker 2>nonlocal fat for we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say that the two brains are on </v>

843
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.410
<v Speaker 2>locally connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Han locally connected on locally </v>

844
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.240
<v Speaker 2>connected Matrix is what we call </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

845
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it possible though that the mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>is where consciousness is stored,</v>

846
00:49:19.161 --> 00:49:22.760
<v Speaker 2>but yet it communicates mountain locally</v>
<v Speaker 2>with other minds and other consciousness</v>

847
00:49:22.761 --> 00:49:27.761
<v Speaker 2>that are also stored in people's brains </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the consciousness is in the </v>

848
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:29.780
<v Speaker 2>brain and that the non locality is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the connection?</v>

849
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:31.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

850
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:32.260
<v Speaker 2>They were making,</v>

851
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:37.670
<v Speaker 3>making not quite considerable scenes </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>

852
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.510
<v Speaker 3>That's not inconceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That not comfortable,</v>

853
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:44.940
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you if I suppose you </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine,</v>

854
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.310
<v Speaker 3>imagine consciousness to be contained in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brain.</v>

855
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Imagine consciousness content in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprain and the district,</v>

856
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.880
<v Speaker 3>but what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were saying that my India team,</v>

857
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.130
<v Speaker 3>you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just</v>

858
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:58.160
<v Speaker 2>inventing another word</v>

859
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.640
<v Speaker 3>to convert the notion that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonlocal matrix.</v>

860
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.390
<v Speaker 3>You want to call it mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to call it consciousness.</v>

861
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the only difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

862
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.400
<v Speaker 3>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a brain here that his brain </v>

863
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.161
<v Speaker 3>here normally to loan it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that rain involved something </v>

864
00:50:16.161 --> 00:50:16.380
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What brain?</v>

865
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:21.410
<v Speaker 3>False brain contents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are words we can give but not </v>

866
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.510
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here is the brand.</v>

867
00:50:21.511 --> 00:50:26.511
<v Speaker 3>Here's the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow they are communicating right </v>

868
00:50:26.511 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 3>without any signals because signal could</v>
<v Speaker 3>not pass through the faraday cage </v>

869
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.550
<v Speaker 3>without any signal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This brain and this brain are </v>

870
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 3>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating by like quiet,</v>

871
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:42.100
<v Speaker 3>communicating with the transfer of </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual electrical potential that is </v>

872
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:45.400
<v Speaker 3>measurable by physical experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so nothing like mental telepathy,</v>

873
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical transfer of something,</v>

874
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:54.160
<v Speaker 3>physical transfer of energy without any </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal transfer of a reaction,</v>

875
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:59.170
<v Speaker 3>not in a physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical transfer of information that </v>

876
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.500
<v Speaker 3>puts that not energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no energy actually goes from one to the </v>

877
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the brains change in such a way that</v>

878
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:09.731
<v Speaker 3>is obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The synchrony in the way this brand </v>

879
00:51:09.731 --> 00:51:12.480
<v Speaker 3>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this brand changed because light </v>

880
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.780
<v Speaker 3>flashes fall under that brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This brain changing not because of light</v>

881
00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:19.781
<v Speaker 3>flashes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because this brain is associated </v>

882
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:19.781
<v Speaker 3>with this meditative awareness.</v>

883
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:24.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then wouldn't it do you justice to get </v>

884
00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 1>as far away from a city as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>because aren't you constantly </v>

885
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.431
<v Speaker 1>communicating with all the minds in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>city and if if they're all in a good </v>

886
00:51:31.431 --> 00:51:32.250
<v Speaker 1>headspace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

887
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 1>but if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't you experiencing the crazy light </v>

888
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 1>flashes of a million neighbors?</v>

889
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:42.610
<v Speaker 3>The possibilities are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They saving how far away can you get </v>

890
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.320
<v Speaker 3>them filled in at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>

891
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.530
<v Speaker 3>positive to have that much brain action </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>

892
00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if they're smart and does not</v>

893
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.210
<v Speaker 3>need to be so much scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

894
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.120
<v Speaker 3>it's true that some of that may very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well be true in the emotional domain.</v>

895
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I actually believed that it is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

896
00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.720
<v Speaker 3>but actually I believe it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's.</v>

897
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.750
<v Speaker 3>You could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at football stadium,</v>

898
00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:07.680
<v Speaker 3>we see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

899
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean one guy becomes angry and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>that anger spreads.</v>

900
00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 3>That's spread only locally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the people have not even seen </v>

901
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Speaker 3>the anger where it took place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gun,</v>

902
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.690
<v Speaker 3>so there could very well be a nonlocal </v>
<v Speaker 3>component in that</v>

903
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.740
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hive mind that you experienced in </v>

904
00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.531
<v Speaker 1>concerts as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you watch a concert and </v>

905
00:52:29.531 --> 00:52:31.871
<v Speaker 1>everyone has their hand up in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lighter and they're all singing </v>

906
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:31.871
<v Speaker 1>along the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

907
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're locked in there.</v>

908
00:52:32.721 --> 00:52:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Man affects us in a very positive</v>

909
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:40.110
<v Speaker 3>yes and so but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how does that not happen in a </v>

910
00:52:43.151 --> 00:52:45.730
<v Speaker 3>sitting at equilar web?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we would go crazy,</v>

911
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:50.790
<v Speaker 3>there isn't saving guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The saving grace is the need for </v>

912
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.340
<v Speaker 3>correlation unless you and I have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of intention that connects us,</v>

913
00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:04.890
<v Speaker 3>we will not be privileged to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this nonlocal consciousness </v>

914
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.850
<v Speaker 3>essentially saying so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

915
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:13.230
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in less we have some sort of context to </v>

916
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.931
<v Speaker 3>put it into our own lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't affect us as information </v>

917
00:53:15.931 --> 00:53:19.080
<v Speaker 3>quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives it more exactly correlation.</v>

918
00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 3>We need to be correlated like that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

919
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:27.550
<v Speaker 3>in the experiment that I just described,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the was performed first by a </v>

920
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 3>neuro physiologist named Bell Greenberg </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the list of Mexico.</v>

921
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

922
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.510
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

923
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his experiment dependent crucially on </v>

924
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.660
<v Speaker 3>this conscious meditative intention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

925
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 3>but people can get correlated simpler </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

926
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Like in a football stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are getting correlated just by </v>

927
00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:51.110
<v Speaker 3>simply the identification with the team </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

928
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 3>that can correlate people on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

929
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:58.790
<v Speaker 3>We never see people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we are correlated because we are </v>

930
00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:02.810
<v Speaker 3>some cause that brings us together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are many ways to get </v>

931
00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:05.070
<v Speaker 3>correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if people,</v>

932
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 3>once they become correlated certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

933
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

934
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:14.090
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to transfer emotions than </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual talks and the trail,</v>

935
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:19.270
<v Speaker 3>we don't correlate very well because </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk rational and restaurant,</v>

936
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.050
<v Speaker 3>it takes us away from this nonlocal </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

937
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 3>But when we are emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then this nonlocal consciousness can </v>

938
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 3>correlate us and the effects can travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>much better.</v>

939
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:36.500
<v Speaker 3>This is why one person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad mood can get another person to bad </v>

940
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.840
<v Speaker 3>mood or one person's happiness can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicated to another person's </v>

941
00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 3>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happiness is most certainly infectious.</v>

942
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why comedy clubs work</v>

943
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.410
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.190
<v Speaker 2>laughter becomes infectious when </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone around you is laughing at,</v>

945
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll have your laughing.</v>

946
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Meditation today is taking off like </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildfire in some places.</v>

947
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meditation,</v>

948
00:54:57.751 --> 00:55:00.180
<v Speaker 3>I think meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to India recently,</v>

949
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Bangalore and they have parks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

950
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 3>where people gather together every </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

951
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 3>like at six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>6:30,</v>

952
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.270
<v Speaker 3>and they will have this lafitte </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetation.</v>

953
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.920
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's wonderful thing to watch and you </v>

954
00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:14.920
<v Speaker 3>watch your self will start laughing.</v>

955
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just tickle each other or no,</v>

956
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.070
<v Speaker 2>without thinking like this is the thing.</v>

957
00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it of course is is local </v>

958
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:25.350
<v Speaker 3>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no denying it,</v>

959
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:29.290
<v Speaker 3>but that jokes and then just the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just start laughing.</v>

960
00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:32.890
<v Speaker 3>It was just started laughing and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to love so everybody just.</v>

961
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could not maintain that kind of </v>

962
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:38.380
<v Speaker 3>thing for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anything,</v>

963
00:55:38.381 --> 00:55:41.170
<v Speaker 3>the mouth muscles will be tired and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

964
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.320
<v Speaker 3>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that nonlocal correlation,</v>

965
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:49.321
<v Speaker 3>which comes into play after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see more than what you'd expect </v>

966
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:51.550
<v Speaker 3>just imitating other people to laugh.</v>

967
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>

968
00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:56.510
<v Speaker 2>So these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of them meet?</v>

969
00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 50 people,</v>

970
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe 50 people in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just get together and just laugh </v>

971
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.461
<v Speaker 2>for how long work for 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just howling.</v>

972
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

973
00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it is kind of a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very amusing.</v>

974
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you forgive me,</v>

975
00:56:15.991 --> 00:56:20.991
<v Speaker 2>I still don't understand how that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness nonlocal I understand that</v>

976
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 2>there's communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I that there's sort of a shared</v>

977
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:28.840
<v Speaker 3>laughing meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thing,</v>

978
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 3>the experiments you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

979
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.570
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something unusual happens.</v>

980
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not very difficult to show Deidre </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a psychologist working at the </v>

981
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Institute of noetic sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dean Radin does the following </v>

982
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:49.741
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes what is called random number </v>

983
00:56:49.741 --> 00:56:52.651
<v Speaker 3>generators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things are devices in which </v>

984
00:56:52.651 --> 00:56:57.151
<v Speaker 3>radioactive decay is that taking place </v>
<v Speaker 3>because are completed and as you know </v>

985
00:56:57.151 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 3>already activity the quantum process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely random.</v>

986
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Radioactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that again.</v>

987
00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the activity is a quantum process.</v>

988
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Completely random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Random decay have taken place.</v>

989
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:11.220
<v Speaker 3>These random decay is a process by </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer to generate random airways of </v>

990
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:16.231
<v Speaker 3>zeros and ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are called random number </v>

991
00:57:16.231 --> 00:57:16.231
<v Speaker 3>generators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

992
00:57:16.231 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of this so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have random already supposedly,</v>

993
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 3>and there'll be some deviation from </v>
<v Speaker 3>randomness which can be calculated.</v>

994
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 3>The rule sub statistics gives you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather than have the tremendous </v>

995
00:57:29.681 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 3>insight of taking these machines to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditative places,</v>

996
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:37.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he has actually done </v>
<v Speaker 3>this with loving meditators,</v>

997
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:42.181
<v Speaker 3>but he quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm saying is that in the </v>

998
00:57:42.181 --> 00:57:45.361
<v Speaker 3>presence of meditative pupil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this random number generators start </v>

999
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 3>behaving Nanda randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nanda,</v>

1000
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm normally quite way beyond what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted deviation should be.</v>

1001
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:58.230
<v Speaker 2>So were they concentrating on specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers to be generated once and it </v>

1002
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.390
<v Speaker 2>should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have one.</v>

1003
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Did they concentrate on specific one </v>
<v Speaker 2>group on zero,</v>

1004
00:58:09.461 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 2>one group on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1005
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just meditating,</v>

1006
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 2>just meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep dating.</v>

1007
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:14.750
<v Speaker 2>And how</v>

1008
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.570
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1009
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:20.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the random number generator did numbers </v>

1010
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.100
<v Speaker 3>degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not so random anymore,</v>

1011
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:23.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more zeros done one.</v>

1012
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Well wouldn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1013
00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole idea of quantum leaping</v>
<v Speaker 2>and quantum teleportation,</v>

1014
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 2>meaning that distance really isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>

1015
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:39.540
<v Speaker 2>This is not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is it that with these people </v>

1017
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.570
<v Speaker 2>meditating in the room with all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>jazz,</v>

1018
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.830
<v Speaker 2>that it affects it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I would assume anytime you run a</v>

1019
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:49.890
<v Speaker 2>random number generator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone meditating somewhere in </v>

1020
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:49.890
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably massive groups of them.</v>

1021
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:54.660
<v Speaker 2>How could the effect of just a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals vary that much from the </v>

1022
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:54.660
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

1023
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.000
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intelligent question.</v>

1024
00:58:56.001 --> 00:58:59.000
<v Speaker 3>But remember I also taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told about another factor.</v>

1025
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:04.070
<v Speaker 3>People have to be coordinated so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>local correlation is important.</v>

1026
00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you correlate and then look for this </v>

1027
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:13.721
<v Speaker 3>affects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>send people away and they're still </v>

1028
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:13.721
<v Speaker 3>demand correlated because they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditating,</v>

1029
00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.050
<v Speaker 3>then that should work if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1030
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:21.260
<v Speaker 3>if you set up a group of meditators but </v>
<v Speaker 3>not in Los Angeles but in Los Angeles,</v>

1031
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:25.700
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco and New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they all are correlated in some ways</v>

1032
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:30.701
<v Speaker 3>by telephone or by internet or some </v>
<v Speaker 3>intention given by a common source,</v>

1033
00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 3>ones are correlated and they start </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditating.</v>

1034
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Distance should not matter.</v>

1035
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what essentially what you're saying </v>

1036
00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:41.830
<v Speaker 2>is their energy focused on this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing can now be measured.</v>

1037
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if their energy is not focused </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>

1038
00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:49.561
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have an effect on it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on the thing has an effect and </v>

1039
00:59:49.561 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 2>the poker thing has been tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we translate the word forecasting to </v>

1040
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.481
<v Speaker 2>intention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would agree with focusing is too </v>

1041
00:59:57.481 --> 01:00:00.331
<v Speaker 2>general and Sunday the complete notion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like focusing.</v>

1042
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:03.700
<v Speaker 2>The intention is focusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>

1043
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.580
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's truly measurable,</v>

1044
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:11.610
<v Speaker 2>definitely shows are some effect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind has to accept that they weren't</v>

1045
01:00:12.221 --> 01:00:14.440
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use two different consciousness.</v>

1046
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness is happening,</v>

1047
01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:19.090
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still.</v>

1048
01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that</v>

1049
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:22.880
<v Speaker 3>keeps you.</v>

1050
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

1051
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that makes </v>

1052
01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:28.620
<v Speaker 2>consciousness being nonlocal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1053
01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:28.620
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

1054
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 3>how you communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our picture is very simple like this.</v>

1055
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.540
<v Speaker 3>You and I had transferred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Potential electrical activity was </v>

1056
01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.640
<v Speaker 3>transferred from my brain to your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>without an electrical connection.</v>

1057
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 3>The connection is nonlocal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No question,</v>

1058
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:48.251
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not having any difficulty with </v>

1059
01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:49.750
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just how do we interpret it to </v>

1060
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.900
<v Speaker 3>interpret it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could this happen?</v>

1061
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:56.170
<v Speaker 3>How could this happen is because you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although we have not been exposed to </v>

1062
01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.440
<v Speaker 3>these light flashes now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have in your brain memory of </v>

1063
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.361
<v Speaker 3>seeing light flashes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have seen light fascist many times </v>

1064
01:01:07.361 --> 01:01:09.440
<v Speaker 3>in your life and it's because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlated and no,</v>

1065
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have seen them before.</v>

1066
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:17.590
<v Speaker 3>So out of this memories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are all unconscious processes,</v>

1067
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you are vegetating,</v>

1068
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:24.470
<v Speaker 3>the unconscious brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious,</v>

1069
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.320
<v Speaker 3>unconscious because sub his brain stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and become.</v>

1070
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 3>They become the subjects of the objects </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the unconscious for processing.</v>

1071
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 3>So unconscious always has these memories</v>
<v Speaker 3>to process.</v>

1072
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens if you do an </v>

1073
01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:47.111
<v Speaker 2>experiment where one person experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they have no background </v>

1074
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:48.700
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen before.</v>

1075
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor does the other person in the room </v>

1076
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.890
<v Speaker 2>who's going to receive the signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does he process in that case,</v>

1077
01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:03.010
<v Speaker 2>be very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things done memory based on the brain.</v>

1078
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Memory exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Understanding what consciousness is </v>

1079
01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:08.020
<v Speaker 2>choosing from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did,</v>

1080
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 2>how did shitty way to communicate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

1081
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.270
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what a marvelous book.</v>

1082
01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to have memory of it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most things,</v>

1083
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.680
<v Speaker 2>most things that we think about help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most things,</v>

1084
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 2>they are exposed</v>

1085
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.460
<v Speaker 3>to have memories of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how,</v>

1086
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:25.560
<v Speaker 3>how many new things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely new things to do.</v>

1087
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Get exposed in a day.</v>

1088
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I will say with this dude on a weekend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and exposed to new shits on,</v>

1089
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:36.400
<v Speaker 2>but grill is zero because that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least something coming.</v>

1090
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I understand that there's communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do not understand the finding.</v>

1091
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Give the name</v>

1092
01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this memory being actualized in </v>

1093
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.580
<v Speaker 3>your brain</v>

1094
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.820
<v Speaker 2>as that cost or some sort of transfer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

1095
01:02:52.821 --> 01:02:54.140
<v Speaker 2>but not even a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1096
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it always on?</v>

1097
01:02:56.530 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remembered being quantum physics </v>

1098
01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 3>thinking classically again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1099
01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:06.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry your Tanya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being quantum physics Newtonian </v>

1100
01:03:06.261 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is the problem.</v>

1101
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:13.650
<v Speaker 3>We are all Newtonian when we are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>using subtle language so you have to get</v>

1102
01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:18.651
<v Speaker 3>used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand your brain is possibility </v>

1103
01:03:18.651 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 3>unconsciously just giving you </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

1104
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 3>So unless this entity called </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is choosing possibility,</v>

1105
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 3>it will not have the actual transport </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>

1106
01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how can you have it transferred?</v>

1107
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Potential you potential being </v>
<v Speaker 3>transferred by a nonlocal meet Matrix </v>

1108
01:03:33.511 --> 01:03:38.511
<v Speaker 3>that we're calling consciousness because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be consciousness who chooses </v>

1109
01:03:38.511 --> 01:03:43.250
<v Speaker 3>out of the possibilities of your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>generated by previous memory because you</v>

1110
01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:50.091
<v Speaker 3>are meditating with your partner and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>partner has seen this light flashes </v>

1111
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:57.290
<v Speaker 3>consciousness by virtue of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation is choosing from your </v>

1112
01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:01.071
<v Speaker 3>unconscious which has the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing more than that has the </v>

1113
01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.070
<v Speaker 3>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing more than that,</v>

1114
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:07.071
<v Speaker 3>no actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but consciousness is choosing the </v>

1115
01:04:07.071 --> 01:04:08.520
<v Speaker 3>actuality because you are meditating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>receive that.</v>

1116
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to disagree with you.</v>

1117
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.920
<v Speaker 2>This is why I understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1118
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I completely do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it necessarily means </v>

1119
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.940
<v Speaker 2>that your consciousness is non local,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can make an alternative model.</v>

1120
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:29.850
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't have to be an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

1121
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:34.851
<v Speaker 2>Just the idea of communication and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>through through information being passed</v>

1122
01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:40.101
<v Speaker 2>forth where what you're measuring is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>like imprecise the.</v>

1123
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.280
<v Speaker 2>You're saying 70 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1124
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:44.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1125
01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing in precise.</v>

1126
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of a signal being </v>

1127
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.791
<v Speaker 2>transferred between one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another separate papers happened to </v>

1128
01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:52.791
<v Speaker 2>percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

1129
01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1130
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't meditate when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditate.</v>

1131
01:04:57.290 --> 01:04:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The potential up.</v>

1132
01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:04.540
<v Speaker 3>The other person is vegetating is </v>
<v Speaker 3>practically nothing,</v>

1133
01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.210
<v Speaker 3>so there's no transfer whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adrenaline's meditating.</v>

1134
01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:10.730
<v Speaker 3>If you don't meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the never found.</v>

1135
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.500
<v Speaker 3>They never found any turn for potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whenever they would meditate,</v>

1136
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden there is the electric </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential which is like 70 percent,</v>

1137
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:24.130
<v Speaker 3>80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 percent of the detect if a potential.</v>

1138
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 3>There is something here.</v>

1139
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something being transferred </v>

1140
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.870
<v Speaker 1>weekends without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without any signal.</v>

1141
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I totally appreciate</v>

1142
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:38.430
<v Speaker 3>matrix between the two people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just giving it a name.</v>

1143
01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.650
<v Speaker 3>That metrics we call consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1144
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Because what is happening in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the.</v>

1145
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:46.080
<v Speaker 3>In the two people consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the vehicle to know it,</v>

1146
01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:51.260
<v Speaker 3>so what is happening is that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>is being transferred which has no basis </v>

1147
01:05:52.471 --> 01:05:57.471
<v Speaker 3>for the transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Transfer takes energy that is already </v>

1148
01:05:57.471 --> 01:06:00.351
<v Speaker 3>usually experienced here is transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking place without any energy </v>

1149
01:06:00.351 --> 01:06:01.070
<v Speaker 3>transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without any signal transfer,</v>

1150
01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 3>holding the understanding because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of that is already there in </v>

1151
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.921
<v Speaker 3>the other brain and consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>choosing the possibility and making it </v>

1152
01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:09.921
<v Speaker 3>actual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is</v>

1153
01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:12.720
<v Speaker 1>is that any different than distributing </v>
<v Speaker 1>information?</v>

1154
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>How is it any different than one person </v>
<v Speaker 1>has an experience and relays that </v>

1155
01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.250
<v Speaker 1>experience through information to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person,</v>

1156
01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>cannot local signals through something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a connection?</v>

1157
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at signals that even but not like </v>

1158
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>sound signals are being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>

1159
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the meditative state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ics exchanging information.</v>

1160
01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.860
<v Speaker 3>If it is not local thickness than it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness only.</v>

1161
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Now you got to getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just objecting to language,</v>

1162
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1163
01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>does the person who is sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other room who's receiving these </v>

1164
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>signals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they have a memory of this?</v>

1165
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>If there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a cognitive impact?</v>

1166
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Devastate definite signal that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>detecting for this brain.</v>

1167
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Does the person aware of it who detects </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1168
01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>The patient there is no cognitive</v>

1169
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.380
<v Speaker 3>mission and the other person because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is so complex,</v>

1170
01:07:03.381 --> 01:07:07.540
<v Speaker 3>unless you focus on something that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>will never,</v>

1171
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.560
<v Speaker 3>we have not yet been able to isolate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive change and the person.</v>

1172
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:17.890
<v Speaker 1>See that's where I'm having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the leap between what I </v>

1173
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:20.580
<v Speaker 1>understand to be a clear sense of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a communication,</v>

1174
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.030
<v Speaker 1>but how does that mean that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is long,</v>

1175
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>non local?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that not mean some real new </v>

1176
01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.830
<v Speaker 1>form of communication that is evolving </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the human body</v>

1177
01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:35.540
<v Speaker 3>already got the language.</v>

1178
01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean no,</v>

1179
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>it's that new form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

1180
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting Newtonian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I go Newtonian on,</v>

1181
01:07:41.181 --> 01:07:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Tony,</v>

1182
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.880
<v Speaker 1>they send you a farmer saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's rudimentary right now.</v>

1183
01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm just giving it a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1184
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>You agreed that there is something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're telling me,</v>

1185
01:07:54.921 --> 01:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand any of this.</v>

1186
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I agree that in your story and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and your experience,</v>

1187
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>sorry you all many times and</v>

1188
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 3>factually during this broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without signals at times for up </v>

1189
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 3>information or transfer of</v>

1190
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 5>you have put the electric potential</v>

1191
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.560
<v Speaker 1>completely based on your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1192
01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>spending mental data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean the story.</v>

1193
01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have your information that you're.</v>

1194
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You're presenting experimental data to </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2011.</v>

1195
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:32.820
<v Speaker 5>Birth order is in different parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1196
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:38.270
<v Speaker 5>what we call this matrix of times times </v>
<v Speaker 5>far up signals.</v>

1197
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:41.340
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>East Ohio had our differences.</v>

1198
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying is that it is.</v>

1199
01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the rest of our theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it takes consciousness.</v>

1200
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.740
<v Speaker 5>Anything information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we call this matrix consciousness.</v>

1201
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1202
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 1>And in fact the person is receiving it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other end.</v>

1203
01:08:56.811 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Even though consciousness is non local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person isn't even conscious.</v>

1204
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:05.500
<v Speaker 1>They're receiving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to look at it that way or </v>

1205
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:05.500
<v Speaker 1>cognizant</v>

1206
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:05.500
<v Speaker 5>that would not fit help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1207
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.850
<v Speaker 5>let's put the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember people already have data,</v>

1208
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:10.800
<v Speaker 5>extensive data up telepathy.</v>

1209
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>What's the most convincing data of </v>
<v Speaker 1>telepathy that you've experienced?</v>

1210
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:19.000
<v Speaker 5>I have myself experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1211
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or that you know,</v>

1212
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:23.150
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's subjective,</v>

1213
01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 5>so people up to object,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1214
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1215
01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:31.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these experiments called distant </v>

1216
01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 5>experiments have been done viewing </v>
<v Speaker 5>remote viewing.</v>

1217
01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:36.950
<v Speaker 5>It now done so accurately analyze by </v>
<v Speaker 5>computers.</v>

1218
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:40.460
<v Speaker 5>You were looking at a town square at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>statue.</v>

1219
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:46.570
<v Speaker 5>Your coordinated person coordinated by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the international export export and </v>

1220
01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:49.550
<v Speaker 5>metric is sitting in the closet in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>laboratory.</v>

1221
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 5>He's just drawing a picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure that you're looking at it.</v>

1222
01:09:55.370 --> 01:10:00.370
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A computer has chosen who it will go to </v>

1223
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:04.721
<v Speaker 5>look at the statute at computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unbeknownst to everyone connected with </v>

1224
01:10:04.721 --> 01:10:09.660
<v Speaker 5>the experiment is analyzing the picture </v>
<v Speaker 5>that with your coordinator friend,</v>

1225
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 5>psychic is drawing of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at and then computer is bringing</v>

1226
01:10:15.081 --> 01:10:18.260
<v Speaker 5>the two together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the picture of the statute that they are</v>

1227
01:10:18.261 --> 01:10:21.460
<v Speaker 5>actually looking at and the picture that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the person has drawn.</v>

1228
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 5>Computer does the matching and computer </v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

1229
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.560
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is 90 percent match between this.</v>

1230
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.040
<v Speaker 5>This could not be just a happenstance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1231
01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:34.100
<v Speaker 5>this got to be a transfer of </v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

1232
01:10:34.101 --> 01:10:36.610
<v Speaker 5>Got To be an example of telepathically.</v>

1233
01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 1>What is some studies specifically have </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown remote viewing tie to be that </v>

1234
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:46.691
<v Speaker 1>accurate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that you could just </v>

1235
01:10:46.691 --> 01:10:46.691
<v Speaker 1>for the folks listening?</v>

1236
01:10:46.691 --> 01:10:49.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That day said Russell targeted Harold </v>

1237
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 5>put off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>started this kind of experiment.</v>

1238
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 19 seventies.</v>

1239
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell Targ is actually coming on the </v>

1240
01:10:58.090 --> 01:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1241
01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be on in April.</v>

1242
01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put,</v>

1243
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.390
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the pioneers.</v>

1244
01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:07.380
<v Speaker 5>So distracted this and 19 slash 70,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 73,</v>

1245
01:11:07.381 --> 01:11:12.381
<v Speaker 5>74 if I remember it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he and her all put off his partner.</v>

1246
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 5>They did a lot of this in Sri Stanford </v>
<v Speaker 5>Research Institute.</v>

1247
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.980
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the new thing is that these are,</v>

1248
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.710
<v Speaker 5>the analysis is done much by very </v>
<v Speaker 5>objectively.</v>

1249
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.160
<v Speaker 5>It's no longer subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even then materialist object to it </v>

1250
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's still the mind,</v>

1251
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 5>but in the experiment that I gave you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>transport potential experiment of our </v>

1252
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 5>Greenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody can object because it is not.</v>

1253
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Mine is not involve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually cognitive cognition got </v>

1254
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People immediately start saying,</v>

1255
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's subjective,</v>

1256
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:50.940
<v Speaker 5>but here they transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That actually isn't the objective domain</v>

1257
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:56.130
<v Speaker 5>material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Measurable Material in measurable </v>

1258
01:11:56.130 --> 01:12:00.021
<v Speaker 5>electric potential here in material,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in measurable electric potential there </v>

1259
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:05.210
<v Speaker 5>in between.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No local connection and therefore the </v>

1260
01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:05.870
<v Speaker 5>proof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually in this experiment,</v>

1261
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:10.880
<v Speaker 5>the transport potential experiment is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the most accurate proof of nonlocality </v>

1262
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.790
<v Speaker 5>than you ever saw.</v>

1263
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So that means that there's a connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know about that has always</v>

1264
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:23.871
<v Speaker 1>existed between human beings constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that's missing is the</v>

1265
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:28.110
<v Speaker 1>intention and the focus on the two</v>

1266
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:31.430
<v Speaker 5>right now it's stated it complete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Accurate</v>

1267
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.280
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1268
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Is this something that you think as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have evolved from lower primates to </v>

1269
01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:43.121
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this something that is beginning to </v>

1270
01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:46.481
<v Speaker 1>show its potential in the human species </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that might improve and </v>

1271
01:12:46.481 --> 01:12:46.481
<v Speaker 1>expand</v>

1272
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:52.430
<v Speaker 5>if you'll believe other experimental </v>
<v Speaker 5>data that people have been collecting </v>

1273
01:12:53.621 --> 01:12:56.860
<v Speaker 5>since the early fifties or sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1274
01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.130
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the name of that fellow Baxter,</v>

1275
01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:02.200
<v Speaker 5>I forget his first name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clyde Baxter.</v>

1276
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:04.330
<v Speaker 5>That makes them make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make A.</v>

1277
01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 5>I can look it up for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clyde Baxter,</v>

1278
01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:08.740
<v Speaker 5>Baxter Baxter's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last name that I know.</v>

1279
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 5>He did some experiments with </v>
<v Speaker 5>communication with plants,</v>

1280
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.350
<v Speaker 5>communication with plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no,</v>

1281
01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.370
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

1282
01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.700
<v Speaker 5>that was one of the earliest experiments</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are others.</v>

1283
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.390
<v Speaker 5>So it's not just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plants have that ability.</v>

1284
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:30.810
<v Speaker 5>Probably even Amoeba has that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at a very rudimentary.</v>

1285
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was Claude.</v>

1286
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 1>It's cleaved c l e</v>

1287
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Baxter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Baxter.</v>

1288
01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.070
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lax for hell kind of name is that,</v>

1289
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 5>but great experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You discarded that much,</v>

1290
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.720
<v Speaker 5>but now we understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1291
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 5>because I could really be something in </v>
<v Speaker 5>his experiments.</v>

1292
01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely fascinating that </v>

1293
01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.411
<v Speaker 1>there's a perception between animals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it using a polygraph machine.</v>

1294
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's your.</v>

1295
01:13:57.451 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 5>He was polygraphed is shit by Rupert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sheldrake is the latest.</v>

1296
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.720
<v Speaker 5>One of the latest trends in this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is showing that dogs communicate </v>

1297
01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.630
<v Speaker 5>telepathically with their masters.</v>

1298
01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard about this and I've also heard </v>

1299
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rupert sheldrake has said recently,</v>

1300
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.890
<v Speaker 1>something about the speed of light </v>
<v Speaker 1>varying,</v>

1301
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.430
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people are coming down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>him for that.</v>

1302
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad science and pseudoscience at </v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

1303
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1304
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are people in my message where</v>

1305
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:30.370
<v Speaker 1>we're going bananas about him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very controversial character in </v>

1306
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>the first place because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what he says is true,</v>

1307
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>like the amazing randy is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered,</v>

1308
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a million dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can prove any sort of psychic </v>

1309
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:43.801
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why hasn't anybody taking that guy up </v>

1310
01:14:43.801 --> 01:14:43.801
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he doesn't pay.</v>

1311
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't pay and pitch because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>always finds like,</v>

1312
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can always object.</v>

1313
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Notice the 70 percent times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I 100 percent.</v>

1314
01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 5>Is that what he does?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what he does,</v>

1315
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 5>but he will not pay anybody looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of situation.</v>

1316
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.610
<v Speaker 5>You can always raised some objection to </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1317
01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a study that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen on these dogs knowing that their </v>

1318
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:09.800
<v Speaker 1>masters are coming on this trip</v>

1319
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:15.230
<v Speaker 5>movie after movie is made a movie of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and I saw the movie.</v>

1320
01:15:15.241 --> 01:15:17.540
<v Speaker 5>It has to marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know him.</v>

1321
01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:22.541
<v Speaker 5>I'm a good friend of his actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my wife and I went to his house and </v>

1322
01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:27.201
<v Speaker 5>he showed us a movie of the dog and also</v>
<v Speaker 5>the parrot parrots.</v>

1323
01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.650
<v Speaker 5>He has shown also can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 5>telepathically with their master's.</v>

1324
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing it dog movie.</v>

1325
01:15:34.591 --> 01:15:39.090
<v Speaker 5>I remember very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dog is waiting in the house.</v>

1326
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:42.600
<v Speaker 5>He and his regular sitting place is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>software.</v>

1327
01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:45.480
<v Speaker 5>That's why as soon as the master lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he loves her.</v>

1328
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:48.620
<v Speaker 5>He jumps on the Sofa and invest there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know it.</v>

1329
01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:52.890
<v Speaker 5>They love human warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>warming up the sofa,</v>

1330
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:55.020
<v Speaker 5>the particular place where to master </v>
<v Speaker 5>satin.</v>

1331
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:59.160
<v Speaker 5>They'll stay there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so is there and 5:00</v>

1332
01:15:59.161 --> 01:16:04.161
<v Speaker 5>comes right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Master is now getting up from her desk </v>

1333
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:09.540
<v Speaker 5>and the dog jumps and comes through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>window.</v>

1334
01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:16.940
<v Speaker 5>It's time and time again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has photograph the dog and </v>

1335
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.811
<v Speaker 5>photographs in muster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so dogs are becoming aware as soon as </v>

1336
01:16:20.811 --> 01:16:24.951
<v Speaker 5>the master is ready to come home and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that awareness is shown by the dog </v>

1337
01:16:25.261 --> 01:16:30.180
<v Speaker 5>jumping down at that exact time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as master gets up from her desk,</v>

1338
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.660
<v Speaker 5>his guest to come home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

1339
01:16:33.661 --> 01:16:36.360
<v Speaker 5>He's done it multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple times of it,</v>

1340
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:42.150
<v Speaker 5>and always using cameras in both places </v>
<v Speaker 5>in synchrony and always exactly at that </v>

1341
01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:48.591
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dog will react and if they've </v>

1342
01:16:48.591 --> 01:16:52.550
<v Speaker 5>mastered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does not get up from the desk dog will </v>

1343
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:55.461
<v Speaker 5>not get up from his sofa either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it takes quite amazing responses.</v>

1344
01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:57.480
<v Speaker 5>So what I said,</v>

1345
01:16:57.710 --> 01:17:00.960
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't just collect that million?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1346
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say I feel like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1347
01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.910
<v Speaker 1>if you got that concept is called </v>
<v Speaker 1>morphic resonance,</v>

1348
01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:09.660
<v Speaker 1>is that not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1349
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.340
<v Speaker 5>he will not bring morphic resonance for </v>
<v Speaker 5>discipline metrics.</v>

1350
01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.540
<v Speaker 5>Part of transforming people's learning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

1351
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:21.590
<v Speaker 5>that's a slightly different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You learned something.</v>

1352
01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:23.930
<v Speaker 5>It's stored in the morphic morphic </v>
<v Speaker 5>fields,</v>

1353
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:27.430
<v Speaker 5>morphogenetic fields.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then um,</v>

1354
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:32.590
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be able to get this </v>

1355
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:33.000
<v Speaker 5>morphogenetic fields to communicate to.</v>

1356
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1357
01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1358
01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept I thought was kind of </v>

1359
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 1>related because his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1360
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.460
<v Speaker 1>he deals in an interconnectivity sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to with this.</v>

1361
01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes that if animals have </v>

1362
01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every species have a certain sort </v>

1363
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.450
<v Speaker 1>of a database almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if rats in St Paul learn how to</v>

1364
01:17:52.451 --> 01:17:54.550
<v Speaker 1>get through a maze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same rats in Florida,</v>

1365
01:17:54.551 --> 01:17:55.810
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to get through a quicker.</v>

1366
01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this kind of thing has to be taken </v>

1367
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 2>with a grain of salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does.</v>

1368
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the crazy shit we've talked </v>

1369
01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:05.440
<v Speaker 2>about that has to be taken with a grain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of salt.</v>

1370
01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the transfer is occurring to </v>

1371
01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:08.980
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1372
01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.210
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1373
01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:11.640
<v Speaker 5>this pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The morphogenetic field.</v>

1374
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.870
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1375
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.960
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it may not transfer in exactly that form</v>

1376
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.850
<v Speaker 5>is what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is that the.</v>

1377
01:18:20.851 --> 01:18:25.230
<v Speaker 5>Originally what happened was people </v>
<v Speaker 5>started this kind of thinking because an</v>

1378
01:18:25.231 --> 01:18:28.070
<v Speaker 5>experiments seem to have done this </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiment.</v>

1379
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.410
<v Speaker 5>Real experiment was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1380
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.230
<v Speaker 5>in an island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1381
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:38.990
<v Speaker 5>some monkeys learn a monkey model.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how it started.</v>

1382
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.720
<v Speaker 5>And monkey mother learned to wash her </v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet potato before eating.</v>

1383
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.750
<v Speaker 5>And she found that the test improves </v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

1384
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:51.940
<v Speaker 5>So she immediately talked to her </v>
<v Speaker 5>offspring.</v>

1385
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:56.460
<v Speaker 5>So the baby monkeys are also learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1386
01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 5>And then the entire island of monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 5>learn to sweet potatoes before eating.</v>

1387
01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Somehow this was the data untopological </v>
<v Speaker 5>data.</v>

1388
01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:09.770
<v Speaker 5>I've looked at the paper and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>original journal,</v>

1389
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.820
<v Speaker 5>but when somehow somebody reported on </v>
<v Speaker 5>this data in a book that somebody </v>

1390
01:19:17.281 --> 01:19:21.240
<v Speaker 5>invented an extension which never </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

1391
01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:26.900
<v Speaker 5>which is that in monkeys in a nearby </v>
<v Speaker 5>island without any connection picked up </v>

1392
01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 5>the same,</v>

1393
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.840
<v Speaker 2>so it's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was based on next saturation.</v>

1394
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Very Fun motherfuckers researchers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerate.</v>

1395
01:19:36.841 --> 01:19:39.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dangerous habit.</v>

1396
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a restructuring.</v>

1397
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Comedians exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny,</v>

1398
01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately communicators exaggerate </v>

1399
01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.720
<v Speaker 2>communicators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1400
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Because we are used to attract </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1401
01:19:54.481 --> 01:19:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything for the sake of attention,</v>

1402
01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.730
<v Speaker 2>so mayBe they just wanted to get funding</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their research.</v>

1403
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Not that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No researcher exaggerated.</v>

1404
01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:05.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the only the communicators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thing that the book will sell more.</v>

1405
01:20:05.671 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>If I say something I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would</v>

1406
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 1>assume that something like animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>washing their food if human beings.</v>

1407
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean the word evolution is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>touchy subject amongst people when it </v>

1408
01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 1>comes to natural selection and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancement of the species,</v>

1409
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:26.331
<v Speaker 1>but it's commonly knowledged </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically that we were once </v>

1410
01:20:26.331 --> 01:20:28.830
<v Speaker 1>primitive organisms and that's all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the planet.</v>

1411
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>If that is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intelligent animals like chimpanzees</v>

1412
01:20:33.841 --> 01:20:35.870
<v Speaker 1>or monkeYs or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

1413
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I would assume that much like people </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly all over the world figured out </v>

1414
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.321
<v Speaker 1>how to make tools with rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that monkeys would slowly figuring out </v>

1415
01:20:45.321 --> 01:20:45.321
<v Speaker 1>new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CAt</v>

1416
01:20:45.321 --> 01:20:45.520
<v Speaker 5>litter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1417
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.270
<v Speaker 5>They themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1418
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that cats are born just </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing how to use the cat litter box.</v>

1419
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:51.840
<v Speaker 5>It's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1420
01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:54.250
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they never get smart enough.</v>

1421
01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:56.850
<v Speaker 5>Thank you for pointing that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1422
01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.680
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting because you are right </v>
<v Speaker 5>and do it right,</v>

1423
01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:04.930
<v Speaker 5>because it is true that lots of things </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get transferred.</v>

1424
01:21:04.931 --> 01:21:09.931
<v Speaker 5>So in philly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is also true that there are this </v>

1425
01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:10.180
<v Speaker 5>a case of instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1426
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:15.260
<v Speaker 5>There was some transparent stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of thing that universally </v>

1427
01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:18.730
<v Speaker 5>everybody has picked up within.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then what's your feeling on epigenetics?</v>

1428
01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:22.790
<v Speaker 5>The idea that that epigenetics are </v>
<v Speaker 5>related to this morphogenic fields,</v>

1429
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:27.870
<v Speaker 5>so it is not very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you explain that to be sure belief</v>

1430
01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:34.180
<v Speaker 5>was ever since darwin and after some </v>
<v Speaker 5>verifications of darwin that came apart,</v>

1431
01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:40.210
<v Speaker 5>the belief has been that genes are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only way that any heriditary </v>

1432
01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:44.620
<v Speaker 5>characteristics learning can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>transferred to subsequent generations.</v>

1433
01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:49.890
<v Speaker 5>That has been the belief right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now though,</v>

1434
01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:56.530
<v Speaker 5>there are phenomena which showed that </v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1435
01:21:56.531 --> 01:21:58.570
<v Speaker 5>something else move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very well be involved.</v>

1436
01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:04.110
<v Speaker 5>One of the striking phenomenon is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon of morphogenesis or cell </v>

1437
01:22:04.121 --> 01:22:09.121
<v Speaker 5>differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all begin as you and I both began as </v>

1438
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.530
<v Speaker 5>single celled embryos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1439
01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:15.160
<v Speaker 5>and then that single cell divides itself</v>
<v Speaker 5>divided itself,</v>

1440
01:22:15.190 --> 01:22:20.190
<v Speaker 5>making replica itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is still true that our toast </v>

1441
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.880
<v Speaker 5>cells and our brain cells behave very </v>
<v Speaker 5>differently.</v>

1442
01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.850
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the proteins are very different.</v>

1443
01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Proteins that are made in those cells </v>
<v Speaker 5>are proteins.</v>

1444
01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Proteins are made because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>instructions written in the gene called </v>

1445
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:37.621
<v Speaker 5>the genetic code,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the genes ababa all of ourselves at </v>

1446
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:41.221
<v Speaker 5>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the expansion is that some genes are </v>

1447
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:44.521
<v Speaker 5>activated in the tau proteins and other </v>
<v Speaker 5>genes are activated in the brain making </v>

1448
01:22:46.301 --> 01:22:51.190
<v Speaker 5>the brain proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why brain cells differ very much</v>

1449
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.800
<v Speaker 5>in their activity than the host cells.</v>

1450
01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:55.150
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So far?</v>

1451
01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.340
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>

1452
01:22:56.410 --> 01:23:01.410
<v Speaker 5>so then this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does the cell different sessions </v>

1453
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.890
<v Speaker 5>take place?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people said there must be programs </v>

1454
01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 5>sub ditto sally's program differently </v>
<v Speaker 5>than the genes of brain cells were sales</v>

1455
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.960
<v Speaker 5>and brand sauce that sand banks have </v>
<v Speaker 5>different programs running the but where</v>

1456
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.020
<v Speaker 5>are these programs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1457
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:23.740
<v Speaker 5>So initially the ability has the program</v>
<v Speaker 5>must also be in the genes.</v>

1458
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 5>Now people are seeing that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the programs for cell different session,</v>

1459
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:35.040
<v Speaker 5>not in the genes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are in the epigenetics outside of </v>

1460
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:39.060
<v Speaker 5>teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sheldrick originally was suggesting </v>

1461
01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 5>very something very similar which is </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of morphogenetic field.</v>

1462
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.080
<v Speaker 5>And so if you assume that morphogenetic </v>
<v Speaker 5>fields are they blueprints of biological</v>

1463
01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:53.160
<v Speaker 5>form and they are non local,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there is no way,</v>

1464
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 5>no difficulty in explaining why they tow</v>
<v Speaker 5>cells behave very differently in brain </v>

1465
01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:03.181
<v Speaker 5>cell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does the cell know what to do in a </v>

1466
01:24:03.181 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 5>different way when it is in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>different parts of the body?</v>

1467
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:08.580
<v Speaker 5>If it's in the in the toe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then those genes to be activated which </v>

1468
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:12.490
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which can make protein which can perform</v>

1469
01:24:12.491 --> 01:24:17.491
<v Speaker 5>in the way if it's in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Similarly those genes will be activated </v>

1470
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:21.110
<v Speaker 5>which can make protein which makes it </v>
<v Speaker 5>behave to brain way,</v>

1471
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:26.580
<v Speaker 5>but how are they doing it in all in </v>
<v Speaker 5>synchrony because of this nonlocal </v>

1472
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.080
<v Speaker 5>morphogenetic field that is involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so in a way epigenetics is the first </v>

1473
01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Speaker 5>step of verification of shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Next idea.</v>

1474
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:39.390
<v Speaker 5>The next step is taken by a biologist </v>
<v Speaker 5>like bruce lipton who are saying that </v>

1475
01:24:39.881 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quantum practice,</v>

1476
01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:46.021
<v Speaker 5>certain balled in biology and safe </v>
<v Speaker 5>quantum processes involved in our </v>

1477
01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:51.090
<v Speaker 5>consciousness based quantum measurement </v>
<v Speaker 5>theory is telling us that consciousness </v>

1478
01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 5>must be involved in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can.</v>

1479
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 5>We now can understand the whole gamut of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas that leads to these things.</v>

1480
01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 5>And finally to connect up what you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>just saying.</v>

1481
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 5>These instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so certain learning from the past to get</v>

1482
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:09.340
<v Speaker 5>passed on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the belief is tech specific,</v>

1483
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:14.200
<v Speaker 5>some specific type of learning which </v>
<v Speaker 5>involves emotions.</v>

1484
01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:19.180
<v Speaker 5>My guess is that if the learning's </v>
<v Speaker 5>involves emotional,</v>

1485
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.240
<v Speaker 5>has an emotional aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then probably the morphogenetic fields </v>

1486
01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:29.251
<v Speaker 5>are easier to transfer the certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>innate involving peers and similar </v>

1487
01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:36.790
<v Speaker 5>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>egotism and suck even racism,</v>

1488
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 5>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of thing.</v>

1489
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 5>But what if it is purely cerebral mental</v>
<v Speaker 5>than it is probably harder to transfer </v>

1490
01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:51.650
<v Speaker 5>through morphogenic field.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That morphogenetic field transfer is a </v>

1491
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:57.210
<v Speaker 5>pretty fairly good idea and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find some explanation of the instincts </v>

1492
01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:58.410
<v Speaker 5>that it did get transferred in </v>
<v Speaker 5>windstream.</v>

1493
01:25:58.430 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 5>Start universal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we have a very peculiar situation.</v>

1494
01:26:02.381 --> 01:26:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Instincts could not possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 5>explained by genetics.</v>

1495
01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:07.950
<v Speaker 5>Many people have written about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturday,</v>

1496
01:26:07.951 --> 01:26:10.170
<v Speaker 5>difficult to understand on the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 5>genes.</v>

1497
01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.170
<v Speaker 5>So if you'll bring morphogenetic field </v>
<v Speaker 5>to understand the instinct,</v>

1498
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.510
<v Speaker 5>then you get the idea that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can,</v>

1499
01:26:15.511 --> 01:26:20.340
<v Speaker 5>we can today become a nicer person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have brain circuits of um,</v>

1500
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:22.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>

1501
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 5>ANd then a few generations later via the</v>
<v Speaker 5>transference morphogenetic field,</v>

1502
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:31.340
<v Speaker 5>everybody will begin to have circuits of</v>
<v Speaker 5>loving their pain.</v>

1503
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring up a really interesting point </v>

1504
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.750
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1505
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:39.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemical composition of a,</v>

1506
01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:43.720
<v Speaker 1>of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different serotonin and dopamine</v>

1507
01:26:43.721 --> 01:26:48.721
<v Speaker 1>and neurotransmitters and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that are going on </v>

1508
01:26:48.721 --> 01:26:51.180
<v Speaker 1>inside the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will alter those and one way or </v>

1509
01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.661
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive or negative and you get </v>

1510
01:26:54.661 --> 01:26:56.431
<v Speaker 1>profound effects on how the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaves and thinks and interfaces with </v>

1511
01:26:56.431 --> 01:27:00.511
<v Speaker 1>their reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel persoNally about the all</v>

1512
01:27:00.661 --> 01:27:03.580
<v Speaker 1>the different pills that people are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the different pills that,</v>

1513
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.320
<v Speaker 1>that alter consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems a very strange time when we are</v>

1514
01:27:08.321 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>doing so much experimentation on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a daily basis,</v>

1515
01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>altering the way a person's mind is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is interfacing with its reality and </v>

1516
01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:21.640
<v Speaker 1>we're see profound effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't know.</v>

1517
01:27:21.641 --> 01:27:26.410
<v Speaker 1>NInety percent of school shooters either</v>
<v Speaker 1>were on antidepressants,</v>

1518
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:29.170
<v Speaker 1>had been on them and we're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal.</v>

1519
01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent is a big number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1520
01:27:31.781 --> 01:27:36.781
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't prove that that's what caused</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because a lot of times these people </v>

1521
01:27:36.781 --> 01:27:38.380
<v Speaker 1>are depressed and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were depressed.</v>

1522
01:27:38.381 --> 01:27:43.381
<v Speaker 1>Getting on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it caused them to </v>

1523
01:27:43.381 --> 01:27:43.381
<v Speaker 1>be psychotic or to have psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks,</v>

1524
01:27:43.381 --> 01:27:45.780
<v Speaker 1>but there is something to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1525
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.840
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be studied for </v>

1526
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:50.840
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1527
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very dangerous to put the natural </v>

1528
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.930
<v Speaker 5>brain under tracks of any kind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially those drugs which are </v>

1529
01:27:56.930 --> 01:28:00.780
<v Speaker 5>psychoactive because you don't ever know</v>
<v Speaker 5>strategies there.</v>

1530
01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 5>So scanty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1531
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:07.550
<v Speaker 5>you don't even know what the effects are</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how the effects will be specialty </v>

1532
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:08.740
<v Speaker 5>longterm effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1533
01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:13.741
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what we do know is that depression </v>

1534
01:28:13.741 --> 01:28:15.930
<v Speaker 5>is now the third biggest epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>

1535
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.740
<v Speaker 5>It's almost epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but besides heart disease and cancer,</v>

1536
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.930
<v Speaker 5>depression is the third most common </v>
<v Speaker 5>chronic disease who I.</v>

1537
01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:29.931
<v Speaker 5>Is it because depression depends so much</v>
<v Speaker 5>on these brain chemicals and of course </v>

1538
01:28:30.211 --> 01:28:33.060
<v Speaker 5>so much also on how we process our </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

1539
01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:38.180
<v Speaker 5>emotions thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So something is basically going wrong in</v>

1540
01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:39.410
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

1541
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.190
<v Speaker 5>in the new theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1542
01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.280
<v Speaker 5>wherever we talk in terms of chakras,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because all the places where they're </v>

1543
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 5>very much involved with our emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the emotion that is involved in the </v>

1544
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.670
<v Speaker 5>highest place in our body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the neocortex,</v>

1545
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.660
<v Speaker 5>emotions that are involved with </v>
<v Speaker 5>specifically our,</v>

1546
01:28:57.690 --> 01:28:59.100
<v Speaker 5>what we call satisfaction.</v>

1547
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:04.790
<v Speaker 5>So If neocortex dIsplayed with certainly</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will affect our level of </v>

1548
01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:09.900
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the same token,</v>

1549
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.080
<v Speaker 5>people might be using antIdepressant to </v>
<v Speaker 5>better suit your level of satisfaction.</v>

1550
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.310
<v Speaker 5>You know what happens when you take </v>
<v Speaker 5>prozac,</v>

1551
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.190
<v Speaker 5>you get sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get temporarily,</v>

1552
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 5>it will get to get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get to look at the world as okay,</v>

1553
01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.620
<v Speaker 5>you're getting a feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1554
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:30.970
<v Speaker 5>they're satisfied so people are using </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like that to give them a feeling </v>

1555
01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:35.541
<v Speaker 5>of satisfaction because it's not there </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the absence of taking this drug </v>

1556
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.460
<v Speaker 5>prozac,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so in this way,</v>

1557
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.640
<v Speaker 5>but we don't know the consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking prozac and a good brain longterm </v>

1558
01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 5>consequences of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am terribly,</v>

1559
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:51.771
<v Speaker 5>terribly upset about the drug culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're getting into stuff.</v>

1560
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Does every device that we need that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>intimately connected with our </v>

1561
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:04.200
<v Speaker 5>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our brain that is no manifest </v>

1562
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.440
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to recognize that to play with </v>

1563
01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.741
<v Speaker 5>that vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which gives us the basic way of </v>

1564
01:30:09.741 --> 01:30:13.551
<v Speaker 5>cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>basic way of experiencing everything </v>

1565
01:30:13.551 --> 01:30:13.551
<v Speaker 5>that we know.</v>

1566
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Conversely though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have met people that have some sort of</v>

1567
01:30:18.151 --> 01:30:23.151
<v Speaker 1>an imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some sort of a chemical </v>

1568
01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:26.601
<v Speaker 1>balance in the mind and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally seen people take medication </v>

1569
01:30:26.601 --> 01:30:28.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's benefited them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly improved,</v>

1570
01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:33.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also people that just.</v>

1571
01:30:34.111 --> 01:30:36.440
<v Speaker 1>They're not living a fulfilling life </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1572
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't have good friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

1573
01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:43.640
<v Speaker 1>job opportunities that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the career they really wanted </v>

1574
01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:47.721
<v Speaker 1>to impress for good reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and a lot of times with that </v>

1575
01:30:47.721 --> 01:30:50.991
<v Speaker 1>depression is is in fact the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and how your body is </v>

1576
01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:56.301
<v Speaker 1>perceiving it in the negative energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're getting and feeling about </v>

1577
01:30:56.301 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to motivate you to change,</v>

1578
01:30:57.930 --> 01:30:59.970
<v Speaker 1>supposed to motivate you to move away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

1579
01:30:59.971 --> 01:31:04.971
<v Speaker 1>The negative feelings that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>after any personal altercation with </v>

1580
01:31:04.971 --> 01:31:04.971
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are supposed to be like,</v>

1581
01:31:04.971 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 1>that's to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1582
01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever you just did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking do that anymore.</v>

1583
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1584
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.360
<v Speaker 1>However you interacted with the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that created this terrible wave of bad </v>

1585
01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.090
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not satisfying.</v>

1586
01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:20.091
<v Speaker 1>It's not satisfying to you and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a pill executive to change </v>

1587
01:31:20.091 --> 01:31:20.091
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1588
01:31:20.091 --> 01:31:24.820
<v Speaker 5>but the way to where to where to took </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of situation involved here and the</v>

1589
01:31:25.581 --> 01:31:30.581
<v Speaker 5>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the device itself may have wrong </v>

1590
01:31:30.581 --> 01:31:30.581
<v Speaker 5>neurochemicals and therefore we get the </v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction.</v>

1591
01:31:30.581 --> 01:31:35.401
<v Speaker 5>We get depression or it can be that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological effect of stuff that's </v>

1592
01:31:35.421 --> 01:31:40.421
<v Speaker 5>producing the depression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it is the the latter psychological </v>

1593
01:31:40.421 --> 01:31:45.221
<v Speaker 5>stuff that producing dissatisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then actually in a way it's easier </v>

1594
01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:47.540
<v Speaker 5>because we can use psychological method.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1595
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:52.541
<v Speaker 5>we should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am not in favor of using brain </v>

1596
01:31:52.541 --> 01:31:56.981
<v Speaker 5>chemicals like prozac to reestablish the</v>
<v Speaker 5>balance.</v>

1597
01:31:57.050 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 5>If the cost is psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the call is coming from genetics or </v>

1598
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:06.940
<v Speaker 5>family history are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are clear brain dysfunction,</v>

1599
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:12.270
<v Speaker 5>brain imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it should be treated with what </v>

1600
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:13.310
<v Speaker 5>brain chemicals with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

1601
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:17.850
<v Speaker 5>with madison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But If it is psychologically caused,</v>

1602
01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:22.890
<v Speaker 5>it's better to try to improve the </v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction level of the person and </v>

1603
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:27.600
<v Speaker 5>when we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can by bringing in the heart chakras,</v>

1604
01:32:27.601 --> 01:32:30.160
<v Speaker 5>starting with the heart chakra where </v>
<v Speaker 5>love resides.</v>

1605
01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.390
<v Speaker 5>Then expression where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1606
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:39.690
<v Speaker 5>which decides and the throat chakra and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then podcasting which resides in the </v>

1607
01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 5>tardive or in between the two brows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brow chakra,</v>

1608
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 5>and then of course the crown chakra in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the neocortex,</v>

1609
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:51.661
<v Speaker 5>which is the seat of satisfaction so we </v>
<v Speaker 5>can improve satisfaction by </v>

1610
01:32:51.661 --> 01:32:54.850
<v Speaker 5>concentrating not so much on the lord </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions,</v>

1611
01:32:55.090 --> 01:33:00.090
<v Speaker 5>which is the lower chakras there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The emotions that you get are all those </v>

1612
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.900
<v Speaker 5>fear and sexuality and price.</v>

1613
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Sexuality low</v>

1614
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 5>or know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was way up there.</v>

1615
01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.220
<v Speaker 5>It's in a sense because it's a doorway </v>
<v Speaker 5>to something where of have to love.</v>

1616
01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:16.810
<v Speaker 5>So sex is actually a very special one </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if used in moderation,</v>

1617
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:20.270
<v Speaker 5>sex is actually a very good one because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the doorway to love.</v>

1618
01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.210
<v Speaker 5>It's one doorway.</v>

1619
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that I always got </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed off at monks that don't have sex</v>

1620
01:33:25.770 --> 01:33:30.360
<v Speaker 5>coming sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why we call effing make love,</v>

1621
01:33:30.361 --> 01:33:31.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watching.</v>

1622
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.580
<v Speaker 5>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>

1623
01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:35.550
<v Speaker 5>you can do it the effort or you can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1624
01:33:35.551 --> 01:33:37.560
<v Speaker 5>Making law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cost point,</v>

1625
01:33:37.561 --> 01:33:40.110
<v Speaker 5>is that what you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way we use it,</v>

1626
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:44.010
<v Speaker 5>so sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of good and bad both.</v>

1627
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:45.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean all of this actually good and </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

1628
01:33:45.831 --> 01:33:49.500
<v Speaker 5>Both fear is also good sometimes because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes us away from danger.</v>

1629
01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:55.130
<v Speaker 5>You go test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The movement is good sometimes because </v>

1630
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:55.130
<v Speaker 5>it gives us assurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Self assurance,</v>

1631
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:58.380
<v Speaker 5>so used in moderation and negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions are okay.</v>

1632
01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.630
<v Speaker 5>It's one day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go out of control.</v>

1633
01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:06.360
<v Speaker 5>Then there are problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Positive emotions are good all the time,</v>

1634
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:11.490
<v Speaker 5>little or more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Love is not going to kill you.</v>

1635
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.600
<v Speaker 5>Love is only going to elevate you so you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can never have too much love.</v>

1636
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:21.380
<v Speaker 5>So in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we learn to concentrate more on this </v>

1637
01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:25.310
<v Speaker 5>positive emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could actually heal or psychological.</v>

1638
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.170
<v Speaker 5>He caused cases of depression</v>

1639
01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.240
<v Speaker 1>psychologically caused cases of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and that's where you have to </v>

1640
01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:34.240
<v Speaker 1>differentiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

1641
01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.350
<v Speaker 1>You have to differentiate between people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are depressed because they're in a </v>

1642
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:40.610
<v Speaker 1>bad state in life and people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed because the mind's not working</v>

1643
01:34:40.611 --> 01:34:43.160
<v Speaker 1>correctly and there are two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not work.</v>

1644
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.320
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is the overdiagnosis than</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least the overprescription of </v>

1645
01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:53.540
<v Speaker 1>prescribing psychologists tend to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's easy to treat the</v>

1646
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:58.990
<v Speaker 5>brain chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The chemical psychologist try to get </v>

1647
01:35:00.201 --> 01:35:03.530
<v Speaker 5>away with just using drugs because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect will be quicker.</v>

1648
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 5>I think if we use an integration of both</v>
<v Speaker 5>approaches,</v>

1649
01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:14.230
<v Speaker 5>why they do quicker because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever lived with a mentally ill </v>

1650
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 5>person is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult,</v>

1651
01:35:18.711 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 5>so parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course one immediate cure,</v>

1652
01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:26.880
<v Speaker 5>so best strategy probably is to use </v>
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants immediately because that</v>

1653
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:33.641
<v Speaker 5>will give a temporary healing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but of course the psychological </v>

1654
01:35:33.641 --> 01:35:34.520
<v Speaker 5>residents who will be president so it </v>
<v Speaker 5>will come back,</v>

1655
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:39.580
<v Speaker 5>it will continue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they start the psychological </v>

1656
01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:44.290
<v Speaker 5>treatment that I'm suggesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are already people are suggesting </v>

1657
01:35:44.290 --> 01:35:45.410
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't take the original credit for</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1658
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 5>nothing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this dealing with noble emotions,</v>

1659
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 5>how are emotions?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Positive emotions that healing will take</v>

1660
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:57.100
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prozac can give us time for the prospect</v>

1661
01:35:57.110 --> 01:36:02.110
<v Speaker 5>can buy us time so we can use a </v>
<v Speaker 5>combination of both conventional and the</v>

1662
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:06.700
<v Speaker 5>new medicine mind body medicine </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggestion.</v>

1663
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 5>This is what I suggested is called mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>body medicine because you're trying to </v>

1664
01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.600
<v Speaker 5>heal the brain in balance with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect of the mind.</v>

1665
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:14.710
<v Speaker 5>The health.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do mine.</v>

1666
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.100
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be a real issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern humans too,</v>

1667
01:36:19.101 --> 01:36:24.101
<v Speaker 1>and that the life that we live does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really satisfy all of our natural reward</v>

1668
01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:30.400
<v Speaker 1>systems that we have in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hunter gatherer systems and sitting </v>

1669
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 1>in a cubicle and and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of it,</v>

1670
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.960
<v Speaker 1>even monogamy is a struggle for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for,</v>

1671
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 1>for that very reason is that we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of genetics that are set up from a </v>

1672
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 1>different time and they're still in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>system</v>

1673
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:45.360
<v Speaker 5>and we have not talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have not taught very well.</v>

1674
01:36:45.361 --> 01:36:47.250
<v Speaker 5>We don't been up and taught how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>manage it.</v>

1675
01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.230
<v Speaker 5>We're not being taught how to manage it </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly.</v>

1676
01:36:50.231 --> 01:36:51.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very important,</v>

1677
01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:51.990
<v Speaker 5>very important.</v>

1678
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't that one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you could teach a child is </v>

1679
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.070
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to manage them</v>

1680
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.070
<v Speaker 5>back to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1681
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:59.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>educational reform is so needed,</v>

1682
01:36:59.791 --> 01:37:02.550
<v Speaker 5>so needed part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another thing,</v>

1683
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>

1684
01:37:03.570 --> 01:37:07.860
<v Speaker 5>how do you bring this stuff to a child?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to use creativity,</v>

1685
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.920
<v Speaker 5>obviously conditioning that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their body is conditioned in a certain </v>

1686
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:15.990
<v Speaker 5>way since the days of hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those conditioning are still present.</v>

1687
01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:21.320
<v Speaker 5>Mine has moved onto restaurant wind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the predicament of us learning </v>

1688
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.900
<v Speaker 5>today because some of our conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the body,</v>

1689
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:27.960
<v Speaker 5>the remains the same as the hunter got </v>
<v Speaker 5>that or nothing has changed,</v>

1690
01:37:28.410 --> 01:37:31.950
<v Speaker 5>but the mind has moved onto purely </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with mine.</v>

1691
01:37:31.951 --> 01:37:33.760
<v Speaker 5>Mine does not even deal with the body.</v>

1692
01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1693
01:37:34.951 --> 01:37:39.951
<v Speaker 1>the environment has changed radically to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment that your physical </v>

1694
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:43.251
<v Speaker 1>body's interfacing with has changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically and those natural reward </v>

1695
01:37:43.251 --> 01:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>systems are not being fun,</v>

1696
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:48.700
<v Speaker 5>not being fed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we live in a world where we really </v>

1697
01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:52.480
<v Speaker 5>need a new educational system which will</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring this aspect stop and use creative </v>

1698
01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 5>creativity quite because these things </v>
<v Speaker 5>require creative learning.</v>

1699
01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.020
<v Speaker 5>What what has to happen is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>context of our thinking,</v>

1700
01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.320
<v Speaker 5>which is thinking without the emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this has evolved so much.</v>

1701
01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes very cerebral,</v>

1702
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.220
<v Speaker 5>tinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only involvement with neocortex.</v>

1703
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:16.580
<v Speaker 5>Instead we can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can start involving some of what we </v>

1704
01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 5>left behind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the emotions that are intuitive.</v>

1705
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:23.270
<v Speaker 5>Some of the emotions that you have not </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealt with and we have to read it </v>

1706
01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:29.031
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It integrate how we think about </v>

1707
01:38:29.031 --> 01:38:33.620
<v Speaker 5>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reintegrate that into our present life </v>

1708
01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:35.580
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is more thinking rationally,</v>

1709
01:38:35.581 --> 01:38:39.080
<v Speaker 5>who just thinking about thinking itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not so much thinking emotional.</v>

1710
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 2>It's very frustrating to you as as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a professor for over 32 years,</v>

1711
01:38:44.681 --> 01:38:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1712
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Is it frustrating to you?</v>

1713
01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:51.460
<v Speaker 5>It was until I discovered new ways of </v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching.</v>

1714
01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 5>I started putting things in an emotional</v>
<v Speaker 5>way because it will get.</v>

1715
01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.520
<v Speaker 5>you can reframe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to.</v>

1716
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:03.190
<v Speaker 5>when we teach new physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1717
01:39:03.191 --> 01:39:05.080
<v Speaker 5>quantum physics versus classical </v>
<v Speaker 5>physics,</v>

1718
01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:08.320
<v Speaker 5>classical physics is all study abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but quantum physics,</v>

1719
01:39:08.321 --> 01:39:11.470
<v Speaker 5>because it has that aspect of choice I </v>
<v Speaker 5>choose.</v>

1720
01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Therefore something can happen already </v>
<v Speaker 5>and emotional component can get in </v>

1721
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.310
<v Speaker 5>because whenever you say I chose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll find that you're a start chapter,</v>

1722
01:39:21.311 --> 01:39:25.570
<v Speaker 5>naval chapter sort of body eagle is </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately alert.</v>

1723
01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Those were your ego's a body ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not reminding the body.</v>

1724
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:33.020
<v Speaker 2>so that's why people are weirded out </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you poked her belly button.</v>

1725
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off my ego.</v>

1726
01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:39.330
<v Speaker 5>There's a bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1727
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:40.130
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1728
01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.160
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you feel quite as quite assured of </v>

1729
01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:45.160
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1730
01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.320
<v Speaker 5>do you find that navel chakra is find a </v>
<v Speaker 5>quieter teeth?</v>

1731
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:47.800
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

1732
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:52.730
<v Speaker 2>nice enabled massage cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why do,</v>

1733
01:39:52.731 --> 01:39:55.330
<v Speaker 2>are not feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I shared butterflies in the stomach.</v>

1734
01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1735
01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Very common experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1736
01:39:59.291 --> 01:40:04.291
<v Speaker 2>And that's the connection where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the whole soccer thing come </v>

1737
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:04.291
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that from?</v>

1738
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:04.940
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

1739
01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.800
<v Speaker 5>There was no explanation for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1740
01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.950
<v Speaker 5>Then when the new science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have an expedition because then the</v>

1741
01:40:09.951 --> 01:40:13.460
<v Speaker 5>new science to introduce this </v>
<v Speaker 5>morphogenetic fields as part of reality.</v>

1742
01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:18.940
<v Speaker 5>What are morphogenic fields?</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are the blueprints of biological </v>

1743
01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:18.940
<v Speaker 5>origins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1744
01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:23.720
<v Speaker 5>We went to the sell different fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so neocortex has a blueprInt,</v>

1745
01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:28.480
<v Speaker 5>the toes of a different blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's blueprints is the,</v>

1746
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.520
<v Speaker 5>is the morphogenetic field.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in quantum physics we started that </v>

1747
01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.350
<v Speaker 5>morphogenetic fields and they organs </v>
<v Speaker 5>that then non-locally correlated through</v>

1748
01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:42.230
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Consciousness operates on one hand,</v>

1749
01:40:42.231 --> 01:40:43.850
<v Speaker 5>the blueprints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the other hand,</v>

1750
01:40:43.851 --> 01:40:48.400
<v Speaker 5>the oregon's chakras are those places </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the organs are present,</v>

1751
01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.260
<v Speaker 5>the important part of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at all the chakras.</v>

1752
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:54.640
<v Speaker 5>Every chapter is the site of a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>important organ.</v>

1753
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Is there a sexual bro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1754
01:40:57.650 --> 01:40:58.910
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that one called?</v>

1755
01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Would that foreign is called sex chakra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called sex chakra.</v>

1756
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check.</v>

1757
01:41:03.291 --> 01:41:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Did they work on that one in yoga too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that whether the girl is one of those</v>

1758
01:41:06.411 --> 01:41:08.800
<v Speaker 2>tight pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's all about the course.</v>

1759
01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:11.080
<v Speaker 2>But you have golf course has a sanskrit </v>
<v Speaker 2>name of it,</v>

1760
01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.240
<v Speaker 2>the sanskrit name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty complex.</v>

1761
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:19.270
<v Speaker 2>But there is a scientific sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation between the shock between </v>

1762
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:21.470
<v Speaker 2>the sex organs and the corresponding </v>
<v Speaker 2>morphogenetic field.</v>

1763
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you practice yoga yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1764
01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.320
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

1765
01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.440
<v Speaker 5>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not every day because of my travel </v>

1766
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:29.440
<v Speaker 5>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most days that I can.</v>

1767
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:29.840
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1768
01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 2>And how yoga has been around for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years and some people will </v>

1769
01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:38.531
<v Speaker 2>just dismiss it as simply stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you've never actually done it and</v>

1770
01:41:38.991 --> 01:41:43.991
<v Speaker 2>I try to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go to one of those beat yoga </v>

1771
01:41:43.991 --> 01:41:46.961
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take one class or or whatever's in </v>

1772
01:41:46.961 --> 01:41:46.961
<v Speaker 2>your neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take one class and then talk.</v>

1773
01:41:46.961 --> 01:41:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Because until you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really don't know what that feeling </v>

1774
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:52.640
<v Speaker 2>is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That feeling after yoga is your high,</v>

1775
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.370
<v Speaker 2>your high a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love people.</v>

1776
01:41:55.371 --> 01:41:58.220
<v Speaker 2>You want to call people and apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to hug people.</v>

1777
01:41:58.221 --> 01:41:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brian,</v>

1778
01:41:59.451 --> 01:42:00.670
<v Speaker 2>you need that shit in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

1779
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:03.630
<v Speaker 2>We were definitely high.</v>

1780
01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.000
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the best with of the ama</v>

1781
01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:08.040
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] really nice.</v>

1782
01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:13.340
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The energy gets into the crown chakra </v>

1783
01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:13.900
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1784
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:16.770
<v Speaker 5>Or in the higher chakras.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very definitely.</v>

1785
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.210
<v Speaker 5>so ground chapter is connected with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1786
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:24.330
<v Speaker 5>chronic chapter satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get this endorphin molecules that </v>

1787
01:42:24.330 --> 01:42:25.440
<v Speaker 5>the byproduct of yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crown chakra.</v>

1788
01:42:25.770 --> 01:42:30.770
<v Speaker 5>So no endorphin molecules are wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's the height,</v>

1789
01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:34.560
<v Speaker 5>that's the high actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's fairly simple explanation why we</v>

1790
01:42:34.561 --> 01:42:38.450
<v Speaker 5>get decided and why it should not be </v>
<v Speaker 5>trivialized you.</v>

1791
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:43.500
<v Speaker 5>There are many other ways to get high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is one of the best ways because</v>

1792
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:48.800
<v Speaker 5>at the same time your gating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting an exercise of the muscles and </v>

1793
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:48.800
<v Speaker 5>joints.</v>

1794
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're stretching and stretching </v>

1795
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people don't think of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of stretching.</v>

1796
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:57.781
<v Speaker 2>It's for athletic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stretching is also for attention </v>

1797
01:42:57.781 --> 01:42:57.940
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing tension remains.</v>

1798
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:03.160
<v Speaker 5>and because that tension release now </v>
<v Speaker 5>will in the future say you from </v>

1800
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.780
<v Speaker 5>february.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Debilitating disease.</v>

1801
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1802
01:43:09.110 --> 01:43:14.110
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PreventIve medicine in a way and </v>

1803
01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:15.100
<v Speaker 2>flexibility last is very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>repair,</v>

1804
01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:20.110
<v Speaker 2>a difficult to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that hard to maintain once </v>

1805
01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you've attained</v>

1806
01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:24.330
<v Speaker 5>once you have attended and the key is </v>
<v Speaker 5>not to never to completely discontinue </v>

1807
01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:26.380
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you can do once a week is better</v>

1808
01:43:26.381 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 5>than not doing it at all.</v>

1809
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:29.080
<v Speaker 2>You know what the problem with yogurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

1810
01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Fake yoga people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking about.</v>

1811
01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:38.150
<v Speaker 2>You do people that are claiming to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual and showing up a yoga classes,</v>

1812
01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:42.550
<v Speaker 2>but the really annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know those people?</v>

1813
01:43:42.551 --> 01:43:43.120
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1814
01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:48.210
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point is of course that you </v>

1815
01:43:48.210 --> 01:43:48.210
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there will always be effect pupil.</v>

1816
01:43:48.210 --> 01:43:49.230
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be bumper </v>
<v Speaker 2>stickers.</v>

1817
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.620
<v Speaker 2>All there's</v>

1818
01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:52.290
<v Speaker 5>going to be bumper stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You cannot avoid.</v>

1819
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.930
<v Speaker 5>This thing is not the real thing because</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the effect.</v>

1820
01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very true and in reality it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small percentage of the yoga people that</v>

1821
01:44:01.421 --> 01:44:03.790
<v Speaker 1>are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tiny percentage and if you,</v>

1822
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:06.910
<v Speaker 1>and if you think about the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>scammers in the population,</v>

1823
01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:12.060
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be issues with </v>
<v Speaker 1>men in male ego and posturing and </v>

1824
01:44:12.761 --> 01:44:17.761
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean similar issues with women and </v>

1825
01:44:17.761 --> 01:44:19.190
<v Speaker 1>women dealing with other women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1826
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the fake yoga man and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen the fake yoga woman.</v>

1827
01:44:22.751 --> 01:44:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the fake yoga woman everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake yoga man is trying to get laid.</v>

1828
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:32.790
<v Speaker 1>The fake yoga woman is just trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to be a little more spiritual </v>

1829
01:44:34.061 --> 01:44:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and not materialistic than she truly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fake yoga man,</v>

1830
01:44:36.911 --> 01:44:38.500
<v Speaker 1>it's just trying to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's annoying</v>

1831
01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:44.560
<v Speaker 5>and then maybe one out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's enough that these things.</v>

1832
01:44:46.170 --> 01:44:51.170
<v Speaker 5>I think that some people will get into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the new age movement with the idea of </v>

1833
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:55.840
<v Speaker 5>finding relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which in a way of course is finding.</v>

1834
01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I love how you just put that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what they're doing.</v>

1835
01:44:58.811 --> 01:45:03.811
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get some pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between find a </v>

1836
01:45:03.811 --> 01:45:03.811
<v Speaker 1>relationship and just</v>

1837
01:45:03.811 --> 01:45:06.050
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they tend to be just finding a</v>
<v Speaker 5>one night stand,</v>

1838
01:45:06.051 --> 01:45:08.430
<v Speaker 5>which is of course their language is </v>
<v Speaker 5>quite accurate.</v>

1839
01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's they're trying to appear </v>

1840
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.770
<v Speaker 1>desirable and one of the ways to appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable to women to be introduced,</v>

1841
01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:22.310
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to be spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1842
01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a trick.</v>

1843
01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.820
<v Speaker 5>That is all true and I'm sure that as </v>
<v Speaker 5>quantum physics,</v>

1844
01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:30.460
<v Speaker 5>quantum fakers</v>

1845
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:37.390
<v Speaker 1>fakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to focus entirely on </v>

1846
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:40.771
<v Speaker 1>the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to address what I know </v>

1847
01:45:40.771 --> 01:45:41.860
<v Speaker 1>people in the general public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues that they have with,</v>

1848
01:45:41.861 --> 01:45:46.861
<v Speaker 1>with folks that claim to be spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'll run into a fake yoga </v>

1849
01:45:46.861 --> 01:45:47.530
<v Speaker 1>person and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

1850
01:45:47.531 --> 01:45:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the typically unique guy with his</v>

1851
01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.250
<v Speaker 1>beads and this is hemp sandals and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to punch them.</v>

1852
01:45:54.251 --> 01:45:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

1853
01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:00.540
<v Speaker 5>Like didn't you have to wait?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be patient looking at the </v>

1854
01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:00.720
<v Speaker 5>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell you a story,</v>

1855
01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:06.010
<v Speaker 5>a typical hinduism teaching story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1856
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:11.380
<v Speaker 5>So if tiff comes to the master spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 5>master and the at the end of the night,</v>

1857
01:46:14.811 --> 01:46:17.660
<v Speaker 5>which are master of course stay with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>

1858
01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 5>So the toughest stealing this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the whole thing.</v>

1859
01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 5>So the buster opens the eyes and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you remember,</v>

1860
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:28.850
<v Speaker 5>did you remember to take everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>

1861
01:46:28.851 --> 01:46:33.170
<v Speaker 5>I really don't need that stuff over </v>
<v Speaker 5>there either so you can take that tube.</v>

1862
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:36.440
<v Speaker 5>So tip is caught.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's very surprised.</v>

1863
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Know master is not throwing him in jail </v>
<v Speaker 5>or the police or anything like that.</v>

1864
01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:47.170
<v Speaker 5>So he's become a little curious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he lays things down the way or you </v>

1865
01:46:47.170 --> 01:46:49.840
<v Speaker 5>not angry because I'm feeling your stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1866
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 5>I said for most of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1867
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't really need it.</v>

1868
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:58.140
<v Speaker 5>I still have attachments so I keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're taking notes,</v>

1869
01:46:58.170 --> 01:47:03.170
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it beComes a littLe more curious and </v>

1870
01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:03.170
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1871
01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:06.120
<v Speaker 5>since you don't mind me stealing it </v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime,</v>

1872
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.360
<v Speaker 5>why should I have to steal it at the end</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the night?</v>

1873
01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:13.410
<v Speaker 5>Let me stay with you for a few days just</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching your metrics and what you do.</v>

1874
01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:15.840
<v Speaker 5>Then I'll take them awaY.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the week,</v>

1875
01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:16.790
<v Speaker 5>my son says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1876
01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:18.120
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stay with me,</v>

1877
01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.660
<v Speaker 5>so it just stays for a few days as he </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks at the master and tries to do some</v>

1878
01:47:27.781 --> 01:47:32.781
<v Speaker 5>of the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He sTarts changing by faking.</v>

1879
01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:38.180
<v Speaker 5>Initially he thought you'll just fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>the monster because then he'll pick up </v>

1880
01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:41.661
<v Speaker 5>the faking and then his stealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>capacity will increase manifold because </v>

1881
01:47:41.661 --> 01:47:43.680
<v Speaker 5>it will impress people by being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>spiritual man.</v>

1882
01:47:44.190 --> 01:47:47.220
<v Speaker 5>People will have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will have more access to more houses</v>

1883
01:47:47.221 --> 01:47:48.750
<v Speaker 5>and he will be able to steal more.</v>

1884
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:54.110
<v Speaker 5>That was the origiNal idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why you wanted to watch the </v>

1885
01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 5>master,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then as It did two things,</v>

1886
01:47:56.310 --> 01:48:01.310
<v Speaker 5>meditate and sit and talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After even a few days it started </v>

1887
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:07.971
<v Speaker 5>changing sodium so it can begin with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fake and ended up with something else </v>

1888
01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.020
<v Speaker 5>and of course master knew it all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1889
01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:15.180
<v Speaker 5>So at the end of the seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>master says,</v>

1890
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you take this stuff and leave.</v>

1891
01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:22.640
<v Speaker 5>Why are you belonging your stage and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the and the fellow calls on the </v>

1892
01:48:22.921 --> 01:48:27.921
<v Speaker 5>feed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an indian medium of saying </v>

1893
01:48:27.921 --> 01:48:27.921
<v Speaker 5>surrender subsets that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1894
01:48:27.921 --> 01:48:31.470
<v Speaker 5>I want to learn what makes it you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not interested in stealing the small</v>

1895
01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:36.471
<v Speaker 5>stuff anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to steal the stuff that you are </v>

1896
01:48:36.471 --> 01:48:38.961
<v Speaker 5>made up so it's so where we can make </v>
<v Speaker 5>even use sub this faith is.</v>

1897
01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:48.580
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing by being patient with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are faking and just allowing </v>

1898
01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:52.521
<v Speaker 5>them in the process because although the</v>
<v Speaker 5>initial intention is superficial,</v>

1899
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:58.800
<v Speaker 5>but as you ruled them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>consumption itself,</v>

1900
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:04.460
<v Speaker 5>consuming this very wonderful stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very wonderful behavior will begin to </v>

1901
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:06.930
<v Speaker 5>give the idea.</v>

1902
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:12.010
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe I can become a producer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>these energies that I faked by </v>

1903
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.510
<v Speaker 5>meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I actualize them,</v>

1904
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:20.810
<v Speaker 5>then they will actually produce changes </v>
<v Speaker 5>in meta profound and um,</v>

1905
01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:26.580
<v Speaker 5>which should open the gates for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>rather than closing it by saying,</v>

1906
01:49:26.610 --> 01:49:29.070
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are just a fake instead.</v>

1907
01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:32.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're a little more tolerant about them.</v>

1908
01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:38.740
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am kind of losing the quantum </v>

1909
01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:41.571
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although they have no idea what they're </v>

1910
01:49:41.571 --> 01:49:41.571
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then,</v>

1911
01:49:41.571 --> 01:49:45.210
<v Speaker 5>but then you explain it one time and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll become a little curious.</v>

1912
01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:50.211
<v Speaker 5>And initially their curiosity will be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can pick up a little more and impress </v>

1913
01:49:50.211 --> 01:49:50.850
<v Speaker 5>people a little more medevac,</v>
<v Speaker 5>covenantal,</v>

1914
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.560
<v Speaker 5>more curious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more curious.</v>

1915
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:54.070
<v Speaker 5>One day they'll ask,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1916
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:58.600
<v Speaker 5>can I actually start doing this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And really be creative.</v>

1917
01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't find in one,</v>

1918
01:50:02.151 --> 01:50:07.151
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think you understand quantum </v>

1919
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:07.151
<v Speaker 5>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand quantum mechanics,</v>

1920
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1921
01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:11.410
<v Speaker 5>one of them now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

1922
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:12.310
<v Speaker 5>many sayings.</v>

1923
01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:16.690
<v Speaker 5>This could come from niels bohr who said</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if we will talk to you,</v>

1924
01:50:16.730 --> 01:50:21.730
<v Speaker 5>understood quantum physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then probably didn't understand it at </v>

1925
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.780
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that many,</v>

1926
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:25.270
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many things about quantum physics,</v>

1927
01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.240
<v Speaker 5>man said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody understands quantum physics.</v>

1928
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.560
<v Speaker 5>One time he did say something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why do people say something like </v>

1929
01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:39.091
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because quantum physics at some level </v>

1930
01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:42.300
<v Speaker 5>becomes so incredibly mysterious that </v>
<v Speaker 5>India,</v>

1931
01:50:43.431 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 5>first of matter consciousness can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>

1932
01:50:45.971 --> 01:50:50.971
<v Speaker 5>This is just such a inherent mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many people are savvy,</v>

1933
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:56.470
<v Speaker 5>heart put to accept this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they would rather have nobody </v>

1934
01:50:56.470 --> 01:51:01.381
<v Speaker 5>understands quantum mechanics then </v>
<v Speaker 5>except that consciousness is needed to </v>

1935
01:51:01.661 --> 01:51:06.661
<v Speaker 5>understand quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these are the barriers of new </v>

1936
01:51:07.271 --> 01:51:09.790
<v Speaker 5>thinking coming into the field of </v>
<v Speaker 5>science.</v>

1937
01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.240
<v Speaker 5>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because experimentally we are verifying </v>

1938
01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:19.030
<v Speaker 5>the idea of nonlocal consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are verifying the idea that really </v>

1939
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:23.851
<v Speaker 5>eased at nonlocal connection between </v>
<v Speaker 5>people or the way we got knowledge named</v>

1940
01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.660
<v Speaker 5>the consciousness is actually nonlocal.</v>

1941
01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:34.320
<v Speaker 5>that verification will go a long way in </v>
<v Speaker 5>changing the paradigm,</v>

1942
01:51:34.661 --> 01:51:37.960
<v Speaker 5>changing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did yoga get discovered?</v>

1943
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:42.990
<v Speaker 5>How did they figure out that these poses</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stretches could open up your mind </v>

1944
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:42.990
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1945
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:44.530
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and change your consciousness.</v>

1946
01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:45.040
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is,</v>

1947
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:46.600
<v Speaker 5>what is the history behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1948
01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:50.680
<v Speaker 5>the original,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you read patanjali's yoga sutra,</v>

1949
01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.980
<v Speaker 5>he just introduced us author yoga as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way of finding a comfortable place to </v>

1950
01:51:56.771 --> 01:52:01.771
<v Speaker 5>meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Originally the idea was just to sit </v>

1951
01:52:01.771 --> 01:52:06.421
<v Speaker 5>comfortably and in order to sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortably in meditation for a long </v>

1952
01:52:06.421 --> 01:52:07.560
<v Speaker 5>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stretching helps,</v>

1953
01:52:08.110 --> 01:52:10.960
<v Speaker 5>and then they discovered one very </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderful thing.</v>

1954
01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:16.050
<v Speaker 5>As people meditated the bain job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>meditation,</v>

1955
01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:20.680
<v Speaker 5>they found this to create gap between </v>
<v Speaker 5>tots.</v>

1956
01:52:21.010 --> 01:52:26.010
<v Speaker 5>You slow down your mental process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So once they discovered that the idea of</v>

1957
01:52:27.821 --> 01:52:32.170
<v Speaker 5>slowing down the mental process helps </v>
<v Speaker 5>enormously,</v>

1958
01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:36.520
<v Speaker 5>or creativity or spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once they found that out,</v>

1959
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:41.850
<v Speaker 5>then they realized the next wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing is that isn't yoga also a way of </v>

1960
01:52:41.861 --> 01:52:46.861
<v Speaker 5>slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The body Is in front I a way of slowing </v>

1961
01:52:46.861 --> 01:52:47.690
<v Speaker 5>down the breaths and therefore all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>arguments,</v>

1962
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:51.100
<v Speaker 5>so the interest group at your eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>self,</v>

1963
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:56.140
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you a gauge self is not just </v>
<v Speaker 5>stretching or just working on the </v>

1964
01:52:57.050 --> 01:53:02.050
<v Speaker 5>joints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also weird to slow down the body </v>

1965
01:53:02.050 --> 01:53:05.800
<v Speaker 5>and therefore the mind is alternately it</v>
<v Speaker 5>indirectly slowing down the wind because</v>

1966
01:53:05.961 --> 01:53:07.970
<v Speaker 5>if the body is slow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wind will also be slow</v>

1967
01:53:08.190 --> 01:53:12.190
<v Speaker 2>by focusing on the poses and your breath</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your throat.</v>

1968
01:53:12.690 --> 01:53:15.660
<v Speaker 5>Not so much like bikram Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fast yoga,</v>

1969
01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:18.310
<v Speaker 5>but in the original way that you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

1970
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 5>That's quite slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The slow yoga is actually even better </v>

1971
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:24.060
<v Speaker 5>than the first year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not at the festival.</v>

1972
01:53:24.061 --> 01:53:26.520
<v Speaker 5>Loses everything of yoga festival is </v>
<v Speaker 5>also good,</v>

1973
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.740
<v Speaker 5>but they'd be even better because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>slows down.</v>

1974
01:53:31.741 --> 01:53:35.250
<v Speaker 5>The body slows down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mind slows down.</v>

1975
01:53:35.251 --> 01:53:38.520
<v Speaker 5>The vital energies slows down our </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions.</v>

1976
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:41.970
<v Speaker 5>It gives you a lot of breaths between </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fast,</v>

1977
01:53:41.971 --> 01:53:42.810
<v Speaker 5>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fast go,</v>

1978
01:53:42.811 --> 01:53:43.500
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go mind,</v>

1979
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:48.970
<v Speaker 5>and especially important for developing </v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity because creativity is </v>

1980
01:53:48.970 --> 01:53:51.690
<v Speaker 5>enormously dependent on that unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 5>processing,</v>

1981
01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:54.840
<v Speaker 5>doing nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do and be so.</v>

1982
01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:58.110
<v Speaker 5>If we do yoga regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we really don't differ.</v>

1983
01:53:58.111 --> 01:54:03.111
<v Speaker 5>Need meditation or goodwill day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can just do yoga and get the benefit </v>

1984
01:54:04.141 --> 01:54:09.141
<v Speaker 5>on the mind from yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lower that that is goes a long way for </v>

1985
01:54:09.211 --> 01:54:10.200
<v Speaker 5>our creativity.</v>

1986
01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:15.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of ancient texts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect yoga with cannabis,</v>

1987
01:54:15.041 --> 01:54:20.041
<v Speaker 2>use yoga with how she shoes and and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even eating cannabis.</v>

1988
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're now familiar with.</v>

1989
01:54:23.651 --> 01:54:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look aT you.</v>

1990
01:54:24.311 --> 01:54:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Your slide devil with that smile on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1991
01:54:27.250 --> 01:54:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Someone's got a reputation to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>

1992
01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that point of view.</v>

1993
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any experience at all in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic?</v>

1994
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little less certain tried.</v>

1995
01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I've been in this faith if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the law to what do you mean?</v>

1996
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1997
01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 2>You have to take a very mild or atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to ask you about some </v>

1998
01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:57.170
<v Speaker 2>mild in one time and one time what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about samsung or something very </v>

1999
01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:00.970
<v Speaker 2>familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at your old school devil.</v>

2000
01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2001
01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:07.520
<v Speaker 2>so a friend of mine comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington with the Washington,</v>

2002
01:55:08.381 --> 01:55:10.840
<v Speaker 2>don't play games exact seattle's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

2003
01:55:11.890 --> 01:55:12.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2004
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:13.600
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2005
01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:18.620
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take this stuff with him and we put </v>

2006
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:18.620
<v Speaker 2>it in cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2007
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And iT doesn't,</v>

2008
01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.950
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take effect for an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes,</v>

2009
01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.750
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing is happening.</v>

2010
01:55:26.110 --> 01:55:26.740
<v Speaker 2>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2011
01:55:26.741 --> 01:55:29.200
<v Speaker 2>let's go to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a classic story.</v>

2012
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:36.670
<v Speaker 2>We go to dinner and all of a sudden I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just eating my first course.</v>

2013
01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the lights of the city from a</v>

2014
01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:44.610
<v Speaker 2>window and it starts exploding.</v>

2015
01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my wife was the third question on the</v>

2016
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:56.181
<v Speaker 5>table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She also starts feeling something and </v>

2017
01:55:56.181 --> 01:56:00.650
<v Speaker 5>she has to go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she goes on the way back from the </v>

2018
01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 5>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she passes out.</v>

2019
01:56:02.610 --> 01:56:06.010
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'd have to,</v>

2020
01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:09.300
<v Speaker 5>I have to go and try that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2021
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.350
<v Speaker 5>This is my woman.</v>

2022
01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:16.720
<v Speaker 4>I will take her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to.</v>

2023
01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So probably she got weak and therefore </v>

2024
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:24.060
<v Speaker 5>best out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't pay any attention to her.</v>

2025
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:28.701
<v Speaker 5>I'll take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this friend or people from </v>

2026
01:56:28.701 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to watch them.</v>

2027
01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:32.640
<v Speaker 5>This friend doesn't know me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't know her.</v>

2028
01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:37.940
<v Speaker 5>Just walks away completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doEsn't go anywhere.</v>

2029
01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:40.430
<v Speaker 1>It just left you guys there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just left those guys there.</v>

2030
01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an asshole.</v>

2031
01:56:41.481 --> 01:56:44.990
<v Speaker 1>That guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He caught up and apologize.</v>

2032
01:56:45.070 --> 01:56:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually.</v>

2033
01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Did he know that you guys had taken pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>cookies?</v>

2034
01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Cookie or a brownie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't he was taking.</v>

2035
01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.590
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be a part of it.</v>

2036
01:56:55.591 --> 01:57:00.591
<v Speaker 1>I still get caught up in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that difficult situation in the </v>

2037
01:57:00.591 --> 01:57:04.631
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who have never heard me </v>

2038
01:57:04.631 --> 01:57:06.401
<v Speaker 1>say this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I've said it a million </v>

2039
01:57:06.401 --> 01:57:06.401
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you eat cannabis,</v>

2040
01:57:06.401 --> 01:57:06.750
<v Speaker 1>that has a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive effect,</v>

2041
01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're telling me,</v>

2042
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:09.370
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2043
01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.080
<v Speaker 1>When cannabis is processed by the liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces something called 11 hydroxy </v>

2044
01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:21.161
<v Speaker 1>metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a approximately four to five </v>

2045
01:57:21.161 --> 01:57:24.161
<v Speaker 1>times more psychoactive than thc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why It has that insane effect.</v>

2046
01:57:24.471 --> 01:57:29.471
<v Speaker 1>It's not just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an alien effect that you don't get </v>

2047
01:57:29.471 --> 01:57:29.471
<v Speaker 1>when you smoke pot eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very,</v>

2048
01:57:29.471 --> 01:57:33.860
<v Speaker 1>very different experience and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily overdo it and it looks like maybe</v>

2049
01:57:33.861 --> 01:57:35.330
<v Speaker 1>your wife just got so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2050
01:57:35.331 --> 01:57:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to pretend to be blacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2051
01:57:37.130 --> 01:57:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It's way less stressful than walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2052
01:57:39.590 --> 01:57:44.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she did say that she was faking </v>

2053
01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:44.590
<v Speaker 5>interdental bit.</v>

2054
01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:44.590
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2055
01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:51.160
<v Speaker 5>she did have to lie down and they fed </v>
<v Speaker 5>them anonymous.</v>

2056
01:57:51.161 --> 01:57:56.161
<v Speaker 5>affect mine to be under it and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>driving under it,</v>

2057
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is why I don't really like the idea</v>

2058
01:57:59.571 --> 01:58:04.571
<v Speaker 5>of legalizing marijuana in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>because driving with marijuana at least </v>

2059
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.930
<v Speaker 5>be oral kind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>

2060
01:58:08.931 --> 01:58:13.931
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I tell that driving experience </v>

2061
01:58:13.931 --> 01:58:15.770
<v Speaker 5>was the most difficult power in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire life.</v>

2062
01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.710
<v Speaker 5>I've never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

2063
01:58:18.711 --> 01:58:22.280
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible to gauge time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How time is going,</v>

2064
01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:24.620
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's fast.</v>

2065
01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Did it change?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did it change your ideas of the quantum </v>

2066
01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.380
<v Speaker 4>world pot brownies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like connected to.</v>

2067
01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 4>This was before the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the discoveries</v>

2068
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:44.860
<v Speaker 2>of quantum physics that I went through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really those,</v>

2069
01:58:44.861 --> 01:58:49.861
<v Speaker 2>this is pre quantum physics quantum era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early eighties.</v>

2070
01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:52.620
<v Speaker 2>So in the early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were a standard.</v>

2071
01:58:52.621 --> 01:58:56.740
<v Speaker 2>A nuclear theorists are struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already came out of bed,</v>

2072
01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:01.800
<v Speaker 2>but I had not found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discovered the new possibilities of </v>

2073
01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:01.870
<v Speaker 2>quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2074
01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:04.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before you discovered all this stuff,</v>

2075
01:59:04.050 --> 01:59:05.740
<v Speaker 2>you weren't really a happy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you?</v>

2076
01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a very unhappy guy.</v>

2077
01:59:07.661 --> 01:59:08.450
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2078
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

2079
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:12.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my change came only after I realized it.</v>

2080
01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:16.450
<v Speaker 5>one day I was at a conference on nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 5>physics giving a paper,</v>

2081
01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:18.010
<v Speaker 5>erudite paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

2082
01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:22.060
<v Speaker 5>nothing to do with everyday life and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>give this paper gusto.</v>

2083
01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:27.180
<v Speaker 5>Nobody appreciates it at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I taught and I think that the other </v>

2084
01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:31.021
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although they are talking about equally </v>

2085
01:59:31.021 --> 01:59:33.300
<v Speaker 5>esoteric nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they are much more appreciated by </v>

2086
01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:37.141
<v Speaker 5>the audience and at the party,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially by the women.</v>

2087
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:38.260
<v Speaker 5>The first sex.</v>

2088
01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm jealous.</v>

2089
01:59:42.031 --> 01:59:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jealous,</v>

2090
01:59:43.441 --> 01:59:43.760
<v Speaker 2>jealous.</v>

2091
01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 5>Sending that equipped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that way,</v>

2092
01:59:45.911 --> 01:59:48.940
<v Speaker 5>the whole party,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole evening at 1:00,</v>

2093
01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:52.810
<v Speaker 5>I get disgusted with myself because all </v>
<v Speaker 5>my pumps are gone.</v>

2094
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2095
01:59:53.850 --> 01:59:57.750
<v Speaker 2>tom's digestive hard buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pills you eat,</v>

2096
01:59:57.751 --> 02:00:01.950
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times those days you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were upset.</v>

2097
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm upSet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I go outside this,</v>

2098
02:00:04.841 --> 02:00:08.020
<v Speaker 5>this is that on the on the monterrey </v>
<v Speaker 5>bay,</v>

2099
02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:13.320
<v Speaker 5>rePlace Scott Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Omar and I have this ocean breeze hit my</v>

2100
02:00:14.111 --> 02:00:17.170
<v Speaker 5>face and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do I live this way?</v>

2101
02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:22.320
<v Speaker 5>They this happy with so I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally avowedly was the </v>

2102
02:00:23.501 --> 02:00:25.510
<v Speaker 5>practitioner of happy physics since </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

2103
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:30.580
<v Speaker 5>Of course I didn't find it immediately </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way to be happy doing physics,</v>

2104
02:00:30.581 --> 02:00:33.760
<v Speaker 5>but eventually found it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>

2105
02:00:33.761 --> 02:00:38.761
<v Speaker 5>Physics is happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>happiest years of physics that I ever </v>

2106
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.850
<v Speaker 5>hoped.</v>

2107
02:00:40.610 --> 02:00:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was this change though?</v>

2108
02:00:42.471 --> 02:00:43.910
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting out there.</v>

2109
02:00:43.911 --> 02:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>The water hits your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's thinking and what?</v>

2110
02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Think it's an intuitive thought to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change one's life.</v>

2111
02:00:49.730 --> 02:00:53.810
<v Speaker 2>This is the kind of thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden and you are not the same</v>

2112
02:00:53.811 --> 02:00:55.220
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not.</v>

2113
02:00:55.221 --> 02:00:58.490
<v Speaker 2>You weren't like descartes was visited </v>
<v Speaker 2>by an angel in his dreams.</v>

2114
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your changes.</v>

2115
02:01:00.710 --> 02:01:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Like I just went outside and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

2116
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on mushrooms,</v>

2117
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:05.970
<v Speaker 2>not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2118
02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:07.250
<v Speaker 2>no drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2119
02:01:07.290 --> 02:01:12.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a moment that intuition at moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of knowing yourself because I was ready </v>

2120
02:01:13.570 --> 02:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>to look at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were ready to look at yourself </v>

2121
02:01:18.570 --> 02:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>because before you weren't</v>

2122
02:01:18.570 --> 02:01:23.490
<v Speaker 5>before I wasn't before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't matter to me that the physics </v>

2123
02:01:23.490 --> 02:01:26.941
<v Speaker 5>that I do has nothing to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>life that I live and all of a sudden I </v>

2124
02:01:26.941 --> 02:01:31.681
<v Speaker 5>wanted to really live a meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to do something that has </v>

2125
02:01:31.681 --> 02:01:36.030
<v Speaker 5>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just in west to get ahead in my </v>

2126
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:37.320
<v Speaker 5>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I wanted to integrate.</v>

2127
02:01:37.330 --> 02:01:40.490
<v Speaker 5>I want to integrate my professional with</v>
<v Speaker 5>my daily life,</v>

2128
02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.760
<v Speaker 5>how to love my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put up children how to get on with </v>

2129
02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:45.760
<v Speaker 5>trends better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2130
02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 5>live life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just to physics formulas and publish</v>

2131
02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:51.530
<v Speaker 5>papers and get promotions in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>department.</v>

2132
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just one moment.</v>

2133
02:01:54.641 --> 02:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>You just had enough and that's when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into the woo world.</v>

2134
02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quantum mechanics,</v>

2135
02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.210
<v Speaker 5>not immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Slowly,</v>

2136
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:03.940
<v Speaker 5>slowly and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of struggle,</v>

2137
02:02:03.941 --> 02:02:07.510
<v Speaker 5>a lot of experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of steps in between.</v>

2138
02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.450
<v Speaker 5>It took a lot of time too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was 1973.</v>

2139
02:02:10.530 --> 02:02:15.530
<v Speaker 5>I might discover a kevin 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So 12 years of quite a risky,</v>

2140
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:21.300
<v Speaker 5>adventurous path,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but words came.</v>

2141
02:02:22.230 --> 02:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Now there's another thing that you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I read that I found completely </v>

2142
02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>fascinating is that you don't believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>

2143
02:02:31.330 --> 02:02:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do and I don't.</v>

2144
02:02:33.650 --> 02:02:38.650
<v Speaker 5>You do it in the sense that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity has the component of favor.</v>

2145
02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:42.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it starts with the free will of the ego.</v>

2146
02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Ego has one freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's very crucial element of </v>

2147
02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:48.970
<v Speaker 5>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is bad.</v>

2148
02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:54.480
<v Speaker 5>At some point they got to realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it really does not know and </v>

2149
02:02:56.951 --> 02:03:00.160
<v Speaker 5>therefore start saying no to all </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditioning,</v>

2150
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:03.420
<v Speaker 5>nor to condition meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now to condition habits,</v>

2151
02:03:03.421 --> 02:03:06.580
<v Speaker 5>no to condition patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nor to condition behavior,</v>

2152
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:10.360
<v Speaker 5>and that's when we make room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when you have an open mind.</v>

2153
02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:15.420
<v Speaker 5>We make room for learning new stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when creativity can come to us </v>

2154
02:03:16.331 --> 02:03:21.331
<v Speaker 5>before then we start really thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we know it all with our reservoir </v>

2155
02:03:22.721 --> 02:03:25.660
<v Speaker 5>of knowledge because I have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>expertise.</v>

2156
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Therefore I know that expert is don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>bring us knowledge.</v>

2157
02:03:30.281 --> 02:03:35.281
<v Speaker 5>Expertise just bring us a very special </v>
<v Speaker 5>fraction of knowledge that is useful to </v>

2158
02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:41.041
<v Speaker 5>solve certain problems that would given </v>
<v Speaker 5>context because the context is known.</v>

2159
02:03:42.490 --> 02:03:44.230
<v Speaker 5>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the expertise always says,</v>

2160
02:03:44.231 --> 02:03:49.231
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere in my expertise there is an </v>

2161
02:03:49.231 --> 02:03:51.361
<v Speaker 5>answer and it will develop a habit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>finding that answer fairly quickly and </v>

2162
02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:53.530
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people admire that.</v>

2163
02:03:53.531 --> 02:03:58.531
<v Speaker 5>Of course you go ahead in your society </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they are very efficient problem </v>

2164
02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:03.211
<v Speaker 5>solver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I they did sing that happens with an</v>

2165
02:04:03.581 --> 02:04:08.581
<v Speaker 5>open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They start to realize that there is a </v>

2166
02:04:08.581 --> 02:04:10.090
<v Speaker 5>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Problems are not given within contexts.</v>

2167
02:04:10.690 --> 02:04:15.690
<v Speaker 5>The contexts are not given to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to discover not only the new </v>

2168
02:04:15.690 --> 02:04:17.410
<v Speaker 5>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also the new context of it.</v>

2169
02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:20.680
<v Speaker 5>And this is what makes real life </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems very difficult.</v>

2170
02:04:20.681 --> 02:04:23.800
<v Speaker 5>This is why we're touching about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier.</v>

2171
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:25.690
<v Speaker 5>We don't learn that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2172
02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:30.691
<v Speaker 5>they sent her brother are sitting in me </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to integrate that with the abstract </v>

2173
02:04:30.691 --> 02:04:34.300
<v Speaker 5>thinker of today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not given in any book.</v>

2174
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:36.520
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not given within given context.</v>

2175
02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:39.240
<v Speaker 5>So how do you get into this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing?</v>

2176
02:04:39.250 --> 02:04:41.790
<v Speaker 5>Have To creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to become open first.</v>

2177
02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:46.820
<v Speaker 5>That okay with this rational mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has only learned about abstract </v>

2178
02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:48.770
<v Speaker 5>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to integrate our,</v>

2179
02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:51.780
<v Speaker 5>my emotions of the hunter gatherer days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2180
02:04:51.781 --> 02:04:54.900
<v Speaker 5>with the one that is today who is all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the suppressed emotions.</v>

2181
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to open up,</v>

2182
02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:02.540
<v Speaker 5>we have to recognize our ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely and invite creativity in our </v>

2183
02:05:02.581 --> 02:05:04.530
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that idea,</v>

2184
02:05:04.531 --> 02:05:09.210
<v Speaker 5>that idea was the most important idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably that eventually,</v>

2185
02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changed me as a person.</v>

2186
02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2187
02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea that is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

2188
02:05:20.071 --> 02:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>this is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard way to hurt a widow,</v>

2189
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>wrap your head around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in saying that you have freewill and</v>

2190
02:05:27.091 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't have free will at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2191
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:30.720
<v Speaker 5>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the freewill.</v>

2192
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:34.470
<v Speaker 5>This said this is the free world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in other things with what is our,</v>

2193
02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:36.160
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what choices,</v>

2194
02:05:36.330 --> 02:05:38.550
<v Speaker 5>what flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what flavor of ice cream?</v>

2195
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Well left or right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good or bad,</v>

2196
02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.750
<v Speaker 1>on the basis of what you know already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2197
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis of what you know and what you've </v>

2198
02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:49.940
<v Speaker 1>learned and what we admire in someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's learned.</v>

2199
02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who evolved.</v>

2200
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2201
02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So on the basis of the known,</v>

2202
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:59.350
<v Speaker 5>all the answers are conditioned among </v>
<v Speaker 5>the condition spectrum of knowledge and </v>

2203
02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:01.220
<v Speaker 5>that that's really not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2204
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:04.910
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's nothing to kroger.</v>

2205
02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:06.310
<v Speaker 5>It's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2206
02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:09.950
<v Speaker 5>nobody would give up that freedom if it </v>
<v Speaker 5>tied and comes and says that,</v>

2207
02:06:09.951 --> 02:06:11.050
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have the.</v>

2208
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:15.620
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the choice to choose a </v>
<v Speaker 5>flavor of ice cream even I have.</v>

2209
02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:18.410
<v Speaker 5>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to take only one flavor.</v>

2210
02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:23.800
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of us would object and immediately </v>

2211
02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:23.800
<v Speaker 5>we know we don't want that will become </v>
<v Speaker 5>rebellious,</v>

2212
02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:29.080
<v Speaker 5>but it's that a different order of </v>
<v Speaker 5>magnitude than what is needed to </v>

2213
02:06:30.771 --> 02:06:33.950
<v Speaker 5>discover really new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That freedom,</v>

2214
02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 5>that freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which takes us to,</v>

2215
02:06:35.401 --> 02:06:40.040
<v Speaker 5>to really new and they're the ego's </v>
<v Speaker 5>threewill is not very helpful.</v>

2216
02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:45.100
<v Speaker 5>We have to open up to what means </v>
<v Speaker 5>spiritual tradition is called god's </v>

2217
02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:46.820
<v Speaker 5>will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that god separate from us?</v>

2218
02:06:46.821 --> 02:06:50.960
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also our will in some sense,</v>

2219
02:06:50.961 --> 02:06:55.961
<v Speaker 5>but coming from a higher consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the difference coming from that </v>

2220
02:06:55.961 --> 02:06:59.381
<v Speaker 5>nonlocal consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So real freedom of choice is beyond </v>

2221
02:06:59.381 --> 02:07:02.260
<v Speaker 5>egos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>freewill to that freewill.</v>

2222
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:05.180
<v Speaker 5>That enables me to choose creative </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer.</v>

2223
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:07.670
<v Speaker 5>Creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2224
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so real freewill only exist sort of in </v>

2225
02:07:14.211 --> 02:07:19.211
<v Speaker 1>the base animalistic world and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of consciousness,</v>

2226
02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:25.180
<v Speaker 1>free will doesn't exist because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the collective </v>

2227
02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

2228
02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:26.720
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2229
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Stay there a little bit inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was some accurate in it.</v>

2230
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:33.440
<v Speaker 5>It it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does not exist necessarily.</v>

2231
02:07:33.441 --> 02:07:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Also in the non rational,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the in the emotional,</v>

2232
02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:41.880
<v Speaker 5>non rational experiences of the pre </v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurant.</v>

2233
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Either it comes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes from the intuition,</v>

2234
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:51.870
<v Speaker 5>the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it really is the higher function </v>

2235
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:53.260
<v Speaker 5>except you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In one sense,</v>

2236
02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:58.530
<v Speaker 5>if we go out outside of the irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rational is our biggest enemy in defense</v>

2237
02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.270
<v Speaker 5>of free will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the higher sense is a bigger enemy of</v>

2238
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:06.340
<v Speaker 5>intuition than already more sense.</v>

2239
02:08:06.710 --> 02:08:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Rationality is the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea that you can rationalize</v>

2240
02:08:11.001 --> 02:08:16.001
<v Speaker 2>any evil or abusive behavior for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head of a corporation because it makes </v>

2241
02:08:16.001 --> 02:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>money for your</v>

2242
02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:21.260
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that restaurant I fashion is our </v>

2243
02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.721
<v Speaker 5>biggest enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even bigger than emotions in defensive </v>

2244
02:08:23.721 --> 02:08:25.380
<v Speaker 5>to include emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to improve positive emotions,</v>

2245
02:08:25.381 --> 02:08:28.890
<v Speaker 5>positive emotions are very helpful too </v>
<v Speaker 5>to intrusive.</v>

2246
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:31.260
<v Speaker 2>So how would you describe what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational thing is?</v>

2247
02:08:31.261 --> 02:08:34.850
<v Speaker 2>The biggest enemy of what that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking can also be a friend.</v>

2248
02:08:34.851 --> 02:08:39.851
<v Speaker 2>I don'T want to sound overly again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can be rationalized.</v>

2249
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Everything you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rationalization,</v>

2250
02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:45.000
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational thinking,</v>

2251
02:08:45.570 --> 02:08:47.430
<v Speaker 2>rational thinking is good generally.</v>

2252
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:50.880
<v Speaker 5>But we don't do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only with that we can,</v>

2253
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:52.530
<v Speaker 5>we can justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like today,</v>

2254
02:08:52.531 --> 02:08:55.440
<v Speaker 5>scientific materialists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they justify everything,</v>

2255
02:08:55.441 --> 02:08:57.180
<v Speaker 5>all of their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2256
02:08:57.750 --> 02:09:00.120
<v Speaker 5>all of the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even the worldview itself,</v>

2257
02:09:00.121 --> 02:09:05.121
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's not as a way that could not </v>

2258
02:09:05.121 --> 02:09:07.851
<v Speaker 5>be spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could not be god because everything </v>

2259
02:09:07.851 --> 02:09:07.851
<v Speaker 5>has to be made up better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What else can it be?</v>

2260
02:09:07.851 --> 02:09:09.630
<v Speaker 5>That's their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's their argument.</v>

2261
02:09:09.631 --> 02:09:12.990
<v Speaker 5>Basic argument just boils down to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What else can it be?</v>

2262
02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:16.650
<v Speaker 5>There is only this matters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A pastime matter.</v>

2263
02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:18.330
<v Speaker 5>Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing else.</v>

2264
02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:23.190
<v Speaker 5>If you started an assumption like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's sort closed as you completely,</v>

2265
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:28.350
<v Speaker 5>that's not freedom anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he will lose freedom because you're not </v>

2266
02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:31.881
<v Speaker 5>able to suspend your belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you suspend your belief system,</v>

2267
02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:35.190
<v Speaker 5>many other experiences immediately find </v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning,</v>

2268
02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:38.700
<v Speaker 5>but it has this kind of reciprocity </v>
<v Speaker 5>picked clothes,</v>

2269
02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:41.310
<v Speaker 5>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>intuition.</v>

2270
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:44.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a problem with the definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The word rational like you,</v>

2271
02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.080
<v Speaker 2>like you're being irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not being right,</v>

2272
02:09:47.110 --> 02:09:50.200
<v Speaker 2>have some rational thinking and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalizing,</v>

2273
02:09:50.201 --> 02:09:53.770
<v Speaker 2>which is a negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange,</v>

2274
02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:55.970
<v Speaker 2>but if the idea of taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it</v>

2275
02:09:55.970 --> 02:09:58.140
<v Speaker 5>too far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when is that rasterized?</v>

2276
02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:03.160
<v Speaker 5>WhaT we are really saying is that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>are using restful thinking to where it </v>

2277
02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:05.150
<v Speaker 5>does not belong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's rationalizing.</v>

2278
02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:09.140
<v Speaker 5>We'd asked analyze the way where </v>
<v Speaker 5>intuition belongs to rationalize the way</v>

2279
02:10:09.141 --> 02:10:11.560
<v Speaker 5>her emotions belong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in Australia,</v>

2280
02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.600
<v Speaker 5>the new science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new science does it admits it's the </v>

2281
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.400
<v Speaker 5>science of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just a sensory experience.</v>

2282
02:10:19.401 --> 02:10:24.401
<v Speaker 5>That material is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll agree with a new science says that </v>

2283
02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.440
<v Speaker 5>our emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our thinking and already intuition.</v>

2284
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:35.320
<v Speaker 5>All three are valid ways of knowing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>audition to sensitive.</v>

2285
02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:40.130
<v Speaker 5>So we have four valid ways of knowing </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical,</v>

2286
02:10:40.131 --> 02:10:42.080
<v Speaker 5>vital,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mental and super mental,</v>

2287
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:47.081
<v Speaker 5>deep intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when we imply all four ways of </v>

2288
02:10:47.081 --> 02:10:51.341
<v Speaker 5>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we go beyond it as not being </v>

2289
02:10:51.341 --> 02:10:53.840
<v Speaker 5>international being we go only the </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical way of knowing and the mental </v>

2290
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:56.780
<v Speaker 5>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 5>logical way of knowing.</v>

2291
02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Michael shermer has a great point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great quote,</v>

2292
02:10:59.961 --> 02:11:04.961
<v Speaker 1>rather than the only thing smart people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are better at rationalizing their dumb </v>

2293
02:11:04.961 --> 02:11:06.730
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

2294
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a very funny thing when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to certain,</v>

2295
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:11.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain focuses,</v>

2296
02:11:11.091 --> 02:11:14.570
<v Speaker 1>certain things people do rationalize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2297
02:11:14.571 --> 02:11:18.230
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a environmental disasters </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

2298
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:22.700
<v Speaker 1>doing things in other countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unethical or immoral,</v>

2299
02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2300
02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to rationalize and </v>

2301
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:29.740
<v Speaker 1>especially the ability to rationalize on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large scale like as a corporation is a</v>

2302
02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.940
<v Speaker 1>key problem with the civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2303
02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:33.760
<v Speaker 5>Keep prompting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep problem,</v>

2304
02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:39.180
<v Speaker 5>and how to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a whole method of getting out of </v>

2305
02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:39.180
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do we do it?</v>

2306
02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:41.230
<v Speaker 5>I call it spiritual economics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This same idea,</v>

2307
02:11:41.231 --> 02:11:43.660
<v Speaker 5>like the earlier story that I told you </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2308
02:11:43.661 --> 02:11:47.710
<v Speaker 5>he found the wise person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was that idea,</v>

2309
02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:52.920
<v Speaker 5>if we feed people these spiritual stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>as consumer good,</v>

2310
02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.720
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suppose you could go out in the market </v>

2311
02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.261
<v Speaker 5>and buy happiness in the company of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sage was very being makes you happy.</v>

2312
02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:04.120
<v Speaker 5>I've met such people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are at,</v>

2313
02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:05.410
<v Speaker 5>what do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean?</v>

2314
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Does that make you happy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>

2315
02:12:06.650 --> 02:12:11.650
<v Speaker 5>you can lead them a little bit difficult</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they don't appear in every the </v>

2316
02:12:12.010 --> 02:12:13.850
<v Speaker 5>marketplace and not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2317
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.230
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2318
02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:19.280
<v Speaker 5>not like steven greer's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we could manufacture these people.</v>

2319
02:12:19.901 --> 02:12:24.901
<v Speaker 5>I think We now have the key.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know about creativity so much today </v>

2320
02:12:24.901 --> 02:12:29.520
<v Speaker 5>that deep people are investing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we really can inspire a lot of </v>

2321
02:12:33.191 --> 02:12:38.191
<v Speaker 5>very capable people in a lifestyle which</v>
<v Speaker 5>will generate happy.</v>

2322
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Well let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing because this is not </v>

2323
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:46.811
<v Speaker 1>something we ever set out to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When brian and I started this podcast </v>

2324
02:12:46.811 --> 02:12:48.050
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just on a laptop in my office and</v>

2325
02:12:48.051 --> 02:12:50.960
<v Speaker 1>we were just trying to have some fun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just doing it just to be silly.</v>

2326
02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>We had done previous things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>webcasts where we had done them in hotel</v>

2327
02:12:56.301 --> 02:12:59.090
<v Speaker 1>rooms and you know when we were on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road doing stand up,</v>

2328
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>but over the course of three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's happened is </v>

2329
02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>people have told us that what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten in this podcast and this </v>

2330
02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>communication is they've gotten an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to interact or at least here </v>

2331
02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.490
<v Speaker 1>people interact that are like no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>

2332
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:17.260
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2333
02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.400
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're changing the way they think </v>

2334
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.281
<v Speaker 1>about life there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're seeing that there's other ways </v>

2335
02:13:24.281 --> 02:13:27.581
<v Speaker 1>to look at things and in fact a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your reality is shaped by the way you </v>

2336
02:13:27.581 --> 02:13:31.040
<v Speaker 1>choose to view the world and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can morph that and change that.</v>

2337
02:13:31.050 --> 02:13:33.450
<v Speaker 1>In this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2338
02:13:33.451 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>we're not taking credit for it because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know it was going to happen,</v>

2339
02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:39.360
<v Speaker 1>has had an amazingly profound effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on people.</v>

2340
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I've talked to literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of people that say the podcast </v>

2341
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>changed their life and that once they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started listening,</v>

2342
02:13:45.781 --> 02:13:48.120
<v Speaker 1>they started eating healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exercising.</v>

2343
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:50.400
<v Speaker 1>They feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think about things better.</v>

2344
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:55.401
<v Speaker 1>They try not to be a shitty person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to be positive and they </v>

2345
02:13:55.401 --> 02:13:58.050
<v Speaker 1>understand and feel the effect of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive thinking.</v>

2346
02:13:58.100 --> 02:13:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2347
02:13:58.750 --> 02:14:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2348
02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:05.900
<v Speaker 1>we're not taking credit for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that just happened on </v>

2349
02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:05.900
<v Speaker 1>its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

2350
02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:09.650
<v Speaker 1>is it a side effect of allowing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your life and into your way of </v>

2351
02:14:09.650 --> 02:14:09.960
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

2352
02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:13.840
<v Speaker 5>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that openness that says that.</v>

2353
02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:14.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2354
02:14:14.371 --> 02:14:16.050
<v Speaker 5>we have this avid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2355
02:14:16.110 --> 02:14:21.110
<v Speaker 5>and let's open it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though it's only for a couple of </v>

2356
02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:21.870
<v Speaker 5>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Switch to is that I should really make a</v>

2357
02:14:21.871 --> 02:14:24.570
<v Speaker 5>call to my wife because I told her five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five.</v>

2358
02:14:24.650 --> 02:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we're going to wrap this thing up </v>

2359
02:14:29.650 --> 02:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 5:30.</v>

2360
02:14:29.650 --> 02:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to wear you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2361
02:14:29.650 --> 02:14:31.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a beautiful conversation.</v>

2362
02:14:31.281 --> 02:14:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2363
02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you're a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really,</v>

2364
02:14:34.641 --> 02:14:39.641
<v Speaker 1>really interesting and intelligent guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to follow a lot of what </v>

2365
02:14:39.641 --> 02:14:39.641
<v Speaker 1>you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A two.</v>

2366
02:14:39.641 --> 02:14:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this podcast.</v>

2367
02:14:41.991 --> 02:14:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Three or four times.</v>

2368
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:44.560
<v Speaker 5>I think you did good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

2369
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:49.930
<v Speaker 5>How,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the things are actually depends a </v>

2370
02:14:50.361 --> 02:14:55.361
<v Speaker 5>lot on the language we use and it is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that we have a habit of using </v>

2371
02:14:55.490 --> 02:15:00.490
<v Speaker 5>languages like mind and consciousness in</v>
<v Speaker 5>an anonymous way that science cannot be </v>

2372
02:15:01.701 --> 02:15:04.550
<v Speaker 5>done that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens then is we don't understand</v>

2373
02:15:04.551 --> 02:15:09.551
<v Speaker 5>each other anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here you are not so much conversant </v>

2374
02:15:09.551 --> 02:15:13.971
<v Speaker 5>with the new science vocabulary anD here</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am without teaching you any recovery.</v>

2375
02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:19.380
<v Speaker 5>Just get right into the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we had a discipline and some words.</v>

2376
02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it was a dissonance </v>

2377
02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 1>quite honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2378
02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:25.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to really,</v>

2379
02:15:25.190 --> 02:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ex.</v>

2380
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to play the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that is listening to this for the</v>

2381
02:15:31.301 --> 02:15:33.850
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware of these concepts of I'm aware</v>

2382
02:15:33.851 --> 02:15:36.400
<v Speaker 1>of your work and I really do appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 1>you coming on the podcast,</v>

2383
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

2384
02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:43.080
<v Speaker 1>even for someone like me who's read at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least a half a dozen books on this </v>

2385
02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:43.990
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to wrap your head around.</v>

2386
02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:47.500
<v Speaker 5>It is hard and it is also simple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2387
02:15:47.530 --> 02:15:52.530
<v Speaker 5>I often say that quantum physics is </v>
<v Speaker 5>simpler than newtonian physics because </v>

2388
02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:56.351
<v Speaker 5>newtonian physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got very quickly the idea that </v>

2389
02:15:56.351 --> 02:15:57.560
<v Speaker 5>science can solve everything and in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2390
02:15:57.561 --> 02:15:58.100
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2391
02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:03.160
<v Speaker 5>in quantum physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the choices brought into for it </v>

2392
02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:05.790
<v Speaker 5>from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>ImmeDiately start relating that,</v>

2393
02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:07.330
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know about choice.</v>

2394
02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:12.340
<v Speaker 5>I know about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is sciences giving us this stuff </v>

2395
02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:16.420
<v Speaker 5>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mine mellows out a little and science </v>

2396
02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:16.420
<v Speaker 5>become more humanistic.</v>

2397
02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:17.980
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I wanted to ask you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>ken.</v>

2398
02:16:18.070 --> 02:16:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you go without this.</v>

2399
02:16:19.390 --> 02:16:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you familiar with Dr.</v>

2400
02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:22.990
<v Speaker 1>James Gates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2401
02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:28.200
<v Speaker 1>he's a theoretical physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor of physics at the </v>

2402
02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:31.900
<v Speaker 1>university of Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with another guy named john.</v>

2403
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:35.890
<v Speaker 1>He's the john toll professor of physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the university of Maryland.</v>

2404
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:41.160
<v Speaker 1>He found self-correcting computer code </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the equations of string theory.</v>

2405
02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've,</v>

2406
02:16:44.390 --> 02:16:48.220
<v Speaker 1>if you've heard about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really interesting,</v>

2407
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:53.790
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard to follow conversation that </v>

2408
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:56.560
<v Speaker 1>he had with neil degrasse tyson who </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had on the show.</v>

2409
02:16:56.561 --> 02:17:01.561
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to neil about it and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to wrap his head around </v>

2410
02:17:01.561 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this meant,</v>

2411
02:17:02.530 --> 02:17:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but they found double and even self dual</v>
<v Speaker 1>linear,</v>

2412
02:17:06.730 --> 02:17:11.730
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubly even self dual linear binary code</v>

2413
02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:17.220
<v Speaker 1>error correcting block quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was first invented by claude </v>

2414
02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:21.751
<v Speaker 1>shannon in the 19 forties has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered and embedded within the </v>

2415
02:17:21.751 --> 02:17:22.630
<v Speaker 1>equations of superstring theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're laughing at this.</v>

2416
02:17:22.631 --> 02:17:24.240
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you.</v>

2417
02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:27.170
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm laughing because here we are talking</v>

2418
02:17:27.171 --> 02:17:29.920
<v Speaker 5>mainly about quantum physics and </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness sedentary.</v>

2419
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:34.250
<v Speaker 5>You go into such a sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion of something that is remotely</v>

2420
02:17:34.251 --> 02:17:35.930
<v Speaker 5>connected with quantum physics of </v>
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>

2421
02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:38.960
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2422
02:17:39.350 --> 02:17:41.750
<v Speaker 5>it could very well be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you something,</v>

2423
02:17:41.850 --> 02:17:46.460
<v Speaker 5>they lost interest in such details.</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is fairly simple.</v>

2424
02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:52.180
<v Speaker 5>String theory is a good example of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that people propose when they </v>

2425
02:17:52.641 --> 02:17:57.641
<v Speaker 5>say the word pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pseudoscience field of sciences that </v>

2426
02:17:57.641 --> 02:18:01.210
<v Speaker 5>were theory and experiment are both not </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical aspects.</v>

2427
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:06.490
<v Speaker 5>It's just to re.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a good example of just theory </v>

2428
02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:08.900
<v Speaker 5>because string theory can never be very </v>
<v Speaker 5>far in our experience.</v>

2429
02:18:08.930 --> 02:18:13.930
<v Speaker 5>We just cannot do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's talking about too high and energy </v>

2430
02:18:13.930 --> 02:18:17.930
<v Speaker 5>that we cannot simulate in the quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the laboratory,</v>

2431
02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:22.340
<v Speaker 5>nor in the high energy cosmology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in other words,</v>

2432
02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:24.200
<v Speaker 5>it's really a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2433
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.830
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2434
02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:26.120
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very far out.</v>

2435
02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:31.250
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here we are at once the rational culture</v>

2436
02:18:31.251 --> 02:18:36.251
<v Speaker 5>that we call scientific materialism </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's intended date to talk about a </v>

2437
02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:42.160
<v Speaker 5>string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is highly abstract mathematical </v>

2438
02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.970
<v Speaker 5>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that they're not interesting as a </v>

2439
02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:44.970
<v Speaker 5>mind game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly interesting.</v>

2440
02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:49.190
<v Speaker 5>And then they'll object things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>telepathy,</v>

2441
02:18:49.191 --> 02:18:54.110
<v Speaker 5>which is very much human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where the objection of course is that it</v>

2442
02:18:54.111 --> 02:18:59.111
<v Speaker 5>may not be quiet our proper science </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there may not be in a good </v>

2443
02:18:59.111 --> 02:19:00.500
<v Speaker 5>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There may not be any good data.</v>

2444
02:19:01.130 --> 02:19:02.810
<v Speaker 5>so it was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

2445
02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.350
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do because it has mathematics in it.</v>

2446
02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:09.950
<v Speaker 5>We call science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which cannot be ever be verified.</v>

2447
02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.440
<v Speaker 5>Quite doable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>science</v>

2448
02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.980
<v Speaker 1>be science if it's not verified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it yet it's mathematic.</v>

2449
02:19:16.010 --> 02:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>If it's math,</v>

2450
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:20.690
<v Speaker 5>I agree you agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but say this is what puzzles me,</v>

2451
02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:25.700
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the culture is so obtuse that they </v>

2452
02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:26.450
<v Speaker 5>don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will never collect.</v>

2453
02:19:27.430 --> 02:19:29.600
<v Speaker 5>There are many concepts like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2454
02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:32.870
<v Speaker 5>which because of that mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature,</v>

2455
02:19:33.350 --> 02:19:37.790
<v Speaker 5>they're accepted part of science because</v>
<v Speaker 5>their mathematical,</v>

2456
02:19:37.850 --> 02:19:41.360
<v Speaker 5>because mathematics is so vital,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just felt</v>

2457
02:19:41.710 --> 02:19:46.710
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not interested in this because </v>

2458
02:19:46.710 --> 02:19:48.721
<v Speaker 1>there's literally no way to know whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's correct or whether it's just </v>

2459
02:19:48.721 --> 02:19:48.721
<v Speaker 1>daydreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2460
02:19:48.721 --> 02:19:49.860
<v Speaker 1>So I have a crazy way to make a living</v>

2461
02:19:50.770 --> 02:19:53.640
<v Speaker 5>vaguely interested because the one thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is something good,</v>

2462
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:58.670
<v Speaker 5>very good about theory because it does </v>
<v Speaker 5>enable us to connect gravity to quantum </v>

2463
02:19:59.130 --> 02:20:03.090
<v Speaker 5>physics and that that problem is not to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be underestimated,</v>

2464
02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:08.480
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want the solution to come in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the form of a theory that can never be </v>

2465
02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:08.490
<v Speaker 5>very far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2466
02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:12.510
<v Speaker 5>So people should recognize that science </v>
<v Speaker 5>has two prongs.</v>

2467
02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:13.840
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my judgment,</v>

2468
02:20:13.841 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 5>tree theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>edification,</v>

2469
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:19.080
<v Speaker 5>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then technology,</v>

2470
02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:24.840
<v Speaker 5>there's never going to be any </v>
<v Speaker 5>technological application of something </v>

2471
02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:25.620
<v Speaker 5>like string theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never,</v>

2472
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:29.160
<v Speaker 5>never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>IT's just too abstract.</v>

2473
02:20:29.610 --> 02:20:34.610
<v Speaker 5>Taking place in places that are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>remote from the human experience that </v>

2474
02:20:37.350 --> 02:20:42.350
<v Speaker 5>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technological breakthroughs on the face </v>

2475
02:20:42.350 --> 02:20:42.840
<v Speaker 5>of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2476
02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:47.900
<v Speaker 5>at least for high energy physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could always give it technological </v>

2477
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:50.700
<v Speaker 5>justifications for in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>weapons technology.</v>

2478
02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:56.240
<v Speaker 5>Not particularly good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why technology at least is that </v>

2479
02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:56.730
<v Speaker 5>feasible offshoot of high energy </v>
<v Speaker 5>physics,</v>

2480
02:20:57.270 --> 02:21:00.740
<v Speaker 5>but these kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2481
02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:01.240
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2482
02:21:01.530 --> 02:21:06.530
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just been too far from my for my </v>

2483
02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:09.831
<v Speaker 5>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should concentrate instead of </v>

2484
02:21:09.831 --> 02:21:10.980
<v Speaker 5>problems which can immediately be </v>
<v Speaker 5>addressed,</v>

2485
02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:14.550
<v Speaker 5>problems that has impact on who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we are,</v>

2486
02:21:14.551 --> 02:21:19.551
<v Speaker 5>what we are doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give us answers to real life questions </v>

2487
02:21:19.551 --> 02:21:20.940
<v Speaker 5>like how to run our life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to run our society,</v>

2488
02:21:20.941 --> 02:21:25.650
<v Speaker 5>how to run our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we have designs at hand.</v>

2489
02:21:25.651 --> 02:21:27.540
<v Speaker 5>That's what the New science is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

2490
02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:33.260
<v Speaker 5>Instead we have too much emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that have not much to do with us.</v>

2491
02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:42.930
<v Speaker 5>The human condition superstring theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like super string theory.</v>

2492
02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2493
02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm glad that you couldn't </v>

2494
02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:49.770
<v Speaker 1>understand it either or that it can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood or that it leads to camp</v>

2495
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:52.420
<v Speaker 5>verify,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't need to be.</v>

2496
02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:55.480
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't need to be understood because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can be very far.</v>

2497
02:21:55.930 --> 02:21:59.080
<v Speaker 5>That's my simple proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who needs to understand things,</v>

2498
02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:04.110
<v Speaker 5>clutter up your rein up for things which</v>
<v Speaker 5>has no consequence in my life,</v>

2499
02:22:04.450 --> 02:22:07.000
<v Speaker 5>and cannot even be very fair and can </v>
<v Speaker 5>never be built.</v>

2500
02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:09.860
<v Speaker 5>Never give rise to any technology that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>can relate.</v>

2501
02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>There's so much crazy shit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on.</v>

2502
02:22:12.341 --> 02:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That is actually real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right on.</v>

2503
02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been an honor to talk to you.</v>

2504
02:22:16.511 --> 02:22:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly appreciate it.</v>

2505
02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could people with.</v>

2506
02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:24.480
<v Speaker 1>What books do you have out that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend that people could pick up to </v>

2507
02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>learn more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about some of your</v>

2508
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:30.980
<v Speaker 3>work when they basic quantum physics </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff is best done in a book called the </v>

2509
02:22:31.390 --> 02:22:33.650
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is not dead is another one.</v>

2510
02:22:33.730 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 3>God is not dead is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how quantum activism concepts </v>

2511
02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:41.910
<v Speaker 3>civilization has some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of this theory to society.</v>

2512
02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:44.010
<v Speaker 1>do you have a twitter page?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2513
02:22:44.050 --> 02:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>of course you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2514
02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

2515
02:22:50.380 --> 02:22:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Go swami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you're funny on twitter here.</v>

2516
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:58.580
<v Speaker 1>So I could send people to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2517
02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2518
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:02.270
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not you.</v>

2519
02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:07.340
<v Speaker 1>It was some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude is laid here is love but innocent </v>

2520
02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:07.760
<v Speaker 1>here is knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But creative,</v>

2521
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:09.210
<v Speaker 1>here's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not you.</v>

2522
02:23:09.211 --> 02:23:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's whack.</v>

2523
02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't write something that whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that guy catches me?</v>

2524
02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that you will find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

2525
02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what your twitter name is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what it is and no to </v>

2526
02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:26.360
<v Speaker 1>someone else do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2527
02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

2528
02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:31.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of young there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

2529
02:23:31.251 --> 02:23:35.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of goswamis a shorten via </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole lot.</v>

2530
02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:41.140
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different ones on </v>

2531
02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:41.140
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belieVe it or not.</v>

2532
02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:42.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably got a lot of fakers.</v>

2533
02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:44.250
<v Speaker 1>There's dudes who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2534
02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.920
<v Speaker 1>what did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2535
02:23:45.921 --> 02:23:48.170
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fakers out there.</v>

2536
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2537
02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:52.920
<v Speaker 6>Can I ask a quick question on the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on you said earlier in the podcast that,</v>

2538
02:23:52.921 --> 02:23:55.530
<v Speaker 6>you know now because of lasers and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

2539
02:23:55.531 --> 02:24:00.531
<v Speaker 6>you can measure particles a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 6>accurately and that's how you found </v>

2540
02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:00.810
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2541
02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:03.360
<v Speaker 6>particles actually are moving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you,</v>

2542
02:24:03.361 --> 02:24:05.990
<v Speaker 6>is the laser itself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2543
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:09.150
<v Speaker 6>is that an accurate tool?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has that been proven to be 100 percent?</v>

2544
02:24:09.151 --> 02:24:10.740
<v Speaker 6>Because what if it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2545
02:24:10.741 --> 02:24:12.750
<v Speaker 6>the laser saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then down,</v>

2546
02:24:12.751 --> 02:24:14.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 years from now you find out,</v>

2547
02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:15.360
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just the laser.</v>

2548
02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:15.980
<v Speaker 3>NO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2549
02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:18.590
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no measurement of distance.</v>

2550
02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:23.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'm part of macro object like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about tables and chairs at</v>

2551
02:24:24.531 --> 02:24:28.370
<v Speaker 3>that time in between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at my looking.</v>

2552
02:24:28.430 --> 02:24:33.430
<v Speaker 3>They moved so very little and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to observe with just ordinary way </v>

2553
02:24:34.251 --> 02:24:36.770
<v Speaker 3>that we measured like triangulating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

2554
02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:41.740
<v Speaker 3>But with the laser beam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because lasers traveling fairly,</v>

2555
02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:45.810
<v Speaker 3>very close to a straight line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the diffraction effect is actually gone.</v>

2556
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Very good straight lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So triangulation becomes very accurate </v>

2557
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:54.710
<v Speaker 3>because you really can go a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance and even that small of a,</v>

2558
02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>even that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even that small measurement do contract </v>

2559
02:24:59.840 --> 02:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>for measuring.</v>

2560

<v Speaker 1>I found you on twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a video and it was like staged.</v>

2644
02:28:48.011 --> 02:28:52.961
