00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:04.950

<v Speaker 1>they see the,</v>

7
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems is you're a cop.</v>

8
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of shit.</v>

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you lose your patients and you,</v>

00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:13.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:13.681
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

15
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

16
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you become more attuned to the kinds of the world then you would like to be and</v>

17
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hear any fucking bullshit anymore.</v>

18
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>So very,</v>

19
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>very fucking tricky job.</v>

20
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:23.641
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

21
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>my pain.</v>

22
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Your humanity.</v>

23
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>My question is this,</v>

24
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>now you're always seeing the worst in people being did I know that there are</v>

25
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>people out there who really do risk their lives.</v>

26
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone's house is getting robbed or,</v>

27
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:35.560
<v Speaker 1>how about this guy?</v>

29
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.151
<v Speaker 1>The fucking,</v>

30
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>this guy in Denver,</v>

31
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.321
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

32
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:37.681
<v Speaker 1>they had it.</v>

33
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Someone had to go in there and stop him.</v>

34
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>

36
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>this isn't something that you,</v>

37
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:41.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>the community can just rally together.</v>

39
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>No one had guns.</v>

40
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>But my question is the,</v>

41
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>the police that break the law,</v>

42
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>should they be held more accountable because they know the law that much better?</v>

43
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.341
<v Speaker 1>Like in other words,</v>

44
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>if you had killed somebody to ever or should you get time</v>

45
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.591
<v Speaker 1>minimize?</v>

46
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.041
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

47
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a case in in New York where a guy,</v>

48
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>he got like a a year of probation or something or was it a year in one year in</v>

49
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>jail is because he killed a guy while he was drunk driving and he's,</v>

50
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>he's his family is apparently connected with the NYP ds.</v>

51
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>This is my question though.</v>

52
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>If if you're a caption should be held accountable to the law even more so</v>

53
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>because you knew it was wrong to be drunk and driving.</v>

54
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>You arrested people probably a hundred times for doing the same thing.</v>

55
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that it's ever been shown that to put people in a situation</v>

56
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>where it's whatever they're doing that's wrong has more of a consequence.</v>

57
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's ever been shown to them.</v>

58
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>It have any effect on their actions.</v>

59
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I think people do shit cause they think they're going to get away with it.</v>

60
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>They don't do shit because they measure the consequences and go,</v>

61
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

62
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I might do a year in jail.</v>

63
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.731
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it,</v>

64
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>let's ride.</v>

65
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't do it like that there.</v>

66
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.331
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

67
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>it's more of an impulsive sort of a thing when,</v>

68
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>when people make mistakes,</v>

69
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.991
<v Speaker 1>but if people know,</v>

70
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.824
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

71
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that I'm really going to catch it that much heat for this because</v>

72
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is,</v>

73
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>If I'm drunk and somebody pulls me over and we both play for the same team,</v>

75
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bring me in.</v>

76
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's going to happen in you after that?</v>

77
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>What's really crazy is how many cops turned out to be corrupt back in the days</v>

78
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.634
<v Speaker 1>before the Internet.</v>

79
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

80
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very difficult to be corrupt today,</v>

81
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but I think back in the day it was probably pretty fucking easy.</v>

82
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I miss,</v>

83
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's slightly less difficult to be corrupt.</v>

84
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:24.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I think you can if,</v>

86
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>if there's money in it for you,</v>

87
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's levels of corruption,</v>

89
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>there's harmful levels,</v>

90
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>and then there's simple stuff like,</v>

91
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.294
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

92
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.261
<v Speaker 1>I'll fix it.</v>

93
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Tickets for you.</v>

94
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.084
<v Speaker 1>we're good friends.</v>

96
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.201
<v Speaker 1>That's corruption.</v>

97
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it's,</v>

98
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

99
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.991
<v Speaker 1>Those kids are dying.</v>

100
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Someone shouldn't have the ability to do that and they say,</v>

101
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

102
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you're connected with me.</v>

103
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the card when you have a problem,</v>

104
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>you call me and I'd take care of it.</v>

105
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I know people that benefit from that.</v>

106
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I know people that had been in situations where they may not be 100% right and</v>

107
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:59.421
<v Speaker 1>they have a specific card or something like that and I'm not denigrating thing.</v>

108
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that at some point,</v>

109
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>are you more responsible for your corruption because you know the law 10 times</v>

111
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>better and you're enforcing it and forcing it.</v>

112
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.641
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

113
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:14.641
<v Speaker 1>if you get caught for murder and then you're off all of a sudden in five years,</v>

114
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>that's only because you knew the law better and then you still broke it.</v>

115
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>he was selling drugs to pick.</v>

117
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.981
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

118
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can,</v>

119
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you make people more responsive when you going to change.</v>

120
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.911
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

121
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Might make people feel better because you're punishing them more,</v>

122
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you're necessarily going to change behavior by offering a</v>

123
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>bigger consequence.</v>

124
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way to change behaviors to change thinking,</v>

125
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>and what I try to tell people is it sounds ridiculous,</v>

126
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>but this is something that came to me on a boat once,</v>

127
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>is that you got to treat everybody as if it's you living in another life.</v>

128
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>We could all do that.</v>

129
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>We could all do that.</v>

130
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.680
<v Speaker 1>If we could all picture ev,</v>

131
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>any person,</v>

132
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what the fuck they're going through in your life,</v>

133
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>think about what it would be like to live that person's life from birth to death</v>

134
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>with their situation,</v>

135
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>their economic situation,</v>

136
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>their biological situation there,</v>

137
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>their life experiences.</v>

138
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Would you be any different than that person?</v>

139
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>If you were that man,</v>

140
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>if you were that woman,</v>

141
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>would you be any different?</v>

142
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Are you them?</v>

143
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

144
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>if that person was born you,</v>

145
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>would they be you?</v>

146
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And Are we all the same like that?</v>

147
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And is that what life really is all about is figuring out that each one of us is</v>

148
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same.</v>

149
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>We're just living through at different biological circumstance.</v>

150
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>And the more you can treat everyone you meet,</v>

151
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>like there,</v>

152
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>you living another life,</v>

153
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the happier you'll be.</v>

154
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way we're ever going to sort this thing out is everyone has</v>

155
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>to do things based on that ideal everyone had,</v>

156
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>whether it's business or personal shit.</v>

157
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.271
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you do,</v>

158
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you always have to think that this person that you're dealing with is you living</v>

159
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>another life and you can't let them boss you around.</v>

160
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Can't let them talk shit to you.</v>

161
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Can't let them fuck up your life.</v>

162
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>You know you do your best to keep them on track,</v>

163
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>but your ethic and your resolve and your,</v>

164
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>your intent should always be to treat them as if it was you living a whole</v>

165
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:03.694
<v Speaker 1>nother life.</v>

166
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
