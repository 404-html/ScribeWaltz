11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.100
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>This is workout music.</v>

15
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were saying you lost 31 pounds.</v>

16
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>31 may be picked up three over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>holidays.</v>

17
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

18
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

19
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Shouts out to Al Clayborne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>who's from out here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's a hell of a trainer?</v>

21
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>If I had his discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd already be a hundred pounds down,</v>

22
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>but the gold is a hundred and the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 months you can do it.</v>

23
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not 100% just eat bad and got lazy.</v>

24
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>

25
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could turn her.</v>

26
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could stick with it for 90 days,</v>

27
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it will become a part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the goal.</v>

28
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

29
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

30
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

31
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

32
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>cause I like meat so I still get to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I like green stuff and I don't</v>

33
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>like salad dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's going to be relatively</v>

34
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Like olive oil and vinegar does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste bad bro.</v>

36
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't even use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I have a salad,</v>

37
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>one wife make salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she literally will make the salad.</v>

38
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>She may add a little goat cheese or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll,</v>

39
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>she'll throw some chicken or some steak</v>
<v Speaker 1>on there.</v>

40
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>But if it's fruit in the salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need any salad dressing.</v>

41
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Just throw some strawberries and apples</v>
<v Speaker 1>or stuff to salting to just give me that</v>

42
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>strive juicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm good.</v>

43
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>If I could figure out during that three</v>
<v Speaker 1>to four times a day versus the one meal</v>

44
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>and with my wife and then he didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trash in the studio.</v>

45
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problems from the temptation</v>

46
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see burgers and fries.</v>

47
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

48
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>You see a Coca Cola?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really is it for me.</v>

50
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I had to quit sodas because the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

51
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings me to cripple cola.</v>

52
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is critical to bottles of it?</v>

53
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to keep it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frigerator.</v>

54
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to join it and it's perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>

55
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepsi Cola,</v>

56
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>rse color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything with Cola.</v>

57
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has probably killed more Americans than</v>

58
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>anything else in the world.</v>

59
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything that's color,</v>

60
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>cause Coca Cola was provided tons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs in my hometown.</v>

61
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I won't want to diss them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might promote a concert,</v>

62
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we know that sugary drinks aren't</v>

63
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

64
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yet we don't have an aversion to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't criminalize sugar.</v>

65
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And my doctor Larry told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>

66
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>sugar is poison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I want you to work it out of your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these kids that are members of these</v>

68
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>little punk ass street fraternity's</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially gangs we criminalize and</v>

69
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>villainize a bunch of teenagers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply don't have anything to do.</v>

70
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't have jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have skills,</v>

71
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>they don't have organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have police athletic league</v>

72
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>like they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have people engaging them in</v>

73
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>academics or sports where they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just kind of,</v>

74
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess off,</v>

75
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes fuck up in violence happens,</v>

76
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>If you could take those same kids with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entrepreneurial spirit that will</v>

78
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>sell your water on the side of a highway</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you add it to something to public</v>

79
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>already wants anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cola,</v>

80
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you create something like Cripple Colin</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and essentially what you're</v>

81
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>doing is creating the same sugary shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all go buy and drink and we</v>

82
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we're given the structure of say</v>

83
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>a hell's angels to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

84
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you could say were criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

85
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>but we still can sell your fucking tee</v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt because we are now paying our</v>

86
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're now employing people and we're</v>

87
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>were now doing what we're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

88
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I wanted to give the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift of my friends who are hurt,</v>

89
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>who are members of street fraternities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we actually pulled it off at the</v>

90
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys actually managed to bring</v>

91
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>something in microcosm to the market in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>

92
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>It did well enough for us to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue doing it.</v>

93
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And I want to see how far I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's in it?</v>

94
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

95
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>artificial for artificial arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

96
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:41.681
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food,</v>

97
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>color and flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

98
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's six ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total wheels,</v>

99
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever,</v>

100
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>do you know what Zevia is even fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cvs?</v>

101
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fake sugar and stuff you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>

102
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Zvm has a soft drinks that are made with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevia.</v>

103
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is like,</v>

104
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I found out when me was sugar is</v>

105
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>either just do it or don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for me it's easy to do things that</v>

106
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>are actually a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sugar,</v>

107
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>like a Mexican coke or just have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 1>some carbonated water and lemons in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do well with irritation.</v>

109
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>This cadillac in the hand job.</v>

110
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I want the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying,</v>

111
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but this stuff is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

112
00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who has adjusted Bieber?</v>

113
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:19.460
<v Speaker 1>He's did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just I am such an addict as shut</v>

114
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't make sense for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to tempt myself.</v>

116
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll do is trump water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

117
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of water now,</v>

146
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

147
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>talking to Ilan Musk on the show about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when he was,</v>

148
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to me about the thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are bouncing,</v>

149
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>bouncing around inside of his head that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't control,</v>

150
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>and then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been his whole life.</v>

151
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't want to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

152
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about it.</v>

153
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought I did something to cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking with mar and that was definitely</v>

154
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get an elan musk to fucking</v>

155
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>smoke is classic stoner history in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>making right there.</v>

156
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even see,</v>

157
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>the thing about it is if I had any idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

158
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 2>people would react to it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would just do that on a normal</v>

159
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's normal.</v>

160
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

161
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>It's legal or smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>

162
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.600
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a slick,</v>

163
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.240
<v Speaker 2>a comradery thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks,</v>

164
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's sharing space together.</v>

165
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a piece by week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

166
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the only things that you sip</v>
<v Speaker 2>off that another man's lips touched.</v>

167
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody does it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

168
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.090

<v Speaker 2>but we just don't admit to ourselves</v>

169
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>that there's another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

170
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 2>But that's like it's been washed.</v>

197
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.090

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.953
<v Speaker 2>I stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

199
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 2>he's been on a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy and a great human</v>

200
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.674
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

201
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy brought me a plate of his</v>

202
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:40.811
<v Speaker 2>grandma's food to the podcast studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how down home that dude is.</v>

203
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plate of food.</v>

204

<v Speaker 2>that's more of the stuff I'm saying</v>

206
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 2>people need to do instead of arguing</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and extreme do you need to get</v>

207
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 2>with people who don't look like you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not culturally a light and you need to</v>

208
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 2>allow them to do things like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that creates friendships,</v>

209
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 2>empathy and builds bridges instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean that is who he is.</v>

213
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:11.141
<v Speaker 2>He's got very strict ethics in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's essentially smart.</v>

214
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>He's like a soldier in terms of he how</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks and operates and takes care of</v>

<v Speaker 1>they've been on the Atlanta scene for</v>

295
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultivating young talent,</v>

00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>whether it was grip plies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest in peace.</v>

297

298
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

299
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.851
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

300
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>which was another group out of Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these kids were dope.</v>

301
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some worked out,</v>

302
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 1>some didn't on group dot grip died of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

303
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

304
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>to nine members went their separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

305
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 1>We still are making dope music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they found the kid in 21 that</v>

306
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 1>they managed to help get to the next by</v>
<v Speaker 1>toy and congrats to 21.</v>

00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 1>He had a number one album a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

308
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but management usually comes from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people who care and just just</v>

309
00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 1>want to see someone they're a fan of be</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated well in the industry.</v>

310
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 1>So I really applaud music managers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like you say,</v>

311
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.880
<v Speaker 1>placing your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own fate in your own hands.</v>

312
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing placing in the fate of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional addict,</v>

313
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.980
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of times the act can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>including myself.</v>

314
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the roller coaster ride.</v>

315
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This distress of other people performing</v>

316
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>is brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>willing to poke the Hornet's nest just</v>

350
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>to see how many of flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my two of my greatest heroes,</v>

351
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 1>when black people usually talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes,</v>

352
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:08.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about Martin,</v>

353
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elijah Muhammad,</v>

354
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Mario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcus Garvey it.</v>

355
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.610
<v Speaker 1>But two of my biggest heroes coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're Luther Campbell and Larry Flynt,</v>

356
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in my lifetime I saw Luther</v>

357
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Campbell and Larry Flynt fight the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government on behalf of the American</v>

358
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 1>people's right to say whatever they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to say.</v>

359
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my formative years,</v>

360
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I was learning to love the bill of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

361
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>the preamble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had to say its constitution,</v>

362
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.610
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance to see people fight for</v>

363
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>my right and I couldn't wait to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapper,</v>

364
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>just soccer curse and by my own titty</v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

365
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those people have shaped my life in</v>

366
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:50.710
<v Speaker 1>terms of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom and liberties as much as the</v>

367
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Thurgood Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:52.684
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as,</v>

369
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 1>as much as a Barbara Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as a,</v>

370
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 1>as a Shirley Chisholm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

371
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>who I am is needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:13:58.931 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

373
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember one of my friends saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

374
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact you're talking on social</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

375
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why do you always feel necessarily</v>

376
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.610
<v Speaker 1>talk about smoking Weed and Strip clubs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

377
00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I really do.</v>

378
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And I never want someone to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other side to say,</v>

379
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.190
<v Speaker 1>don't like this guy because he smokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

380
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Go to strip clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want whoever they say that to to say,</v>

381
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes with his wife and they</v>

382
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 1>smoked together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be some secret I</v>

383
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people to understand that when I</v>

384
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>want you to be free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to be free to agree to</v>

385
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>see the world the way I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be free to live as you</v>

386
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>would like to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long as it doesn't infringe on me and</v>

387
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's supposed to be what this is all</v>

388
00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.620
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this country's all about.</v>

390
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what Ms. Ellis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told them.</v>

391
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In high school.</v>

392
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Luther Campbell thing was so strange</v>

393
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>because it was at one area in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

394
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>where they had very strict brass</v>
<v Speaker 1>blasphemy laws.</v>

395
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've tried porn stars there before.</v>

396
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried some male porn star was doing</v>

397
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 1>really fucked up videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried him down there for,</v>

398
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 1>for obscenity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had him locked up.</v>

399
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

400
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very conservative and they just</v>

401
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>decided that the two live crew was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

402
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were drawn a line in the sand.</v>

403
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a crazy thing to do and</v>

<v Speaker 1>something's very popular.</v>

419
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Speaker 1>step out of line of social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your head on a stick is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't less about actually charging you</v>

<v Speaker 1>they were getting off the plane in my</v>

433
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:13.160
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

442
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 1>States constitution when in matters of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech because I got a chance</v>

443
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:41.880
<v Speaker 1>to see it fought for an exercised right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there before me as I was learning about</v>

444
00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an interesting that really</v>

445
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 1>what we're concerned with too is</v>
<v Speaker 1>visuals.</v>

446
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 1>We're not concerned with what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down,</v>

447
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>what we're concerned with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people say.</v>

448
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.370
<v Speaker 1>But we're not like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no one would get mad at up at that book.</v>

451
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It's something about them singing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people singing along to it.</v>

00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Would you have women gladly celebrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sexuality and bodies if it wasn't</v>

466
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>for her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She never gets the credit.</v>

467
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you think people know how extravagant</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was and her time?</v>

468
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I think she doesn't get the credit she</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves.</v>

469
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I think women know that it became safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to be sexually aggressive and</v>

470
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 1>free because of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women that you know were coming of</v>

471
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 1>age in our time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think in retrospect,</v>

472
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>because wraps young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only 45 46 years old.</v>

473
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's getting to the point</v>

474
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>where we appreciate what we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've accomplished.</v>

475
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So a little Kim is going to become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrated as the years go on her.</v>

476
00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Trina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Kaia choice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boss,</v>

478
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 1>like so many hip hop has been a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair game.</v>

479
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 1>The women are very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

480
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 1>whether people want to know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've always had to call her response</v>

482
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.330
<v Speaker 1>records in hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get on there and the baddest</v>

483
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker in the world and in a girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up behind you.</v>

484
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Nah Mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bad.</v>

485
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Or you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those records have been around forever.</v>

486
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've always promoted equality within</v>

487
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>because it made money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made sense.</v>

488
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 1>And women were the audience too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing that hip hop is</v>

489
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>really only 40 something years old when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really stop and think about that.</v>

490
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the primary sources of music</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

491
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about how many songs</v>

492
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:39.240
<v Speaker 1>are being published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many songs people are listening to</v>

493
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 1>and enjoying right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of those are rap?</v>

494
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking giant number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

495
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 1>If you could look at the whole country</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and just a little light goes</v>

496
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:49.930
<v Speaker 1>off when it's a rap song is playing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>woof.</v>

497
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to wheeler walker jr</v>
<v Speaker 1>willow Arkan says the rest of the</v>

498
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>country music is just biting rap and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and acting like they are so,</v>

499
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 1>well I think it was a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

500
00:18:58.081 --> 00:19:02.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think at one point in time it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little that a lot of rappers would</v>

501
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>look at guys like waylon jennings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash and old school gangster</v>

502
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.180
<v Speaker 1>country guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlaw country is way different from</v>

503
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:09.630
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

504
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I love outlaw country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell me Waylon Jennings,</v>

505
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Kris Kristofferson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willie Nelson,</v>

506
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash are kicking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what the fuck is that?</v>

507
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

508
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:20.750
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the same as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>allocating and Nellie beat to your songs</v>

509
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and talking about cowboy boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And said air force ones not the same.</v>

510
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:26.690
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the almond</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers midnight rider and you know,</v>

511
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.850
<v Speaker 1>whipping pulse that's radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than you just singing about</v>

512
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 1>your Ford and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

513
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and rafting on dates with your chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

514
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people even understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>tied to the whipping posts.</v>

515
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't fake that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they came at me about the NRA</v>

516
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 1>interview last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day I smoked a joint,</v>

517
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:50.190
<v Speaker 1>woke up and laughed and listened to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>record like every single day.</v>

518
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted you guys to know it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>bother me any.</v>

519
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 1>My wife just told me to shut up talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you all.</v>

520
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>We went shooting a lot more and we play</v>
<v Speaker 1>almond brothers whipping posts every</v>

521
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:02.280
<v Speaker 1>morning because I had to remind myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is normal,</v>

522
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that you are being done like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly because you are disagreeing</v>

523
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:09.450
<v Speaker 1>with the system that people have agreed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that you don't agree to.</v>

524
00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's okay not to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the harmon brothers really got me</v>

525
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 1>through that segment and stopped me from</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching a lot of bourgeoisie black</v>

526
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>people in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

527
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you're a proponent of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your right to carry a gun.</v>

528
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a lover of 19 states</v>

529
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>constitution as a whole of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

530
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>of all our rights in amendments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in particular,</v>

531
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first and second amendment rights</v>

532
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>matter to me as an African American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an and as an American first foremost</v>

533
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>as an African American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been free 55 years.</v>

534
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 1>My parents were born and apartheid.</v>

535
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.560
<v Speaker 1>And as an American we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a country that broke off from</v>

536
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 1>what we felt like with the tyranny of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy.</v>

537
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 1>And we did that because farmers and guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>dare to wage guerrilla warfare against,</v>

538
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.900
<v Speaker 1>at that time when the largest armies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>navies in the world.</v>

539
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>So I honor that by continuing to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the host farmers,</v>

540
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

541
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 1>in the continuance of crispus attucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person to die in American</v>

542
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>revolution was a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

543
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would dishonor those patriots who</v>

544
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 1>started this country and Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>attics.</v>

545
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I would dishonor the lineage is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>African American who was only 55 years</v>

546
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 1>in the freedom by giving government more</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun patch.</v>

547
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I just not something I believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>government is people pro.</v>

548
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem with giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>government anything is that they're just</v>

549
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

550
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 1>They're not something special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not flawless.</v>

551
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely give People Power over you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>theirs.</v>

552
00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 1>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not saying we should</v>

553
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 1>stockpile guns and point them at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

554
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.880
<v Speaker 1>but if people have guns it's way harder</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just take over.</v>

555
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Sees a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

556
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit happens all the time.</v>

557
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And other countries APP does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

558
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>People get occupied and governments turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and governments changed the</v>

559
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>rules and put places that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies are no longer so absolutely.</v>

560
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 1>That's real and we're never far from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it safe as you feel?</v>

561
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 1>You're never far from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what we need more of is</v>

562
00:21:57.131 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 1>people like you that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are a reasonable,</v>

563
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:06.090
<v Speaker 1>very educated in the matter of very</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate person who comes from a place</v>

564
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 1>where they don't expect that argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

565
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

566
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you think about left wing people</v>

567
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 1>are Democratic People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive people.</v>

568
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 1>You'll always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

569
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you think about democratic people</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly being appreciated by the</v>

570
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>black community and you always associate</v>
<v Speaker 1>them with being anti gun.</v>

571
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common thing.</v>

572
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>So when a guy like you steps out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

573
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:25.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

574
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a disservice to take this</v>

575
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:30.670
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

576
00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:33.130
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't support it and fight for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

577
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been an African American 40 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>something years now.</v>

578
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have known democrats primarily my</v>

579
00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 1>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the south in particular in</v>

580
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>

581
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never known a black male Democrat</v>

582
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 1>that was working class that did not own</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weapon.</v>

583
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to follow the examples of</v>

584
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to listen to the National</v>

585
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Party and their rhetoric about the arm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the population.</v>

586
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I think obviously we could agree that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would all love it if we never needed</v>

587
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

588
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

589
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

590
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Who wouldn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rather not need it than be prepared</v>

591
00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>though and not be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

592
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better to have it not to need it than</v>

593
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 1>they did not to have it and re part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country I'm from.</v>

594
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 1>And what you do often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm from a part of the country,</v>

595
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I grew up fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and growing food.</v>

596
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.090
<v Speaker 1>My sister grows food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get to as regularly now.</v>

597
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Still fish occasionally shouts out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg Street when our biggest tjx down</v>

598
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:24.130
<v Speaker 1>there and so great fisherman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

599
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.880
<v Speaker 1>But this is this normal in my part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country as not having straws and</v>

600
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.860
<v Speaker 1>being able to smoke in public in places</v>
<v Speaker 1>like La is it,</v>

601
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big of a deal.</v>

602
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:35.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

603
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my mind state a household should have</v>

605
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 1>five guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

606
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>You should have a revolver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a semiautomatic for a few and your wife</v>

607
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:44.200
<v Speaker 1>carrying out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

608
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:46.020
<v Speaker 1>in public you have a shot gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>

609
00:23:46.021 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>This is a great all around going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

610
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>whether it's burglars or vermin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:52.340
<v Speaker 1>and you should have bolt action rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some course case.</v>

612
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Got To kill your meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a semiautomatic rifle meant</v>

613
00:23:55.051 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>defend against here and there just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off on Sundays and show your</v>

615
00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:59.890
<v Speaker 1>homeboys who was Dick Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what should,</v>

616
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>what you should not do is give up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to own weapons or use them on</v>

617
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:06.790
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about using them on</v>

618
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>people is that it's so rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so horrific and so,</v>

619
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 1>so common for something that's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific and everybody's against it.</v>

620
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.320
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how you would ever</v>

621
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 1>buy taking guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

622
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to take all the guns away to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop that from happening,</v>

623
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 1>but how are you going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to do that?</v>

624
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Criminals are going to give him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

625
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was no way they'll,</v>

626
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regular people should probably not do</v>

627
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:29.871
<v Speaker 1>that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

628
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets squirrely.</v>

629
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to get those guns from</v>

630
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

631
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to joke.</v>

632
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Well we can do though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will say as an owner,</v>

633
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you get lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't train enough.</v>

634
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.720
<v Speaker 1>We should try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more.</v>

635
00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

636
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 1>go try to be the quickest draw and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice it,</v>

637
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.350
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you want to do is make sure you</v>

638
00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 1>know what you're doing with your weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you know how to clean your</v>

639
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you're not a story,</v>

640
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:55.370
<v Speaker 1>a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I took my son and my nephew and I'm</v>

641
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.140
<v Speaker 1>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to start taking my 11 year old</v>

642
00:24:57.141 --> 00:25:00.260
<v Speaker 1>girl Michael shooting because I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to know what they do if they see a</v>

643
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

644
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 1>So we've already went through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do if you're somewhere you</v>

645
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:04.600
<v Speaker 1>see a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do,</v>

646
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 1>how do you get out of that situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get other kids out of that situation and</v>

647
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>let an adult know all that comes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

648
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

649
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the strange thing to me is that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

650
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 1>when she was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually taught how to shoot a</v>

651
00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:18.111
<v Speaker 1>rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

652
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Because the NRA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is now vilified and hate it for</v>

653
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 1>four reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some deservedly sell,</v>

654
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>some not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to have big programs in public</v>

655
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 1>schools to make sure that children new</v>
<v Speaker 1>firearms safety,</v>

656
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.600
<v Speaker 1>so my mother's school and other schools</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefited from that.</v>

657
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if it was just that sheet</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paper that tells you the gun safety</v>

658
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 1>before you went and age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just a piece of propaganda they</v>

659
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was better for the overall public.</v>

660
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.760
<v Speaker 1>So I tend to say as Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten away from stuff like traits</v>

661
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten away from different options</v>

662
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>beside funneling our kids in the college</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt and we've also gotten away from</v>

663
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:51.440
<v Speaker 1>basic training such as balancing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>checkbook,</v>

664
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 1>a basic home economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how do you,</v>

665
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd make a Lasagna at home by herself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like gun gun,</v>

666
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.600
<v Speaker 1>gun shooting and archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if those things return to</v>

667
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 1>public school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a safer,</v>

668
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 1>more confident student body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a reduction on things like</v>

669
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:08.300
<v Speaker 1>bullying and in bullshit and you get an</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase on self-propel interest of</v>

670
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 1>children and you start to meet to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>it scholars than excel.</v>

671
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.890
<v Speaker 1>But do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really,</v>

672
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.870
<v Speaker 1>how was it going to stop bullying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by knowing that more kids know how</v>

673
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 1>to use guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guns don't stop bullying.</v>

674
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 1>No boxing class stops bullying pimps.</v>

675
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.900
<v Speaker 1>He said that no one wants to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody gonna fight back.</v>

676
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure martial arts,</v>

677
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know wrestling does it.</v>

678
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing you can do though is make</v>

679
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 1>people more aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initially you had a lot of people just</v>

680
00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:35.730
<v Speaker 1>getting into it and learn how to fight a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot to get that far.</v>

681
00:26:35.731 --> 00:26:38.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like blue belt mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you get with your homies</v>

682
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:39.160
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go with your homey.</v>

683
00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:41.180
<v Speaker 1>So you and your homies are just beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of each other and you're</v>

684
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:42.920
<v Speaker 1>not picking on a kid at lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

685
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willie Spearman.</v>

686
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I remember six credit.</v>

687
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.080
<v Speaker 1>The thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

688
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you'd get hurt each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a horrible video.</v>

689
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see I'm the one that,</v>

690
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are uh,</v>

691
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.260
<v Speaker 1>who put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

692
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.750
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a one of those fight breakdown</v>

693
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and my crew really,</v>

<v Speaker 1>circuit.</v>

745
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Fun Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great groupies bags of money,</v>

746
00:29:05.641 --> 00:29:06.474

<v Speaker 1>Now how do you guys start out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start out like is there a like a</v>

748
00:29:12.221 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 1>open mic night or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy wants to become a rapper,</v>

749
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>how do you get going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to get on stage?</v>

750
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm from the underground rap</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene and that I liked these cults rap.</v>

751
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I like battle rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type stuff coming up.</v>

752
00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So I was more out of the open mic scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to hang around the older guys in</v>

753
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 1>the cool guys and the drug dealers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can rap about treat stuff</v>

754
00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:30.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's your and you take like a t.</v>

755
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always interested,</v>

756
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 1>loved music and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But tip was a trap rapper from the</v>

757
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:35.221
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

758
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was entertaining for the streets so</v>

759
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't need to go to fucking open</v>

760
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 1>mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just needed to be opened up on a mic</v>

761
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 1>and then allowed the greater public.</v>

762
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>The hearing I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

763
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I talk about him and I mean big boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there are two of my best friends.</v>

764
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So I know I got poetic license to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about those guys where I don't really,</v>

765
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:53.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tread lightly with other rappers.</v>

766
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 1>You never know whose feelings get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so it was no need for him to do open</v>

767
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>mics as much as just find someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed in him.</v>

768
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And that was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kp La Reid,</v>

769
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Dj toomp and gave him platform to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genre.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how much time would you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in the nine is this isn't like</v>

817
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:49.780
<v Speaker 1>formal battle rap now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like battle rap has evolved like boxing</v>

818
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:51.490
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what I'm talking about is</v>

819
00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:54.310
<v Speaker 1>essentially cockfighting so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when you would battle up,</v>

820
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 1>there would be no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no time limit.</v>

821
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.580
<v Speaker 1>No time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just went,</v>

822
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you just went until you won the crowd or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy shut the fuck up and</v>

823

925
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:06.330
<v Speaker 2>beatings that maybe a lot of guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought as long as him took.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's very technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at avoiding getting hit.</v>

927
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been hit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's finding the best in the world</v>

987
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought if someone could</v>

988
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 2>lose weight once they're really heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have an advantage of their</v>

989
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:42.570
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calves are still good,</v>

990
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but the legs are constantly used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving around with much more weight.</v>

991
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden they don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No big difference.</v>

<v Speaker 1>doing for jobs.</v>

1089
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I was just paying attention to how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>got these people in there.</v>

1090
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>They took homeless people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipped him out there on buses so they</v>

1091
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 1>could vote from the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gave them jobs and identities and</v>

1092
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:27.550
<v Speaker 1>these people were extremely happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what?</v>

1093
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.770
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1094
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were troubled,</v>

1095
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:33.380
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot of them they finally had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of purpose.</v>

1096
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 1>They just been taken into this place as</v>

<v Speaker 1>enlightenment and all of,</v>

1103
00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about mystical</v>

1105
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.680
<v Speaker 1>emphasizes spirituality.</v>

1106
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.070
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that the Hindu religion is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>is a more ancient,</v>

1152
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Jim Morrison with a full beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight the fuck.</v>

1153
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1154
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1155
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Jesus would probably a Tan guy with dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair and curly curly hair and Brown eyes</v>

1156
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that was saying shit that the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the church didn't like.</v>

1157
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.030
<v Speaker 1>So they knocked him the fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that each race looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone of another race to be their</v>

1159
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:40.434
<v Speaker 1>advisor?</v>

1160
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't think people trust the</v>
<v Speaker 1>divinity in themselves.</v>

1161
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1162
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that once you understand that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

1163
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>we really only looked different because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of subtle differences in atmosphere and</v>

1164
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 1>change and you know who you mix with</v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

1165
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:59.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think that all those books that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are moms paid oprah to sell us of self</v>

1166
00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 1>help and inward looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reverend Ike had told my grandmother's</v>

1167
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 1>generation had in the seventies you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean?</v>

1168
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we're scared to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the lights and at some point see</v>

1169
00:46:08.701 --> 00:46:12.090
<v Speaker 1>something divine within ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you do that,</v>

1170
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>that requires you act differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people need to be told</v>

1171
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that they actually need it,</v>

1172
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 1>but they want to be instructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 1>versus knowing or going on a gut feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>or experiment and getting something</v>

1174
00:46:25.801 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1175
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather was one of the most kind</v>

1176
00:46:29.131 --> 00:46:34.131
<v Speaker 1>moral men I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always gentle with children.</v>

1177
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 1>He only put a belt on my butt twice in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life and shit.</v>

1178
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I think he cried harder than that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>man at 14 years old.</v>

1179
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Shot a man in church for kicking this</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike down.</v>

1180
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he grew up in between 14 and 54 when I</v>

1181
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.400
<v Speaker 1>was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had experiences that he had</v>

1182
00:46:50.401 --> 00:46:55.401
<v Speaker 1>learned to regret and he had dealt with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and he had become something that by</v>

1183
00:46:56.251 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the time I was a child and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising me,</v>

1184
00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:00.570
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather was divided in my eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

1185
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because he was perfect because he</v>

1186
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 1>was genuinely good and moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a 14 year old boy who had grown</v>

1187
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 1>up fatherless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who dropped out of school in the third</v>

1188
00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:10.740
<v Speaker 1>grade and who had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who understood it,</v>

1189
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:12.540
<v Speaker 1>that I must protect my mothers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters.</v>

1190
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:16.320
<v Speaker 1>He refused to people that buy anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in adult to the point of putting a</v>

1191
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 1>bullet in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1192
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.840
<v Speaker 1>So I think that a lot of times we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to see the divinity in ourselves</v>

1193
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then you have to acknowledge the</v>

1194
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 1>darkness and you'd have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1195
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier to get instructed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

1196
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier to see the evil outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1197
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to see the ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to know I can't control it</v>

1198
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 1>just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus,</v>

1199
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:34.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1200
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm complying and I'm complicit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1201
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.670
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a consequence of,</v>

1202
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that bothers me the</v>

1203
00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:46.040
<v Speaker 2>most when people talk about people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>commit crimes or think about people that</v>

1204
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:49.280
<v Speaker 2>commit crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much of who a person is as a</v>

1205
00:47:49.281 --> 00:47:51.590
<v Speaker 2>consequence of things that had nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with them.</v>

1206
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get had been born in a terrible</v>

1207
00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:58.380
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood to horrible parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been abused sexually and physically.</v>

1208
00:47:58.381 --> 00:48:00.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the time you get to them,</v>

1209
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.410
<v Speaker 2>they broke their life is already a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a shambles row.</v>

1210
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.100
<v Speaker 2>And for you to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think that they are going to look at</v>

1211
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:10.250
<v Speaker 2>life and just figure it out with no</v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance whatsoever,</v>

1212
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work like that occur.</v>

1213
00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.860
<v Speaker 2>One of the weirdest things about our</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture is that we haven't put more of</v>

1214
00:48:15.861 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 2>an emphasis in finding the spots that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there,</v>

1215
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.620
<v Speaker 2>the ghettos and the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods in this country.</v>

1216
00:48:21.621 --> 00:48:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And figuring out a way to build them up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just make it even,</v>

1217
00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:25.820
<v Speaker 2>we know you're out a way.</v>

1218
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.080
<v Speaker 1>We know unequivocably where jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>commerce are present and economic</v>

1219
00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and prosperity occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dessa,</v>

1220
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 1>dramatic reduction and elimination and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gang violence.</v>

1221
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Yet we do not put resources into</v>
<v Speaker 1>building institutions that will create</v>

1222
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:49.650
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs' or work on a soft skill</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the kids can be working at and around</v>

1223
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 1>production houses to the owls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put that money into prisons.</v>

1224
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we use prison labor to undercut</v>

1225
00:48:55.661 --> 00:48:57.510
<v Speaker 1>things like call centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1226
00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the jobs,</v>

1227
00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it factories may need and we,</v>

1228
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a disservice by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1229
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>and I always say we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we looked how our quote unquote</v>

1230
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:10.300
<v Speaker 1>leaders and blamed him when so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times we allow it,</v>

1231
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:13.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we allow this to happen by not paying</v>

1232
00:49:13.331 --> 00:49:16.450
<v Speaker 1>attention and not voting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We allow it to happen by not raising our</v>

1233
00:49:16.451 --> 00:49:18.310
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we know someone in prison</v>

1234
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 1>and saying this is wrong.</v>

1235
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last people,</v>

1236
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe just for the record,</v>

1237
00:49:22.691 --> 00:49:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in the big three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Abrahamic religions,</v>

1238
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the books I've read and they're</v>

1239
00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>amazing graphic novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot read them.</v>

1240
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I can look like a graphic novel of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts.</v>

1241
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at the people who</v>

1242
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Christ died with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1243
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.701
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1244
00:49:35.701 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was up there thieves.</v>

1245
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.020
<v Speaker 1>The last person he saved before he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired here,</v>

1246
00:49:40.021 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it was a thief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1247
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.320
<v Speaker 1>what's a confessed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve was dying right next to him and he</v>

1248
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:44.891
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1249
00:49:44.891 --> 00:49:47.770
<v Speaker 1>we going to go on this together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sets an amazing thing.</v>

1250
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So as you're serving your savior or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>messiah,</v>

1251
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you need to be thinking about who he</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent his time with.</v>

1252
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with liars and thieves,</v>

1253
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 1>he was in the streets.</v>

1254
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 1>He was what people were alleged to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes.</v>

1255
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if we start to turn our</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to those places and we put our</v>

1256
00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:07.180
<v Speaker 1>intentions and good there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do produce on the out on the other</v>

1257
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 1>side better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as long as we look at religion as</v>

1258
00:50:09.641 --> 00:50:11.440
<v Speaker 1>something that makes us holy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us clean,</v>

1259
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 1>washed us of our sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we become pious that I think</v>

1260
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:18.040
<v Speaker 1>religion will something be something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's forever kind of harmful.</v>

1261
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.160
<v Speaker 1>It helped to create that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that,</v>

1262
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 1>that believing that some people are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at evil doesn't allow us to say,</v>

1263
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could we do to fix those ghettos,</v>

1264
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 1>fix all depressed areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for every ghetto where I'm from,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's amazing man.</v>

1280
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1281
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big confederate flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doesn't bother me as much.</v>

1282
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not saying that you had to pass.</v>

1283
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Just it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lived with it so long.</v>

1284
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:12.060
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1285
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you shocked at all of a sudden it</v>

1286
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:16.580
<v Speaker 1>became a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with the Dukes of Hazzard and all</v>

1287
00:51:16.581 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not while I was at Duke because it has,</v>

1288
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I have pictures of me.</v>

1289
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And what's the General Leon a shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1290
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised because you know it,</v>

1291
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>my thing with the competitor of faggots</v>
<v Speaker 1>that side loss,</v>

1292
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're flying a loser's flag.</v>

1293
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So I just never really bothered me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I got older to drama,</v>

1294
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>the drama that's been placed around it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been amazing because if I'm not</v>

1295
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Speaker 1>going to change Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>

1296
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the school's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to really be able to</v>

1297
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:41.840
<v Speaker 1>change places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be here.</v>

1298
00:51:41.841 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a southern,</v>

1299
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of that it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1300
00:51:44.091 --> 00:51:46.390
<v Speaker 1>But Turbo Jesus as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw following.</v>

1301
00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So my natural assumption is typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>redneck kid,</v>

1302
00:51:49.821 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hella talent.</v>

1303
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 1>He can fix anything with a motor on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes these amazing Katana like</v>

1304
00:51:55.131 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 1>swartz out of riches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1305
00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 1>He's just an amazing kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I see him rallying against kids that</v>

1306
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 1>uphold that flag and upholding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1307
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:06.560
<v Speaker 1>anything that feels like racism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationals and he just wanted a more most</v>

1308
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 1>morally good kids I've ever seen running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1309
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And he's an ally and he doesn't look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stereotypically anything you would</v>

1310
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the great part of this.</v>

1311
00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great part of all of this country he</v>

1312
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:19.160
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1313
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:23.160
<v Speaker 1>as as polar opposites is people try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make say a you and I,</v>

1314
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.490
<v Speaker 1>here we are together as equals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1315
00:52:25.491 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 1>here we are together engaging one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another as equals and we don't look like</v>

1316
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 1>one another and not from the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

1317
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's just a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity in that.</v>

1318
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's money to be made in</v>

1319
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:39.050
<v Speaker 1>promoting that versus promoting division</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fear.</v>

1320
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:43.670
<v Speaker 1>And so absolutely you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is money in helping children be</v>

1321
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>better there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is in there and if we're going to</v>

1322
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 1>live in a capitalist system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a compassionate capitalists and be</v>

1323
00:52:49.071 --> 00:52:51.300
<v Speaker 1>the best you possibly can because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need more of you.</v>

1324
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Speaker 1>But just seems like something like an in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of something that we think about</v>

1325
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 1>as a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't think about neighborhood</v>

1326
00:52:57.981 --> 00:52:59.240
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1327
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not a primary concern even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest problems we have is</v>

1328
00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 1>with crime and violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask people what's the two biggest</v>

1329
00:53:06.411 --> 00:53:08.060
<v Speaker 1>things you're afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crime and violence.</v>

1330
00:53:08.061 --> 00:53:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Next be car accidents and cancer and but</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and violence,</v>

1331
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you could severely mitigate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Can if she had all these community</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs.</v>

1333
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.340
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they've,</v>

1334
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I bet if they calculate it out probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wash,</v>

1335
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.610
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money you'd spend spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix things versus the amount of money</v>

1336
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 1>you would save by not having as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

1337
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roxanne Shawntay</v>

1338
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I saw her and I don't know shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just guessing.</v>

1339
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I eight south eighth anything is better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than what we're doing.</v>

1340
00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 2>More prisons what we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1341
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the scariest shit we got</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1342
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.390
<v Speaker 2>The idea that someone's profiting off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting people in cages and that they</v>

1343
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 2>also lobby to make sure that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>more laws in the books.</v>

1344
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I told Larry King early today that I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather stop arguing over the second</v>

1345
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 2>amendment with people that I should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguing for amendment of the 13th</v>

1346
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:55.200
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should stop arguing over guns and we</v>

1347
00:53:55.201 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 2>should start to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does that 13th amendment have a</v>

1348
00:53:57.841 --> 00:54:02.520
<v Speaker 2>loophole that allows for slavery that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says slavery is illegal except for yeah,</v>

1349
00:54:02.521 --> 00:54:04.920
<v Speaker 2>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have no idea how much prisoners</v>

1350
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 2>get paid to work when they were working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the fires.</v>

1351
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:08.483
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was,</v>

1352
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it was $2 or something.</v>

1353
00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking insane amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pay them and when they get out of</v>

1354
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are not allowed to be firemen.</v>

1355
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1356
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:54:20.671 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 2>It's real</v>
<v Speaker 2>like because you're a felon.</v>

1358
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.900

<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the guys I've known that</v>

<v Speaker 2>allowed to apply for five.</v>

1362

<v Speaker 2>these are the guys in ally.</v>

1378
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate you saying that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true and it's not just black guys</v>

1379
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:26.730
<v Speaker 2>is poor white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost wish I could have a convention</v>

1380
00:55:26.731 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 2>with to say we got to say masters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying this right here.</v>

1381
00:55:31.321 --> 00:55:34.920
<v Speaker 2>More than 2000 volunteer inmate</v>
<v Speaker 2>firefighters and they volunteered,</v>

1382
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 2>including 58 youth offenders are</v>
<v Speaker 2>battling wildfire flames through</v>

1383
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inmate firefighters serve a vital role</v>

1384
00:55:41.581 --> 00:55:45.030
<v Speaker 2>clearing thick brush down to bare soil</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop the fire.</v>

1385
00:55:45.031 --> 00:55:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Spread a wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1386
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 2>do they get better service for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they they get out earlier?</v>

1387
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think nothing.</v>

1388
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:53.963
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1389
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I would hope they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we're paying them a dollar out,</v>

1390
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.150
<v Speaker 2>what do we care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're,</v>

1391
00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.400
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

1392
00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.920
<v Speaker 2>the public should be up in arms about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1393
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:02.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>not run too,</v>

1395
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 2>because when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're chopping down bushes out</v>

1396
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:08.740
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's a fire going on,</v>

1397
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 2>but where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to go with it?</v>

1398

<v Speaker 2>locked in the hole for like eight</v>

1432
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like 10 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

1448
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.950

<v Speaker 2>Fuck you by yourself.</v>

1449
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:07.000
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1450
00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:12.001
<v Speaker 2>you could break someone's brain is tired</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people's brain gets broken on a good</v>

1451
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 2>edible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I watch first 48 I see.</v>

1452
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Mother fuckers rang it broken 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cigarettes at a honeypot.</v>

1453
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another reason I tell kids don't</v>

1454
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.920
<v Speaker 2>commit crime or with your homies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1455
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Watch first 48 you're going to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything go bad man.</v>

1456
00:58:30.101 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 2>For a newport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1457
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Just so many fucking crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many laws that don't,</v>

1458
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:38.680
<v Speaker 2>don't need to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poverty.</v>

1459
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 2>We end poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fixed crime when that's a fuck load</v>

1460
00:58:41.861 --> 00:58:42.720
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1461
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd still be sociopaths and greedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are going to have that,</v>

1462
00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but far less than crimes of opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Robin Moms,</v>

1463
00:58:48.851 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 2>if their persons that gas stations car</v>
<v Speaker 2>jackings you're not going to see stolen</v>

1464
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to see burglaries.</v>

1465
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.920
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start to have an influx of,</v>

1466
00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd need to bring a lot of stuff back</v>

1467
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:01.380
<v Speaker 2>to America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to start making shit again and</v>

1468
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:03.010
<v Speaker 2>he'd start buying shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make again.</v>

1469
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:05.770
<v Speaker 2>We need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to start refocusing on what we</v>

1470
00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:07.810
<v Speaker 2>could be doing in house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1471
00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would certainly help us and</v>

1472
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what we could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1473
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.500
<v Speaker 2>to sort of promote that idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1474
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't it,</v>

1475
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.460
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing that ever gets discussed</v>

1476
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.000
<v Speaker 1>in any political discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

1477
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 1>whenever there's some debates going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whenever there's,</v>

1478
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 1>cause we're being given an agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody ever thinks of that one</v>

1479
00:59:32.091 --> 00:59:35.840
<v Speaker 1>aspect of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weakest aspect of our culture</v>

1480
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 1>economically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't really consider it,</v>

1481
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 1>you just look at it as a source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

1482
00:59:40.521 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a statistic we sitters as though</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that just is just has to</v>

1483
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:47.180
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have to be like that.</v>

1484
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if we know history and to</v>

1485
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:52.310
<v Speaker 1>tell them he shuts all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really trying to say like there are</v>

1486
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 1>other alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways to try this and,</v>

1487
00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1488
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can try to fix homelessness without</v>

1489
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 1>criminalizing being homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1490
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>We know that most men that are homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1491
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>have some types of mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>

1492
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>So that means that we've broken down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not taking care of the mentally</v>

1493
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:12.890
<v Speaker 1>ill in a way that we should be a could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1494
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you start to fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to fix that kind of</v>

1495
01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>homelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that women and children,</v>

1496
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>we know why they're on the street and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that if they're subsidized into</v>

1497
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>these types of affordable housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments in the city,</v>

1498
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.060
<v Speaker 1>the kids have the opportunity to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>better schools,</v>

1499
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>to become better parts of society in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of having to networks and</v>

1500
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the mothers are closer to work,</v>

1501
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>can be home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't do that.</v>

1502
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>We build cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right now we're developing Atlanta</v>

1503
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 1>and we've been promised a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1504
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of workspace in the city for working</v>

1505
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>class people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for poor people.</v>

1506
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Some of the developers aren't doing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say they do.</v>

1507
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And because you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to increase the,</v>

1508
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>the things that are blights on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1509
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>we just have to be really committed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and do it.</v>

1510
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once we do it,</v>

1511
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1512
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>But if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we keep acting like it's not</v>

1513
01:00:56.751 --> 01:01:01.751
<v Speaker 1>happening and complaining about poverty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crime in war and not doing anything,</v>

1514
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just the cycle never stops nasty on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the insanity.</v>

1515
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I really don't understand yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well everybody feels like it's somebody</v>

1516
01:01:09.921 --> 01:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>else's job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody feels like work like,</v>

1517
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody feels like,</v>

1518
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>well you just got to get out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

1519
01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>

1520
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roxanne Shawntay talked about reentry</v>

1521
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1522
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1523
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.970
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want to hear people come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep complaining about gentrification</v>

1524
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>when the kids that are leaving these</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods,</v>

1525
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>whether they'd sing dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rap or not,</v>

1526
01:01:31.251 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>or just cokie could jobs and colby</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent human beings.</v>

1527
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>You should be reentering your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

1528
01:01:36.601 --> 01:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>You should be buying houses or pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>land near.</v>

1529
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the most impressive things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite players are John</v>

1530
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Stockton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll know if it's true or not,</v>

1531
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>but I read a story that he actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought a house right on the street he</v>

1532
01:01:47.261 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the Aussie that he go back</v>

1533
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>essentially home with his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd had some type of normalization</v>

1534
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>to their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1535
01:01:55.131 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>we should be doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1536
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiana,</v>

1537
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I have bought properties together in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same neighborhoods we grew up in,</v>

1538
01:02:01.161 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>were developing things like restaurants</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

1539
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I like to see more athletes and rappers</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the merchant and business class,</v>

1540
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>net weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like to see people who grew up in</v>

1541
01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods move back to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods they grew up in like,</v>

1542
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>like the typical iconic American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you can build a,</v>

1543
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another eight square feet in the back of</v>

1544
01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:25.221
<v Speaker 1>the a frame house if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't be going to 54 60</v>

1545
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>minutes outside the city in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the blight of the city</v>

1546
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>because you took yourself away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took the talent and the resources</v>

1547
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:33.204
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1548
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that everyone should feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way though?</v>

1549
01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Or is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1550
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to the city that you grew up</v>

1551
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>in or couldn't you want to just get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of there and go somewhere</v>

1552
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>different difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with getting the fuck out,</v>

1553
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but you just think you should go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and support it.</v>

1554
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I tell kids,</v>

1555
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in college and they say,</v>

1556
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.331
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.021
<v Speaker 1>what can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1558
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>kids in college gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go speak at college and say,</v>

1559
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:51.564
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could we do?</v>

1560
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Kids want to affect the world very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fanned a kid in high school,</v>

1561
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>tutored at Kit and make sure they</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace you at this university or</v>

1562
01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1563
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>you're just used replanting a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you grow food,</v>

1564
01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:06.680
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't grow the same way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to year after year some you'd</v>

1565
01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Speaker 1>have to give that land a break.</v>

1566
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Retail it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1567
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:11.250
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to stay in the same</v>

1568
01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to feel like I never win</v>

1569
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>anything or escaped anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do have to,</v>

1570
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.400
<v Speaker 1>don't sell your mother's house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1571
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>rent it to your cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1572
01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.970
<v Speaker 1>let you get my assistant but don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't sell your mother.</v>

1573
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>That piece of land was worked for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood to toil the soil.</v>

1574
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It means something and it should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1575
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:33.830
<v Speaker 1>and for working class people especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps your neighborhood and</v>

1576
01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 1>communities more like the ones that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>you be a good human being,</v>

1577
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that there is something,</v>

1578
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 1>most people don't leave the town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow up in and moved to the other</v>

1579
01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>side or they moved to the suburbs for</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people or most people marry</v>

1580
01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>somebody they knew.</v>

1581
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My thing is make the best of it.</v>

1582
01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Don't let it keep becoming a worse.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the old narrative of we've</v>

<v Speaker 1>were here left and they never came back</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't think what they</v>

1604
01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>parents bill was good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man to kill me because that is not</v>

1605
01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>just black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less Americans period.</v>

1606
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.240
<v Speaker 1>We have gotten to a point where we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unappreciative,</v>

1607
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:11.450
<v Speaker 1>we are entitled and we don't think what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened before us was good enough so we</v>

1608
01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>don't treasure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't honor it.</v>

1609
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>We don't reinvest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a farm in Milledgeville</v>

1610
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that could be a house in Adamsville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to do a better job of</v>

1611
01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:23.870
<v Speaker 1>appreciating ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciating our community and in Capri,</v>

1612
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our greater community and you have to</v>

<v Speaker 1>you have to reenter fi day.</v>

1614
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a part of whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentrification happens to make sure that</v>

1615
01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>your stake is still there and net what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you care about from a moral and civil</v>

1616
01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>perspective represented there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My uncle,</v>

1617
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>my uncle John Blackman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a huge influence on me dad and</v>

1618
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>had a five car garage where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he did transmissions and stuff and</v>

1619
01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I begged my aunt to sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

1620

<v Speaker 1>I don't want you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're going to come.</v>

1621
01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>The beltline's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cooked,</v>

1622
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but please sell it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want my uncle's building,</v>

1623
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for to go to strangers and become,</v>

1624
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an apartment complex or something.</v>

1625
01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.770
<v Speaker 1>And I walked in your building I senior</v>
<v Speaker 1>building and I said,</v>

1626
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm gonna do with it now.</v>

1627
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I've had it for like three years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1628
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I just had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't never knew what I wanted to</v>

1629
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:08.830
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1630
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:09.611
<v Speaker 1>But you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1631
01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you need somewhere to go every day</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're building is impressive.</v>

1632
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1633
01:06:12.341 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to just make my bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uncle's building.</v>

1634
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 1>My office is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I figured out a way to make a lot of</v>

1635
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>money off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1636
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I've already made a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what leaving me to buy it.</v>

1637
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:24.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's important to me that as his</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood turns into hipster land,</v>

1638
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 1>because it's definitely going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be black hips going to be</v>

1639
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:27.430
<v Speaker 1>like chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hipster and land.</v>

1640
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to make sure that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still some chocolate working</v>

1641
01:06:30.431 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 1>class in there and sometimes they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go buy coffee and there's going</v>

1642
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:37.810
<v Speaker 1>to be a loud ass muscle car and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana smoke point out of it so</v>

1643
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 1>they'll know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uncle's nephew still in town.</v>

1644
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.880

1645
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:47.620

<v Speaker 1>a sense of community,</v>

1646
01:06:47.621 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>and you had a business perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a business perspective.</v>

1647
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife,</v>

1648
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:55.680
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife is doing it all while she</v>

1649
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 1>taught Campbell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem to know what the fuck you're</v>

1650
01:06:57.671 --> 01:07:00.550
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a pretty good roadmap,</v>

1651
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I've zero that zero business</v>

1652
01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:07.030

1653
01:07:07.031 --> 01:07:08.470
<v Speaker 1>every day though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have that.</v>

1654
01:07:08.471 --> 01:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm crazy that I'm going to the gym</v>

1655
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 1>to try to silence demons forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had man failing was the best thing</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think for everybody fail.</v>

1657
01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:23.680

<v Speaker 1>They become hateful.</v>

1659
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.760
<v Speaker 1>At least how to mock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:33.210
<v Speaker 1>But failure can be one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that ever happened to failing and</v>

1661
01:07:33.491 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>having to learn to become a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm very thankful for removed from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1670
01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go to Texas and people like</v>

1678
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.070
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they taught me to rudimentary</v>

1679
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:23.420
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals of business and when I met</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ahead of everyone because the</v>

1686
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 1>grandmother had raised her in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grandmother had a shot house running</v>

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:19.221
<v Speaker 1>with the essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1703
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be frustrating.</v>

1704
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:21.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Barbara comes in one day,</v>

1705
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>like I want to wear a glitter Cape</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1706
01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:25.310
<v Speaker 1>The next part was coming of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1707
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to cut hair in the nude,</v>

1708
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to use your shop to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1709

<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1710
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1711
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>like this is the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had to learn for us that the booth</v>

1712
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 1>rent model,</v>

<v Speaker 1>knit.</v>

1714
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:41.120
<v Speaker 1>So we had to kind of say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>their nails done and no,</v>

1747
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:04.760

1760
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much to the point that I bought my</v>

01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:33.240
<v Speaker 2>wife thousands of dollars in stocks for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>she cried when I,</v>

1763
01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.140
<v Speaker 2>when I showed it a wedding band that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought,</v>

1764
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>cause I never really got her winning</v>
<v Speaker 2>band and say,</v>

1765
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:42.360

01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:45.500
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is never coming off at if Soviet,</v>

1767
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 2>beginning of Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she cried when she saw my wedding band.</v>

1768
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.120
<v Speaker 2>And at the end she cried when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never want you to be fully dependent</v>

1769
01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:54.240
<v Speaker 2>upon me or feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a lot of stock.</v>

1770
01:11:54.241 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And she cried like a baby.</v>

1771
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I called flat like this shit works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bronco Friesen,</v>

1772
01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm so I'm learning about,</v>

1773
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.640
<v Speaker 2>and I just put lots of money into the s</v>
<v Speaker 2>and p 500,</v>

1774
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.950
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know a lot about crypto</v>
<v Speaker 2>currency and stuff.</v>

1775
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm learning how to have money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by them.</v>

1776
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d the idea of a decentralized economy,</v>

1777
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:14.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we're always,</v>

1778
01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.280
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing has always been about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1779
01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that banks control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just stop and think about what's</v>

1780
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:27.870
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what goes on with the Federal Reserve</v>

1781
01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:31.690
<v Speaker 2>and what goes on with all the money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much a dollar is worth overseas and</v>

1782
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 2>balance of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was something that we can all</v>

1783
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 2>rely on that wasn't controlled by any</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic group of people that have a</v>

1784
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:41.820
<v Speaker 2>vested interest in profiting off of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>pile of money.</v>

1785
01:12:41.821 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 2>If it was some sort of a bitcoin like</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1786
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:46.920
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a really different world.</v>

1787
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:47.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

1788
01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:49.050
<v Speaker 2>really different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1789
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:50.400
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

1790
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.820
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be different if the world was money</v>

1791
01:12:52.821 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be different if there was a gold</v>

1792
01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:55.530
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1793
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a lot of differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question becomes,</v>

1794
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.280
<v Speaker 2>is the banking mafia of source ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to let that happen?</v>

1795
01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could they stop it?</v>

1796
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like stopping the Internet at this</v>

1797
01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:07.950
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's calming,</v>

1798
01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you think we're going to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrency?</v>

1799
01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's eventually going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to throw the chicken</v>

1800
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.393
<v Speaker 2>coops?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>

1801
01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:14.211
<v Speaker 2>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1802
01:13:14.211 --> 01:13:16.530
<v Speaker 2>let's be big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a question correctly,</v>

1803
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't throw coins and clubs.</v>

1804
01:13:18.181 --> 01:13:19.200
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1805
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 2>What can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>tower built with a goal,</v>

1810
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:39.410

<v Speaker 2>shit ton of money.</v>

1894
01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1895
01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:53.590
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her family owned land,</v>

1896
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.980
<v Speaker 2>they started as sharecroppers but</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they all land she could,</v>

1897
01:16:56.981 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 2>because she could become educated</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they could sell the stuff.</v>

1898
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They grew to stores and produce markets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

1899
01:17:02.141 --> 01:17:04.750
<v Speaker 2>So she named were methodist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she got to go to school.</v>

1900
01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.200
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some mother old no land.</v>

1901
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 2>So grandfather had</v>

1902
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 1>to work in a bread factory in cotton</v>
<v Speaker 1>meals and shit.</v>

1903
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So I knew did difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership and you know,</v>

1904
01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>the advantages of having something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1905
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's something I can have obsessed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want my children to</v>

1906
01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>endure poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1907
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and I grew up working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1908
01:17:28.341 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she jokes but she says it a lot.</v>

1909
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:32.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was from housing projects in</v>

1910
01:17:32.091 --> 01:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Savannah and her grandmother and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother worked.</v>

1911
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:35.720
<v Speaker 1>They were out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1912
01:17:35.721 --> 01:17:37.130
<v Speaker 1>she says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me all the time,</v>

1913
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you were spoiled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1914
01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you're a little rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids were like,</v>

1915
01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:40.071
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1916
01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:41.390
<v Speaker 1>you had a fucking rv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1917
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I lived in an a frame house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1918
01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Grandpa,</v>

1919
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>your grandparents couldn't afford the</v>
<v Speaker 1>RV.</v>

1920
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.190
<v Speaker 1>You guys went on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were spoiled.</v>

1921
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So I understand money means a lot and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean everything to me,</v>

1922
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.360
<v Speaker 1>but it helps to afford me to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of her,</v>

1923
01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 1>my children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand it,</v>

1924
01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really give a shit knock on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a daily basis.</v>

1925
01:18:01.731 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm more like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think about businesses,</v>

1926
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you think about starting businesses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forming businesses.</v>

1927
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you have the time to do that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>write and perform and all the other shit</v>

1928
01:18:10.551 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it enabled what the business has</v>

1929
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:15.380
<v Speaker 1>enabled me to enjoy writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>performing.</v>

1930
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.630
<v Speaker 1>When I had to wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there was no choice,</v>

1931
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:19.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1932
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:22.820
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't as fun anymore because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure was,</v>

1933
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.250
<v Speaker 1>am I going to chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I make this much?</v>

1934
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Will the record versus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1935
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:30.080
<v Speaker 1>if I have a couple of streams of revenue</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in,</v>

1936
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it a little more relaxed and my</v>

1937
01:18:33.651 --> 01:18:35.470
<v Speaker 1>art is freer that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1938
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that answer.</v>

1939
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:40.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a great answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1940
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 1>That makes a lot of sense actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:18:42.141 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>To free yourself up creatively so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to think about when you're</v>

1942
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:46.970
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever read the strange death of</v>

2069
01:23:59.011 --> 01:24:00.360

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2071
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.260

<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2073
01:24:05.881 --> 01:24:07.920
<v Speaker 2>when they found his body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gun was still in his hand,</v>

2074
01:24:07.921 --> 01:24:10.460

<v Speaker 2>Guns fly out of here.</v>

2075

2076
01:24:14.191 --> 01:24:16.920

<v Speaker 2>Cause waves are beautiful like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that will faint.</v>

2128
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:30.110

<v Speaker 2>That's a bald wall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Doesn't show any hair.</v>

2132
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the fuck wolves looked</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2136
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:46.430

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.530
<v Speaker 2>He has to look it up and he's a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>specimen.</v>

2171
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he has a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that said,</v>

2172
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 2>if you look at bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2173
01:28:18.231 --> 01:28:21.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different animal there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're breaking their body's ability to</v>

2174
01:28:21.531 --> 01:28:23.810
<v Speaker 2>perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop testosterone.</v>

2175
01:28:23.811 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 2>They're nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A shrinking fucked up.</v>

2176
01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks bad.</v>

2177
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I got a picture of Ronnie Coleman that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>send to my friends every now and then</v>

2178
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:32.480
<v Speaker 2>just as like a wake up call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I save it on my phone.</v>

2179
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I sent it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want you to know that this is how</v>

2180
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:37.850
<v Speaker 2>big people can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why while you're lifting weights,</v>

2181
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:41.150
<v Speaker 2>just keep everything in perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 2>always know</v>

2182
01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>

2185
01:28:47.901 --> 01:28:48.920
<v Speaker 2>game prayers up to run.</v>

2186
01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I heard there's a documentary about him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on Netflix.</v>

2187
01:28:51.981 --> 01:28:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just sad and not sad,</v>

2188
01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 2>but like you feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like first of all,</v>

2189
01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had that type of discipline.</v>

2190
01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 2>He was eating 10,000 calories a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was training for one hour a day doing</v>

2191
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 2>full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full training,</v>

2192
01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:09.210
<v Speaker 2>top to bottom because he was a cop at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time and he was just a bull</v>

01:29:09.211 --> 01:29:10.170
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2206
01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:33.300
<v Speaker 2>he's a much smaller now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would live so much weight and worked</v>

2207
01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:34.680
<v Speaker 2>out so much harder than anybody.</v>

2215
01:29:55.921 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 2>inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Myostatin is something that apparently</v>

2216
01:29:59.221 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 2>it regulates the muscle growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

01:30:01.591 --> 01:30:03.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2218
01:30:03.811 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 2>when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they either happen accidentally on dogs</v>

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.170
<v Speaker 2>called whippets on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen a window?</v>

2236
01:30:49.321 --> 01:30:52.440
<v Speaker 2>kind of mass on mass and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have perfect genetics.</v>

2237
01:30:52.441 --> 01:30:55.170
<v Speaker 2>You have to have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a warm Jesus Christ.</v>

2241
01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.520
<v Speaker 2>they just have a weird anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a genetic anomaly that makes them super</v>

2242
01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 2>fucking jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work though?</v>

2243
01:31:14.521 --> 01:31:15.500
<v Speaker 2>In terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2244
01:31:15.501 --> 01:31:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like pit bulls like I like,</v>

2245
01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:18.180
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

2246
01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 2>So that's really how we thought that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fate.</v>

2247
01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>

2248
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

2249
01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:26.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens in this community for some</v>

2250
01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:28.500
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read something about what it is</v>

2251
01:31:28.501 --> 01:31:33.240
<v Speaker 2>about breeding that somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gene is trait has is more common in</v>

2252
01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 2>whippets than most other animals as</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2253
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd like the traditional style pit bull</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Pete from little rascals,</v>

2254
01:31:40.051 --> 01:31:40.884
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:43.200
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new pit Bul.</v>

2256
01:31:43.201 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 2>The ones that are lower if bulkier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like the lowest as an English</v>

2257
01:31:46.741 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 2>bulldog or over muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder how useful are they?</v>

2258
01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they get ahold of you,</v>

2259
01:31:52.441 --> 01:31:53.900
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn sure.</v>

2260
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Power is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power that those things have is</v>

2261
01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:59.010
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's bad.</v>

2262
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>It's really when</v>

2263
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you get an answer like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have a hard time breathing,</v>

2264
01:32:02.831 --> 01:32:03.664
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2265
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to have longer legs so it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can move.</v>

2266
01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Good pit bulls were bred for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

2267
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:13.530
<v Speaker 1>They were bred for purposes of fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and purposes of bringing down bulldogs.</v>

2268
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run alongside the bull,</v>

2269
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.330
<v Speaker 1>grab the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab the nose,</v>

2270
01:32:16.331 --> 01:32:18.630
<v Speaker 1>ring trop their wait flip essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>football ball.</v>

2271
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just thinking myself as we liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aesthetics of what they look like.</v>

2272
01:32:21.551 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we really doing to these little</v>

2273
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:26.140
<v Speaker 1>guys where they're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're buffed to shit,</v>

2274
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:27.550
<v Speaker 1>but they're shorter shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get up,</v>

2275
01:32:27.551 --> 01:32:29.620
<v Speaker 1>prepare steps for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they have such amazing</v>

2276
01:32:29.621 --> 01:32:32.120
<v Speaker 1>qualities because the fact they're game</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread because the,</v>

2277
01:32:32.121 --> 01:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are,</v>

2278
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:37.210
<v Speaker 1>that responded negatively to people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would growl at people or show aggression</v>

2279
01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:37.780
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

2280
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 1>They called them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ones that are real game dogs,</v>

2281
01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 1>let's a little 35 pound males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the best dogs on the planet</v>

2282
01:32:44.741 --> 01:32:45.161
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2283
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to convince shaffer</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're so nice.</v>

2284
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:15.490
<v Speaker 1>She could ride it like a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell him to sit,</v>

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.740
<v Speaker 1>She'd do anything but to in her eyes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>her purpose in life was to make sure</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everything came from a wolf.</v>

2399
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

2400
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

2401
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Every dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something key that we took it back and I</v>

2402
01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:10.970
<v Speaker 2>say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people in my community,</v>

2403
01:37:10.971 --> 01:37:15.240
<v Speaker 2>but in humans evolved from monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

2404
01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>He's saying kind of Asheville get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was the words of killer Mike.</v>

2405
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.770
<v Speaker 2>If you're just listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 2>We definitely didn't pop up just like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2407
01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

2408
01:37:26.481 --> 01:37:28.370
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2409
01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my wife says,</v>

2410
01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:31.600
<v Speaker 2>joking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to know my wife.</v>

2411
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's very cool,</v>

2412
01:37:33.171 --> 01:37:34.580
<v Speaker 2>very down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's my best friend.</v>

2413
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:39.080
<v Speaker 2>She speaks in his thick creole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like accent and she'll just say</v>

2414
01:37:39.081 --> 01:37:41.180
<v Speaker 2>things blindly out of nowhere there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

2415
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 2>And she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're watching planting today and she</v>

2416
01:37:43.131 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 2>people get mad about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shit,</v>

2418
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:53.510
<v Speaker 2>when you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings do look like monkeys.</v>

2419
01:37:53.511 --> 01:37:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably were swinging the fuck</v>

2420
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.870
<v Speaker 2>around a few thousand and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of myself.</v>

2421
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.990
<v Speaker 2>You do realize in the black community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an insult to even call us.</v>

2422
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:03.480
<v Speaker 2>And she's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's black,</v>

2423
01:38:03.481 --> 01:38:05.520
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just like a man.</v>

2424
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 2>She pointed at the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

2425
01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably a fault.</v>

2426
01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:11.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2427
01:38:11.171 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2428
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:14.070
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can have whatever debates they</v>

2429
01:38:14.071 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 2>want to file it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2430
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we act a lot just like,</v>

2431
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I think human beings are arrogant</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we think we can communicate and</v>

2432
01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 2>we can use tools to build shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But basically we're hairless apes and</v>

2433
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just cause we can communicate doesn't</v>

2434
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:28.950
<v Speaker 2>mean we're communicating the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2435
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Animals live in harmony with nature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very different way.</v>

2436
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.200
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kill for hunger,</v>

2437
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:36.810
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>AIDS can't kill for reasons that are non</v>

2438
01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:38.070
<v Speaker 2>hunger related and things of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

2439
01:38:38.071 --> 01:38:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So we know that's a part of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2440
01:38:40.471 --> 01:38:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2441
01:38:41.581 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I think we evolved from something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't necessarily look like us.</v>

2442
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.640
<v Speaker 2>If that may have swing from a tree where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most advanced of the primates,</v>

2444
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:55.380
<v Speaker 2>but we exhibit characteristics so we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see in the lower primates and if you pay</v>

2445
01:38:55.381 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 2>attention to all the top scientists who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have spent studying human evolution,</v>

2446
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:03.210
<v Speaker 2>they're all pretty much in agreement</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was something that we were</v>

2447
01:39:03.211 --> 01:39:05.340
<v Speaker 2>all similar too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all branched off at a bunch of</v>

2448
01:39:05.341 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2449
01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:08.670
<v Speaker 2>They keep finding new forms of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2450
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw why they just stopped destined.</v>

2451
01:39:10.670 --> 01:39:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Noveon or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's called.</v>

2452
01:39:12.371 --> 01:39:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Not another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one from Russia.</v>

2453
01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:17.160
<v Speaker 2>So do you think yellow do you take alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>has really popped down.</v>

2454
01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the monkey and we popped out nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>months later.</v>

2455
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

2456
01:39:20.581 --> 01:39:22.230
<v Speaker 2>that would be the most fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2457
01:39:22.231 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if a pit stop happened and what</v>

2458
01:39:25.801 --> 01:39:28.080
<v Speaker 2>was the movie that was really crappy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as good as it should have been?</v>

2459
01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:31.630
<v Speaker 2>That was the aliens like precursor</v>
<v Speaker 2>something showed essentially where can</v>

2460
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.940
<v Speaker 2>atheists atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2461
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:34.320
<v Speaker 2>They should have been very good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

2462
01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.371
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2463
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I think that that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

2464
01:39:36.811 --> 01:39:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Aliens were chick hanging out at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon,</v>

2465
01:39:38.821 --> 01:39:39.241
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

2466
01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:43.080
<v Speaker 2>look at the blue plans to fucking go see</v>
<v Speaker 2>with and say Yo [inaudible] he looks</v>

2467
01:39:43.081 --> 01:39:44.970
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the shit out of it.</v>

2468
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Got Out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing you know you have war</v>

2469
01:39:46.801 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 2>and pestilence and violence and poverty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and MMA.</v>

2470
01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Mm and joints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one monkey that accelerated stop</v>

2471
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.680
<v Speaker 2>past way past all the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one invention,</v>

2472
01:39:58.710 --> 01:40:01.020
<v Speaker 2>the invent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to communicate and the</v>

2473
01:40:01.021 --> 01:40:03.420
<v Speaker 2>ability to having opposable thumbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to communicate.</v>

2474
01:40:03.421 --> 01:40:06.270
<v Speaker 2>And then it started advancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as it started talking,</v>

2475
01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:10.620
<v Speaker 2>started figuring out ways to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself to each other,</v>

2476
01:40:10.621 --> 01:40:13.110
<v Speaker 2>and then they started making things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're off to the races and the next</v>

2477
01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 2>thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple hundred thousand years later,</v>

2478
01:40:15.151 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 2>the world's different Pune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this thing erupts and then</v>

2479
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:19.710
<v Speaker 2>just covers the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is shit.</v>

2480
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's us.</v>

2481
01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:24.270
<v Speaker 2>How do you subscribe to the theory that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just may be a virus and the earth may</v>

2482
01:40:24.271 --> 01:40:26.370
<v Speaker 2>be getting rid of us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2483
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 2>no one would like to think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2484
01:40:29.251 --> 01:40:31.470
<v Speaker 2>but the reason you call a virus or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2485
01:40:31.471 --> 01:40:33.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just an a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a word that's been assigned to a living</v>

2486
01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:35.220
<v Speaker 2>organism and a system.</v>

2487
01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.230
<v Speaker 2>By biomedical science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2488
01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:39.840
<v Speaker 2>we all know what a viruses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real thing.</v>

2489
01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that these brilliant people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have discovered it and come up with</v>

2490
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:46.950
<v Speaker 2>vaccines to stop and prevent them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a some sort of a life form</v>

2491
01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:47.690
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

2492
01:40:47.690 --> 01:40:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2493
01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>if we looked at the earth as being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>living organism and so we should we,</v>

2494
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:56.110
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly you can make an argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a kind of a life form that</v>

2495
01:40:56.111 --> 01:40:59.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a host of massive amounts of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the life.</v>

2496
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2497
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 2>you would think that maybe some of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things would not be in harmony.</v>

2498
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Just like some of those things in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>human body aren't in harmony,</v>

2499
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:08.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your gut bacteria is off or you got a</v>

2500
01:41:08.591 --> 01:41:12.730
<v Speaker 2>cold because there's bacteria in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body that you picked up from a fucking</v>

2501
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.180
<v Speaker 2>bathroom somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you're saying,</v>

2502
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:20.730
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff could easily apply to how</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings interact with the earth.</v>

2503
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Are we the virus though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2504
01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>cause when you got to look at it at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point the earth is,</v>

2505
01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>or you or the theory is it's a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing organism.</v>

2506
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I can say for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2507
01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 2>We are the virus to the ocean because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even live in it and think about</v>

2508
01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's life.</v>

2509
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Before we were monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were something that crawled out of</v>

2510
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:40.660
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2511
01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.070
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if the earth,</v>

2512
01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 2>the ocean was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2513
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are getting a hundred really stone.</v>

2514
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.310
<v Speaker 2>This is what our fans were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stone is,</v>

2515
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:51.760
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the ocean was like a</v>

2516
01:41:51.761 --> 01:41:55.090
<v Speaker 2>couple of hundred thousand years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>before people really became what we are</v>

2517
01:41:55.091 --> 01:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>tool to using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2518
01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:00.430
<v Speaker 2>people that figured out how to get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the ocean and capture fish.</v>

2519
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if you could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you could see an image of how</v>

2520
01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:09.610
<v Speaker 2>many fucking fish were out there 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago versus how many are now.</v>

2521
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like they lived next to a vampire</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just keeps sucking the life.</v>

2522
01:42:14.621 --> 01:42:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Avid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet we've killed 50% of all life in</v>

2523
01:42:18.851 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2524
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Felt like we have to think of ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point.</v>

2525
01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:28.040
<v Speaker 2>You gotta say maybe the best thing human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings could do for the earth is,</v>

2526
01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 2>is to aid humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2527
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:34.060
<v Speaker 2>But maybe viruses are there for a reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maybe that it all needs to exist.</v>

2528
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.130
<v Speaker 2>There needs to be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

2529
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Where are we trying to eliminate bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2530
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they do serve some sort of weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking purpose.</v>

2531
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:44.240
<v Speaker 2>So even even in that we find purpose as</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2532
01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:48.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the talent of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ability to adjust and make logic out</v>

2533
01:42:48.401 --> 01:42:50.290
<v Speaker 2>of us being here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:42:50.291 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Well and to keep moving and make more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2535
01:42:52.210 --> 01:42:55.030
<v Speaker 2>This China make it to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grew cotton on the moon apparently</v>

2536
01:42:55.031 --> 01:42:55.360
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

2537
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they grew something in the moon,</v>

2538
01:42:56.531 --> 01:42:57.550
<v Speaker 2>but it died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2539
01:42:57.610 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 2>it died quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was happy that it was that cotton</v>

2540
01:43:01.271 --> 01:43:05.050
<v Speaker 2>because seeing as how they're their</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest investor in Africa and China was</v>

2541
01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:08.080
<v Speaker 2>growing cotton that didn't go well for</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people 500 years ago.</v>

2542
01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.860
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't let cotton grown in the</v>

2543
01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:11.693
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2544
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to transmit Atlantic slave</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade.</v>

2545
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit.</v>

2546
01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:21.330
<v Speaker 2>So do you think they actually set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>shop before us or as American steel</v>

2547
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:25.600
<v Speaker 2>number one cause they feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we lost that day.</v>

2548
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:27.370
<v Speaker 2>We went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China landed on the moon.</v>

2549
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

2550
01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

2551
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:31.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've grown up being,</v>

2552
01:43:31.451 --> 01:43:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm black,</v>

2553
01:43:32.711 --> 01:43:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like I come here,</v>

2554
01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:36.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people I'm saying I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2555
01:43:36.011 --> 01:43:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Like America.</v>

2556
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2557
01:43:37.601 --> 01:43:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're a bad like Frederick</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglass when asked what he leave was I</v>

2558
01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.020
<v Speaker 2>answered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2559
01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck am I going to leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>for when I see something like the moon</v>

2560
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:49.390
<v Speaker 2>landing the China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the growing the plants and landing</v>

2561
01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:50.420
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there what,</v>

2562
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

2563
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2564
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the kind of ship that they</v>

2565
01:43:54.531 --> 01:43:56.140
<v Speaker 2>landed on the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2566
01:43:56.141 --> 01:43:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I put one on the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently landing on the dark side</v>

2567
01:43:59.511 --> 01:44:01.370
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right on the side that we didn't make it</v>

2568
01:44:01.371 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 2>to all or just went and told me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>video of it was a drone.</v>

2569
01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>

2570
01:44:05.031 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of a drone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of that.</v>

2571
01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think about that as a win for</v>
<v Speaker 2>science and for innovation.</v>

2572
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about it in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nations cause I feel like that is done</v>

2573
01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:15.470
<v Speaker 2>by scientists.</v>

2574
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:18.410
<v Speaker 2>That's done by the wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so are you saying we're going to</v>

2575
01:44:18.411 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 2>steal the scientists because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy gave the fucking speech,</v>

2576
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy made it seem like the moon</v>
<v Speaker 2>landing was going to make us the</v>

2577
01:44:24.741 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>preeminent nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the propaganda</v>

2578
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 2>China's going to run it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think,</v>

2579
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:31.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have some fucking amazing</v>

2580
01:44:31.581 --> 01:44:33.950
<v Speaker 2>technology and to deny that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

2581
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:36.260
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that it's important</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody,</v>

2582
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:39.890
<v Speaker 2>everybody be competitive in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they,</v>

2583
01:44:39.891 --> 01:44:41.330
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to make things</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

2584
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.060
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna do that in a vacuum.</v>

2585
01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:47.720
<v Speaker 2>What helps the technological innovation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons why it's so</v>

2586
01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 2>accelerated as there's so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on it,</v>

2587
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a few people trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make cell phones better.</v>

2588
01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.860
<v Speaker 2>I got fucking so many geniuses out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2589
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:57.320
<v Speaker 2>so when I see something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they landed on the moon,</v>

2590
01:44:57.321 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I go did geniuses.</v>

2591
01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:00.440
<v Speaker 2>One you just gave me hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2592
01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 2>they're Chinese people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just people.</v>

2593
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:04.130
<v Speaker 2>We're all just people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2594
01:45:04.210 --> 01:45:05.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that they're going to all</v>

2595
01:45:05.901 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 2>get those people on that side to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way is what we're worried</v>

2596
01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:10.251
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2597
01:45:10.251 --> 01:45:12.350
<v Speaker 2>That we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be US versus them and their</v>

2598
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:16.280
<v Speaker 2>technology is going to impact our lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we frame it as a country.</v>

2599
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always worry about that.</v>

2600
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 2>But you have to admit that that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way we frame it.</v>

2601
01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:21.920
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world that's been,</v>

2602
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:25.190
<v Speaker 2>that happens so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes sense to be worried</v>

2603
01:45:25.191 --> 01:45:27.230
<v Speaker 2>about the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2604
01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on it and I'm on this side of the</v>

2605
01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:31.160
<v Speaker 2>fence so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem with that.</v>

2606
01:45:31.161 --> 01:45:32.730
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2607
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an American,</v>

2608
01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:36.140
<v Speaker 2>so that's what we want to know.</v>

2609
01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:36.760
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2610
01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.020
<v Speaker 2>if red October is going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

2611
01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Russians don't hate us.</v>

2612
01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody has a quarrel with</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody over there.</v>

2613
01:45:44.211 --> 01:45:47.510
<v Speaker 2>It's the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's the hustle is that the</v>

2614
01:45:47.511 --> 01:45:50.980
<v Speaker 2>real interaction is between a very small</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of people that involves all,</v>

2615
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.300
<v Speaker 2>these are the people that are with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some strange reason,</v>

2616
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I think they should just be thrown</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially in a stadium to fight to</v>

2617
01:45:56.211 --> 01:45:59.450
<v Speaker 2>their death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gluten would be the king of the world.</v>

2618
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Fuck everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and that other dude that runs the</v>

2619
01:46:02.991 --> 01:46:04.650
<v Speaker 2>other little country next door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was unreal.</v>

2620
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2621
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:08.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a huge supporter of MMA.</v>

2622
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Fucking bad ass was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some bees over there.</v>

2623
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 2>You and how bad Putin would fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

2624
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't a fight to the death with</v>

2625
01:46:19.881 --> 01:46:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would actually probably bit pooed</v>

2626
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:24.530
<v Speaker 2>versus Obama too.</v>

2627
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2628
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama is probably better than a debate.</v>

2629
01:46:28.730 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pooh who is a real,</v>

2630
01:46:29.841 --> 01:46:30.980
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2631
01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of real real can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to go all the way.</v>

2632
01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Bush one I think was bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe as a younger man that need you to</v>

2633
01:46:41.271 --> 01:46:43.000
<v Speaker 2>leave the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have some killer in.</v>

2634
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2635
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.070
<v Speaker 2>he was a tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I probably have to get all the way</v>

2636
01:46:46.071 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 2>back to Kennedy in terms of physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>prowess and his back was bad.</v>

2637
01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I think you've got to go to Abraham</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln when Lincoln.</v>

2638
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was wiring.</v>

2639
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:56.160
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't that farmer bill farmer</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

2640
01:46:56.161 --> 01:47:00.600
<v Speaker 2>He did wiring those old dudes back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to carry everything true.</v>

2641
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:01.890
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2642
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.400
<v Speaker 2>farm work was real work just carried</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything everywhere.</v>

2643
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:08.430
<v Speaker 2>All those dudes are just wiring as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a wrestler too.</v>

2644
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are,</v>

2645
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.000

2646
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:12.600
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's beloved in my community.</v>

2647
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:13.740
<v Speaker 2>We like them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2648
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:14.603
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.220
<v Speaker 2>He wrote this little thing called</v>
<v Speaker 2>emancipation proclamation.</v>

2650
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that stupid fucking movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they had him as a vampire slayer?</v>

2651
01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

2652
01:47:22.171 --> 01:47:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I saw the trailer and decided maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the one for me.</v>

2653
01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the ones you happier</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids don't ask you to go see.</v>

2654
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Jamie,</v>

2655
01:47:30.961 --> 01:47:32.760
<v Speaker 2>didn't you say it was based on a graphic</v>
<v Speaker 2>novel?</v>

2656
01:47:33.250 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a fun comic book that</v>

2657
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:38.730
<v Speaker 2>somebody made and then they turned it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a movie as a movie.</v>

2658
01:47:38.731 --> 01:47:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It was like so weird as a graphic and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>will probably work better.</v>

2659
01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some things that work that just</v>

2660
01:47:44.171 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 2>stay in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2661
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some realize that movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2662
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Who said the question?</v>

2663
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fun movie.</v>

2664
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was dumb and fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying that's perfect.</v>

2665
01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:55.771
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2666
01:47:55.771 --> 01:47:57.340

<v Speaker 2>Who what?</v>

2668
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:59.783

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2669
01:48:00.210 --> 01:48:03.270

2670
01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Vampires,</v>

2672
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably said another president</v>

2673
01:48:09.551 --> 01:48:10.500
<v Speaker 2>first and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

2674
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:11.530

<v Speaker 1>to meet Mike Tyson.</v>

2776
01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange to hang out and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them like party.</v>

2777
01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.390

<v Speaker 1>around him park there's like 10% of you</v>

2778
01:52:19.391 --> 01:52:21.660

2781
01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 1>When you showed the clip of the 51 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old Mike Tyson and hitting the bag,</v>

2782
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember it as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the first person I see.</v>

2783
01:52:35.021 --> 01:52:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I have two dads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a non bio on the Bio Dad and I,</v>

2784
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.770
<v Speaker 1>he was the first person I had seen in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life where I say this guy could probably</v>

2785
01:52:41.771 --> 01:52:43.170
<v Speaker 1>beat my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2786
01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.440
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Know My,</v>

2787
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:46.850
<v Speaker 1>cause my dad's pretty tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been a policeman,</v>

2788
01:52:46.851 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 1>was pretty good with his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bio day.</v>

2789
01:52:48.861 --> 01:52:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean my non biofire was a six foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

2790
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he played offensive tackle on same high</v>

2791
01:52:53.211 --> 01:52:54.080
<v Speaker 1>school teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dick.</v>

2792
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.860
<v Speaker 1>So I got some pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2793
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:58.070
<v Speaker 1>bad as dad's not there acting tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2794
01:52:58.190 --> 01:53:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you feel protected as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember just seeing Mike Tyson,</v>

2795
01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:01.853
<v Speaker 1>just slight,</v>

2796
01:53:02.230 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got,</v>

2797
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:05.070
<v Speaker 2>could probably fucking kill everything</v>

2798
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:10.170
<v Speaker 1>you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit with such vicious and evil</v>

2799
01:53:10.171 --> 01:53:11.610
<v Speaker 1>intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

2800
01:53:11.970 --> 01:53:13.260
<v Speaker 1>He could still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2801
01:53:13.261 --> 01:53:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So when I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was hitting the bag like he's still</v>

2802
01:53:15.271 --> 01:53:16.130
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2803
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:18.390
<v Speaker 1>If he was a young contender coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would look at him and go,</v>

2804
01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:19.410
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy can punch.</v>

2805
01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have nearly the hand speed</v>

2806
01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:24.120
<v Speaker 1>that he had when he was young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that man.</v>

2807
01:53:24.210 --> 01:53:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the peak.</v>

2808
01:53:27.690 --> 01:53:29.140
<v Speaker 2>He is an amazing story though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2809
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Listening to him describe his childhood</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how custom motto had hypnotized him.</v>

2810
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was amazing because I'd never heard</v>

2811
01:53:36.161 --> 01:53:38.980
<v Speaker 2>him talk about that before and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people need to understand.</v>

2812
01:53:38.981 --> 01:53:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Like who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He people want to say,</v>

2813
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:44.800
<v Speaker 2>oh he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was hyper aggressive and he did</v>

2814
01:53:44.801 --> 01:53:46.960
<v Speaker 2>terrible things and he was violent in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2815
01:53:47.410 --> 01:53:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Think of how this kid grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it forfeit?</v>

2816
01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally or taken in by this one guy,</v>

2817
01:53:54.401 --> 01:53:57.430
<v Speaker 2>the first time in his life where</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything is positive and it's all about</v>

2818
01:53:57.431 --> 01:54:00.580
<v Speaker 2>fighting and being a destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he gets hypnotized by this guy to be</v>

2819
01:54:00.581 --> 01:54:03.100
<v Speaker 2>a destroyer and he's a physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>specimen.</v>

2820
01:54:03.130 --> 01:54:04.650
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put your hand,</v>

2821
01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you grab his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just his hand,</v>

2822
01:54:06.881 --> 01:54:11.080
<v Speaker 2>like his whole body's like carved out</v>
<v Speaker 2>above a large block of rock.</v>

2823
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:12.550
<v Speaker 2>He's a tank of a man.</v>

2824
01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:13.061
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2825
01:54:13.061 --> 01:54:16.780
<v Speaker 2>still to this day he's a tank and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was young,</v>

2826
01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:19.540
<v Speaker 2>they saw that right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teddy Alison on this podcast that when</v>

2827
01:54:19.541 --> 01:54:24.541
<v Speaker 2>Mike was 1,390 pounds and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe he was 13 they thought we were</v>

2828
01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:25.930
<v Speaker 2>sandbagging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they,</v>

2829
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:27.880
<v Speaker 2>they put them in at 16 he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2830
01:54:27.881 --> 01:54:30.790
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say 16 nobody would believe he's 13 and</v>

2831
01:54:30.791 --> 01:54:32.880
<v Speaker 2>they would come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're shutting these fucking kids.</v>

2832
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.410
<v Speaker 2>They did want to believe it and he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him have it.</v>

2833
01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.221
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2834
01:54:36.221 --> 01:54:37.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because he said people were always</v>

2835
01:54:37.751 --> 01:54:40.330
<v Speaker 2>lying about how many fights people had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would always say,</v>

01:54:40.331 --> 01:54:42.400
<v Speaker 2>he's only had 10 fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see the guy move immediately.</v>

2837
01:54:42.401 --> 01:54:42.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

01:54:42.941 --> 01:54:46.840
<v Speaker 2>this guy's at 50 fights watching him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Teddy was saying that that was</v>

<v Speaker 2>always the hustle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody always lied a little bit</v>

01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:38.140
<v Speaker 2>characters and got mad at me for a while</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no disrespect,</v>

2855
01:55:38.141 --> 01:55:41.350
<v Speaker 2>but there was guys that just like pink</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olan Thomas who's a champion and Tony</v>

2856
01:55:41.351 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 2>tubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't the kind of guy that you</v>

2857
01:55:43.861 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2858
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.960
<v Speaker 1>look forward to seeing as being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion of the world.</v>

2859
01:55:45.961 --> 01:55:46.830
<v Speaker 1>You didn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2860
01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that's the toughest guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

2861
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It might be a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's a tough guy.</v>

2862
01:55:50.581 --> 01:55:52.740
<v Speaker 1>He's a professional boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's the best guy.</v>

2863
01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And then Tyson came along very is</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect name.</v>

2864
01:55:56.461 --> 01:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>He had the perfect look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the perfect body,</v>

2865
01:55:58.231 --> 01:56:00.720
<v Speaker 1>the perfect image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came at the perfect time.</v>

2866
01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

2867
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.800
<v Speaker 1>when you look at hip hop and where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was and where Mike was at the time,</v>

2868
01:56:05.070 --> 01:56:08.010
<v Speaker 1>it was a perfect synergy for him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a hero.</v>

2869
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Jordan,</v>

2870
01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:14.610
<v Speaker 1>like these people became icon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at a time where the United States,</v>

2871
01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:19.770
<v Speaker 1>like in the 80s after getting opaque</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking ass and the debt crisis fucking</v>

2872
01:56:19.771 --> 01:56:24.030
<v Speaker 1>up the 70s our ranch shit at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies early eighties I steal.</v>

2873
01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I remember my grandfather worked at hall</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>

2874
01:56:25.801 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 1>remember steal my other grandfather</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel leaving America.</v>

2875
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I remember like it just kind of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't as proud and he was one</v>

2876
01:56:35.641 --> 01:56:40.641
<v Speaker 1>of those things that may you feel bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and the Times feel dangerous and he</v>

2877
01:56:41.251 --> 01:56:44.440
<v Speaker 1>was black and those little boxes and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't wear the boots.</v>

2878
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:48.210
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't flashy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was a perfect villain at a time</v>

2879
01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:51.750
<v Speaker 1>where Villainy Nwa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying was was</v>

2880
01:56:51.751 --> 01:56:55.380
<v Speaker 1>celebrated danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was perfect for the time and</v>

2881
01:56:55.381 --> 01:56:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he's perfectly now like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike is when I hear him interview and I</v>

2882
01:56:58.861 --> 01:57:01.080
<v Speaker 1>really talk and people make fun of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>

2883
01:57:01.081 --> 01:57:03.660
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that gets in the way of you</v>

2884
01:57:03.661 --> 01:57:06.150
<v Speaker 1>hearing the real wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying a lot of times,</v>

2885
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:11.040
<v Speaker 1>like Mike is repeatedly talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>change and about growth and about how he</v>

2886
01:57:11.041 --> 01:57:14.280
<v Speaker 1>doesn't see things the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if we actually listened to</v>

2887
01:57:14.281 --> 01:57:16.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of challenged us to do the same</v>

2888
01:57:16.621 --> 01:57:18.540
<v Speaker 1>shit that we really don't want to do.</v>

2889
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:18.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

2890
01:57:18.991 --> 01:57:22.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the rare guys that you'll talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that accomplished an insane amount,</v>

2891
01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:26.340
<v Speaker 1>literally became one of the most famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers in the history of the sport.</v>

2892
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And you talk about him now and all he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do is dismiss that past life.</v>

2893
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.050
<v Speaker 1>He went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he like I was,</v>

2894
01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I was silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2895
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:34.680
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a silly person.</v>

2896
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a real warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

2897
01:57:36.691 --> 01:57:37.530
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2898
01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:40.120
<v Speaker 1>he is like in a class that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled.</v>

2899
01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:42.600
<v Speaker 1>He's the reluctant teacher almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2900
01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.441
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2901
01:57:43.441 --> 01:57:44.430

<v Speaker 1>you do a movie.</v>

2904
01:57:46.891 --> 01:57:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Mike is the guy who used a student go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beg to teach you to fight and you want</v>

2905
01:57:50.690 --> 01:57:52.380
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know why he won't teach you</v>

2906
01:57:52.381 --> 01:57:54.000
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you find out later your</v>

2907
01:57:54.001 --> 01:57:55.170
<v Speaker 1>teacher killed someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2908
01:57:55.171 --> 01:57:58.260
<v Speaker 1>in the ring or some shit like he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is really that character.</v>

2909
01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 1>He is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2910
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you can tell even with the pigeons back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the days that there's kindness and</v>

2911
01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 1>love in there somewhere and now he gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>to express it to human beings.</v>

2912
01:58:09.630 --> 01:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>You just see he's a happier person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2913
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Until you bring up don king's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2915
01:58:14.761 --> 01:58:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get scared.</v>

2916
01:58:16.111 --> 01:58:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to fucking beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my dad too.</v>

2917
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:21.510

<v Speaker 1>the crazy thing about him selling weed</v>

2918
01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:24.170
<v Speaker 1>now is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they chart,</v>

2919
01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:27.240
<v Speaker 1>what did they charge him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>$300,000 I think for he tested positive</v>

2920
01:58:27.450 --> 01:58:32.340
<v Speaker 1>for the Andrew Gelada fight for weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they find him $300,000 they just</v>

2921
01:58:32.341 --> 01:58:34.620
<v Speaker 1>stole money from him cause he had weed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the system.</v>

2922
01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he sells weed.</v>

2923
01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Ain't going to nfl guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So should let everybody smoke</v>

2924
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.630
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for your brain if you're,</v>

2925
01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're doing something</v>

2926
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 2>like slamming into each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running 30 miles an hour.</v>

2927
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably good to give them</v>

2928
01:58:50.291 --> 01:58:54.670
<v Speaker 2>something to calm them down or release</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the inflammation.</v>

2929
01:58:55.930 --> 01:58:56.763
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2930
01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:59.170
<v Speaker 2>grown adults telling you you can or</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do it.</v>

2931
01:58:59.171 --> 01:59:01.930
<v Speaker 2>It's just what's ridiculous about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the day,</v>

2932
01:59:02.110 --> 01:59:05.500
<v Speaker 2>a grown adult telling you they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones who say you shouldn't smoke</v>

2933
01:59:05.501 --> 01:59:06.730
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't do it.</v>

2934
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.490
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what they're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't ever done it.</v>

2935
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>The ones who do or don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the ones who have and like,</v>

2936
01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to get high anymore.</v>

2937
01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:14.471
<v Speaker 2>Those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2938
01:59:14.471 --> 01:59:14.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2939
01:59:14.831 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to you don't like to do it.</v>

2940
01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Fucks with your productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2941
01:59:18.191 --> 01:59:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you never done it and you're</v>

2942
01:59:20.191 --> 01:59:22.420
<v Speaker 2>talking shit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know the benefits.</v>

2943
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:23.770
<v Speaker 2>You really just want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>

2944
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:26.770
<v Speaker 2>There's benefits to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some people get</v>

2945
01:59:26.771 --> 01:59:31.390
<v Speaker 2>fucked up by everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's weed or alcohol or speed.</v>

2946
01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 2>People get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just fucked up.</v>

2947
01:59:33.191 --> 01:59:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I been a drill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2948
01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:36.880
<v Speaker 2>but I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can honestly tell you that I read an</v>

2949
01:59:36.881 --> 01:59:41.881
<v Speaker 2>article in huff or something years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>that talked about parents who smoked and</v>

2950
01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:45.090
<v Speaker 2>stoners actually being more engaged with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their children.</v>

2951
01:59:45.091 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't mean you get up and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fried the first thing in the</v>

2952
01:59:47.831 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take your kid to school,</v>

2953
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:54.390
<v Speaker 2>but it does mean that were drinkers or</v>
<v Speaker 2>smokers would come home and almost avoid</v>

2954
01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:58.390
<v Speaker 2>the child to smoke or drink or do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something else or had other things going</v>

2955
01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:01.060
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stoner with literally pop up may take a</v>

2956
02:00:01.061 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 2>hit or two of the joint and the focus</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be more on just being the child</v>

2957
02:00:04.661 --> 02:00:05.680
<v Speaker 2>parenting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of kicking it,</v>

2958
02:00:05.681 --> 02:00:06.514
<v Speaker 2>cooling it.</v>

2959
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're way more curious when you're</v>

2960
02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:10.660
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're just a little bit high and</v>

2961
02:00:10.661 --> 02:00:11.980
<v Speaker 2>you're around kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2962
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.610
<v Speaker 2>you would be thinking more the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking or trying to be a</v>

2963
02:00:15.611 --> 02:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>little calmer with them and a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

2964
02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:21.730
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you more relaxed person.</v>

2965
02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the anxiety is given to you.</v>

2966
02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>She asked out the shower writing to God</v>
<v Speaker 2>was shook one that's talked about and he</v>

2967
02:00:29.351 --> 02:00:31.160
<v Speaker 2>talked very openly about anxiety in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2968
02:00:31.170 --> 02:00:31.871
<v Speaker 2>And he's wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2969
02:00:31.871 --> 02:00:34.270
<v Speaker 2>these are the people I like to see you</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up too is a great,</v>

2970
02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I got that on tape too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that one in audio.</v>

2971
02:00:36.731 --> 02:00:38.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not as it was listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running.</v>

2972
02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like man there who cause he,</v>

2973
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 2>he reads it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2974
02:00:40.571 --> 02:00:43.000
<v Speaker 2>We don't acknowledge that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the African American community</v>

2975
02:00:43.001 --> 02:00:45.280
<v Speaker 2>kidney disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that plays and not just</v>

2976
02:00:45.281 --> 02:00:50.140
<v Speaker 2>diet carrying around stress and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety is bad for your kidneys.</v>

2977
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.360
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you're fearing stressed</v>

2978
02:00:51.370 --> 02:00:53.230
<v Speaker 2>beats up the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2979
02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2980
02:00:54.110 --> 02:00:56.920
<v Speaker 2>it's very important for all of us to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest about how we feel.</v>

2981
02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes,</v>

2982
02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>it makes you brave enough to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>express honestly what everybody is</v>

2983
02:01:02.951 --> 02:01:05.080
<v Speaker 2>probably feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it scared to bring up cause they</v>

2984
02:01:05.081 --> 02:01:06.480
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be thought of as weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2985
02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:08.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be a whiny bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2986
02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't want to tell you what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on that's wrong.</v>

2987
02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:12.820
<v Speaker 2>But especially something like anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man did the,</v>

2988
02:01:12.821 --> 02:01:16.600
<v Speaker 2>the delicate balance of chemicals that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist in the human mind and how much it</v>

2989
02:01:16.601 --> 02:01:19.660
<v Speaker 2>can be affected by stress and</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships and life in general and</v>

2990
02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:23.950
<v Speaker 2>your diet and all these other factors</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's genetic issues and</v>

2991
02:01:23.951 --> 02:01:26.200
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just have problems.</v>

2992
02:01:26.250 --> 02:01:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wound tight and you can get help if</v>

2993
02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you can get help.</v>

2994
02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll get help through cognitive therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get help through medication.</v>

2995
02:01:33.491 --> 02:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ecstasy should help people,</v>

2996
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 2>that they should be able to do MTMA</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy for a lot people with stress.</v>

2997
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of talk of that now and now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing,</v>

2998
02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:45.320
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you making the decision on what to put</v>

2999
02:01:45.321 --> 02:01:46.280
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3000
02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 2>It's more in line with right than wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well especially if there's science</v>

3001
02:01:50.001 --> 02:01:50.870
<v Speaker 2>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3002
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>like if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they allowed it to be legal,</v>

3003
02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>then you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would allow it to be regulated,</v>

3004
02:01:55.761 --> 02:01:58.970
<v Speaker 2>which means you would allow it to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would know exactly how many</v>

3005
02:01:58.971 --> 02:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>milligrams of this is in this and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much you should take.</v>

3006
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>If you weigh 112 pounds versus you weigh</v>
<v Speaker 2>212 pounds,</v>

3007
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>that all those things should be taken in</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration by science.</v>

3008
02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And if we had that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we just had freedom,</v>

3009
02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I can see that.</v>

3010
02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hub,</v>

3011
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:18.840
<v Speaker 2>they're having a lot of studies are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of success rather with um,</v>

3012
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 2>veterans and treating veterans with MDA</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maps,</v>

3013
02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maps the psychedelic organization,</v>

3014
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.670
<v Speaker 2>no heard of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're an organization that is working</v>

3015
02:02:28.671 --> 02:02:31.640
<v Speaker 2>to try to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make psychedelics legal.</v>

3016
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that are pushing</v>

3017
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:38.390
<v Speaker 2>initially is this mtma study that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done with veterans and they're</v>

3018
02:02:38.391 --> 02:02:43.391
<v Speaker 2>showing a significant benefit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduction of PTSD and stress from</v>

3019
02:02:43.610 --> 02:02:45.770
<v Speaker 2>veterans to come home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've seen a lot of shit over</v>

3020
02:02:45.771 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 2>there and they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3021
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:50.270
<v Speaker 2>fucked up from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be one of the best</v>

3022
02:02:50.271 --> 02:02:53.510
<v Speaker 2>things I've ever found and discovered</v>
<v Speaker 2>for alleviating.</v>

3023
02:02:53.511 --> 02:02:55.490
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that they've used it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

3024
02:02:55.491 --> 02:02:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I think John Hopkins had one they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Siliciden,</v>

3025
02:02:58.490 --> 02:03:01.100
<v Speaker 2>same sort of result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give people psychedelics under</v>

3026
02:03:01.101 --> 02:03:06.101
<v Speaker 2>controlled situations and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big alleviation of stress from the past.</v>

3027
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:09.380
<v Speaker 2>They can let things go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got introduced to mushrooms.</v>

3028
02:03:09.610 --> 02:03:10.443
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

3030
02:03:11.661 --> 02:03:15.230
<v Speaker 2>and that was a beautiful experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I introduced my wife to him because of</v>

3031
02:03:15.231 --> 02:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can,</v>

3032
02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I can definitely see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>from yesterday.</v>

3043
02:03:39.650 --> 02:03:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Apparently Richard Rawlings brought this</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinnamon Tequila and some of it had</v>

3044
02:03:43.581 --> 02:03:46.910

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found it and when we got here it</v>

3050
02:03:57.531 --> 02:03:59.120
<v Speaker 2>was covered with ants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrunk aunts.</v>

3051
02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 2>My wife made me hang out at a bar all</v>
<v Speaker 2>night last night with her and her</v>

02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:12.320
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like good night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throwing up an uber,</v>

3056
02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:14.840
<v Speaker 2>like how many times does that happen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>those poor bastards?</v>

3057
02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tipped the God damn near $100 I was</v>

3058
02:04:18.771 --> 02:04:19.041
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3059
02:04:19.041 --> 02:04:19.840
<v Speaker 2>oh sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Row.</v>

3060
02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:23.940
<v Speaker 2>You know how much puke a large amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not ge,</v>

3061
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but enough to be aggravated because she</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a bag.</v>

3062
02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:31.070
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think that the bad catches,</v>

3063
02:04:31.071 --> 02:04:33.200
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3064
02:04:33.201 --> 02:04:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I thought it it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3065
02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 2>it gave a little leak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get that smell out,</v>

3066
02:04:36.741 --> 02:04:40.260
<v Speaker 2>that smell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's caused about 150 bucks to get it</v>

3067
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

3068
02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Piecemeal out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really that shit is in your body.</v>

3069
02:04:43.291 --> 02:04:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Like imagine if you turn yourself inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3070
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Probably Smell</v>
<v Speaker 2>pubes first far to the morning.</v>

3071
02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>But puke smelled is something in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

3072
02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:53.550
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't like Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hot Yoga,</v>

3073
02:04:53.551 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 2>rather regular yoga I can endure.</v>

02:06:03.211 --> 02:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I let go into the early classes.</v>

3106
02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Do your side of the same day you hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga?</v>

3107
02:06:07.890 --> 02:06:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time,</v>

3108
02:06:09.151 --> 02:06:10.080
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time,</v>

3109
02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:12.390
<v Speaker 2>no double door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

3110
02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:14.460
<v Speaker 2>if I have an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have something that's fucking with</v>

3111
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:15.630
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3112
02:06:15.930 --> 02:06:18.270
<v Speaker 2>if I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost consider it like a sauna</v>

3113
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:20.010
<v Speaker 2>because you get so God damn hot.</v>

3114
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Like the room might only be 104 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're working out hard doing</v>

3115
02:06:23.791 --> 02:06:26.250
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is poor and sweat.</v>

3116
02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:30.690
<v Speaker 2>You must be heated up as warm as you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sauna.</v>

3117
02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:32.420
<v Speaker 2>It feels the same way to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

3118
02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It feels like almost like I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work out in the sauna.</v>

3119
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doing some study now at Harvard</v>

3120
02:06:38.911 --> 02:06:42.480
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a heat shock proteins and hot</v>

3121
02:06:42.481 --> 02:06:44.820
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know how much inflammation it</v>

3122
02:06:44.821 --> 02:06:48.750
<v Speaker 2>reduces and how beneficial is to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what scientists were involved</v>

3123
02:06:48.751 --> 02:06:49.920
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a bunch of people were talking about</v>

3124
02:06:49.921 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 2>it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it definitely gets gas at your</v>

3125
02:06:52.351 --> 02:06:54.300
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely does so well.</v>

3126
02:06:54.301 --> 02:06:57.030
<v Speaker 2>If you have something that you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat and like eat a hot dog with</v>

3127
02:06:57.031 --> 02:07:01.080
<v Speaker 2>sauerkraut and a coke and then two hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>later tried to go to yoga class,</v>

3128
02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you're a criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a terrible person.</v>

3129
02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Mofo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's nowhere for that far to go</v>

3130
02:07:10.441 --> 02:07:11.870
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stuck in the hot day.</v>

3131
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

3132
02:07:12.991 --> 02:07:17.190
<v Speaker 2>It stays there that you get the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>earthy chicks,</v>

3133
02:07:17.191 --> 02:07:21.000
<v Speaker 2>they burn sage and then that starts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffocate you and you gotta leave the</v>

3134
02:07:21.001 --> 02:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>real earthy chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:07:22.730 --> 02:07:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you know sage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone told me this check and see if</v>

3136
02:07:25.741 --> 02:07:27.390
<v Speaker 2>this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we might've talked about this</v>

3137
02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:30.360
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Salvia is sage.</v>

3138
02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Salvia divinorum someone said is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same shit as sage.</v>

3139
02:07:35.770 --> 02:07:36.603
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3140
02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic Shay and says she uses sage</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning first.</v>

3141
02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really like the way it smelled.</v>

3142
02:07:43.181 --> 02:07:46.840
<v Speaker 2>And now it's almost addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a beautiful smell.</v>

3143
02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:48.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird smell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>

3144
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Someone said it's like related to to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salvia divinorum like there's so close</v>

3145
02:07:53.451 --> 02:07:55.930
<v Speaker 2>he related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that that might've been why</v>

3146
02:07:55.931 --> 02:07:58.930
<v Speaker 2>they call it sage stoned off stage.</v>

3147
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:01.510
<v Speaker 2>You get a little buzz or something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying [inaudible] smell.</v>

3148
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I've never really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never caught a sage buzz.</v>

3149
02:08:04.210 --> 02:08:04.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3150
02:08:04.911 --> 02:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but it does calm you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3151
02:08:06.791 --> 02:08:08.500
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I walk in the room and I smell</v>

3152
02:08:08.501 --> 02:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I instantly feel just like,</v>

3153
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sages,</v>

3154
02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>the common stages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Official name is Salvia office and</v>

3155
02:08:17.561 --> 02:08:19.450
<v Speaker 2>novelists or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a cousin.</v>

3156
02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:22.770
<v Speaker 2>The salvia divinorum sort of like genius</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe is solid.</v>

3157
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:24.730
<v Speaker 2>We never know if I could say Janice or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenice.</v>

3158
02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I was panic on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's Chino.</v>

3159
02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's uh,</v>

3160
02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's where the name sage</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>

3161
02:08:32.141 --> 02:08:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Cause the sage is a wide per a wise</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

3162
02:08:34.590 --> 02:08:37.720
<v Speaker 2>It came from the use of some trippy</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>

3163
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be or might just have some</v>

3164
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:44.530
<v Speaker 2>other strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you find out?</v>

3165
02:08:44.531 --> 02:08:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the origin of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3166
02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.830
<v Speaker 2>the word sage.</v>

3167
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the mint family.</v>

3168
02:08:49.751 --> 02:08:51.520
<v Speaker 2>So that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it called sage?</v>

3169
02:08:51.521 --> 02:08:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Sage was once considered a medicinal</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure.</v>

3170
02:08:53.831 --> 02:08:58.120
<v Speaker 2>All sage is an herb that has a sweet yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>savory flavor.</v>

3171
02:08:58.150 --> 02:09:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Sage botanical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He known as Salvia efficient.</v>

3172
02:09:00.521 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Novelis is native to the Mediterranean</v>
<v Speaker 2>regions.</v>

3173
02:09:03.521 --> 02:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Sage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sage is botanical name comes from the</v>

3174
02:09:06.521 --> 02:09:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Latin word salver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means to be saved.</v>

3175
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

3176
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So why do they call it sage then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone calls it Salvia and Salvia,</v>

3177
02:09:19.391 --> 02:09:22.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we call it sage.</v>

3178
02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Why do we change the name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still doesn't,</v>

3179
02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:28.660
<v Speaker 2>doesn't say why we changed the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3180
02:09:28.661 --> 02:09:31.660
<v Speaker 2>The botanical name makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes from the word salver,</v>

3181
02:09:31.661 --> 02:09:32.950
<v Speaker 2>meaning to be saved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

3182
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:35.890
<v Speaker 2>But why sage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean like we like an English?</v>

3183
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we say shop at it from however</v>

3184
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:40.000
<v Speaker 2>they were using it back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean region.</v>

3185
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Whatever word they use is probably very</v>
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>

3186
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 2>But they always like treat you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stupid.</v>

3187
02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to have a botanical name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bitch,</v>

3188
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:47.980
<v Speaker 2>just tell me the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the name?</v>

3189
02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have two names?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3190
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:52.540
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it sage or is it foster?</v>

3191
02:09:52.541 --> 02:09:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Mitis eyelid ptosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hominin he sage.</v>

3192
02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Definitely easy to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy ass names.</v>

3193
02:09:58.421 --> 02:10:00.430
<v Speaker 2>You guys want to give them at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

3194

<v Speaker 2>Little people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>let's just call it sage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Salvage Salvia.</v>

3202
02:10:13.841 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Norum cat do it.</v>

3203
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever experienced that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salvia?</v>

3204
02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that was one of the ones</v>

3205
02:10:23.051 --> 02:10:26.240
<v Speaker 2>that slipped through the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3206
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.650
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic Dac data sweeping act that</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a bunch of things illegal,</v>

3207
02:10:29.890 --> 02:10:32.140
<v Speaker 2>including apparently some of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made illegal aren't even</v>

3208
02:10:32.141 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just to make everything illegal,</v>

3209
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:36.530
<v Speaker 2>but they missed Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it used to be able to buy it.</v>

3210
02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.670
<v Speaker 2>You see have to go to a gas station and</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy Salvia and trip your fucking balls</v>

3211
02:10:40.671 --> 02:10:42.530
<v Speaker 2>or what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the Salvia trip line?</v>

3212
02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only did it once and it was really</v>

3213
02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:46.430
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

3214
02:10:46.670 --> 02:10:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I did enough because Ari</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shaffir had a entire life he lived for</v>

3215
02:10:52.011 --> 02:10:55.430
<v Speaker 2>three months in one Salvia trip that</v>
<v Speaker 2>took 10 minutes.</v>

3216
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:57.500
<v Speaker 2>We talked to him about is the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking story.</v>

3217
02:10:57.501 --> 02:10:59.960
<v Speaker 2>He had relationships and breakups and</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs and,</v>

3218
02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.640
<v Speaker 2>and he lived a different life and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>woke up on the couch in 10 minutes</v>

3219
02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:05.840
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>

3220
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lived underwater,</v>

3221
02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:08.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3222
02:11:08.010 --> 02:11:08.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3223
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Just wrapping balls on this stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could buy from the gas station.</v>

3224
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Ssi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Chrism.</v>

3225
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to stay in very dense and to</v>

3226
02:11:19.051 --> 02:11:21.840
<v Speaker 2>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are times where I a very</v>

3227
02:11:21.841 --> 02:11:24.030
<v Speaker 2>dissident in the mushrooms kind of take</v>
<v Speaker 2>me on the trip.</v>

3228
02:11:24.031 --> 02:11:25.430
<v Speaker 2>He ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3229
02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:26.480
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3230
02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how far I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a scary,</v>

3231
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:30.590
<v Speaker 2>there's already right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's him tripping.</v>

3232
02:11:30.591 --> 02:11:32.810
<v Speaker 2>They got it all on video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3233
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Him and this is some stuff that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's legal anymore.</v>

3234
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I think they've made it illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you used to be able to buy it</v>

3235
02:11:40.011 --> 02:11:41.930
<v Speaker 2>virtually anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Head shops,</v>

3236
02:11:41.931 --> 02:11:44.150
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all carried it and it's so much</v>

3237
02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:48.700
<v Speaker 2>more potent than weed but yet legal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a long history of people using it to</v>

3238
02:11:50.010 --> 02:11:52.020
<v Speaker 2>char repin.</v>

3239
02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:53.840
<v Speaker 2>So when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get any of that,</v>

3240
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:57.200
<v Speaker 2>but I did get a third.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want you to be that trip and</v>

3241
02:11:57.210 --> 02:11:58.820
<v Speaker 2>you're a strong guy.</v>

3243
02:12:00.210 --> 02:12:01.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want it.</v>

3244
02:12:01.011 --> 02:12:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have to be the homie</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save the homie from itself and the</v>

3245
02:12:04.071 --> 02:12:06.230
<v Speaker 2>homies to physically fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fun.</v>

3246
02:12:06.250 --> 02:12:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have Hershel Walker's tripping bad</v>

3247
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:11.970
<v Speaker 2>mom partial than the other room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kit has all names,</v>

3248
02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You call the police [inaudible] who was</v>

3249
02:12:14.781 --> 02:12:17.250
<v Speaker 2>kicking his old ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save us,</v>

3250
02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send Ronnie Coleman.</v>

3251
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>You would literally have to have cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>asides or Ronnie Coleman and they still</v>

3252
02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:23.390
<v Speaker 2>can fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would still be fuck.</v>

3253
02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3254
02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I saw myself from like outside my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>

3255
02:12:29.131 --> 02:12:31.610
<v Speaker 2>like it would pulsate in my body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of my body,</v>

3256
02:12:31.611 --> 02:12:35.510
<v Speaker 2>in my body and outside my body from like</v>
<v Speaker 2>over here looking down at myself.</v>

3257
02:12:35.710 --> 02:12:36.501
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom,</v>

3258
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:39.650
<v Speaker 2>when she had me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she died on the table for a few seconds.</v>

3259
02:12:39.710 --> 02:12:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Jesus and she said she saw herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that is cause that's the</v>

3260
02:12:44.151 --> 02:12:47.360
<v Speaker 2>same thing that everybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean regardless of your religious</v>

3261
02:12:47.361 --> 02:12:50.180
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop for a second and try to figure</v>

3262
02:12:50.181 --> 02:12:55.181
<v Speaker 2>out why so many people see themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>from above their body see themselves</v>

3263
02:12:56.121 --> 02:12:57.620
<v Speaker 2>outside their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>

3264
02:12:57.650 --> 02:12:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know one.</v>

3265
02:12:58.400 --> 02:12:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all,</v>

3266
02:12:59.690 --> 02:13:03.180
<v Speaker 2>all people and even science kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree at this point through the body is</v>

3267
02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:06.500
<v Speaker 2>just a vehicle of sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So machine of sorts that whatever energy</v>

3268
02:13:06.501 --> 02:13:09.200
<v Speaker 2>or solve the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are people trying to identify this?</v>

3269
02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:12.090
<v Speaker 2>It's within it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3270
02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.870
<v Speaker 2>it does disconnect out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>

3271
02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that they figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put myself in a computer before I die.</v>

3272
02:13:18.051 --> 02:13:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to live a couple hundred more</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3273
02:13:19.701 --> 02:13:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Fuck off.</v>

3274
02:13:20.130 --> 02:13:21.740
<v Speaker 2>So what if it sucks though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3275
02:13:21.741 --> 02:13:24.080
<v Speaker 2>What if I like to try to be alive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3276
02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.670
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a computer,</v>

3277
02:13:25.671 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 2>you can't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3278
02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying if you're 89 and you're about</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the fuck outta here,</v>

3279
02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:35.140
<v Speaker 2>you got the opportunity to upload right</v>
<v Speaker 2>into 29 again for the next 29 years.</v>

3280
02:13:35.281 --> 02:13:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Like Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

3281
02:13:36.631 --> 02:13:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I might try that before I decided to</v>
<v Speaker 2>click on out of there.</v>

3282
02:13:39.011 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to be able to</v>

3283
02:13:40.321 --> 02:13:43.860
<v Speaker 2>reverse aging and I think they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to do that before they're</v>

3284
02:13:43.861 --> 02:13:46.230
<v Speaker 2>going to figure out a way to get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a machine.</v>

3285
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:48.060
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the real problem,</v>

3286
02:13:48.061 --> 02:13:50.970
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a guy like trump putting himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like a million machines.</v>

3287
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Just not one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One.</v>

3288
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who has like a Ted Turner</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bankroll says I like about a million</v>

3289
02:13:57.961 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 2>texts in this town.</v>

3290
02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Starts Breeding Ted's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3291
02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:05.040
<v Speaker 2>but the butthead robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trump ain't got ted money now.</v>

3292
02:14:05.041 --> 02:14:07.200
<v Speaker 2>He might not have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got money for a few robots.</v>

3293
02:14:07.201 --> 02:14:07.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3294
02:14:07.671 --> 02:14:08.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3295
02:14:08.051 --> 02:14:09.960
<v Speaker 2>And those monies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those robots to go out and make more</v>

3296
02:14:09.961 --> 02:14:12.030
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are Robots going to destroy us?</v>

3297
02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:15.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good question and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that Elon Musk is actually</v>

3298
02:14:15.871 --> 02:14:17.190
<v Speaker 2>scared of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3299
02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a little deval says it's going to</v>

3300
02:14:19.261 --> 02:14:21.570
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very intelligent guy to just,</v>

3301
02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:26.220
<v Speaker 2>besides making a good record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks about us essentially replacing</v>

3302
02:14:26.221 --> 02:14:28.620
<v Speaker 2>each other with robots soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible.</v>

3303
02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:31.080
<v Speaker 2>The Way Ilan Musk looks at it is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3304
02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.900
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to warn people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't listening and that</v>

3305
02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:38.430
<v Speaker 2>there's no telling how powerful they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could get once they become sentient,</v>

3306
02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:42.010
<v Speaker 2>once they start taking control of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own destiny and creating new robots and,</v>

3307
02:14:42.210 --> 02:14:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and just deciding whether or not we live</v>
<v Speaker 2>or die and how they're going to run</v>

3308
02:14:45.661 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're essentially,</v>

3309
02:14:46.710 --> 02:14:49.830
<v Speaker 2>they're going to become a life form and</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial life form that's way fucking</v>

3310
02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:50.550
<v Speaker 2>smarter than us.</v>

3311
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's saying,</v>

3312
02:14:51.481 --> 02:14:53.580
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's smart to arm these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

3313
02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:55.020
<v Speaker 2>They've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's smart to make this,</v>

3314
02:14:55.021 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 2>like he's looking at it in terms of he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tip of the spear.</v>

3315
02:14:58.351 --> 02:15:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it comes to technology and an</v>

3316
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.950
<v Speaker 2>implementation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3317
02:15:01.951 --> 02:15:03.090
<v Speaker 2>think about who this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3318
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:06.810
<v Speaker 2>If he's the one who's telling you</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's kind of slow the fuck down.</v>

3319
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:10.410
<v Speaker 2>This is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally might be making a</v>

3320
02:15:10.411 --> 02:15:11.500
<v Speaker 2>terminator movie here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3321
02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:13.650
<v Speaker 2>He's literally might be making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terminator movie.</v>

3322
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to worry because we,</v>

3323
02:15:15.930 --> 02:15:18.600
<v Speaker 2>when were you were saying that you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved from monkeys?</v>

3324
02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 2>We evolve from some lower thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3325
02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:23.010
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that we got to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3326
02:15:23.011 --> 02:15:27.000
<v Speaker 2>if we might hit a biological bottleneck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that might be the whole convergence</v>

3327
02:15:27.001 --> 02:15:29.910
<v Speaker 2>of humans and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be what it's all about.</v>

3328
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Like biologically this system doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>move fast enough,</v>

3329
02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:35.820
<v Speaker 2>but if we can transcend this and move</v>
<v Speaker 2>into some sort of a digital life,</v>

3330
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:39.660
<v Speaker 2>that life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can accelerate all of the innovation,</v>

3331
02:15:39.661 --> 02:15:44.160
<v Speaker 2>all of the improvements in insane</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers like years traveled through</v>

3332
02:15:44.161 --> 02:15:45.920
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the fucking,</v>

3333
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:50.960
<v Speaker 2>the nature of life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to probably be one of the</v>

3334
02:15:51.211 --> 02:15:53.340
<v Speaker 2>stages of our future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's a thousand years from now</v>

3335
02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:56.250
<v Speaker 2>or a hundred thousand years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me like with this adoption</v>

3336
02:15:56.251 --> 02:16:00.630
<v Speaker 2>of science and into our daily lives in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like the technologies that</v>

3337
02:16:00.631 --> 02:16:03.570
<v Speaker 2>we're all addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones and tablets and all these</v>

3338
02:16:03.571 --> 02:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>different things going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that we're a Cyborg is already</v>

3339
02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:08.970
<v Speaker 2>your extension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Niesr this is just a rudimentary way.</v>

3340
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's ready for sure.</v>

3341
02:16:10.291 --> 02:16:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You already living people already living</v>

3342
02:16:12.121 --> 02:16:12.954
<v Speaker 2>through this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3343
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:15.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and he's also coming out with</v>

3344
02:16:15.061 --> 02:16:16.500
<v Speaker 2>something called neuro link.</v>

3345
02:16:16.530 --> 02:16:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very vague about it,</v>

3346
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:22.230
<v Speaker 2>but he was saying he was going to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bandwidth to change your,</v>

3347
02:16:22.231 --> 02:16:26.190
<v Speaker 2>your like your ability to access</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and people are going to wear</v>

3348
02:16:26.191 --> 02:16:28.050
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where this thing on your head,</v>

3349
02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 2>it's going to literally charge up your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking brain.</v>

3350
02:16:30.221 --> 02:16:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Some strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange days because he couldn't,</v>

3351
02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:35.170
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't explain too much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was saying it was going to come</v>

3352
02:16:35.171 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 2>out in a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3353
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.930
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fuck man.</v>

3354
02:16:39.210 --> 02:16:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Were we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3355
02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>30 or 40 years away from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>unrecognizable.</v>

3356
02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:47.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're 30 or 40 years away from</v>

3357
02:16:47.831 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 2>being a living in la at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in a virtual world,</v>

3358
02:16:51.941 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 2>half the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in an augmented world.</v>

3359
02:16:54.430 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I think people are going to exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these weird worlds where it feels real</v>

3360
02:16:58.181 --> 02:16:59.014
<v Speaker 2>and isn't.</v>

3361
02:16:59.410 --> 02:17:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to come out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs that are fun at first,</v>

3362
02:17:02.081 --> 02:17:06.250
<v Speaker 2>but then become life consuming where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put on these fucking goggles and this</v>

3363
02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.740
<v Speaker 2>suit and you go into this world and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>live with these people in it and</v>

3364
02:17:09.741 --> 02:17:10.990
<v Speaker 2>interact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We touch each other,</v>

3365
02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:14.140
<v Speaker 2>but no one's there physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you feel like you are and it's</v>

3366
02:17:14.141 --> 02:17:16.420
<v Speaker 2>magical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like you're living in Avatar,</v>

3367
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:18.790
<v Speaker 2>you're on Pandora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hanging out with the blue people.</v>

3368
02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:19.231
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3369
02:17:19.231 --> 02:17:21.040
<v Speaker 2>You with the Navi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit could happen.</v>

3370
02:17:21.250 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 2>You could literally get to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe you were there or we could</v>

3371
02:17:24.491 --> 02:17:26.320
<v Speaker 2>be there now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could be there.</v>

3372
02:17:26.710 --> 02:17:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sneaky,</v>

3373
02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:29.650
<v Speaker 2>sneaky argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3374
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:31.660
<v Speaker 2>but that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the truth of it all.</v>

3375
02:17:31.690 --> 02:17:32.381
<v Speaker 2>It is a truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3376
02:17:32.381 --> 02:17:33.460
<v Speaker 2>It could be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could be there.</v>

3377
02:17:33.461 --> 02:17:35.130
<v Speaker 2>We could be a part of a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:36.670
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that you learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most sad.</v>

3379
02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

3380
02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to say no.</v>

3381
02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:43.840
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could all be fake.</v>

3382
02:17:44.410 --> 02:17:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Deja.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Volcker peaches.</v>

3383
02:17:45.581 --> 02:17:46.600
<v Speaker 1>A glitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3384
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:49.140
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just try to live like my grandpa's</v>

3385
02:17:49.141 --> 02:17:52.120
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has enjoyed a regular shit as much</v>

3386
02:17:52.121 --> 02:17:53.010
<v Speaker 1>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3387
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I won't upload,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I just don't want to go earlier</v>

3388
02:17:56.351 --> 02:18:00.070
<v Speaker 1>than the fun stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that there's a beauty in,</v>

3389
02:18:02.410 --> 02:18:07.270
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I see a beauty in and in the</v>

3390
02:18:07.271 --> 02:18:10.540
<v Speaker 1>life death cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die now.</v>

3391
02:18:10.541 --> 02:18:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3392
02:18:11.741 --> 02:18:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm telling myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking treadmill,</v>

3393
02:18:13.511 --> 02:18:16.930
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my grandparents were always adamant</v>

3394
02:18:16.931 --> 02:18:20.350
<v Speaker 1>about not going an old folks home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I used to think it was about they</v>

3395
02:18:20.351 --> 02:18:22.750
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to be treated bad and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought we forget about themselves and</v>

3396
02:18:23.050 --> 02:18:26.350
<v Speaker 1>they never want it to stop living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my grandmother died in my arms</v>

3397
02:18:26.351 --> 02:18:30.100
<v Speaker 1>walking up a hill to my granddaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took him to her great grand daughters.</v>

3398
02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>My daughters are pre k graduation and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather died fishing,</v>

3399
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:37.720
<v Speaker 1>which was his greatest love and next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother.</v>

3400
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:42.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they realized that their life never</v>

3401
02:18:42.581 --> 02:18:46.030
<v Speaker 1>stops if they literally died living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's,</v>

3402
02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's maybe ultimately what the real</v>

3403
02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:51.940
<v Speaker 1>thing you should think about is whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the machine and outside of it,</v>

3404
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live the best possible life.</v>

3405
02:18:53.801 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be trying to escape your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life with goggles or even the phone.</v>

3406
02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:58.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit has to be lived.</v>

3407
02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless this is the goggles.</v>

3408
02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting goggles on inside the goggles,</v>

3409
02:19:04.721 --> 02:19:06.380
<v Speaker 1>like mirrors looking at mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>

3410
02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and then we figured out who we really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

3411
02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:08.830
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

3412
02:19:09.010 --> 02:19:10.840
<v Speaker 1>that would be the ultimate mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3413
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:13.690
<v Speaker 1>If you put on the goggles one day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realized you gotta get Outta here,</v>

3414
02:19:13.691 --> 02:19:13.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3415
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:15.220
<v Speaker 1>No I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

3416
02:19:15.221 --> 02:19:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you made me think of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just stoned and I forgot,</v>

3417
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the fucking name of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibit.</v>

3418
02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 1>There's an exhibit at the High Museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the board of the High Museum.</v>

3419
02:19:25.061 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's an exhibit there about</v>

3420
02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:31.620

3432
02:19:56.091 --> 02:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>usually doesn't like going with me</v>

3433
02:19:58.610 --> 02:20:02.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes he'll recognize me and it</v>

<v Speaker 1>We have one of the most premium</v>

3445
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:29.210
<v Speaker 1>beautiful modernist museums in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's greatly supported.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just decided to be a responsible husband</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dad and go to strip club couple of</v>

<v Speaker 1>I miss you bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they asked me for high mood for Hamu</v>

3457
02:20:52.401 --> 02:20:54.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors Rahamo Pico and I know what I'm</v>

3458
02:20:54.531 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His last name wrong is an artist who my</v>

3459
02:20:57.621 --> 02:21:01.550
<v Speaker 1>wife owns his piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did the rap music cover and my wife</v>

3460
02:21:01.551 --> 02:21:04.760
<v Speaker 1>has a piece on loan to the Carlos Museum</v>
<v Speaker 1>at emory university.</v>

3461
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of,</v>

3462
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:10.490
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be a basket like artists</v>

3463
02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:13.100
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how he's talked about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

3464
02:21:13.101 --> 02:21:14.810
<v Speaker 1>He's an amazing human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An artist.</v>

3465
02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:16.940
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky enough to own some of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

3466
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:20.030
<v Speaker 1>He's on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he suggested that me and a guy named</v>

3467
02:21:20.031 --> 02:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>king and he worked over at interscope be</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3468
02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Pete Pete brought to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they met us and they accept us in</v>

3469
02:21:25.311 --> 02:21:26.144
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3470
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you gotta understand I grew up about</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five miles from this place.</v>

3471
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.480
<v Speaker 1>And for most kids this place was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossibility to go to because their</v>

3472
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:36.230
<v Speaker 1>imagination wouldn't let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3473
02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:38.750
<v Speaker 1>So you were in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times you have very</v>

3474
02:21:38.751 --> 02:21:42.590
<v Speaker 1>poor or working class areas that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>right next to things that are inspiring,</v>

3475
02:21:42.591 --> 02:21:45.790
<v Speaker 1>but kids are not brave enough to break</v>
<v Speaker 1>to filter and go because they're never</v>

3476
02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to Ted Turner and the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>museum and things like that have always</v>

3477
02:21:50.871 --> 02:21:53.300
<v Speaker 1>made it very accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Ted Turner on the praise and the</v>

3478
02:21:53.301 --> 02:21:54.860
<v Speaker 1>hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got b's and a's,</v>

3479
02:21:54.861 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you got tickets to the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3480
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So you could see baseball party reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball died in inner cities.</v>

3481
02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:02.510
<v Speaker 1>This cause the stadium's moved out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't see it.</v>

3482
02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The high museum and the Woodridge found</v>

3483
02:22:05.301 --> 02:22:07.760
<v Speaker 1>that woodruff foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a coke charity,</v>

3484
02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 1>gave me and two other kids a scholarship</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go train on Saturdays to draw and</v>

3485
02:22:12.081 --> 02:22:13.250
<v Speaker 1>paint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3486
02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So this museum has been in my life since</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

3487
02:22:16.131 --> 02:22:19.160
<v Speaker 1>So being asked to get on the board was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a huge honor.</v>

3488
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And especially having an 11 year old now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably is going to want to be an</v>

3489
02:22:22.461 --> 02:22:22.911
<v Speaker 1>artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3490
02:22:22.911 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>it makes me the coolest dad in her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

3491
02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Plus like what a thing on the resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3492
02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:30.510
<v Speaker 1>You just look so sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3493
02:22:30.511 --> 02:22:33.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to go buy a jacket and slippers.</v>

3494
02:22:34.410 --> 02:22:37.380
<v Speaker 1>One of them jackets with the leather</v>
<v Speaker 1>patches on the elbows.</v>

3495
02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Thank one of those scholarly gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps even have a pipe and some</v>

3496
02:22:42.511 --> 02:22:43.540
<v Speaker 1>tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3497
02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I got class man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3498
02:22:45.661 --> 02:22:46.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3499
02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.240
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool that you're involved in all</v>

3500
02:22:48.241 --> 02:22:49.140
<v Speaker 1>those different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3501
02:22:49.530 --> 02:22:51.420
<v Speaker 1>it's very inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3502
02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:53.850
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You obviously have a mind for it,</v>

3503
02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:55.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3504
02:22:55.410 --> 02:22:57.510
<v Speaker 1>have you always been entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

3505
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you always been?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

3506
02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to be poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put the world treats poor people</v>

3507
02:23:03.811 --> 02:23:05.520
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't grow up poor.</v>

3508
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I grew up working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're taught to work,</v>

3509
02:23:08.690 --> 02:23:10.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3510
02:23:10.290 --> 02:23:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't like working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was,</v>

3511
02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was lazy by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he got to figure out.</v>

3512
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:19.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's cool that you applied that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as you still artistic.</v>

3513
02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.910

02:23:48.691 --> 02:23:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great fight coach for me.</v>

3528
02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.830
<v Speaker 1>When I first heard his beats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

3529
02:23:52.831 --> 02:23:54.750
<v Speaker 1>no one in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last federal is be sent me.</v>

02:23:54.890 --> 02:23:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to be rapping over his</v>

3531
02:23:56.431 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 1>beats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was only supposed to do three</v>

3532
02:23:58.591 --> 02:24:03.591
<v Speaker 1>beats on my first album on rap music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I went into a fucking campaign to</v>

3533
02:24:03.631 --> 02:24:06.180
<v Speaker 1>make him do the album.</v>

<v Speaker 1>listening to music.</v>

3725
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any musical talent at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I hear good music,</v>

3726
02:31:16.281 --> 02:31:17.270

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It fires me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3728
02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3729
02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most important</v>

3730
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:23.130
<v Speaker 2>things in our culture in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ability to generate energy and</v>

3731
02:31:23.131 --> 02:31:24.630
<v Speaker 2>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a vibration.</v>

3732
02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

3733
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I W with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3734
02:31:27.690 --> 02:31:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I think you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think right now stand up comedy is the</v>

3735
02:31:32.251 --> 02:31:35.760
<v Speaker 2>last vestige of freedom of speech in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country and you guys are to be</v>

3736
02:31:35.761 --> 02:31:38.610
<v Speaker 2>protected at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if people don't protect your</v>

3737
02:31:38.611 --> 02:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>costs is going to be at,</v>

3738
02:31:40.410 --> 02:31:41.370
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

3739
02:31:41.371 --> 02:31:42.061
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

3740
02:31:42.061 --> 02:31:45.090
<v Speaker 2>for the worst of us all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think there's something to</v>

3741
02:31:45.091 --> 02:31:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's very few people that are as</v>

3742
02:31:47.821 --> 02:31:49.870
<v Speaker 2>free with what they're allowed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3743
02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:51.600
<v Speaker 2>like standup comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3744
02:31:51.601 --> 02:31:54.330
<v Speaker 2>we're saying this crazy shit under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guise of it being funny.</v>

3745
02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can get away with saying a lot of</v>

3746
02:31:56.131 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 2>things that won't be criticized as long</v>
<v Speaker 2>as people laugh at them and you have a</v>

3747
02:31:58.711 --> 02:31:59.460
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>

3748
02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:01.800
<v Speaker 2>If you're just making the points without</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke,</v>

3749
02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:03.180
<v Speaker 2>people wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't,</v>

3750
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:04.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get mad at you.</v>

3751
02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 2>But something about delivering a point</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a joke.</v>

3752
02:32:08.190 --> 02:32:09.870
<v Speaker 2>That's why trigger warning works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3753
02:32:09.871 --> 02:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3754
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:14.730
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the last ways you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver a message that maybe people</v>

3755
02:32:14.731 --> 02:32:17.070
<v Speaker 2>don't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can make them laugh at some</v>

3756
02:32:17.071 --> 02:32:19.440
<v Speaker 2>shit they don't even really agree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the laughing hard,</v>

3757
02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:21.600
<v Speaker 2>they'll see a little bit of your point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3758
02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:22.740
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3759
02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

3760
02:32:24.121 --> 02:32:26.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set out to do trigger warning,</v>

3761
02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:27.630
<v Speaker 2>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>

3762
02:32:27.631 --> 02:32:30.450
<v Speaker 2>what was the initial premise and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of it did it change until,</v>

3763
02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:32.160
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you got to production and what you</v>

3764
02:32:32.161 --> 02:32:33.950
<v Speaker 2>started filming you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the only people who have asked</v>

3765
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:34.950
<v Speaker 2>that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

3766
02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:39.030
<v Speaker 2>you can do business bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight up bro.</v>

3767
02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3768
02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:43.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown originally we shot it with fx and</v>

3769
02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:46.590
<v Speaker 2>we over we over did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked really good,</v>

3770
02:32:46.591 --> 02:32:48.330
<v Speaker 2>but it looked really TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3771
02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have been dealt,</v>

3772
02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:54.360
<v Speaker 2>but it would have been a parity of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very real thing I was attempting to do.</v>

3773
02:32:54.690 --> 02:32:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And right now I'm talking about crypto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicola,</v>

3774
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:57.690
<v Speaker 2>what it turned out,</v>

3775
02:32:58.470 --> 02:33:02.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned into at Netflix was a real</v>

3776
02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:03.923
<v Speaker 4>mmm.</v>

3777
02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:09.600
<v Speaker 2>In your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple and plainly shot</v>

3778
02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:16.460
<v Speaker 2>documentation of the possibilities of</v>
<v Speaker 2>barbershop arguments,</v>

3779
02:33:16.741 --> 02:33:19.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a barbershop argument,</v>

3780
02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3781
02:33:21.661 --> 02:33:25.870
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that separates Alka palm</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Joe Kennedy is Al Capone got caught</v>

3782
02:33:25.871 --> 02:33:28.860
<v Speaker 2>and eventually died in prison and Joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy went on to produce precedence,</v>

3783
02:33:28.861 --> 02:33:30.290
<v Speaker 2>but they both had been bootleg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

3784
02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:32.940
<v Speaker 2>people say Shit like there's barbershop</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and you need,</v>

3785
02:33:32.941 --> 02:33:34.430
<v Speaker 2>you got to go home and be asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself like,</v>

3786
02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:37.740
<v Speaker 2>well well damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Papa Joe did it was a bootlegger.</v>

3787
02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Like technically it could have went</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up for him and we never would</v>

3788
02:33:40.381 --> 02:33:45.381
<v Speaker 2>have had an American dynasty versus owl</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch Sibley's in shit and it not going</v>

3789
02:33:45.601 --> 02:33:48.660
<v Speaker 2>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But him being the preeminent marketing</v>

3790
02:33:48.661 --> 02:33:52.170
<v Speaker 2>campaign in face of any compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like then you want to sell cigars to a</v>

3791
02:33:52.171 --> 02:33:53.004
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3792
02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:54.810
<v Speaker 2>So it got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a chance to say,</v>

3793
02:33:54.811 --> 02:33:55.644
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

3794
02:33:55.770 --> 02:33:57.990
<v Speaker 2>what if I could do this for my guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3795
02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:02.760
<v Speaker 2>giving it a shot and giving it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought of that shit at 15 years old,</v>

3796
02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I started trying to figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it 10 years ago.</v>

3797
02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Daniel and I got it done eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years later.</v>

3798
02:34:10.050 --> 02:34:11.620
<v Speaker 2>And now you have this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3799
02:34:11.621 --> 02:34:15.210
<v Speaker 2>and I say that just to say that I read</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Koppelman,</v>

3800
02:34:15.211 --> 02:34:17.350
<v Speaker 2>the creator of billions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3801
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:18.430
<v Speaker 2>is a brilliant</v>

3802
02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:20.920
<v Speaker 1>writer to me and he's a phrase of friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>

3803
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:24.310
<v Speaker 1>But Brian has been putting up lately</v>
<v Speaker 1>these just encouraging things,</v>

3804
02:34:24.311 --> 02:34:27.610
<v Speaker 1>telling writers to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if your stuff is getting body even</v>

3805
02:34:27.611 --> 02:34:32.020
<v Speaker 1>if you don't think is good to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to push yourself to push the idea</v>

3806
02:34:32.021 --> 02:34:34.750
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been taking a lot of</v>

3807
02:34:34.751 --> 02:34:38.220
<v Speaker 1>inspiration for that because Daniel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Weinfeld and I wanted a co writer</v>

3808
02:34:38.221 --> 02:34:40.930
<v Speaker 1>who's in cocreators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel and I have been talking and</v>

3809
02:34:40.931 --> 02:34:44.470
<v Speaker 1>developing this over 10 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do it,</v>

3810
02:34:44.471 --> 02:34:45.790
<v Speaker 1>how to go in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get it,</v>

3811
02:34:45.791 --> 02:34:47.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't take me 10 years for the next</v>

3812
02:34:47.591 --> 02:34:49.900
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was worth the struggle,</v>

3813
02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was worth doing that.</v>

3814
02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It was worth tweaking my ideals worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>critiquing my idea to be like the first</v>

3815
02:34:56.201 --> 02:34:57.460
<v Speaker 1>time around like nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3816
02:34:57.461 --> 02:35:00.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not what it should be because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous as shit the night before it came</v>

3817
02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:02.860
<v Speaker 1>out about everything in it.</v>

3818
02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3819
02:35:04.330 --> 02:35:05.920
<v Speaker 1>what scenes were shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did it look,</v>

3820
02:35:05.921 --> 02:35:10.690
<v Speaker 1>the production value and now seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get it and unlike a lot of other</v>

3821
02:35:10.691 --> 02:35:12.850
<v Speaker 1>artists not have to call yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>

3822
02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every artist thinks is a changes.</v>

3823
02:35:15.610 --> 02:35:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Every comedian thinks they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor and some part of your</v>

3824
02:35:18.881 --> 02:35:21.400
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think you're great or why I</v>

3825
02:35:21.401 --> 02:35:23.800
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to believe there's greatness in</v>

3826
02:35:23.801 --> 02:35:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3827
02:35:24.460 --> 02:35:27.100
<v Speaker 1>But I never wanted to be the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking genius.</v>

3828
02:35:27.101 --> 02:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just never want it.</v>

3829
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:31.420
<v Speaker 1>But to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I always thought the idea was</v>

3830
02:35:31.421 --> 02:35:33.220
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck that shit.</v>

3831
02:35:33.221 --> 02:35:36.250
<v Speaker 1>You remember real people that used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in the seventies eighties I</v>

3832
02:35:36.251 --> 02:35:39.610
<v Speaker 1>remember watching that show as a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at motherfuckers like,</v>

3833
02:35:39.611 --> 02:35:41.980
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these motherfuckers exist in it,</v>

3834
02:35:41.981 --> 02:35:44.950
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's off far off places like Iowa</v>

3835
02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:47.680
<v Speaker 1>and Kansas and I wanted to approach it.</v>

3836
02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I want it to approach people in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here right in front of you kind of</v>

3837
02:35:52.421 --> 02:35:53.231
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Above you,</v>

3838
02:35:53.231 --> 02:35:56.080
<v Speaker 1>not celebrity Michael Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people normal wrapper.</v>

3839
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And it gave me that opportunity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can say is genius and I'm going</v>

3840
02:35:59.881 --> 02:36:02.350
<v Speaker 1>to say I'm humbled and honored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're fucking right.</v>

3841
02:36:02.470 --> 02:36:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's genius because I'm engaging</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at a regular human level,</v>

3842
02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:10.150
<v Speaker 1>not at the level of celebrity or power</v>
<v Speaker 1>to used to be an engaged but one it</v>

3843
02:36:10.151 --> 02:36:14.710
<v Speaker 1>allows them to fully open up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it on TV sets some shit</v>

3844
02:36:14.711 --> 02:36:18.640
<v Speaker 1>like real people or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen revolutionary tv like the</v>

3845
02:36:18.641 --> 02:36:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Jeffersons or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all in the family or mod and I think</v>

3846
02:36:22.901 --> 02:36:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that the world is getting scary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy to be honest.</v>

3847
02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:26.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to,</v>

3848
02:36:26.801 --> 02:36:29.170
<v Speaker 1>not to disrespect pussies because</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies are tough,</v>

3849
02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think that something needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

3850
02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:36.320
<v Speaker 1>The best compliment I got on this press</v>
<v Speaker 1>run has been like and brochures,</v>

3851
02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Ambrosia for headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it feel to have some [inaudible]</v>

3852
02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:41.800
<v Speaker 1>show on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's dangerous because it unites</v>

3853
02:36:41.801 --> 02:36:44.350
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it separate people?</v>

3854
02:36:44.351 --> 02:36:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It gives you alternative answers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones you thought you had and it forces</v>

3855
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you to think it doesn't solve all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems or wrap it up pretty at the</v>

3856
02:36:50.381 --> 02:36:52.330
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gives you some options to do and some</v>

3857
02:36:52.331 --> 02:36:54.570
<v Speaker 1>shit to think about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny as fuck.</v>

3858
02:36:54.571 --> 02:36:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And so first of in dark and I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an imagine netflix give you plenty</v>

3859
02:36:58.571 --> 02:37:00.040
<v Speaker 1>of room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3860
02:37:00.041 --> 02:37:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Hell they weren't tripping man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't trip.</v>

3861
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:05.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't trust go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing.</v>

3862
02:37:05.350 --> 02:37:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3863
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:09.100
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you walk on the room like how</v>

3864
02:37:09.101 --> 02:37:10.060
<v Speaker 1>the fuck I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

3865
02:37:11.970 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 1>they're smart enough to let people</v>
<v Speaker 1>create their own</v>

3866
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.330
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for standup.</v>

3867
02:37:17.331 --> 02:37:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is no one better in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting with them about a special,</v>

3868
02:37:20.781 --> 02:37:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to give many any notes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the material.</v>

3869
02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:24.680
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that you're going to do your</v>

3870
02:37:24.681 --> 02:37:25.514
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt.</v>

3871
02:37:25.610 --> 02:37:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't tell.</v>

3872
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>They can't help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no one can help you as a comic.</v>

3873
02:37:29.271 --> 02:37:32.090
<v Speaker 2>There's not a another person like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>executive is gonna help you do your</v>

3874
02:37:32.091 --> 02:37:34.490
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta be looking at it</v>

3875
02:37:34.491 --> 02:37:36.590
<v Speaker 2>yourself ruthlessly and you'll figure it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3876
02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:38.150
<v Speaker 2>And so they trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3877
02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:39.710
<v Speaker 2>So I would assume they did the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with you.</v>

3878
02:37:39.970 --> 02:37:40.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3881
02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:44.990
<v Speaker 2>The forever the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the opposite.</v>

3882
02:37:44.991 --> 02:37:46.660
<v Speaker 2>There was 50 fucking cooks in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>

3883
02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's pulling you this way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you need to hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody needed a hook.</v>

3889
02:38:07.270 --> 02:38:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Different strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3890
02:38:09.651 --> 02:38:13.730
<v Speaker 2>What a weird change in that short amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time from different strokes it today</v>

3891
02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:15.140
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3892
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:17.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm older than you,</v>

3893
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:19.760
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much older.</v>

3894
02:38:19.761 --> 02:38:22.520
<v Speaker 2>We grew up in similar times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 51 yeah.</v>

3895
02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:26.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were children for both of us,</v>

3896
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:29.090
<v Speaker 2>the world was a way different place than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is for children today.</v>

3897
02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kids are being forced to turbo</v>

3898
02:38:31.541 --> 02:38:33.860
<v Speaker 2>charge their evolution and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

3899
02:38:33.861 --> 02:38:37.580
<v Speaker 2>They're getting every kid over the age</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like 13 has a phone.</v>

3900
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The parents hanging there as long as</v>

3901
02:38:40.101 --> 02:38:42.170
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's filming the kids 13 here's the</v>

3902
02:38:42.171 --> 02:38:44.180
<v Speaker 2>whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You little fuck adage is true.</v>

3903
02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Good luck and and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole world at a push of a</v>

3904
02:38:47.181 --> 02:38:51.230
<v Speaker 2>button where my grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get encyclopedias every four years</v>

3905
02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:56.360
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't wait to get the new set</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you got to read and learn new</v>

3906
02:38:56.361 --> 02:38:59.810
<v Speaker 2>information and now that information is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

3907
02:38:59.810 --> 02:39:01.640
<v Speaker 2>But if they aren't genuinely curious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested,</v>

3908
02:39:01.641 --> 02:39:04.580
<v Speaker 2>it'll die right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's also a lot of things other</v>

3909
02:39:04.581 --> 02:39:07.070
<v Speaker 2>than that information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just an information device.</v>

3910
02:39:07.071 --> 02:39:11.030
<v Speaker 2>These fucking apps and these kids are</v>
<v Speaker 2>using back and forth with each other and</v>

3911
02:39:11.031 --> 02:39:14.000
<v Speaker 2>games and are so addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:16.310
<v Speaker 2>We used to have this place called</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside too.</v>

3913
02:39:16.311 --> 02:39:17.590
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3914
02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Outdoors man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go and I'd just,</v>

3915
02:39:20.661 --> 02:39:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd be gone for hours and how it return</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty as fuck.</v>

3916
02:39:23.661 --> 02:39:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Having one on hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an adventure.</v>

3917
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:27.410
<v Speaker 2>That was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

3918
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Now he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now even outdoors is regulated to some</v>

3919
02:39:30.261 --> 02:39:34.550
<v Speaker 2>also you worry about child molesters</v>
<v Speaker 2>creeps and you worry about shit.</v>

3920
02:39:34.551 --> 02:39:38.270
<v Speaker 2>We've almost like heard too much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's possible.</v>

3921
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:41.480
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are really still child molesters</v>

3922
02:39:41.481 --> 02:39:43.880
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do exist and we also send them to</v>

3923
02:39:43.881 --> 02:39:47.170
<v Speaker 2>church with them so they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of our worries are,</v>

3924
02:39:47.171 --> 02:39:48.740
<v Speaker 2>are exasperated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3925
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3926
02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:51.650
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3927
02:39:51.651 --> 02:39:53.600
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the weirdest things ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3928
02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Like more than likely to chime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say she was going to happen at a</v>

3929
02:39:56.601 --> 02:39:59.810
<v Speaker 2>place that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should be getting outside</v>

3930
02:39:59.811 --> 02:40:01.300
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3931
02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started at Man,</v>

3932
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I said my man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell my wife,</v>

3933
02:40:05.661 --> 02:40:08.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get Michael a leaf blower to start going</v>

3934
02:40:08.541 --> 02:40:10.730
<v Speaker 2>back outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started looking for leaf blowers</v>

3935
02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>but to jess and I started taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of having my nephew do</v>

3936
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:16.140
<v Speaker 1>it because I'm running around on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>

3937
02:40:16.141 --> 02:40:19.680
<v Speaker 1>just when I'm home taking my own trash</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and down and spending some time</v>

3938
02:40:19.681 --> 02:40:21.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking around on my yard watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and stuff.</v>

3939
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized being a rapper and living on</v>

3940
02:40:24.541 --> 02:40:27.810
<v Speaker 1>a tour bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much I had stopped going outside,</v>

3941
02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile my cousins are fucking Haga</v>

3942
02:40:29.970 --> 02:40:31.670
<v Speaker 1>and his Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3943
02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:33.690
<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like,</v>

3944
02:40:33.691 --> 02:40:36.490
<v Speaker 1>if it went down tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd be fuck.</v>

3945
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:37.171
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3946
02:40:37.171 --> 02:40:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rusty as a nail in the rain right</v>

3947
02:40:39.121 --> 02:40:40.350
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just,</v>

3948
02:40:40.351 --> 02:40:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think there's something to</v>

3949
02:40:41.821 --> 02:40:46.320
<v Speaker 1>be said for introducing your kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little more of what it was like</v>

3950
02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:49.390
<v Speaker 1>2030 years or 30 40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3951
02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:52.590
<v Speaker 1>just imagine that human beings lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>before houses.</v>

3952
02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was humans and then they figured</v>

3953
02:40:55.021 --> 02:40:56.320
<v Speaker 1>out shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3954
02:40:56.321 --> 02:40:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's some kind of rather some kind of</v>

3955
02:40:58.351 --> 02:41:01.230
<v Speaker 1>primate and then that primate figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out shelter and eventually became a</v>

3956
02:41:01.231 --> 02:41:02.490
<v Speaker 1>human is a better way to describe it.</v>

3957
02:41:02.490 --> 02:41:06.990
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like us lived and it hadn't</v>

3958
02:41:06.991 --> 02:41:08.510
<v Speaker 1>even figured out roofs yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3959
02:41:08.570 --> 02:41:09.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3960
02:41:09.331 --> 02:41:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I love the wash shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those videos or youtube where it's</v>

3961
02:41:11.701 --> 02:41:14.630
<v Speaker 1>usually they in these people are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dark and they're age,</v>

3962
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:18.360
<v Speaker 1>so it has to be the India or Southeast</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia or somewhere.</v>

3963
02:41:18.361 --> 02:41:19.290
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3964
02:41:19.291 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll see two dudes and they'll just</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a fucking a hut or something out of</v>

3965
02:41:24.061 --> 02:41:25.110
<v Speaker 1>mud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll make a pool.</v>

3966
02:41:25.111 --> 02:41:27.570
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get to see the ingenuity and you</v>

3967
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:30.900
<v Speaker 1>understand if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're quote unquote primitive</v>

3968
02:41:30.901 --> 02:41:34.770
<v Speaker 1>culture never does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never get to skyscrapers like Jack</v>

3969
02:41:34.770 --> 02:41:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Fresco talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no nothing new.</v>

3970
02:41:36.571 --> 02:41:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Everything you see is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an a is an improvement or some</v>

3971
02:41:39.781 --> 02:41:41.400
<v Speaker 1>variation of something they've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

3972
02:41:41.850 --> 02:41:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So that those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3973
02:41:43.081 --> 02:41:46.710
<v Speaker 1>just the curiosity to do that or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity to build that shelter,</v>

3974
02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now now gives you a trump tower.</v>

3975
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:51.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the dark side of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

3976
02:41:51.550 --> 02:41:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Dark side for me is that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this innovation that it happens</v>

3977
02:41:55.710 --> 02:41:58.520
<v Speaker 1>almost unchecked in terms of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

3978
02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:01.320
<v Speaker 1>our ability to think about what are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

3979
02:42:01.350 --> 02:42:04.200
<v Speaker 1>like what are the consequences if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep making things better and better</v>

3980
02:42:04.201 --> 02:42:06.270
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And artificial life and artificial</v>

3981
02:42:06.271 --> 02:42:08.070
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and what w what are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences?</v>

3982
02:42:08.071 --> 02:42:11.430
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of there's no more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is no more weird pink monkey</v>

3983
02:42:11.431 --> 02:42:12.264
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3984
02:42:12.270 --> 02:42:14.430
<v Speaker 1>That that thing goes away because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need it anymore.</v>

3985
02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got a new life form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They new life form is digital life.</v>

3986
02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the real real concern is</v>

3987
02:42:19.591 --> 02:42:23.260
<v Speaker 1>that just like we are an evolution of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lower primates,</v>

3988
02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:25.770
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be an evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to happen.</v>

3989
02:42:25.771 --> 02:42:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3990
02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may not be any avoiding it by</v>

3991
02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:30.210
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

3992
02:42:30.210 --> 02:42:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the virus,</v>

3993
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:34.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one of my thoughts is</v>

3994
02:42:34.401 --> 02:42:37.110
<v Speaker 1>that me saying unequivocably that we put</v>
<v Speaker 1>virus.</v>

3995
02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3996
02:42:37.650 --> 02:42:40.500
<v Speaker 1>The thing is I like people like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of it,</v>

3997
02:42:40.530 --> 02:42:44.260
<v Speaker 1>people are cool dounreay that aliens go</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and attack this motherfucker.</v>

3998
02:42:44.310 --> 02:42:47.670
<v Speaker 1>So white people or black people or cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit and finally have to do</v>

3999
02:42:47.671 --> 02:42:49.500
<v Speaker 1>night like one great movie of Red</v>
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>

4000
02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to get our asses</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked every saying we're not at least</v>

4001
02:42:53.521 --> 02:42:56.670
<v Speaker 1>at least for one time humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the empires would have to unite.</v>

4002
02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Reagan's speech?</v>

4003
02:42:58.830 --> 02:42:59.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never heard it.</v>

4004
02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Reagan actually said that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

4005
02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I forget who he was addressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the first person to ask besides</v>

4006
02:43:06.991 --> 02:43:10.410
<v Speaker 1>him putting in the civil right that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean the cane day you might give me.</v>

4007
02:43:10.411 --> 02:43:13.100
<v Speaker 1>The only other thing I like about Ronald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan was a very strict,</v>

4008
02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:17.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange about it was that it's,</v>

4009
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:22.830
<v Speaker 1>it's shut off this gigantic wave of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theorists who were thinking</v>

4010
02:43:23.381 --> 02:43:26.740
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to tell us something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about alien contact.</v>

4011
02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this</v>

4012
02:43:30.290 --> 02:43:35.290
<v Speaker 5>outside universal thread.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I occasionally think how quickly our</v>

4013
02:43:35.451 --> 02:43:40.451
<v Speaker 5>differences worldwide would vanish if we</v>
<v Speaker 5>were facing an alien threat from outside</v>

4014
02:43:42.410 --> 02:43:47.410
<v Speaker 5>this word dude and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I asked you is not an alien force</v>

4015
02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:51.680
<v Speaker 5>already among us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What could be more alien to the</v>

4016
02:43:52.250 --> 02:43:56.730
<v Speaker 5>universal aspirations of our peoples</v>
<v Speaker 5>than war and the threat of</v>

4017
02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:01.650
<v Speaker 1>tell you what to Ronald Reagan knocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out of the fucking park right there.</v>

4018
02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a song called Reagan.</v>

4019
02:44:04.981 --> 02:44:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Many of you know wasn't the biggest fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him or many of us presidents cause I</v>

4020
02:44:08.881 --> 02:44:12.120
<v Speaker 1>rapped about more than him in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that definitely is going to make it</v>

4021
02:44:12.121 --> 02:44:13.880
<v Speaker 1>on a killer Mike Song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really that,</v>

4022
02:44:13.890 --> 02:44:15.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to you.</v>

4023
02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got this killer Mike and LP.</v>

4024
02:44:17.161 --> 02:44:19.260
<v Speaker 1>We definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody think aliens are going to</v>

4025
02:44:19.261 --> 02:44:22.750
<v Speaker 1>come kill us all one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to maybe suggest to ail.</v>

4026
02:44:22.751 --> 02:44:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully we'll use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if not fucking I'm gonna do it.</v>

4027
02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit is amazing.</v>

4028
02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4029
02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:30.300
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that it is possible that</v>

4030
02:44:30.301 --> 02:44:33.330
<v Speaker 1>aliens came down and manipulated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics of lower primates and creative</v>

4031
02:44:33.331 --> 02:44:37.410
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing based on all the theology,</v>

4032
02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to accept it.</v>

4033
02:44:38.610 --> 02:44:41.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we're alone.</v>

4034
02:44:41.970 --> 02:44:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>

4035
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:44.323
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

4036
02:44:44.370 --> 02:44:47.670
<v Speaker 1>even if there is some divine thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up and decided to make us and we're</v>

4037
02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:49.450
<v Speaker 1>a special children and we on our to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boot plant,</v>

4038
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:52.740
<v Speaker 1>there had to have been some other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>made her play with.</v>

4039
02:44:52.741 --> 02:44:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I think is very</v>

4040
02:44:55.831 --> 02:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>arrogant as a human being to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just us.</v>

4041
02:44:59.401 --> 02:45:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the possibility that</v>

4042
02:45:02.701 --> 02:45:05.490
<v Speaker 1>something made it here and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened exist.</v>

4043
02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we're experimenting on</v>

4044
02:45:09.151 --> 02:45:14.151
<v Speaker 1>animals and things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got like my daughter's army,</v>

4045
02:45:15.690 --> 02:45:19.740
<v Speaker 1>their temperament is mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're curiosity is me.</v>

4046
02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at Michael and I'm looking</v>

4047
02:45:22.441 --> 02:45:24.910
<v Speaker 1>at a night and I'm like arguing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

4048
02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:28.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like arguing with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know why she acts like that.</v>

4049
02:45:28.590 --> 02:45:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4050
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Now if I can look at my pit bull and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

4051
02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:33.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mother acted like this and this is</v>

4052
02:45:33.571 --> 02:45:36.270
<v Speaker 1>why I know she's coded this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know her father was his.</v>

4053
02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to look at my daughter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>save on a genetic basis,</v>

4054
02:45:39.061 --> 02:45:41.260
<v Speaker 1>23 and my chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know our temperament.</v>

4055
02:45:41.261 --> 02:45:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know why Michael is not going to argue</v>

4056
02:45:44.290 --> 02:45:46.020
<v Speaker 1>she's a smart kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's an art student,</v>

4057
02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:48.990
<v Speaker 1>but the minute you put her in danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to punch you.</v>

4058
02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:50.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

4059
02:45:50.101 --> 02:45:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's going to be and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to be anything else because</v>

4060
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:55.440
<v Speaker 1>she is going to protect her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>

4061
02:45:56.010 --> 02:45:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I have to think that my curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else,</v>

4062
02:45:58.561 --> 02:46:01.440
<v Speaker 1>my drive to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take the primate side,</v>

4063
02:46:01.441 --> 02:46:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know you,</v>

4064
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you know that I have to live in mark</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I got to survive as wolves,</v>

4065
02:46:05.741 --> 02:46:06.481
<v Speaker 1>as Lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tigers,</v>

4066
02:46:06.481 --> 02:46:08.160
<v Speaker 1>bears out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go high,</v>

4067
02:46:08.161 --> 02:46:08.994
<v Speaker 1>I have to create shelf.</v>

4068
02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:13.460
<v Speaker 1>There's something else with was a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>small input could have dropped here,</v>

4069
02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:15.050
<v Speaker 1>landed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's crazy,</v>

4070
02:46:15.130 --> 02:46:17.810
<v Speaker 1>if you look into nation of Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of sorts,</v>

4071
02:46:17.811 --> 02:46:21.740
<v Speaker 1>they have a Ufo type philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something here in and by their amount of</v>

4072
02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:23.750
<v Speaker 1>scientists created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4073
02:46:23.751 --> 02:46:26.990
<v Speaker 1>all of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of when a Shrek rain kind of created the</v>

4074
02:46:26.991 --> 02:46:29.790
<v Speaker 1>different races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something could have come here in it</v>

4075
02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:34.400
<v Speaker 1>and it gets here and it says Bonet with</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this and this and I create this.</v>

4076
02:46:34.401 --> 02:46:36.890
<v Speaker 1>And then we set upon evolution and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up here.</v>

4077
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Or that's just could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4078
02:46:38.271 --> 02:46:40.310
<v Speaker 1>me stone having watched too many south</v>
<v Speaker 1>five movies.</v>

4079
02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:42.200
<v Speaker 1>But it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

4080
02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's zero evidence for it,</v>

4081
02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:47.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly possible that if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could go to another planet,</v>

4082
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:51.380
<v Speaker 1>we knew how in life that it's possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we found some lower primates that we</v>

4083
02:46:51.381 --> 02:46:55.370
<v Speaker 1>would manipulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible for a full survey of</v>

4084
02:46:55.371 --> 02:46:57.050
<v Speaker 1>another planet we got there and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4085
02:46:57.051 --> 02:46:58.010
<v Speaker 1>here's the good news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good news.</v>

4086
02:46:58.011 --> 02:47:00.320
<v Speaker 1>A lot of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad news is the most intelligent</v>

4087
02:47:00.321 --> 02:47:04.010
<v Speaker 1>thing is basically a chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've got some ideas and a we're</v>

4088
02:47:04.011 --> 02:47:07.640
<v Speaker 1>going to do is we're going to plant some</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds of our genetics in some of these</v>

4089
02:47:07.641 --> 02:47:08.720
<v Speaker 1>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be smarter than the</v>

4090
02:47:08.721 --> 02:47:10.280
<v Speaker 1>other chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're gonna believe mushrooms</v>

4091
02:47:10.281 --> 02:47:11.114
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

4092
02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Leave the mushrooms everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the chimps,</v>

4093
02:47:14.481 --> 02:47:17.120
<v Speaker 1>he'd mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're in a fishbowl maybe.</v>

4094
02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause again,</v>

4095
02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:21.080
<v Speaker 1>we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we very arrogantly think of ourselves is</v>

4096
02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:22.880
<v Speaker 1>as top choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe,</v>

4097
02:47:22.910 --> 02:47:25.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're just a virus on this living</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

4098
02:47:25.281 --> 02:47:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4099
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:31.100
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could go a state of virus,</v>

4100
02:47:31.101 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 1>amass virus could kill us all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

4101
02:47:33.550 --> 02:47:35.150
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're constantly fighting.</v>

4102
02:47:35.210 --> 02:47:38.510
<v Speaker 1>The earth wouldn't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll think about viruses like get</v>

4103
02:47:38.511 --> 02:47:42.650
<v Speaker 1>viruses wholly negative in our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're wholly negative to</v>

4104
02:47:42.651 --> 02:47:44.210
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a virus thinks his</v>

4105
02:47:44.211 --> 02:47:46.190
<v Speaker 1>holiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is that eating you</v>

4106
02:47:46.191 --> 02:47:47.060
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having a good party.</v>

4107
02:47:47.061 --> 02:47:47.900
<v Speaker 1>When you get the flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

4108
02:47:47.901 --> 02:47:50.900
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably up if this thing is really</v>

4109
02:47:50.901 --> 02:47:53.300
<v Speaker 1>a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the earth is really living thing,</v>

4110
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:55.790
<v Speaker 1>we are possibly the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sore it.</v>

4111
02:47:56.060 --> 02:47:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

4112
02:47:56.570 --> 02:47:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't it get rid of us other than</v>

4113
02:47:58.341 --> 02:47:59.270
<v Speaker 1>meteors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4114
02:47:59.570 --> 02:48:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the worst thing for not just the</v>

4115
02:48:01.731 --> 02:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>biological life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the particulates in the atmosphere</v>

4116
02:48:04.661 --> 02:48:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and now we're creating technology that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to eventually kill us and get rid</v>

4117
02:48:07.341 --> 02:48:10.110
<v Speaker 1>of us that may be able to live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony with biology maybe.</v>

4118
02:48:10.130 --> 02:48:10.521
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4119
02:48:10.521 --> 02:48:13.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's over for us in a few thousand</v>

4120
02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:14.390
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>

4121
02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:17.990
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that makes us fun is the thing</v>

4122
02:48:17.991 --> 02:48:20.900
<v Speaker 1>that's totally unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that got us to the dance.</v>

4123
02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that made us want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>breed and there's the animal side.</v>

4124
02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I got to Piss so bad I can get it.</v>

4125
02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:31.070
<v Speaker 1>The animal side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to embrace your primal.</v>

4126
02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:32.090
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

4127
02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:33.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4128
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:36.560
<v Speaker 1>You've existed in this state for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

4129
02:48:36.561 --> 02:48:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people that came before that</v>

4130
02:48:38.331 --> 02:48:40.460
<v Speaker 1>were savage are still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4131
02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:42.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think that to myself when I</v>

4132
02:48:42.891 --> 02:48:45.860
<v Speaker 1>hear people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did he throw it all away?</v>

4133
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:49.190
<v Speaker 1>It just stick to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that bitch was hot.</v>

4134
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight Nature.</v>

4135
02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Nature's a crazy gene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fun.</v>

4136
02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reason why there's 7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion of us.</v>

4137
02:48:57.610 --> 02:48:58.730
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

4138
02:48:58.731 --> 02:49:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Drive this computer code that's in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back of your head is constantly running.</v>

4139
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:03.870
<v Speaker 1>They had a species must survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must,</v>

4140
02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that's really all we put here to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>

4141
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing that.</v>

4142
02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Where</v>

4143
02:49:08.450 --> 02:49:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I've been describing it is that</v>

4144
02:49:09.961 --> 02:49:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4145
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:15.000
<v Speaker 2>electronic caterpillar that's making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocoon.</v>

4146
02:49:15.001 --> 02:49:17.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know what the fuck we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and we're about to become a</v>

4147
02:49:17.161 --> 02:49:21.180
<v Speaker 2>butterfly or just megan is cocoon and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just completely engulfed in it.</v>

4148
02:49:21.210 --> 02:49:22.890
<v Speaker 2>We're not thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone does it.</v>

4149
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:25.770
<v Speaker 2>They all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I felt.</v>

4150
02:49:25.771 --> 02:49:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

4151
02:49:27.090 --> 02:49:30.720
<v Speaker 2>when I see all this stuff getting better</v>
<v Speaker 2>and better and more invasive in your</v>

4152
02:49:30.721 --> 02:49:33.540
<v Speaker 2>life and the technology becoming more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more advanced and everybody obsessed</v>

4153
02:49:33.541 --> 02:49:35.490
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing I think is like,</v>

4154
02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:37.320
<v Speaker 2>this is eventually going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

4155
02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:40.650
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be way better than this</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical life.</v>

4156
02:49:40.651 --> 02:49:43.320
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna offer you a life that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists just like the Matrix.</v>

4157
02:49:43.321 --> 02:49:45.900
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix sounded like such horse Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fun,</v>

4158
02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:47.940
<v Speaker 2>fun movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great movie and Shit.</v>

4159
02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:53.060
<v Speaker 2>But like that can never happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure it could happen 100%.</v>

4160
02:49:53.431 --> 02:49:58.140
<v Speaker 2>It could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that there's no question.</v>

4161
02:49:58.170 --> 02:50:01.170
<v Speaker 2>If they could make a world that's better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than this and all you had to do is plug</v>

4162
02:50:01.171 --> 02:50:02.400
<v Speaker 2>the back of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

4163
02:50:02.401 --> 02:50:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

4164
02:50:03.530 --> 02:50:05.400
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm 89,</v>

4165
02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I might say fuck in and plug in for</v>
<v Speaker 2>another 80,</v>

4166
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:09.670
<v Speaker 2>89.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4167
02:50:09.810 --> 02:50:13.260
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if they keep your flesh alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll figure out some way to reverse</v>

4168
02:50:13.261 --> 02:50:14.340
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

4169
02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you think,</v>

4170
02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then Dan,</v>

4171
02:50:17.911 --> 02:50:19.860
<v Speaker 2>you got to decide who gets to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets a dye.</v>

4172
02:50:19.890 --> 02:50:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go into it and we get some classes</v>

4173
02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:25.680
<v Speaker 2>he thinks most and then you gotta you</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta you gotta go to kill your master's</v>

4174
02:50:25.681 --> 02:50:28.170
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I think happens.</v>

4175
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing they say is that as</v>

4176
02:50:30.721 --> 02:50:33.030
<v Speaker 2>people get more affluent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have less children in the</v>

4177
02:50:33.031 --> 02:50:37.980
<v Speaker 2>population decreases as the world's</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy evens out and so that we reached</v>

4178
02:50:37.981 --> 02:50:41.190
<v Speaker 2>like a point where we can maintain a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable population.</v>

4179
02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:45.570
<v Speaker 2>How does that has still happened without</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass genocide or mass sterilization?</v>

4180
02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:47.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're saying that.</v>

4181
02:50:47.191 --> 02:50:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're saying is that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>people become more educated and more</v>

4182
02:50:51.271 --> 02:50:55.530
<v Speaker 2>affluent and more successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as more urbanization takes place,</v>

4183
02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:58.950
<v Speaker 2>people work more and have less children</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they have less children,</v>

4184
02:50:58.951 --> 02:51:00.810
<v Speaker 2>the population actually slightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>decreases.</v>

4185
02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:04.620
<v Speaker 2>This is this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't mind fuck more people who</v>

4186
02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:07.510
<v Speaker 2>fuck more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more children night.</v>

4187
02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:09.870
<v Speaker 2>That just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those stats where I'm be</v>

4188
02:51:09.871 --> 02:51:10.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might do,</v>

4189
02:51:10.650 --> 02:51:13.680
<v Speaker 2>they might just be talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular class of people.</v>

4190
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:16.020
<v Speaker 2>They're still sell 7 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4191
02:51:16.021 --> 02:51:19.710
<v Speaker 2>there's still 7 billion people live</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly for under 22,000 a year.</v>

4192
02:51:19.730 --> 02:51:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it usually every time development</v>

4193
02:51:22.891 --> 02:51:24.660
<v Speaker 2>comms at exploits them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4194
02:51:24.690 --> 02:51:27.450
<v Speaker 2>So like where does the balance out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>affluence coming?</v>

4195
02:51:27.451 --> 02:51:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I know there's one country now</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's doing a universal pay for people.</v>

4196
02:51:31.470 --> 02:51:35.490
<v Speaker 2>So are we going to talk about going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you go to like is does that</v>

4197
02:51:35.491 --> 02:51:36.210
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

4198
02:51:36.210 --> 02:51:37.920
<v Speaker 2>is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to universal pay.</v>

4199
02:51:37.950 --> 02:51:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Well universal paid would be fine if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was universal effort.</v>

4200
02:51:40.530 --> 02:51:42.360
<v Speaker 2>If everybody did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it out the same amount of effort.</v>

4201
02:51:42.361 --> 02:51:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with everyone getting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say no.</v>

4202
02:51:43.770 --> 02:51:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I'm for or against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying how do you maintain,</v>

4203
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:50.010
<v Speaker 2>how does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it happen that everybody all of</v>

4204
02:51:50.011 --> 02:51:53.460
<v Speaker 2>a sudden it's affluent without mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide of sterilization.</v>

4205
02:51:53.461 --> 02:51:55.800
<v Speaker 2>But think the idea is that as urban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and listen,</v>

4206
02:51:55.801 --> 02:51:57.810
<v Speaker 2>this is not my theory for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've read it.</v>

4207
02:51:57.840 --> 02:52:02.640
<v Speaker 2>The idea is as the world becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 2>urbanized and more educated and more</v>

4208
02:52:02.641 --> 02:52:06.640
<v Speaker 2>wealthy as as city spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is less.</v>

4209
02:52:06.641 --> 02:52:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Those people have kids and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>less kids.</v>

4210
02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:12.530
<v Speaker 2>This is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't work that well.</v>

4211
02:52:12.530 --> 02:52:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it works or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that this is an actual study.</v>

4212
02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find that he pulled her</v>

4213
02:52:17.111 --> 02:52:18.970
<v Speaker 2>vein is fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are,</v>

4214
02:52:19.270 --> 02:52:20.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are,</v>

4215
02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but the overall humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once people have serious careers,</v>

4216
02:52:24.101 --> 02:52:25.690
<v Speaker 2>like the man and the woman have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious career,</v>

4217
02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:27.150
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them are like really invested in</v>

4218
02:52:27.151 --> 02:52:29.290
<v Speaker 2>the career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They generally tend to have less kids.</v>

4219
02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:32.230
<v Speaker 2>And when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the idea is that as this people,</v>

4220
02:52:32.470 --> 02:52:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a solution.</v>

4221
02:52:33.641 --> 02:52:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a good solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made people become obsessed with</v>

4222
02:52:36.221 --> 02:52:37.090
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things,</v>

4223
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of the world's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like I'm still talking about</v>

4224
02:52:40.601 --> 02:52:43.270
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I poor people are fucking man.</v>

4225
02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just called back to me like I hear it</v>

4226
02:52:46.241 --> 02:52:48.040
<v Speaker 2>all studies show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta say to yourself,</v>

4227
02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you handle the other 4 billion</v>

4228
02:52:51.281 --> 02:52:51.910
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

4229
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I think the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not my argument today,</v>

4230
02:52:54.650 --> 02:52:55.840
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep,</v>

4231
02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:59.200
<v Speaker 2>they keep expanding is that these cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these urban areas,</v>

4232
02:52:59.230 --> 02:53:03.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as the society sort of evens out</v>

4233
02:53:03.430 --> 02:53:06.190
<v Speaker 2>globally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it takes a thousand years or a</v>

4234
02:53:06.190 --> 02:53:10.420
<v Speaker 2>hundred years as things start to even</v>
<v Speaker 2>out people will be more like Los Angeles</v>

4235
02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:14.110
<v Speaker 2>and less like less like poor place at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calcutta.</v>

4236
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Potass site.</v>

4237
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:18.610
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like poor in Calcutta.</v>

4238
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:21.010
<v Speaker 2>You got a bunch of people walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pumped in this noise.</v>

4239
02:53:21.011 --> 02:53:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It could be a Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got small,</v>

4240
02:53:22.871 --> 02:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>you've got traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got Trisha,</v>

4241
02:53:24.030 --> 02:53:25.310
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My death.</v>

4242
02:53:25.330 --> 02:53:27.910
<v Speaker 2>There's Delta two different extremes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that just seem weird.</v>

4243
02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4244
02:53:30.371 --> 02:53:32.320
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I just feel like maybe we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the point,</v>

4245
02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:36.550
<v Speaker 2>it ain't no turning around then we might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be just cause we got 7 billion people.</v>

4246
02:53:36.610 --> 02:53:38.500
<v Speaker 2>We might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also might not be.</v>

4247
02:53:38.530 --> 02:53:41.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's not a bad time to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic because as people look for</v>

4248
02:53:41.591 --> 02:53:44.950
<v Speaker 2>better and better solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4249
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but like jock fresco and the Venus</v>
<v Speaker 2>project talking about moneyless society</v>

4250
02:53:51.011 --> 02:53:54.730
<v Speaker 2>to rather radical change of what a</v>
<v Speaker 2>political states and things of that</v>

4251
02:53:54.731 --> 02:53:57.970
<v Speaker 2>nature chompsky talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4252
02:53:57.971 --> 02:54:01.600
<v Speaker 2>essentially all all countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially now no matter western or</v>

4253
02:54:01.601 --> 02:54:06.490
<v Speaker 2>eastern oligarchies and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what's the radical departure</v>

4254
02:54:06.491 --> 02:54:08.440
<v Speaker 2>from this and that saves it all in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

4255
02:54:08.441 --> 02:54:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Like with the Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>United Nations speech,</v>

4256
02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I think people are more aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>flaws of the system than they ever have</v>

4257
02:54:14.501 --> 02:54:16.380
<v Speaker 2>been any generation previous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4258
02:54:16.470 --> 02:54:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I think when you look at kids from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies and eighties I don't think</v>

4259
02:54:19.511 --> 02:54:24.400
<v Speaker 2>there were nearly as educated as to how</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly fucked up this country is and but</v>

4260
02:54:24.401 --> 02:54:28.510
<v Speaker 2>also yet truly amazing in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of the world,</v>

4261
02:54:28.900 --> 02:54:31.780
<v Speaker 2>but has plenty to printing to improve</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

4262
02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:34.720
<v Speaker 2>But probably will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are getting better at</v>

4263
02:54:34.721 --> 02:54:38.080
<v Speaker 2>life to getting better at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the things and government will</v>

4264
02:54:38.081 --> 02:54:40.180
<v Speaker 2>come along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to get better at</v>

4265
02:54:40.181 --> 02:54:41.470
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We understand each other better.</v>

4266
02:54:41.530 --> 02:54:46.530
<v Speaker 2>We communicate better is I'm optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think with all these incredibly</v>

4267
02:54:47.411 --> 02:54:50.440
<v Speaker 2>intelligent people that are looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems in the world in terms of</v>

4268
02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:52.840
<v Speaker 2>carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the atmosphere or pollution in the</v>

4269
02:54:52.841 --> 02:54:55.420
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are already starting to work on</v>

4270
02:54:55.421 --> 02:54:56.550
<v Speaker 2>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

4271
02:54:56.590 --> 02:54:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm really optimistic that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

4272
02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:03.770
<v Speaker 2>there's at least a potential for someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out some to some of these</v>

4273
02:55:03.771 --> 02:55:06.440
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overpopulation is always going to be a</v>

4274
02:55:06.441 --> 02:55:10.280
<v Speaker 2>weird one because you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to tell people how many kids they</v>

4275
02:55:10.281 --> 02:55:13.400
<v Speaker 2>can have cars who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you meet somebody who's got 10</v>

4276
02:55:13.401 --> 02:55:15.470
<v Speaker 2>kids and the most fucking amazing family</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

4277
02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:16.593
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4278
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:18.350
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>

4279
02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:20.930
<v Speaker 2>They have 10 amazing kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's great.</v>

4280
02:55:20.931 --> 02:55:22.100
<v Speaker 2>You go over the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all love.</v>

4281
02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

4282
02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell me.</v>

4283
02:55:24.501 --> 02:55:26.000
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are good,</v>

4284
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:27.370
<v Speaker 2>but only a certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4285
02:55:27.470 --> 02:55:29.060
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weird,</v>

4286
02:55:29.450 --> 02:55:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a cut and dry issue.</v>

4287
02:55:31.971 --> 02:55:33.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not a one or a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4288
02:55:33.591 --> 02:55:34.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are too many people and yeah,</v>

4289
02:55:34.911 --> 02:55:37.790
<v Speaker 2>you probably shouldn't have 10 kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta fucking awesome family,</v>

4290
02:55:37.791 --> 02:55:39.510
<v Speaker 2>so hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a good nightmare.</v>

4291
02:55:39.570 --> 02:55:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck to do?</v>

4292
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4293
02:55:41.380 --> 02:55:42.213
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4294
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:46.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just speaking as you know,</v>

4295
02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:49.820
<v Speaker 2>just has a lot of their brow people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this scenario,</v>

4296
02:55:49.821 --> 02:55:51.740
<v Speaker 2>this is never went well for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always,</v>

4297
02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:54.770
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always check it out.</v>

4298
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:57.490
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell him what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just always watching you.</v>

4299
02:55:57.491 --> 02:55:58.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4300
02:55:58.270 --> 02:56:03.170
<v Speaker 2>This das scenario usually doesn't go</v>
<v Speaker 2>good telling people how many kids are</v>

4301
02:56:03.171 --> 02:56:04.600
<v Speaker 2>gonna have kit though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck at that.</v>

4302
02:56:04.610 --> 02:56:07.130
<v Speaker 2>But it happens like it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about,</v>

4303
02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:10.160
<v Speaker 2>you think about countries where refugees</v>
<v Speaker 2>are pointing to now,</v>

4304
02:56:10.161 --> 02:56:14.220
<v Speaker 2>just just put up illegal sterilization</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you start to see,</v>

4305
02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:17.090
<v Speaker 2>you start to see where countries are</v>
<v Speaker 2>still alive and refugees that are coming</v>

4306
02:56:17.091 --> 02:56:18.740
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy and it's scary.</v>

4307
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:23.090
<v Speaker 2>It was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want my country to become</v>

4308
02:56:23.091 --> 02:56:24.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember what countries have</v>

4309
02:56:24.651 --> 02:56:28.210
<v Speaker 2>sterilized people as they've come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read a story about it once that</v>

4310
02:56:28.211 --> 02:56:30.800
<v Speaker 2>they did that to some refugee somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't remember where it was.</v>

4311
02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember either.</v>

4312
02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm squishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably know so,</v>

4313
02:56:33.490 --> 02:56:36.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I a country accused of sterilizing</v>

4314
02:56:36.681 --> 02:56:38.390
<v Speaker 2>refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was just a rumor.</v>

4315
02:56:38.930 --> 02:56:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's what the snow is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them.</v>

4316
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I could imagine that happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Saying,</v>

4317
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:47.180
<v Speaker 2>not saying with some people if they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>their way.</v>

4318
02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's scary to think about it.</v>

4319
02:56:49.581 --> 02:56:52.760
<v Speaker 2>These are the people we put in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know what was cool to me about</v>

4320
02:56:52.761 --> 02:56:55.640
<v Speaker 2>what Ms. Ellis and taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

4321
02:56:55.730 --> 02:56:57.110
<v Speaker 2>she was a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had one leg,</v>

4322
02:56:57.290 --> 02:57:00.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She and she wore like a curly met Larry</v>

4323
02:57:00.141 --> 02:57:01.860
<v Speaker 2>and mold three stooges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wore the,</v>

4324
02:57:01.861 --> 02:57:04.570
<v Speaker 2>the like the little mushroom hairstyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>curling up.</v>

4325
02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.950
<v Speaker 2>And she was mean as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4326
02:57:06.980 --> 02:57:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was mean.</v>

4327
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:13.880
<v Speaker 2>But this lady talked to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she taught civics and when she taught</v>

4328
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:16.400
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if your parents weren't</v>

4329
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:19.820
<v Speaker 2>naturalizing weren't citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were just born on us soil,</v>

4330
02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you were a citizen.</v>

4331
02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:23.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just like,</v>

4332
02:57:23.331 --> 02:57:24.290
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

4333
02:57:24.291 --> 02:57:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Because when you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time we had learned about,</v>

4334
02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I think in history of the Irish and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their plight to be here and things of</v>

4335
02:57:30.801 --> 02:57:31.610
<v Speaker 2>that nature.</v>

4336
02:57:31.610 --> 02:57:32.241
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4337
02:57:32.241 --> 02:57:35.900
<v Speaker 2>this country gives you a fucking shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is like when America was</v>

4338
02:57:35.901 --> 02:57:37.610
<v Speaker 2>rattled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is in the middle of public enemy</v>

4339
02:57:37.611 --> 02:57:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Erin Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was something to be admired in</v>

4340
02:57:40.881 --> 02:57:43.640
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like James Baldwin had an adoration for</v>

4341
02:57:43.641 --> 02:57:45.200
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had many people didn't even know he</v>

4342
02:57:45.201 --> 02:57:46.190
<v Speaker 2>ended up dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4343
02:57:46.191 --> 02:57:49.340
<v Speaker 2>as he's living in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the expectation that dream,</v>

4344
02:57:49.341 --> 02:57:51.800
<v Speaker 2>that American sales you manage shit is</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

4345
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Eric can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to know that that was a possibility</v>

4346
02:57:55.610 --> 02:57:58.910
<v Speaker 2>then and now my kids don't think like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and my kids are dead in the middle</v>

4347
02:57:58.911 --> 02:58:01.590
<v Speaker 2>of keeping people out as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking weird.</v>

4348
02:58:01.591 --> 02:58:02.130
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

4349
02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:05.130
<v Speaker 1>in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to death something I'm I see</v>

4350
02:58:05.131 --> 02:58:08.460
<v Speaker 1>happening in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how afraid I am right now with</v>

4351
02:58:08.461 --> 02:58:11.370
<v Speaker 1>shit going fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean when I say when you</v>

4352
02:58:11.371 --> 02:58:12.570
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4353
02:58:12.571 --> 02:58:17.571
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a government or a world one</v>
<v Speaker 1>day where people will be a more fluent,</v>

4354
02:58:17.611 --> 02:58:20.940
<v Speaker 1>well in capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm a capitalist,</v>

4355
02:58:20.941 --> 02:58:22.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to practice compassionate</v>

4356
02:58:22.260 --> 02:58:26.280
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism requires someone get</v>

4357
02:58:26.281 --> 02:58:29.370
<v Speaker 1>snuckered does it really the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice it,</v>

4358
02:58:29.371 --> 02:58:33.330
<v Speaker 1>absolutely ideal that you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more like Milton Friedman and the</v>

4359
02:58:33.331 --> 02:58:34.390
<v Speaker 1>free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4360
02:58:34.410 --> 02:58:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And what Thomas all talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we as in you and I know,</v>

4361
02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:40.170
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I engage in capitalism.</v>

4362
02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I occasionally capitalism has a</v>

4363
02:58:42.001 --> 02:58:46.290
<v Speaker 1>lot more fair than what countries are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with one another large scale sit</v>

4364
02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:49.860
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I say the current system of</v>

4365
02:58:49.861 --> 02:58:52.680
<v Speaker 1>capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with you being</v>

4366
02:58:52.681 --> 02:58:55.500
<v Speaker 1>able to buy that beautiful jeep outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the work you've done.</v>

4367
02:58:55.500 --> 02:58:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Your work ethic will determine your</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth is written in the window of my</v>

4368
02:58:58.741 --> 02:59:00.420
<v Speaker 1>barbershop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really mean it,</v>

4369
02:59:00.421 --> 02:59:01.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're work ethic is gonna determine</v>

4370
02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:03.540
<v Speaker 1>with you or even if there was no such</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as money,</v>

4371
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:05.880
<v Speaker 1>if you plow your fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to be more bountiful.</v>

4372
02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:08.210
<v Speaker 1>So long it's been [inaudible] me ask you</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

4373
02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:11.220
<v Speaker 1>You think it's the system of capitalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself that has the flaws in it or is it</v>

4374
02:59:11.221 --> 02:59:14.760
<v Speaker 1>human nature as desire to exploit</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

4375
02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's human nature unchecked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that system.</v>

4376
02:59:19.410 --> 02:59:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4377
02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that allowing marijuana to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become legal should not have allowed.</v>

4378
02:59:26.671 --> 02:59:29.400
<v Speaker 1>The type of taxation that's been allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California.</v>

4379
02:59:30.330 --> 02:59:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Colorado was at one point in time was</v>
<v Speaker 1>39% yeah.</v>

4380
02:59:34.140 --> 02:59:35.700
<v Speaker 1>What does it in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4381
02:59:35.701 --> 02:59:37.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's high enough that I seen the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

4382
02:59:37.201 --> 02:59:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So we'd go from about $150 to 320 bucks.</v>

4383
02:59:40.050 --> 02:59:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would like it if all that money</v>

4384
02:59:42.901 --> 02:59:44.760
<v Speaker 1>went to a good purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know it's not.</v>

4385
02:59:44.761 --> 02:59:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

4386
02:59:47.980 --> 02:59:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Counting Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4387
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:52.710
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it never lands where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

4388
02:59:52.711 --> 02:59:55.500
<v Speaker 1>It never does what it's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm,</v>

4389
02:59:55.530 --> 02:59:56.700
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm getting.</v>

4390
02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:58.460
<v Speaker 1>That's why I said when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Stereo,</v>

4391
02:59:58.490 --> 02:59:59.041
<v Speaker 1>when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4392
02:59:59.041 --> 03:00:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to be that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually I go,</v>

4393
03:00:00.611 --> 03:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>but for bribery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you just like God fucking</v>

4394
03:00:03.691 --> 03:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4395
03:00:04.921 --> 03:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>why isn't good happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate cause so much money is pushed</v>

4396
03:00:08.491 --> 03:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>into the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4397
03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>if we does become legal worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Thai.</v>

4398
03:00:13.310 --> 03:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean countrywide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that it's going</v>

4399
03:00:15.861 --> 03:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>to stimulate economies and a lot of very</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor places.</v>

4400
03:00:18.151 --> 03:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have some real positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

4401
03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4402
03:00:22.081 --> 03:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

4403
03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying about capitalism is why</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we not ensuring that the people who</v>

4404
03:00:29.431 --> 03:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>have suffered since 1937 have a fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot?</v>

4405
03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've allowed so many laws to come in</v>

4406
03:00:37.081 --> 03:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>with marijuana legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it does not allow for the spa</v>

4407
03:00:40.671 --> 03:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>business man to have the type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity is set up,</v>

4408
03:00:45.151 --> 03:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>got a small liquor store had at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of prohibition or bar.</v>

4409
03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was telling me that in Ohio they</v>

4410
03:00:50.971 --> 03:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>were setting it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were trying to make it legal,</v>

4411
03:00:52.981 --> 03:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but only two guys can grow it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous corporations.</v>

4412
03:00:56.010 --> 03:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>That was the bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4413
03:00:57.160 --> 03:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it worked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

4414
03:00:58.620 --> 03:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I believe might've been four</v>

4415
03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:01.300
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't a lot,</v>

4416
03:01:01.570 --> 03:01:03.540
<v Speaker 2>some small amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were the only ones who could.</v>

4417
03:01:03.850 --> 03:01:04.683
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

4418
03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that's fucked up.</v>

4419
03:01:06.250 --> 03:01:08.140
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't even ask for them.</v>

4420
03:01:08.170 --> 03:01:11.920
<v Speaker 2>We notice fucked up when it should just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be your lab to grow it with a,</v>

4421
03:01:12.250 --> 03:01:15.040
<v Speaker 2>with $100 state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal tax,</v>

4422
03:01:15.610 --> 03:01:18.430
<v Speaker 2>state tax stamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta stay tax to have 100 bucks.</v>

4423
03:01:18.550 --> 03:01:21.970
<v Speaker 2>You can grow up to three acres of</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

4424
03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love it,</v>

4425
03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:24.910
<v Speaker 2>love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect love you do your shit.</v>

4426
03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:27.700
<v Speaker 2>And then the growers have to buy from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

4427
03:01:27.701 --> 03:01:29.640
<v Speaker 2>So if a farmer wants to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective with,</v>

4428
03:01:29.641 --> 03:01:31.780
<v Speaker 2>for the farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are making that collective,</v>

4429
03:01:31.781 --> 03:01:36.190
<v Speaker 2>but we shouldn't be able to to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to allow that type of domination because</v>

4430
03:01:36.191 --> 03:01:38.110
<v Speaker 2>essentially then you're just giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4431
03:01:38.350 --> 03:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monopolies of sorts.</v>

4432
03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:42.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I just,</v>

4433
03:01:42.611 --> 03:01:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust us to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on our shit enough with the people</v>

4434
03:01:47.411 --> 03:01:48.244
<v Speaker 2>we leave in charge.</v>

4435
03:01:48.310 --> 03:01:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it also,</v>

4436
03:01:49.810 --> 03:01:51.970
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't make sense in any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

4437
03:01:52.210 --> 03:01:56.260
<v Speaker 2>And then the of the relationship are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all someone is saying is if I let you</v>

4438
03:01:56.261 --> 03:01:59.380
<v Speaker 2>sell something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give me a certain percentage because</v>

4439
03:01:59.381 --> 03:02:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you're basically saying that all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frameworks of our government and the</v>

4440
03:02:04.500 --> 03:02:08.440
<v Speaker 2>the city's roads that you drive on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff takes money to maintain.</v>

4441
03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:12.520
<v Speaker 2>So we're just going to take a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece now they'd take it 39% that's so</v>

4442
03:02:12.521 --> 03:02:16.990
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that 39% went all to public</v>

4443
03:02:16.991 --> 03:02:21.640
<v Speaker 2>schools and paying teachers more money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and paying cops and paying firemen and</v>

4444
03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>community centers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but beyond just pain,</v>

4445
03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:29.620
<v Speaker 2>good son of a former cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cousin of current cops,</v>

4446
03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>policemen should be from areas that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're policing or areas like those.</v>

4447
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:41.290
<v Speaker 2>They should be offered no interest loans</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live at and around those communities,</v>

4448
03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:44.290
<v Speaker 2>teachers should be also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fire department,</v>

4449
03:02:44.470 --> 03:02:48.550
<v Speaker 2>they should almost hold a special place</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the nobility of those jobs</v>

4450
03:02:48.730 --> 03:02:49.900
<v Speaker 2>and how important they are.</v>

4451
03:02:50.170 --> 03:02:53.290
<v Speaker 2>We all should do stuff like tax freeze</v>
<v Speaker 2>is once you retire,</v>

4452
03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever your taxes are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you retire at 65 years old,</v>

4453
03:02:57.070 --> 03:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>we should knock baby 10 20% off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you pay until you die.</v>

4454
03:03:00.970 --> 03:03:04.540
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should do everything we can to make</v>

4455
03:03:04.580 --> 03:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>the the class of people you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>about affluence possible and we're not</v>

4456
03:03:08.711 --> 03:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>doing it like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the only button I'm</v>

4457
03:03:11.621 --> 03:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>pushing when I seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm a very optimistic person,</v>

4458
03:03:14.321 --> 03:03:19.321
<v Speaker 2>but my pessimism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pessimism comes more from the lack of</v>

4459
03:03:19.511 --> 03:03:23.370
<v Speaker 2>what I've seen us be willing to do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that one another treated</v>

4460
03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:25.660
<v Speaker 2>fairly then I have seen for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4461
03:03:25.690 --> 03:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I refuse to disavow.</v>

4462
03:03:28.990 --> 03:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday tends just an attitude though.</v>

4463
03:03:31.181 --> 03:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>And that people evolve that attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4464
03:03:33.270 --> 03:03:37.060
<v Speaker 2>We realize how important cooperation</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is a dewey though without being</v>

4465
03:03:37.061 --> 03:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>attacked by all of us.</v>

4466
03:03:39.220 --> 03:03:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Some of us do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of us do.</v>

4467
03:03:40.961 --> 03:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4468
03:03:42.341 --> 03:03:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do.</v>

4469
03:03:43.230 --> 03:03:44.440
<v Speaker 2>If there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that do,</v>

4470
03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:47.190
<v Speaker 2>and it takes a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hard knock into your head to,</v>

4471
03:03:47.490 --> 03:03:49.090
<v Speaker 2>to really let it sink in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4472
03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:52.000
<v Speaker 2>But once you do let it sink in and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>live your life that way,</v>

4473
03:03:52.450 --> 03:03:55.120
<v Speaker 2>reciprocity and friendship for all and</v>
<v Speaker 2>camaraderie.</v>

4474
03:03:55.121 --> 03:03:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm so richer life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a better life.</v>

4475
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is people aren't taught,</v>

4476
03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:01.140
<v Speaker 2>they're not taught in enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not taught it in.</v>

4477
03:04:01.141 --> 03:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Men are taught to to face each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hate each other and the hate on each</v>

4478
03:04:04.101 --> 03:04:07.950
<v Speaker 2>other and not look at each other in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a a famine mentality or a</v>

4479
03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:10.910
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lamest shit alive that is life.</v>

4480
03:04:11.060 --> 03:04:13.070
<v Speaker 2>The opposite is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The obstacle.</v>

4481
03:04:13.071 --> 03:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>You're uplifting people and like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've give out 35 shoutouts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4484
03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:22.820
<v Speaker 2>That makes me feel better that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like you out there.</v>

4485
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:26.240
<v Speaker 2>It makes people feel better when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to your music and they enjoy it.</v>

4486
03:04:26.241 --> 03:04:29.210
<v Speaker 2>That you're this guy behind it that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking any of this for granted and</v>
