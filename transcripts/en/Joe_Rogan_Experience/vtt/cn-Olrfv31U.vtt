00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I think what you said is dead on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go straight.</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 1>He's got to go straight African-american</v>
<v Speaker 1>because white people are just not heavy</v>

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think we need to</v>

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>recognize the return of Dr Cosby and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send a shout out to him and all the</v>

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 2>So the barbershops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm triggered.</v>

7
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:19.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm triggered.</v>

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You were saying before the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do you do if you're at a</v>

9
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>comedy club and bill cosby walks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause apparently bill cosby's doing</v>

10
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>standup again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like what do you do?</v>

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't he in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure.</v>

12
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure to be funny.</v>

13
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Why guy in jail?</v>

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause the first first trial was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a mistrial?</v>

15
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>there was a mistrial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>

18
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean how many people have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy fucking drug me and rape me.</v>

19
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there some sort of,</v>

20
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine there's like 80 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are telling the same story of you</v>

21
00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>drugging them and raping them and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

22
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>So on the Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'll say.</v>

23
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Like the soccer up two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

24
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

25
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anything black a little bit</v>

26
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about bill cosby.</v>

27
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 2>This is too soon for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I just,</v>

28
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting that this happened</v>

29
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.460
<v Speaker 2>after this weekend was the women's March</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know like a lot of people want to</v>

30
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 2>roll their eyes and I was getting a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit on instagram for like the</v>

31
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 2>women's March.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys have it.</v>

32
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly the kind of thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified of is that this guy is now</v>

33
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 2>not in jail and he's just like back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing standup.</v>

34
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't know if we've got</v>

35
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 2>desensitized or if we just forgot about</v>
<v Speaker 2>him or we just got sick of talking about</v>

36
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:36.011
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

37
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand how people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that plumbing,</v>

38
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

39
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>he has an enormous ego and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopath and I think that he is,</v>

40
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has enough fans in,</v>

41
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>enough people in his community still</v>
<v Speaker 1>love him or he can go places and small</v>

42
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>places and they accept him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's,</v>

43
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's advertising it.</v>

44
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>And what is twitter people that except</v>
<v Speaker 2>him with this?</v>

45
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it people who have their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeletons in the closet and they see him</v>

46
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>coming back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they get redemption in some</v>

47
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 2>way or maybe it makes them not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrigible people or is it like a herd</v>

48
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.760
<v Speaker 2>mentality or is it just star fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you rationalize that in your</v>

49
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of Star fucking okay.</v>

50
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he's famous eclipse is the</v>

51
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 2>fact that he is,</v>

52
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic.</v>

53
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember how it was right after</v>

54
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Oj got innocent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy,</v>

55
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>and I want to say his name because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect him.</v>

56
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a comic and he went on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

57
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.251
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a black guy.</v>

58
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my blackness will not allow me to think</v>

59
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 1>that Oj did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

60
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was interesting.</v>

61
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what now?</v>

62
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.640
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did I just hear like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

63
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:46.031
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

64
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 1>all black people are innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does a black person comes in and</v>

65
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>kills your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will your blackness exonerate that</v>

66
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

67
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to handle it then?</v>

68
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what the demo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

69
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 2>what were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know who was in that job?</v>

70
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Was it all black people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

71
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

72
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I can't read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just,</v>

73
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm sick to my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be,</v>

74
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a,</v>

75
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's a blown bit when</v>
<v Speaker 3>rape culture on stage performing and</v>

76
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 3>there's not like a complete melee of</v>
<v Speaker 3>disapproval.</v>

77
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 3>That's really scary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is scary.</v>

78
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 3>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that,</v>

79
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of people that</v>

80
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 3>get overwhelmed by celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he shows up.</v>

81
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe he's here.</v>

82
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to say Manson goes up at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jazz club.</v>

83
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's a celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a Charles Manson.</v>

84
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Less of a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>

85
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 3>I'll throw this at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never killed anybody.</v>

86
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Charles Manson actually told people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill people and they did.</v>

87
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 3>And it's terrible that they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Tex Watson did all the crimes and</v>

88
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.594
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

89
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 3>what was her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Squeaky fromme.</v>

90
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 3>She was wanting to try to kill Gerald</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ford.</v>

91
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the one who did the crimes.</v>

92
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 3>He was just this crazy fuck who talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people into these things.</v>

93
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the puppet master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

94
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 3>But that really scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raped,</v>

95
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 3>who knows how many women and allegedly</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

96
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

97
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

98
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 3>it scares me and shakes me to my core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

99
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 3>not that a psychopath does psychopathic</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

100
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 3>but the people who permit it and who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>permissive and are okay with it and</v>

101
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 3>don't resist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that a bunch of people in</v>

102
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:15.221
<v Speaker 3>that club were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

103
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:15.851
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

104
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know what happened.</v>

105
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 3>We just know that he was there and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that he's going to do another show.</v>

106
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 3>And then he announced that he was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do some show at a jazz club.</v>

107
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

108
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 3>is it today or tomorrow?</v>

109
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 3>And is this jazz club?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

110
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about it.</v>

111
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Probably tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like frozen with disgust.</v>

112
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing is that</v>

113
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 3>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's already over.</v>

114
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 3>It's as promised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he performed at a jazz club today,</v>

115
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 3>but this article is yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

116
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.960
<v Speaker 3>That's promise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

117
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a man of his word.</v>

118
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 3>He might be a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does not lie.</v>

119
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 3>And he was wearing that hello friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweater that he always wears a fucking</v>

120
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 3>night and he's got that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bobby Brown thing on,</v>

121
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The microphone or the microphone</v>

122
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 3>headpiece thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

123
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so tricky because it's like,</v>

124
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I was getting all these nasty comments</v>
<v Speaker 3>on instagram this weekend.</v>

125
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you getting nasty comments for</v>

126
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 3>what I think with what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

127
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 3>why the guy was posting photos from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>women's March,</v>

128
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 3>which was the march was about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

129
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think just in the last month or</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

130
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 3>there's been a little bit of eye roll of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

131
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is still going on.</v>

132
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of,</v>

133
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:30.841
<v Speaker 3>I think guys and women also who are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit exhausted or I had one guy I</v>

134
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 3>talked to a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine who was like,</v>

135
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm done with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean you're done with that?</v>

136
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:38.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

137
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 3>we're done with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

138
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 3>sexual predators being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

139
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.430
<v Speaker 3>getting in trouble and getting fired her</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

140
00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>and getting cleansed from our society</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hustled please,</v>

141
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopping from assaulting people in the</v>

142
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were just to go,</v>

143
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 3>just do feel like this has gotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

144
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.001
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

145
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people think it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hysteria or it's like women</v>

146
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>being dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then something like this happens and</v>

148
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:03.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

149
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>are we not being dramatic enough because</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy that he's just going on</v>

150
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>stage and performing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as if everything's just kind of</v>

151
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.210
<v Speaker 2>fine again.</v>

152
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a bad example because I</v>

153
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.410
<v Speaker 1>think he's nuts and I don't think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes any sense.</v>

154
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I think anyone who rapes is treating</v>
<v Speaker 2>people is not,</v>

155
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.320
<v Speaker 2>I think all of these people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're more nuts for just being</v>

156
00:06:19.321 --> 00:06:19.741
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

157
00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we are.</v>

158
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I think most people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the far outraged,</v>

159
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I sent it to Tom Segura and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

160
00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:31.851
<v Speaker 2>his immediate reaction was like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He give me like a bunch of people who</v>

161
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:34.680
<v Speaker 2>are in that jazz club and the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>owns that jazz club.</v>

162
00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

163
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.543
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>

164
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't know who these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

165
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.360
<v Speaker 2>If I'm in a comedy club in bill cosby</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets on stage and I'm like,</v>

166
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I got to hear what the fuck this bitch</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to say.</v>

167
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being like awesome bill cosby's</v>

168
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:50.190
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I should give them the benefit</v>

169
00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:52.920
<v Speaker 2>of the doubt and assume that they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing some kind of circus show.</v>

170
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

171
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think it was yellow.</v>

172
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I definitely think I would sit there</v>

173
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>and watch and like study him like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird fucking creature,</v>

174
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.480
<v Speaker 1>which is what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

175
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.970
<v Speaker 1>he's an aberration in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in humanity.</v>

176
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.833
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.730
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an aberration a couple of ways.</v>

178
00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:16.564
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

179
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>He's an outlier in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

180
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the popularity he reached,</v>

181
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>he reached us insane level of popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did in the 60s and the 70s when</v>

182
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 1>the world was a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

183
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this a bunch of times</v>

184
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.940
<v Speaker 1>as podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people drug people back</v>

185
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was normal.</v>

186
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that dropping a mickey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's drinks,</v>

187
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>it was common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not normal.</v>

188
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people did it and I</v>

190
00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will still do it.</v>

191
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.230
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of famous people did</v>
<v Speaker 1>it back then.</v>

193
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I think they were giving out pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think,</v>

194
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I think culturally we've evolved way</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than we are aware of.</v>

195
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I think we think of ourselves as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar to people from the 1960s I</v>

196
00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:02.430
<v Speaker 1>don't think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're way,</v>

197
00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:07.431
<v Speaker 1>I think if you go from like 1810 to 1870</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet people are pretty goddamn similar.</v>

198
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

199
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:11.963
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

200
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think technology's moving so fast and</v>

201
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:16.650
<v Speaker 2>adapting to that and the fact that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have alarm systems</v>

202
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.680
<v Speaker 1>got a 1960 to 2018 way different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Fucking way different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's acceptable?</v>

204
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>How people think of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've w just as how people,</v>

205
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and one of the reasons why</v>

206
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 1>guys are eyebrow and about the women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>march is,</v>

207
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>is that it's a new thing and this is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming amount of energy that's</v>

208
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>headed towards this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And but what it represents is years,</v>

209
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>decades of frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women that had to work with guys that</v>

210
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>were grabbing their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't trying to fuck them.</v>

211
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Pendulum swung hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it snapped fast and,</v>

212
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 2>and there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always talk about that.</v>

213
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 2>And I'm obsessed with epigenetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>imprinting.</v>

214
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not just us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our moms and our grandmothers.</v>

215
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.610
<v Speaker 2>This happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we carry that pain and that,</v>

216
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

217
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.310
<v Speaker 1>suffering with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that say,</v>

218
00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do anything.</v>

219
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have to feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the thing,</v>

220
00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.940
<v Speaker 1>these guys saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with this.</v>

221
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not even a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

222
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>how are you done with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is,</v>

223
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.440
<v Speaker 2>how is this inconveniencing you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

224
00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how the stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

225
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

226
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.750
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

227
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:22.270
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a couple of,</v>

228
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in La,</v>

229
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:25.090
<v Speaker 2>you're always sitting in women's march</v>
<v Speaker 2>draft it.</v>

230
00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>And I feel that we have who actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

231
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marathon and the gay pride parade</v>

232
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>and the whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

233
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry you're going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sit in traffic for an extra 20</v>

234
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:34.780
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

235
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your Amazon drone.</v>

236
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Why are you driving on a Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway?</v>

237
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

238
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I just,</v>

239
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't an office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate it.</v>

240
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>I guess I just don't understand why this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is such a hassle for men.</v>

241
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why it's such an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you were raping people,</v>

242
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 2>assaulting people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting people,</v>

243
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 2>nothing's being taken away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like a lot of men thinks</v>

244
00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 2>something's being taken away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what that is.</v>

245
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just a little bit confused if</v>

246
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 2>it's unfollow me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

247
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Unfollowed if it's blowing up your</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter feed and your instagram.</v>

248
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wrap my head around why this is</v>

249
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 2>such an inconvenience for guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So threatening</v>

250
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think was that many guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are saying this.</v>

251
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Most men I think are recognizing that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the stories like the Harvey</v>

252
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein one is the worst and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>egregious example,</v>

253
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

254
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:32.321
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that did it for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even enabled him to bill cosby's</v>

255
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:33.770
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

256
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Because cosby was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein was an obvious</v>

257
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

258
00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

259
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.420
<v Speaker 1>don't go in the chicken coop with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wool.</v>

260
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.900
<v Speaker 2>And here's something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was also getting shit about this,</v>

261
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

262
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

263
00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:48.820
<v Speaker 2>if you knew about Harvey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you say something?</v>

264
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.790
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a testament to how,</v>

265
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's someone said that.</v>

266
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just got some comments that were</v>

267
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.381
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

268
00:10:56.381 --> 00:10:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you knew about Harvey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you say something?</v>

269
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you knew about it 10 years ago or</v>

270
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:00.850
<v Speaker 2>whatever it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.980
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard like,</v>

272
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes sleeps with actresses and he</v>

273
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:07.330
<v Speaker 2>like makes them fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wasn't really in that world,</v>

274
00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:09.010
<v Speaker 2>so I knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was I going to call it?</v>

275
00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:09.940
<v Speaker 2>The New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

276
00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on comedy central for 10 minutes.</v>

277
00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

278
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who was going to let you know?</v>

279
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the kind of thing where we</v>

280
00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know what we were allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say and we didn't even know that there</v>

281
00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:24.970
<v Speaker 2>was a possibility for change or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a possibility that anything</v>

282
00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Speaker 2>would be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how I'm ingrained in our</v>

283
00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:28.811
<v Speaker 2>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

284
00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And how we just didn't know there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

285
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:31.510
<v Speaker 2>We just thought that's how it was.</v>

286
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

287
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't work under him.</v>

288
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 2>He did come to the comedy store ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you were gone.</v>

289
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.120
<v Speaker 2>And this isn't like my Harvey Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

290
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:43.870
<v Speaker 2>like it's not close to how awful most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women's stories are,</v>

291
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:45.580
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more like kind of funny.</v>

292
00:11:45.581 --> 00:11:48.100
<v Speaker 2>He came to the comedy store and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

293
00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on stage to the main room and</v>

294
00:11:49.931 --> 00:11:51.670
<v Speaker 2>then I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Tommy called me and he was</v>

295
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:51.851
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

296
00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Tara Harvey Weinstein came to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

297
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 2>he's here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to come back and talk to him.</v>

298
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like already at the Improv are</v>

299
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 2>already like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

300
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go.</v>

301
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 2>And then the only reason I did not go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back at first,</v>

302
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck him for just like summoning me to</v>

303
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 2>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making $22 at the comedy store.</v>

304
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.653
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

305
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

306
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I'd already took me 40 minutes to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the comedy store parking lot.</v>

307
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't go back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

308
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember literally just being like the</v>

309
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>lighting in there as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to see me.</v>

310
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 2>The lighting on stage is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he saw me at my best and I really</v>

311
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 2>don't want to go back and like talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

312
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't like know how to do small talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the producers.</v>

313
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:31.781
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:32.980
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a neurotic mess.</v>

315
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not good at like charming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

316
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

317
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy way to think of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was perfect.</v>

318
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a disaster.</v>

319
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you saw me at my best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

320
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:46.990
<v Speaker 2>let me just get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

321
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how bad it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

322
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the kind of thing that it's</v>

323
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:53.150
<v Speaker 2>like we didn't know what we didn't know.</v>

324
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Feel a little guilty though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what you're saying,</v>

325
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>what I'm getting is that you've people</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that to you,</v>

326
00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:58.470
<v Speaker 1>that you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

327
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

328
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>

329
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.270
<v Speaker 2>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot of women that</v>

330
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:05.970
<v Speaker 2>kind of have done nothing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're consumed with guilt and shame.</v>

331
00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

332
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad to hear you say that cause</v>

333
00:13:09.811 --> 00:13:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not hearing a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing a lot of empathy and</v>

334
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just like zoning in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative comments.</v>

335
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Never had a female employee and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>never worked in an office.</v>

336
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But even though you hear all this sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment shit and any ego,</v>

337
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.940
<v Speaker 1>did I do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

338
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like everybody did something,</v>

339
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were the same way.</v>

340
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember working on a talk show</v>

341
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well does that count?</v>

342
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.960
<v Speaker 2>That's not as bad as like getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>granular about it.</v>

343
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember I worked on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

344
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.860
<v Speaker 2>a talk show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late night talk show and a guy came up</v>

345
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 2>to me in front of like a couple of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>writers and he took his hand and like</v>

346
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 2>put it between my butt cheeks and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>went like swiped.</v>

347
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like a credit card machine and</v>

348
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 2>like everybody started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course I started laughing cause I</v>

349
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 2>didn't like froze and I was embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

350
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 2>he was like my coworker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

351
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just kind of a Dick comedy</v>

352
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 2>writer and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>

353
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the time I had no concept that</v>

354
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:06.140
<v Speaker 2>it was offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was emotionally so naaman unconscious</v>

355
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 2>in my twenties like I didn't even think</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do anything about it.</v>

356
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 2>But looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

357
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 2>that was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was I going to call human</v>

358
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 2>resources and say that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these little tiny things</v>

359
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:20.170
<v Speaker 2>that aren't enough to be assault but are</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much to be appropriate.</v>

360
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like a gray area that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

361
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

362
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.360
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for us to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to delineate what makes sense of it.</v>

363
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Well it's funny how cautious you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

364
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're joking around when we had</v>

365
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.430
<v Speaker 1>these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoverboards and we're rolling around</v>

366
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 1>these and you would not have caught me</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you didn't want to touch me.</v>

367
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 1>That's my fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But which you said was hilarious.</v>

368
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were under to say something about,</v>

369
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 1>but you weren't sure if you could talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you were worried that</v>

370
00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you bringing up the porn.</v>

371
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somehow or another be sexually</v>

372
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 3>harassing and I had to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

373
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that to matt.</v>

374
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you want.</v>

375
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I ever give you license right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly say whatever the fuck you want.</v>

376
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't sexually harass me.</v>

377
00:15:05.551 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

378
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>

379
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a hypocrite.</v>

380
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been coming back to the comedy</v>

381
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 3>store a lot and I hadn't been there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last like six months.</v>

382
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:20.190
<v Speaker 3>I've been working on something and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>noticed when I used to go to the comedy</v>

383
00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to feel like pray or any company</v>

384
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 3>club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

385
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would hug you too long and you</v>

386
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were just waiting to kind of like</v>

387
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 3>have something inappropriate happened.</v>

388
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I went in the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not one man hugged me.</v>

389
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Coloma lady like bowing at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one would come near me like I was a</v>

390
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:42.560
<v Speaker 3>fucking leper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donnell Rawlings came up to me and gave</v>

391
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 3>me a hug and halfway through he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

392
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>

393
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Am I allowed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was just like,</v>

394
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 3>oh Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is,</v>

395
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tables have turned because it used</v>

396
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 3>to be women who are terrified of men and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now men are kind of terrified or you're</v>

397
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 3>afraid of being called out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that.</v>

398
00:15:56.601 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of guys going over the grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have skeletons in your</v>

399
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 3>closet though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're afraid,</v>

400
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.710
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>

401
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 3>are you afraid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know you have some shit.</v>

402
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

403
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to have skeletons in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>closet.</v>

404
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just have a bad relationship</v>

405
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 3>where someone's mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

406
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 3>this is these and sorry thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very bizarre.</v>

407
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Like this seems like he went on a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>date and they took turns eating each</v>

408
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 3>other out and blown each other and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't like it and she said that</v>

409
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 3>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck happened</v>

410
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 3>cause I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of people that are</v>

411
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:32.750
<v Speaker 3>picking sides on this and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not accusing or supporting</v>

412
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 3>either side cause I don't think there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough information yet.</v>

413
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 3>And it all seems very like he had one</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

414
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 3>she had one experience and if they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>both telling the truth,</v>

415
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who fucking knows.</v>

416
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.090
<v Speaker 3>But here's what I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just about my experience in my twenties</v>

417
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Speaker 3>as a woman is I was not fully formed yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 22 years old.</v>

418
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had literally no sex.</v>

419
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to have in my twenties I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to have you understand that now</v>

420
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:58.410
<v Speaker 3>that the frontal lobe is not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully formed and human being cracked,</v>

421
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 3>cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Hey guys in your thirties and forties</v>

422
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 3>stopped dating 20 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just in general.</v>

423
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

424
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.880
<v Speaker 3>and I think that a really big part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversation that for me a blind</v>

425
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:10.964
<v Speaker 3>spot is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

426
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 3>sexual abuse victims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the statistics are a little foggy,</v>

427
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 3>but like one out of six women are</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually assaulted as children and those</v>

428
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:23.690
<v Speaker 3>are only the people that come forward is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that real one on a six one out of six</v>

429
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

430
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 3>is the statistic for people that come</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward that's not even including the</v>

431
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:29.330
<v Speaker 3>people that don't come forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a lot,</v>

432
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

433
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 3>and not to get too serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't fucking Olympia,</v>

434
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see that Olympic thing makes me,</v>

435
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 3>it makes me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Olympic thing is insane.</v>

436
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 3>The Olympic gymnastics coach or doctor</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather that was molesting all those</v>

437
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes me homicidal.</v>

438
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 3>And when they're doing the testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls that he's saying that this is</v>

439
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:49.220
<v Speaker 3>too uncomfortable for him to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these girls</v>

440
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 2>saw that guy on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd kill him,</v>

441
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 2>but my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to,</v>

442
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go batshit crazy.</v>

443
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:56.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

444
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't talk about this publicly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too embarrassed.</v>

445
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that guys,</v>

446
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 2>some guys have this idea that us being</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually harassed is like fun for us and</v>

447
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 2>we like want to come forward and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some glory in it.</v>

448
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing and it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't talk about my sexual</v>

449
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:12.910
<v Speaker 2>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

450
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.900
<v Speaker 2>publicly cause I just like freeze up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can</v>

451
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you're very self aware there are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that take some sort of glory in being</v>

452
00:18:20.561 --> 00:18:21.394
<v Speaker 1>victimized.</v>

453
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak to that.</v>

454
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:28.870
<v Speaker 1>But I mean by that is to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will exaggerate any sort of</v>

455
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.610
<v Speaker 1>interaction with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's people but men and women,</v>

456
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's what I'll say,</v>

457
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.850
<v Speaker 2>that that could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about the science of</v>

458
00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:38.684
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

459
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.300
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my experience was the opposite.</v>

460
00:18:41.301 --> 00:18:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I minimize mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't how most people do.</v>

461
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't come to terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I was sexual assault until</v>

462
00:18:45.831 --> 00:18:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I was 32,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 35.</v>

463
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I just kind of figured this shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

464
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.430
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of stuff that is still</v>
<v Speaker 2>blind spots that I don't want to deal</v>

465
00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.540
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

466
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was only able to write about in my</v>

467
00:18:55.641 --> 00:18:57.890
<v Speaker 2>book because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about it publicly.</v>

468
00:18:57.891 --> 00:19:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I freeze up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get weird and scared and one of the</v>

469
00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:04.940
<v Speaker 2>trauma responses of if you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually assaulted as a child is that</v>

470
00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:08.570
<v Speaker 2>when the man moves towards you or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any kind of sexual,</v>

471
00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:09.590
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like getting all nervous.</v>

472
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.040
<v Speaker 2>When you have a sexual interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you freeze up because when you were</v>

473
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:16.160
<v Speaker 2>sexually assaulted as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't serve you to fight back and</v>

474
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:17.540
<v Speaker 2>you had to kind of disassociate.</v>

475
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>That's why people get confused with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight or flight.</v>

476
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not just fight or flight free</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

477
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a freeze response or I'm sorry,</v>

478
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.090
<v Speaker 1>clear about what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nobody misconstrues this what I'm</v>

479
00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:30.340
<v Speaker 1>saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about real</v>

480
00:19:30.341 --> 00:19:34.210
<v Speaker 1>victimization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about people that love to</v>

481
00:19:34.211 --> 00:19:35.420
<v Speaker 1>play the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

482
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.580
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

483
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about real vic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say that is people take glory and</v>

484
00:19:40.001 --> 00:19:42.280
<v Speaker 1>victimization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean someone who's actually been</v>

485
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:43.570
<v Speaker 1>sexually assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

486
00:19:43.571 --> 00:19:46.930
<v Speaker 1>someone who may have had a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with a person when they said</v>

487
00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:47.620
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

488
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that,</v>

489
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

490
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get bumped at the comedy store and I'm</v>

491
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:54.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you fucking believe I got bumped?</v>

492
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like I just am getting adrenaline</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

493
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and dopamine from like being self</v>
<v Speaker 2>righteous or having been wrong or</v>

494
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:01.810
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

495
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

496
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 2>but I think when it's something real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

497
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 2>My reaction is to complete as he is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big one.</v>

498
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like</v>

499
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>so big one with a salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people get,</v>

500
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.580
<v Speaker 1>not just sexual things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but physical assault,</v>

501
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.240
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens to be</v>

502
00:20:17.241 --> 00:20:20.890
<v Speaker 1>when they're confronted by someone in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous situations that panic and they</v>

503
00:20:20.891 --> 00:20:22.360
<v Speaker 1>freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't do anything.</v>

504
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

505
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.040
<v Speaker 1>they literally can't move.</v>

506
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.400
<v Speaker 2>So if at least 20% of women have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the fuck is going on in</v>

507
00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:30.140
<v Speaker 2>some of these interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

508
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:31.970
<v Speaker 2>like in my twenties when a guy came</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards me,</v>

509
00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I would freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>

510
00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:35.060
<v Speaker 2>why didn't they say no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't they leave?</v>

511
00:20:35.061 --> 00:20:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm fucking frozen and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do.</v>

512
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.930
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

513
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.320
<v Speaker 1>is that has never been involved in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of real altercation when they were</v>

514
00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 1>in danger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone?</v>

515
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.690
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you just,</v>

516
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.910
<v Speaker 1>well you don't know why you didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

517
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>But there's times my life when I look</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

518
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't I fucking say something?</v>

519
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

520
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't I tell that guy to fuck off</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what?</v>

521
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do sometimes.</v>

522
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was me and my whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>

523
00:20:56.241 --> 00:20:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't I tell him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

524
00:20:57.231 --> 00:20:59.240
<v Speaker 2>why didn't I leave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't I tell him to stop?</v>

525
00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

526
00:21:00.381 --> 00:21:03.770
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of it I didn't even understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I was too young too.</v>

527
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.180
<v Speaker 2>And I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

528
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 2>it took me 58 years of a 12 step program</v>
<v Speaker 2>and therapy and Emdr to even be able to</v>

529
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.250
<v Speaker 2>save Emdr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye movement,</v>

530
00:21:13.251 --> 00:21:16.460
<v Speaker 2>reprogramming and desensitization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck would you expect anyone to</v>

531
00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:18.290
<v Speaker 2>know what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could just use</v>

532
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.620
<v Speaker 2>your fans are so fucking smart and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's such neurology nerds.</v>

533
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's off the deep end.</v>

534
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.360
<v Speaker 2>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need in my life it's uh,</v>

535
00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>post traumatic stress disorder or a</v>

536
00:21:31.101 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

537
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 2>it was started for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

538
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam vets and it helps you to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>deactivate traumatic experiences.</v>

539
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done ecstasy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

540
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be,</v>

541
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.610
<v Speaker 1>therapy is supposed to be amazing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have gone through trauma or</v>

542
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.630
<v Speaker 1>been told about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

543
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to Coachella next year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try that.</v>

544
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's supposed to be amazing for</v>

545
00:21:51.131 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 1>people that have gone through real</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic experiences that are so</v>

546
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 1>ingrained in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the memories of those experiences</v>

547
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>are ingrained with trauma and horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings and somehow or another MDM may</v>

548
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:05.510
<v Speaker 1>therapy allows people to separate from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and,</v>

549
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.670
<v Speaker 1>and lose the trigger and like lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose this,</v>

550
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:09.990
<v Speaker 1>this right.</v>

551
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a way more fun way to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Emdr is like you sort of have to</v>

552
00:22:14.431 --> 00:22:18.510
<v Speaker 2>relive the memory and then other shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets on earth and things start clicking</v>

553
00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:19.200
<v Speaker 2>into focus.</v>

554
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they call it ecstasies</v>

555
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.470
<v Speaker 1>cause that's literally what you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel so much love and what,</v>

556
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.140
<v Speaker 1>what his brain with dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

557
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And I only did it once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that stunned me was how</v>

558
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.890
<v Speaker 1>comparatively insecure I am in regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

559
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Comparatively insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you say that again?</v>

560
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Comparatively insecure compared to when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on ecstasy.</v>

561
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inhibition.</v>

562
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so friendly and so warm and so I</v>

563
00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:47.840
<v Speaker 1>try to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

564
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when your,</v>

565
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.830
<v Speaker 1>when you're on ecstasy you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like all the hitches in your</v>

566
00:22:52.831 --> 00:22:54.570
<v Speaker 1>personality or things that are holding</v>
<v Speaker 1>you back.</v>

567
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.220
<v Speaker 1>It made me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only did it once,</v>

568
00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.030
<v Speaker 1>but it made me completely aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity that I didn't even know</v>

569
00:23:00.031 --> 00:23:01.350
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

570
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do that.</v>

571
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:03.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it.</v>

572
00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You'd trip out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

573
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Super</v>

574
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.410
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had another friend,</v>

575
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is doctor prescribed?</v>

697
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.980

<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you just take out all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There it is a medical fear.</v>

702
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.790

704
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:51.310
<v Speaker 3>apparently syphilis untreated</v>
<v Speaker 3>creates like,</v>

705
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.360
<v Speaker 3>like reddening of the face,</v>

<v Speaker 3>little triggered.</v>

745
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think,</v>

746
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that people are reaching for</v>
<v Speaker 1>straws.</v>

747
00:30:42.241 --> 00:30:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was interesting.</v>

748
00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:48.120
<v Speaker 1>The doctor that examined him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>examined him and said that he probably,</v>

749
00:30:48.121 --> 00:30:50.250
<v Speaker 1>if he had a good diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived to be like 200 years old.</v>

750
00:30:50.251 --> 00:30:51.450
<v Speaker 1>These couches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great genes.</v>

751
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That doctor that examined him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

752
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:57.140
<v Speaker 1>this is this doctor's doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that killed Michael Jackson is</v>

753
00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.430
<v Speaker 1>his doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

754
00:30:59.431 --> 00:31:02.790
<v Speaker 1>After he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Sanjay Gupta examine the actual</v>

755
00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:05.340
<v Speaker 1>results and Sanjay Gupta said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

756
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:06.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually an issue here.</v>

757
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.260
<v Speaker 1>And the issue is something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>arteries and something to do with the</v>

758
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.950
<v Speaker 1>potential for a future stroke or heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack and he was going on.</v>

759
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.680
<v Speaker 1>He was basing it on actual test results</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously I don't know Jack Shit</v>

760
00:31:22.681 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 1>about medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see if you could find out what he</v>

761
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:27.030
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a common form of heart disease.</v>

762
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See a scroll up and see if you could</v>

763
00:31:29.571 --> 00:31:31.170
<v Speaker 1>find what it said there.</v>

764
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

765
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.230
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Ronnie Jackson disclosed trump's</v>

766
00:31:37.231 --> 00:31:39.090
<v Speaker 1>basic lab measurements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical exam,</v>

767
00:31:39.091 --> 00:31:43.530
<v Speaker 1>and the conclusion of a cognitive exam</v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the Montreal cognitive</v>

768
00:31:43.531 --> 00:31:44.820
<v Speaker 1>assessment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Additionally,</v>

769
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:48.960
<v Speaker 1>the president had an echo cardiogram of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his heart as well as the stress test.</v>

770
00:31:48.961 --> 00:31:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Both scrubs is normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although is not a part of the official</v>

771
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>medical records that were released</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

772
00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:57.510
<v Speaker 1>After further questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson also reveal the trump underwent</v>

773
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.570
<v Speaker 1>coronary calcium ct scan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is it.</v>

774
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.780
<v Speaker 1>His score was one 33 in anything over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred indicates plaque is present at</v>

775
00:32:05.821 --> 00:32:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the patient has heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to trump's official records in</v>

776
00:32:10.051 --> 00:32:13.740
<v Speaker 1>2009 his coronary calcium score was 34.</v>

777
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Does the president have an obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be in shape?</v>

778
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't Robert Taft like notoriously</v>

779
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.880
<v Speaker 3>obese?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you have to be in shape to be</v>

780
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 3>the president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer.</v>

781
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

782
00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there certain boxes you have to</v>

783
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:27.410
<v Speaker 3>check?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

784
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:32.410
<v Speaker 1>What I'm getting out of this is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sanjay Gupta who is an unconnected third</v>

785
00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:37.160
<v Speaker 1>party who's unbiased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going basically just offered these</v>

786
00:32:37.161 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>coronary calcium ct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

787
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.220
<v Speaker 5>what he's showing is the difference</v>
<v Speaker 5>between how it was in 2009 which was 34</v>

788
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.270
<v Speaker 5>2013 which is 98 and then 2018 which is</v>
<v Speaker 5>one 33.</v>

789
00:32:51.271 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 5>You're saying it's increased?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

790
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Basically doubled every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

791
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 5>Couple of years is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything over 100 indicates heart</v>

792
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to say anything else bad.</v>

793
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:03.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm worried I'll get death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We worry that you want him to get this.</v>

794
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.741
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

795
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:04.491
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

796
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's on millions of fucking people.</v>

797
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

798
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:12.710
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're all sort of just,</v>

799
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 5>just especially angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you were talking about the</v>

800
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 5>pendulum swinging so hard of of women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like having to see this constantly,</v>

801
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 5>everyday in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy is,</v>

802
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:23.840
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard.</v>

803
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard and depressing trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be objective.</v>

804
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 5>This is what I find fascinating about it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that obviously this is an aberration.</v>

805
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.960
<v Speaker 5>Like no one's ever seen something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this before.</v>

806
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:38.170
<v Speaker 5>No one's ever seen a president.</v>

<v Speaker 5>better at blank than him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like a video that was actually</v>

809
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:52.541
<v Speaker 5>put together by people to mock him.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Nobody builds walls better than me.</v>

816
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.250
<v Speaker 6>Nobody's better to people with</v>
<v Speaker 6>disabilities than man.</v>

817
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.530
<v Speaker 6>Nobody's fighting for the veterans like</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fighting for them.</v>

818
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.800
<v Speaker 5>Nobody that's done so much for equality.</v>

819
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.170
<v Speaker 6>There's nobody more pro Israel than I</v>
<v Speaker 6>am.</v>

<v Speaker 6>than I would be tougher on Isis than</v>
<v Speaker 6>Donald Trump.</v>

822
00:34:32.081 --> 00:34:37.081
<v Speaker 6>Nobody's ever had crowds like trump is</v>
<v Speaker 6>crowds of people</v>

823
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.790
<v Speaker 6>and they couldn't corroborate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what it means.</v>

824
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.820
<v Speaker 6>Nobody knows more about trade than me</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the history of this country.</v>

<v Speaker 6>infrastructure has Donald Trump?</v>

826
00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Nobody can do it like me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody</v>

827
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:02.290
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

828
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shed do the opposite.</v>

829
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:03.891
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

830
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that much about this.</v>

831
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 5>Like are more humble about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish he wasn't president because I</v>

832
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:13.250
<v Speaker 5>love him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love what a character he is.</v>

833
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.410
<v Speaker 5>He's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fascinating.</v>

834
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.360
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has powers the problem.</v>

835
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's doing horrible to character and as</v>

836
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:25.970
<v Speaker 5>the host of a reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a gem.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's such a free to be on a reality</v>

838
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:29.300
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

839
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 5>Sign me up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to be running the most powerful</v>

840
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 5>country in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

841
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:36.350
<v Speaker 5>maybe China is now is it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really scary.</v>

842
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just fascinating,</v>

843
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 5>the supporters</v>

844
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I love reading his support his,</v>

845
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm always trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ones are Russians.</v>

846
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of these are Russian?</v>

847
00:35:44.451 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

848
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.610
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few that are women.</v>

849
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what are those women voted for him?</v>

850
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:51.340
<v Speaker 2>What's the deal with those girls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

851
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

852
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.250
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have some family who voted for him</v>

853
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 2>who are in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

854
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exile,</v>

855
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 2>just working class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And their whole thing is like,</v>

856
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:03.450
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't care.</v>

857
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 2>All we care about is the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our jobs.</v>

858
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It's actually kind of a luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

859
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.350
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a fair flaw with what's</v>

860
00:36:10.351 --> 00:36:11.470
<v Speaker 2>happening with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

861
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 2>women's movement conversation is right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

862
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 2>the people getting the most visibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>or fucking millionaires,</v>

863
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of the,</v>

864
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's speaking up right now.</v>

865
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 2>that's what time's up is for to</v>
<v Speaker 2>enfranchise people who don't have the</v>

867
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of resources to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

868
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 2>you're mistreating me.</v>

869
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to quit my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

870
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people can't quit their job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to tolerate sexual harassment</v>

871
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:33.001
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

872
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:35.220
<v Speaker 2>And they don't really have a choice in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the matter of they have to stay in bad</v>

873
00:36:35.221 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>relationships because they can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get their own place or whatever.</v>

874
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:39.504
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

875
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.060
<v Speaker 2>but all they heard was jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their thing is like,</v>

876
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.790
<v Speaker 2>we don't care anything about his</v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

877
00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 2>We think all politicians are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just want jobs.</v>

878
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was gonna promise and he lied.</v>

879
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

880
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.270
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just like sort of played well,</v>

881
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't there more jobs now than ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

882
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And isn't the unemployment as low as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ever been?</v>

883
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.050
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was promised,</v>

884
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health insurance,</v>

885
00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I think they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also thought that they were gonna</v>

886
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:03.330
<v Speaker 2>get this like magical health insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>reform,</v>

887
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:05.040
<v Speaker 2>which they didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was also,</v>

888
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was promising like coal mine jobs,</v>

889
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 2>which is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family members,</v>

890
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:11.130
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to work in coal mines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

891
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's 50,000 jobs,</v>

892
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there it starting to become</v>

893
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:18.120
<v Speaker 2>obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he promised kind of jobs that I think</v>

894
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 2>the pipeline and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>

895
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just watch Fox News and they</v>

896
00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 2>believe everything that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think like liberal news is a lie,</v>

897
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's like the kind of jobs</v>

898
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:29.370
<v Speaker 2>that they promised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know,</v>

899
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think that you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

900
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole thing is unemployment going</v>

901
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 2>up is what helps women because more</v>
<v Speaker 2>women can get John.</v>

902
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.020
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it a case where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

903
00:37:38.021 --> 00:37:41.260
<v Speaker 1>when you see like unemployment and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people were,</v>

904
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing better than before and the economy</v>

905
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:45.020
<v Speaker 1>is doing better than it's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

906
00:37:45.021 --> 00:37:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't this like a natural cycle to like</v>

907
00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:50.060
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it already charting in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction when Obama was leaving?</v>

908
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the president that's like</v>

909
00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:55.120
<v Speaker 2>four years prior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That usually is what causes it because</v>

910
00:37:55.121 --> 00:37:57.760
<v Speaker 2>you can't just like become president and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden there's more jobs.</v>

911
00:37:57.761 --> 00:37:59.530
<v Speaker 2>That's something that has to start a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit earlier.</v>

912
00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

913
00:38:01.001 --> 00:38:01.700
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>

914
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.880
<v Speaker 1>When Obama got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was blaming him like right</v>

915
00:38:04.881 --> 00:38:05.150
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

916
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.040
<v Speaker 2>even though that's probably what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president before him.</v>

917
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

918
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me</v>

919
00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>gain a net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

920
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:14.480
<v Speaker 1>11.5 million jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unemployment rate dropped below the</v>

921
00:38:14.481 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>historical norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

922
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:20.330
<v Speaker 1>4% average weekly earnings for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers were up 4.1% after inflation.</v>

923
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:25.331
<v Speaker 1>The gain was 3.7% or just production and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsupervisory employees after tax</v>

924
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.890
<v Speaker 1>corporate profits also set records as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stock profits.</v>

925
00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:35.891
<v Speaker 1>S and p 500 index rose 166%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some story about how the tax</v>

926
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>break that we got here because of trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people got,</v>

927
00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that California was going to somehow or</v>

928
00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:48.971
<v Speaker 1>another impart some sort of a 10%</v>
<v Speaker 1>surcharge to counterbalance that.</v>

929
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like flat,</v>

930
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but then that they said it was all going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>

931
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social programs.</v>

932
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:55.541
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

933
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for paying more taxes if those</v>

934
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 1>taxes can go to poor communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I feel like.</v>

935
00:39:02.981 --> 00:39:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if there's one thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to concentrate in this country is</v>

936
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>people that are disenfranchised and live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in poor communities that don't feel like</v>

937
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:12.190
<v Speaker 1>there's any hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then setting up community centers,</v>

938
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 1>setting up some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some education programs,</v>

939
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 1>setting up but safe places where kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go and they don't have to worry</v>

940
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 1>about gang violence and shit and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it safer for people and giving</v>

941
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 1>them more opportunities to possibly get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that fucking horrible cycle of</v>

942
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 1>unemployment and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

943
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 1>and fucking welfare and crime.</v>

944
00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And if so many people are stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I completely agree.</v>

945
00:39:33.591 --> 00:39:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And when I think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

946
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.280
<v Speaker 2>oh you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just my point of view</v>

947
00:39:37.281 --> 00:39:39.440
<v Speaker 2>because of what I come from and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being a woman,</v>

948
00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:40.460
<v Speaker 2>a female brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

949
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:43.940
<v Speaker 2>But like when I hear that I'm like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that perpetuates that cycle is</v>

950
00:39:43.941 --> 00:39:47.690
<v Speaker 2>having kids too soon and having a lack</v>
<v Speaker 2>of access to birth control and education</v>

951
00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.300
<v Speaker 2>and this administration is a huge threat</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

952
00:39:50.301 --> 00:39:52.820
<v Speaker 2>An enemy to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like what brain live?</v>

953
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What depletes you faster than a kid?</v>

954
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Was that just a straight up Republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pull this thing?</v>

955
00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always have this problem.</v>

956
00:39:59.361 --> 00:40:01.760
<v Speaker 2>We don't have it like I always do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

957
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.050
<v Speaker 2>What does it say about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me get like a fist.</v>

958
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Do any of your other guests have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem?</v>

959
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay good.</v>

960
00:40:07.401 --> 00:40:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do it before I did a podcast</v>

961
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.870
<v Speaker 2>or radio shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always yell at me cause I wasn't in</v>

962
00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:15.350
<v Speaker 2>the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why is it thing,</v>

963
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 1>it's always a republican thing to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deny women birth control to try to</v>

964
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:20.780
<v Speaker 1>restrict abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is always right</v>

965
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.440
<v Speaker 2>cause I think it probably boils down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and I don't know,</v>

966
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I still can't understand why religion is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that people think women have</v>

967
00:40:27.981 --> 00:40:30.590
<v Speaker 2>to be cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I could have ever for religious,</v>

968
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:31.850
<v Speaker 2>this is what's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

969
00:40:31.851 --> 00:40:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Well he used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think a lot of it's kind of</v>

970
00:40:34.611 --> 00:40:37.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps conveniently now super pro life or</v>

971
00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:39.500
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes the Bible more than I do.</v>

972
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Nobody hates abortion more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could do,</v>

973
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't do an impression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking.</v>

974
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

975
00:40:46.551 --> 00:40:47.510
<v Speaker 2>it's chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

976
00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear it.</v>

977
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Last thing we need is more fucking trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressions at the comedy store.</v>

978
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

979
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.740
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the burn has a really good one.</v>

980
00:40:54.741 --> 00:40:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

981
00:40:56.571 --> 00:40:59.630
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not have seen that coming.</v>

982
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see it coming either.</v>

983
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.360
<v Speaker 2>He did it the other night and went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

984
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.350
<v Speaker 2>He nails it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of amazing.</v>

985
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.680
<v Speaker 2>And he nails it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I have to process that later as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>finger thing.</v>

987
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:10.971
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

988
00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Alec Baldwin's is like fucking just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

989
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.300
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

990
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's religiously sort of based</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

991
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.250
<v Speaker 2>and Hubris based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just the idea that women</v>

992
00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:20.540
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have control over their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

993
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you want me to have kids that I'm</v>

994
00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:24.110
<v Speaker 2>not ready for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What seats are,</v>

995
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic system.</v>

996
00:41:25.821 --> 00:41:27.410
<v Speaker 2>It means everyone else has to pay more</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

997
00:41:27.411 --> 00:41:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It puts more people on welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the things that Republicans hate</v>

998
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a vulnerability thing.</v>

999
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.920
<v Speaker 1>They like women to be vulnerable maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1000
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they want control,</v>

1001
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:36.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1002
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet we have complete control over people</v>

1003
00:41:38.431 --> 00:41:40.080
<v Speaker 2>they'd never met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to control the uterus of</v>

1004
00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:42.090
<v Speaker 2>a woman that lives 10 states down from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1005
00:41:42.091 --> 00:41:42.640
<v Speaker 2>How does that</v>

1006
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a sick thing that people have</v>

1007
00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:47.200
<v Speaker 1>where they want to control people in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways.</v>

1008
00:41:47.201 --> 00:41:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see people that are trying to</v>

1009
00:41:50.831 --> 00:41:53.410
<v Speaker 1>control people's language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see people are trying to</v>

1010
00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:54.430
<v Speaker 1>restrict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say this,</v>

1011
00:41:54.431 --> 00:41:56.770
<v Speaker 1>say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're don't say this isn't a weird</v>

1012
00:41:56.771 --> 00:42:01.300
<v Speaker 1>instinct that we need to address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you are outside of ideology,</v>

1013
00:42:01.301 --> 00:42:04.270
<v Speaker 1>outside of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political lines that you cross.</v>

1014
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird instinct that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to try to control people.</v>

1015
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fear based sale</v>

1016
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I habits or thing that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have much control of</v>

1017
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they want to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>their people.</v>

1018
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is where bullying comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from and I think this is where a lot of</v>

1019
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:22.440
<v Speaker 1>what sexual harassment and just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled meant the,</v>

1020
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 1>the way bosses behave when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>employed.</v>

1021
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Like this is one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein and I've found found</v>

1022
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:32.810
<v Speaker 1>fascinating is that he would bark it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees and it would run and they were</v>

1023
00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:36.550
<v Speaker 1>terrified and ice date a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was a,</v>

1024
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 1>when I first came to La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful woman,</v>

1025
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.800
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect personality,</v>

1026
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.890
<v Speaker 1>terrified of her boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She worked as an agent's assistant and</v>

1027
00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.520
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't have been an actual person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And this girl would wake up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night,</v>

1029
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.700
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1030
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 1>That her agent that she was working for</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed her to do something.</v>

1031
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 1>She would freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1032
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 1>She was like constantly worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>

1033
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:01.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she made terrible money.</v>

1034
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 1>It was constant stress and she'd work</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane hours.</v>

1035
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would make like $400 a week and she</v>

1036
00:43:08.421 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 1>was working fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is before they had the rules of,</v>

1037
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1038
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what she really made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>

1039
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:14.924
<v Speaker 1>But she was always broke.</v>

1040
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.340
<v Speaker 2>And then my questions for you or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in Stockholm Syndrome,</v>

1041
00:43:17.341 --> 00:43:20.250
<v Speaker 2>super rail saying yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what was her relationship with</v>

1042
00:43:20.251 --> 00:43:22.230
<v Speaker 2>her dad where she recreated her</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood circumstances?</v>

1043
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.030
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't good.</v>

1044
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The relationship and then the epigenetic</v>

1045
00:43:25.711 --> 00:43:26.400
<v Speaker 2>imprinting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1046
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.820
<v Speaker 2>it's only till very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very recently that we were not</v>

1047
00:43:29.821 --> 00:43:33.660
<v Speaker 2>completely dependent on men for our</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival and that you guys weren't</v>

1048
00:43:33.661 --> 00:43:35.910
<v Speaker 2>killing us in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1049
00:43:35.911 --> 00:43:39.390
<v Speaker 2>it's so recent in terms of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution and um,</v>

1050
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this movie with Neal Brennan and</v>

1051
00:43:41.671 --> 00:43:43.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wrote a song called again called the</v>

1052
00:43:43.021 --> 00:43:45.570
<v Speaker 2>female brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's about all the shit cause I'm</v>

1053
00:43:45.571 --> 00:43:48.810
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with figuring out and you're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at delineating what's nature and</v>

1054
00:43:48.811 --> 00:43:50.460
<v Speaker 2>what's nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a choice and what's not.</v>

1055
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.730
<v Speaker 2>With biologically neurologically driven</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's socially constructed.</v>

1056
00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my fascination in life.</v>

1057
00:43:55.441 --> 00:43:58.230
<v Speaker 2>And like when all this stuff happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying to figure out this</v>

1058
00:43:58.231 --> 00:43:59.130
<v Speaker 2>kind of behavioral stuff.</v>

1059
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And then that we had talked a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 2>epigenetic imprinting.</v>

1060
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:04.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's like even if your girlfriend at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time had not gone through some sort</v>

1061
00:44:04.951 --> 00:44:06.840
<v Speaker 2>of trauma with a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her mom certainly dead.</v>

1062
00:44:06.841 --> 00:44:09.330
<v Speaker 2>And then her mom's mom certainly dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she carries that with her.</v>

1063
00:44:09.331 --> 00:44:12.390
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden you're in 2016 and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>man is yelling at you and it's like</v>

1064
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.550
<v Speaker 2>flash back to 1850 when like one of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors was being fucking murdered by</v>

1065
00:44:17.731 --> 00:44:18.780
<v Speaker 2>a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1066
00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:20.310
<v Speaker 2>like we just don't think about that kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>

1067
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:21.840
<v Speaker 2>But what I meant to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1068
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Neil had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to have the storyline that was</v>

1069
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:25.920
<v Speaker 2>about sexual harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up kind of changing it.</v>

1070
00:44:25.921 --> 00:44:29.460
<v Speaker 2>It's successfully strong and Blake</v>
<v Speaker 2>Griffin a storyline about her.</v>

1071
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because women are generally for</v>

1072
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 2>consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get dopamine from consensus,</v>

1073
00:44:33.781 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we are physically weaker.</v>

1074
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I know nobody wants to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you mean by consensus,</v>

1075
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of like if you guys are arguing</v>

1076
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1077
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 2>we're on a show that kind of encourages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 2>healthy discourse and I know you guys a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and I feel safe here,</v>

1079
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a work environment,</v>

1080
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to get everyone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree because 2000 years ago,</v>

1081
00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 2>getting everyone to agree made my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>safer.</v>

1082
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.290
<v Speaker 2>If I'm eight months pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need protection from the whole tribe</v>

1083
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 2>and I want everyone to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pretend I agree with things</v>

1084
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:02.800
<v Speaker 2>that maybe I actually don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make sense.</v>

1085
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 2>We get dopamine from harmony because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>less able to defend myself,</v>

1086
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 2>especially with men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to like me because I need</v>

1087
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:10.040
<v Speaker 2>your protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1088
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 2>We're not that different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1089
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.590
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago I needed your protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my brain has not caught up to the</v>

1090
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 2>fact that like it's illegal for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack me and break me now.</v>

1091
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't need anything though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it means something to our</v>

1092
00:45:24.031 --> 00:45:25.200
<v Speaker 2>reptilian brains.</v>

1093
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.200
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Legal part doesn't mean anything.</v>

1094
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:28.790
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>

1095
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:29.840
<v Speaker 4>no one's going to save you.</v>

1096
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Totally correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

1097
00:45:31.861 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 2>You could kill me or whenever you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>

1098
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.250
<v Speaker 2>but 200 years ago it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what w w there was no phones to</v>

1099
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:40.540
<v Speaker 2>even call it a report anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just much more common.</v>

1100
00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 4>I get what I'm saying today that like on</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone saying that that fears alleviated</v>

1102
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:47.310
<v Speaker 4>because there's laws against it as</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

1103
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those fears are always there.</v>

1104
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 2>My reptile brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in my conscious brain,</v>

1106
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1107
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:55.950
<v Speaker 2>it's less likely that this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen because we all have this illusion</v>

1108
00:45:55.951 --> 00:45:57.300
<v Speaker 2>of being civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1109
00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.150
<v Speaker 4>That's all horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get nervous when I interview Francis</v>

1110
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 4>and Gando after a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I got,</v>

1111
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:04.230
<v Speaker 4>when I had to interview him Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>

1112
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.690
<v Speaker 4>cause he's 265 pounds and six foot four</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he smashes people's heads and for</v>

1113
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.070
<v Speaker 4>living and I stand next to him and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like a little tiny person.</v>

1114
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.380
<v Speaker 4>There's just no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing and that's why it's</v>

1115
00:46:14.381 --> 00:46:15.210
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes me.</v>

1116
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 4>I know he's not going to do anything to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1117
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying to me right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what I'm trying to explain to people</v>

1118
00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 2>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm nursing the Fuckin Women's moon.</v>

1119
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Why are you guys freaking out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>office?</v>

1120
00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:24.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not like we're talking to those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1121
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.800
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1122
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.050
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to rape you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1123
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I don't get an elevator's with</v>

1124
00:46:28.451 --> 00:46:30.490
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wait for the next one.</v>

1125
00:46:30.491 --> 00:46:32.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have tribal thinking.</v>

1126
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.300
<v Speaker 4>It's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is right now there's a tribal</v>

1127
00:46:34.301 --> 00:46:39.010
<v Speaker 4>boundaries that are being established on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the male and female side and people are</v>

1128
00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:43.360
<v Speaker 4>picking sides and there's a bunch of men</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are annoyed that people are talking</v>

1129
00:46:43.361 --> 00:46:44.540
<v Speaker 4>too much about women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.000

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1136

<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy thing to say because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not all women.</v>

1137

<v Speaker 4>It's all in together.</v>

1142
00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:12.670
<v Speaker 4>on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>

1143
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.350
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a woman that was,</v>

1144
00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.900
<v Speaker 4>she's like an editor for vogue or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that that said,</v>

1145
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:22.240
<v Speaker 4>here's an unpopular opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not at all concerned with men being</v>

1146
00:47:22.241 --> 00:47:26.050
<v Speaker 4>falsely accused of sexual harassment or</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual assault.</v>

1147
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Speaker 4>That's irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they exist.</v>

1148
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Those people exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the burn it all down people.</v>

1149
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fuck them or burn it all down.</v>

1150
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

1151
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

1152
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:39.870
<v Speaker 4>It's inherently tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1153
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 4>This is a tribal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1154
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 4>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no nuance to that.</v>

1155
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 4>There's no consideration of all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of men.</v>

1156
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.230
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of men that are</v>

1157
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.340
<v Speaker 4>considerate and friendly and nice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

1158
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 4>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're concentrating on themselves and</v>

1159
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 4>they don't want anything bad to happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>to anybody else.</v>

1160
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 4>But then there's men who like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck these bitches.</v>

1161
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck all women.</v>

1162
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 4>All.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all whores bitch and they listen</v>

1163
00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:59.600
<v Speaker 4>to rap music like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1164
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I've been listening to a lot of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>really bad rap music lately.</v>

1165
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the rare places where you could</v>

1166
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:09.640
<v Speaker 4>still just be a straight up massage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then do you think,</v>

1167
00:48:09.641 --> 00:48:11.620
<v Speaker 4>and I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know the answer to this,</v>

1168
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 4>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I think porn definitely affects</v>

1169
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:18.520
<v Speaker 4>our psyche and how we view w dehumanize</v>
<v Speaker 4>women just just right.</v>

1170
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Especially young people watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that a rap song going</v>

1171
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 4>destroy that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>murder that shit,</v>

1172
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.600
<v Speaker 4>beat that pussy up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that affects the way</v>

1173
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.120
<v Speaker 4>men view women on like a cellular level?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1174
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible that it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible.</v>

1175
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 4>When you have something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly popular and you're repeating</v>

1176
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:43.180
<v Speaker 4>the words to it over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what percent of an effect</v>

1177
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:44.940
<v Speaker 4>it has on a 20 year old brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1178
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 4>Whether it has a 5% effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know over your parenting and what</v>

1179
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 4>your life experience is a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.830
<v Speaker 4>All the various different variables that</v>
<v Speaker 4>come into your,</v>

1181
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 4>your psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1182
00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:58.360
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes you a human being?</v>

1183
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a factor.</v>

1184
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 4>It's a factor</v>

1185
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.570
<v Speaker 3>and is in what is in what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear beat that pussy.</v>

1186
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Like is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

<v Speaker 3>that I do is on your wrist.</v>

1193
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.020
<v Speaker 3>What kind of monster do you think I am?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of monster would get a slow</v>

1194
00:49:30.021 --> 00:49:32.510
<v Speaker 3>burn it all down like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

1195
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like a personal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1196
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.350
<v Speaker 3>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too much of a mom or you don't want</v>

1197
00:49:36.351 --> 00:49:38.210
<v Speaker 3>me to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of my tattoos are white.</v>

1198
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I have white ones everywhere you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy.</v>

1199
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I will say is that burn it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all down.</v>

1200
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.890
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk that doctors or why I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>the payment.</v>

1201
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.370
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want anybody fucking 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoos.</v>

1202
00:49:49.371 --> 00:49:50.870
<v Speaker 3>You're covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I crazy?</v>

1203
00:49:50.871 --> 00:49:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Cause you can't see mine to say saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not crazy.</v>

1204
00:49:53.671 --> 00:49:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably pretty crazy.</v>

1205
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hide it very well.</v>

1206
00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.170
<v Speaker 3>You channel it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you manage it in healthy ways.</v>

1207
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get it out.</v>

1208
00:50:00.891 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I didn't matter,</v>

1210
00:50:02.141 --> 00:50:05.900
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't work out every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you just be monitoring and keeping</v>

1211
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 4>you in the streets?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably been to jail a long time ago.</v>

1212
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:10.600
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be like breaking apes out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of zoos and fighting them.</v>

1213
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I would have done something</v>

1214
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:15.390
<v Speaker 4>really stupid a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1216
00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:20.470
<v Speaker 4>but I think that there's a lot of men</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have terrible,</v>

1217
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genetics and instincts and environments</v>

1218
00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 4>that they grow up in and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of violence in your life and you</v>

1219
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.300
<v Speaker 5>will either find a way through that or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1220
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.961
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1221
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 5>the way through it was martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I didn't find martial arts,</v>

1222
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.730
<v Speaker 5>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.750
<v Speaker 5>And I think that is one of the best ways</v>
<v Speaker 5>for men to not be pieces of shit to</v>

1224
00:50:40.811 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I think a lot of the way people</v>

1225
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 5>behave is to insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of pride in other things</v>

1226
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 5>so that you have watch a San Duexis is</v>
<v Speaker 5>it give you dental help too,</v>

1227
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 5>but give you some security and give you</v>
<v Speaker 5>an outlet for your aggression and give</v>

1228
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:57.560
<v Speaker 5>you some humility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in martial arts you get humility,</v>

1229
00:50:57.561 --> 00:50:59.200
<v Speaker 5>you get strangled all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1230
00:50:59.201 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 5>you learn humility.</v>

1231
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.340
<v Speaker 5>You can't have any ego will you do it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>

1232
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:06.320
<v Speaker 5>They do it to you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he does it and you hug and there's</v>

1233
00:51:06.321 --> 00:51:10.720
<v Speaker 5>like real genuine love and affection</v>
<v Speaker 5>between the guys that I do Jujitsu with.</v>

1234
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.030
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1235
00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very intense.</v>

1236
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 5>It's as real as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And here's something,</v>

1237
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:17.870
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to go back to that vogue</v>

1238
00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:19.850
<v Speaker 5>woman for a second or whoever that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's like,</v>

1239
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 5>I think what I'm trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand like what a man acts in a way</v>

1240
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 5>that's violent or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1241
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 5>what's the root of that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

1242
00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:30.530
<v Speaker 5>What happened in his childhood?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what's going on biologically are</v>

1243
00:51:30.531 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 5>genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or like what has he been taught?</v>

1244
00:51:32.661 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 5>Like he was failed somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a guy feels the need to like rape a</v>

1245
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:38.270
<v Speaker 5>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone failed him or he's a sociopath</v>

1246
00:51:38.271 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 5>and just should be locked up or as</v>
<v Speaker 5>mentally ill,</v>

1247
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 5>but like he saw it from his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he learned it hurt people hurt people.</v>

1248
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 5>So it's like when a women says like all</v>
<v Speaker 5>men should,</v>

1249
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:49.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if they're felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like what happened to her that made</v>

1250
00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Speaker 5>her think that that's an okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's her paradigm.</v>

1251
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 5>I probably met a bunch of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>assholes that something went wrong.</v>

1252
00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was probably guys that she grew up</v>

1253
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:00.210
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys that were in her life.</v>

1254
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.040
<v Speaker 5>The sexual traumas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

1255
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.560
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of variables and I guess</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to start a conversation.</v>

1256
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like let's explore what happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>back then and how do we sort of stop</v>

1257
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 5>that shit from going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's like sexual abuse,</v>

1258
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 5>physical abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's like the messages we get</v>

1259
00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:18.950
<v Speaker 5>growing up of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know how you parent your</v>

1260
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.680
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea of like all I heard growing</v>

1261
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 5>up as calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>relax,</v>

1262
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.510
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Seen that like the messages that we</v>

1263
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:27.860
<v Speaker 5>give kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>calm down,</v>

1264
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:29.210
<v Speaker 5>relax before about what?</v>

1265
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.060
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anytime I cried or I was injured or</v>

1266
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:32.511
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1267
00:52:32.511 --> 00:52:34.010
<v Speaker 5>calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're overreacting.</v>

1268
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:39.310
<v Speaker 5>That's what I heard as a kid growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it did because overreacting,</v>

1269
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.570
<v Speaker 5>it caused me to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1270
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:43.600
<v Speaker 5>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know when we,</v>

1271
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.450
<v Speaker 5>when kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids should be assured like it's okay.</v>

1272
00:52:47.451 --> 00:52:49.520
<v Speaker 5>It's just a small booboo and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be fine.</v>

1273
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.900
<v Speaker 5>Normally what kids do when they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>crying,</v>

1274
00:52:51.901 --> 00:52:54.290
<v Speaker 5>it's they're just testing to see how</v>
<v Speaker 5>available you are to them.</v>

1275
00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you go calm down,</v>

1276
00:52:55.941 --> 00:52:57.490
<v Speaker 5>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me teach.</v>

1277
00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do that.</v>

1278
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 5>But then they also recognize that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>way that they can get attention.</v>

1279
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:04.620
<v Speaker 5>So they will overreact on purpose about</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1280
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.280
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will have fits if they don't go to</v>

1281
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:08.240
<v Speaker 5>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like to see,</v>

1282
00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.360
<v Speaker 5>like if my two daughters want to go see</v>
<v Speaker 5>a movie and one of them wins and the</v>

1283
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:12.860
<v Speaker 5>other one starts throwing a temper</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tantrum,</v>

1284
00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:13.694
<v Speaker 5>you gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1285
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 5>we're going to go see a fun movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1286
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't get pissed off next time</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll get to choose.</v>

1287
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

1288
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 5>You can't stomp your feet and cry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's seven.</v>

1289
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:22.394
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

1290
00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 5>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a chance explain</v>

1291
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.610
<v Speaker 4>to her that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these feelings are natural light.</v>

1292
00:53:28.611 --> 00:53:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna win some,</v>

1293
00:53:29.731 --> 00:53:31.800
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna lose some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't hold on to that.</v>

1294
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 4>You've got to let it go and realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1295
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Speaker 4>we're still going to go to go to see a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fun movie.</v>

1296
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not going to be this one.</v>

1297
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:37.610
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1298
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 4>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason we made a decision.</v>

1299
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1300
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 4>and we try to be as fair as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't have fucking temper</v>

1301
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 4>tantrums over and all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1302
00:53:46.441 --> 00:53:48.940
<v Speaker 4>we're going to the wrong restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1303
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids do that.</v>

1304
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because they're little kids.</v>

1305
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 4>They're recognizing that there some</v>
<v Speaker 4>influence that they have some power over</v>

1306
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:56.170
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1307
00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm going to see how much power</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get.</v>

1308
00:53:58.171 --> 00:54:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much attention I can get and how</v>

1309
00:54:00.101 --> 00:54:01.810
<v Speaker 2>much I can play you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just have to figure out the</v>

1310
00:54:01.811 --> 00:54:03.100
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>

1311
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I learned to invalidate my own reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

1312
00:54:05.771 --> 00:54:09.100
<v Speaker 2>My field I ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a specific moment where I was</v>

1313
00:54:09.101 --> 00:54:10.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't rely on adults.</v>

1314
00:54:10.391 --> 00:54:14.020
<v Speaker 2>They won't help you figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or don't have those feelings</v>

1315
00:54:14.021 --> 00:54:15.700
<v Speaker 2>are and validate those feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1316
00:54:15.701 --> 00:54:18.160
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's probably a that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad parenting.</v>

1317
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what your kid did go like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hurt,</v>

1318
00:54:20.231 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 2>don't tell anyone because parenting is</v>

1319
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.370
<v Speaker 4>fucking confusing cause you try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out what,</v>

1320
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 4>what bad parenting you received.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was lucky in that my parents were very</v>

1321
00:54:30.101 --> 00:54:32.560
<v Speaker 4>busy so I didn't get a lot of parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1322
00:54:32.561 --> 00:54:33.700
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same Way.</v>

1323
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:37.300
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like I got bad parenting.</v>

1324
00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get back there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.840
<v Speaker 4>Don't let anybody who is mean to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:42.731
<v Speaker 4>I just got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1327
00:54:42.731 --> 00:54:46.030
<v Speaker 4>it was alone a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I found things to occupy my</v>

1328
00:54:46.031 --> 00:54:48.790
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that literally became like those</v>

1329
00:54:48.791 --> 00:54:52.000
<v Speaker 4>obsessions that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I developed when I was young with</v>

1330
00:54:52.001 --> 00:54:54.430
<v Speaker 4>various things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was art or martial arts or</v>

1331
00:54:54.431 --> 00:54:57.010
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things became my vehicles for</v>

1332
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.310
<v Speaker 4>developing my human potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

1333
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.390
<v Speaker 4>do you think you got a lot of eye</v>
<v Speaker 4>contact as a kid?</v>

1334
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.480
<v Speaker 4>I never thought about that until just</v>
<v Speaker 4>now</v>

1335
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.120
<v Speaker 2>fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

1336
00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Eye contact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye contact and physical touch in the</v>

1337
00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:09.204
<v Speaker 2>first couple of years</v>

1338
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 4>we're affectionate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My family's always been affectionate.</v>

1339
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 4>It's always been huggy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1340
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm real hug you with my family too.</v>

1341
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.560
<v Speaker 4>I think and I'm hugging with my friends</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1342
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 4>I think that's super important and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's also a very important to tow</v>

1343
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.570
<v Speaker 4>your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I tell everybody I love them.</v>

1344
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

1345
00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know I got really into John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bowlby,</v>

1346
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Siri of attachment because I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make eye contact until like two years</v>

1347
00:55:31.111 --> 00:55:32.670
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would always kind of look here.</v>

1348
00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how I used to always look at</v>

1349
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 2>people and then I just recently started</v>
<v Speaker 2>making I and make,</v>

1350
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it still makes me a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

1351
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like a muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had something called infant</v>

1352
00:55:41.461 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 2>maternal disruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically you just didn't get</v>

1353
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 2>enough eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So apparently the amount of eye contact</v>

1354
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't know this because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I can't make it now.</v>

1355
00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.570
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that just an insecure guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to get real insecure.</v>

1356
00:55:53.571 --> 00:55:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about this before or talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a bank teller.</v>

1357
00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I'd freak out why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get nervous.</v>

1358
00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.970
<v Speaker 4>I was nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but only bank tellers or just anywhere.</v>

1359
00:56:01.971 --> 00:56:06.290
<v Speaker 4>I remember being in the bank getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to deposit a check and in line,</v>

1360
00:56:06.291 --> 00:56:09.340
<v Speaker 4>just two people ahead of me was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>times of the comedy story.</v>

1361
00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.440
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know if it will go through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was before the way before then.</v>

1362
00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.910
<v Speaker 4>It was before I did comedy.</v>

1363
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:14.711
<v Speaker 2>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

1364
00:56:14.711 --> 00:56:16.180
<v Speaker 2>did it had anything to do with a man or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman?</v>

1365
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.820
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1366
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 4>it didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1367
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:20.400
<v Speaker 4>I just was nervous talking to people.</v>

1368
00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:22.210
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that too.</v>

1369
00:56:22.211 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Like the couple of minutes you talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me all the time.</v>

1370
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I get a little shade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm socially awkward in the</v>

1371
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 2>beginning and then I sort of settle in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1372
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I do get a little shaky when I first</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to people even now.</v>

1373
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:32.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel that with you.</v>

1374
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I have to say we're friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we love you.</v>

1375
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.050
<v Speaker 4>We're friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're friends,</v>

1376
00:56:37.051 --> 00:56:37.884
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1377
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.960
<v Speaker 4>we're friends right away with the porn</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the hoverboards you like this is</v>

1378
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.820
<v Speaker 4>really shouldn't bring this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you talking get whatever</v>

1379
00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:47.810
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you want to say.</v>

1380
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.421
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1381
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also have this condition called</v>

1382
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:53.080
<v Speaker 2>codependence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on it.</v>

1383
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm fucking dealing with it.</v>

1384
00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very time consuming to rewire your</v>

1385
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:01.510
<v Speaker 2>brain around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I first meet someone,</v>

1386
00:57:01.511 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a chameleon response where</v>

1387
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:04.954
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1388
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 2>when you grow up in an alcoholic home or</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have codependence the first thing</v>

1389
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you do is you meet someone and you kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of try to figure out what they want and</v>

1390
00:57:12.311 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 2>then you morphed to become what makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>them comfortable.</v>

1391
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 2>So I still have to fight that response</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

1392
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:21.070
<v Speaker 2>especially with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with men and then with women</v>

1393
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 2>because though we didn't do that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1394
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Like are you in a football are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like who is this guy and how am I</v>

1395
00:57:25.931 --> 00:57:28.170
<v Speaker 2>going to make him like me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what codependence</v>

1396
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 4>well men do that with other men but they</v>
<v Speaker 4>also do that with women.</v>

1397
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 4>They'll become like what the woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants.</v>

1398
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:35.800
<v Speaker 4>Like women will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it a lot of times my friends with</v>

1399
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 4>the way they dress like the woman who</v>
<v Speaker 4>come along.</v>

1400
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well also the women are mold men.</v>

1401
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Like women will get men in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you should just lose someone</v>

1402
00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Speaker 2>like in a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just mean like when I first meet</v>

1403
00:57:46.101 --> 00:57:49.370
<v Speaker 2>someone my instinct is kind of like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I make an a specialty with it?</v>

1404
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:52.910
<v Speaker 2>It has taken me so long to not be funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm not doing stand up.</v>

1405
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause like the for my first instinct is</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes this person laugh,</v>

1406
00:57:55.521 --> 00:57:58.910
<v Speaker 2>make them like you and I kind of have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like manually be like turn that shit</v>

1407
00:57:58.911 --> 00:58:01.280
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not five and you're not trying to</v>

1408
00:58:01.281 --> 00:58:03.300
<v Speaker 2>get the approval of your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not your dad</v>

1409
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:05.920
<v Speaker 4>turn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what if you just see something</v>

1410
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:08.050
<v Speaker 4>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still free enough to just be</v>

1411
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:08.700
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

1412
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

1413
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:11.790
<v Speaker 2>my motive is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make this person told me</v>

1414
00:58:11.791 --> 00:58:12.624
<v Speaker 2>my</v>

1415
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.330
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the people who are on all the</v>

1416
00:58:15.331 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just say his name,</v>

1417
00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.960
<v Speaker 4>his name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genuinely.</v>

1418
00:58:21.961 --> 00:58:26.961
<v Speaker 4>Brian isn't trying to get anyone to know</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not getting it,</v>

1419
00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:30.810
<v Speaker 4>but he's just really funny and he loves</v>
<v Speaker 4>being that Brian is at its best.</v>

1420
00:58:30.811 --> 00:58:32.970
<v Speaker 4>And I've said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an innocence to it.</v>

1421
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.140
<v Speaker 4>He's at his best in a group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1422
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Not on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's out of around 20 people.</v>

1423
00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.500
<v Speaker 4>If you've got 20 people and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going somewhere,</v>

1424
00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Brian's on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>

1425
00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:46.460
<v Speaker 4>guys just want to show you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll just,</v>

1426
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.920
<v Speaker 4>he'll just be this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking,</v>

1427
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:52.830
<v Speaker 4>I've never met anybody that makes me</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh harder just in groups of people</v>

1428
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.740
<v Speaker 4>other than Joe Diaz kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Joey Diaz is the opposite.</v>

1429
00:58:55.741 --> 00:58:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz is not trying to do,</v>

1430
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.380
<v Speaker 2>he's just naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a performance.</v>

1431
00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder Brian callen knows the</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference anymore.</v>

1432
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Like is there a certain point where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even,</v>

1433
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.080
<v Speaker 2>you can't even tell when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>performing and when you're not.</v>

1434
00:59:06.081 --> 00:59:07.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like just tease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphed,</v>

1435
00:59:07.311 --> 00:59:08.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care.</v>

1436
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1437
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 4>He has a bizarre ability to not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If people were upset at him,</v>

1438
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.180
<v Speaker 4>it's like he's got this weird almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peter Pan,</v>

1439
00:59:17.181 --> 00:59:18.320
<v Speaker 4>like way of moving through life.</v>

1440
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.490
<v Speaker 2>It's cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1441
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:23.180
<v Speaker 2>I am in therapy and a 12 program to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inner monologue of Brian Callan.</v>

1442
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 2>If I could just have an iota of the self</v>
<v Speaker 2>esteem that he has.</v>

1443
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you do meditate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1444
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:33.610
<v Speaker 2>I lost my dad last year and meditate</v>
<v Speaker 2>like suddenly and my meditation,</v>

1445
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I started getting too sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I couldn't close my eyes for 20</v>

1446
00:59:38.211 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've stopped for the past like six</v>

1447
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:41.690
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm trying because I need to build</v>

1448
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 2>those neural pathways.</v>

1449
00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're always,</v>

1450
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:47.790
<v Speaker 1>do you know that feeling when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>running down a hill or it's super hard</v>

1451
00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:50.650
<v Speaker 1>to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>this momentum?</v>

1452
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:51.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1453
00:59:51.191 --> 00:59:51.561
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1454
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:51.901
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1455
00:59:51.901 --> 00:59:53.940
<v Speaker 1>You're still up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's fucking,</v>

1456
00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:55.740
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>

1457
00:59:55.741 --> 00:59:58.260
<v Speaker 1>You are like you're running on a slight</v>
<v Speaker 1>angle,</v>

1458
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not flat.</v>

1459
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1460
01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:03.350
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always like a little,</v>

1461
01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking,</v>

1462
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I am sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1463
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I think in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1464
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to answer in a way that,</v>

1465
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you seem wrong,</v>

1466
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:16.550
<v Speaker 2>but I realize you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty right.</v>

1467
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 2>And I think that also in the last couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years that we've gotten to know each</v>

1468
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 2>other I hadn't been doing is not as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>

1469
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 2>And when I don't do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a little manic.</v>

1470
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that standup serves a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important like release and Catharsis</v>

1471
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 2>purpose where I'm much more calm when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not performing.</v>

1472
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:32.750
<v Speaker 2>When I do stand up right here,</v>

1473
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>get it out right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get out those thoughts,</v>

1474
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these antagonistic protagonistic</v>

1475
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these deer weird little ideas that</v>

1476
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>are wrestling in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can put them into a comedy form</v>

1477
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>and then deliver that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on stage.</v>

1478
01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a very cathartic way of releasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas sometimes.</v>

1479
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And then when the audience laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1481
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I nailed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on to something here.</v>

1482
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1483
01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Speaker 2>And there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1484
01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1485
01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.110
<v Speaker 2>not to beat the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from a,</v>

1486
01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:05.250
<v Speaker 2>we as we all do tricky home and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my brain seeks a con control or</v>

1487
01:01:05.501 --> 01:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>even a false sense of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soothes it.</v>

1488
01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.510
<v Speaker 2>And when I do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of get to have control for at</v>

1489
01:01:10.511 --> 01:01:13.330
<v Speaker 2>least the 20 minutes or an hour that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on stage and everything feels</v>

1490
01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:14.770
<v Speaker 2>like it's an order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know my place.</v>

1491
01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:17.350
<v Speaker 2>You know your place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a very clearly defined rules.</v>

1492
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're laughing,</v>

1493
01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're laughing.</v>

1494
01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>And that makes me feel really calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas going through the world with</v>

1495
01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:23.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are,</v>

1496
01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1497
01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:26.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have a hyperactive Amygdala,</v>

1498
01:01:26.201 --> 01:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>so it's like during the day I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dysregulated and doing standup is</v>

1499
01:01:30.851 --> 01:01:31.391
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1500
01:01:31.391 --> 01:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I just feel very like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where everybody's places and I</v>

1501
01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:36.610
<v Speaker 2>feel safe for that amount of time.</v>

1502
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you get calmed down by working out</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit?</v>

1503
01:01:40.691 --> 01:01:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Because my motive for working out is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>

1504
01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
01:01:46.031 --> 01:01:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm working more on like working out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get strong and to get healthy.</v>

1506
01:01:49.751 --> 01:01:52.630
<v Speaker 2>But for the longest time it was like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get skinny and to look fuckable,</v>

1507
01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So working out was like,</v>

1508
01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of hate fucking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like doing it because I enjoyed</v>

1509
01:01:57.251 --> 01:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>it or wanting to be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to sort of find a new</v>

1510
01:02:00.671 --> 01:02:01.950
<v Speaker 2>motive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1511
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.400
<v Speaker 2>we'll kind of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do,</v>

1512
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I get bored and I used to work with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trainer and I stopped and so I started</v>

1513
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.090
<v Speaker 2>just started doing it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lifting and I've just want to have</v>

1514
01:02:13.091 --> 01:02:14.920
<v Speaker 2>a big butt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I really care about.</v>

1515
01:02:14.921 --> 01:02:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just won an ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

1516
01:02:16.481 --> 01:02:19.140
<v Speaker 2>used that machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it called the Jimmy John Vinci?</v>

1517
01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:20.243
<v Speaker 2>I don't know</v>

1518
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:25.370
<v Speaker 5>the one that likes</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy Dean each immedion sausage to make</v>

1519
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 5>my ass bigger than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

1520
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a squat machine,</v>

1521
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 5>but it has like a little helper has</v>
<v Speaker 5>little claws.</v>

1522
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 5>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this machine is the,</v>

1523
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:35.831
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1524
01:02:35.831 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 5>the rack where the squat goes up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

1525
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:41.130
<v Speaker 5>It's just taught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn it forward to catch it.</v>

1526
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you add to that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1527
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 5>that's a good machine to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

1528
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 5>It's good to do on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's actually just,</v>

1529
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a Smith machine.</v>

1530
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I do at the gym.</v>

1531
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Cause those are good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I do a lot of people don't like</v>

1532
01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 5>those because you don't have to balance</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1533
01:02:55.891 --> 01:02:57.650
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that there's,</v>

1534
01:02:57.651 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 5>there's a benefit to all the stabilizing</v>
<v Speaker 5>muscles.</v>

1535
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:01.820
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have a real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1536
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.880
<v Speaker 5>a real bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you do to add.</v>

1537
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 5>If I do that when I'm afraid I'll hurt</v>
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>

1538
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:12.840
<v Speaker 5>The Jimmy John Helps me to not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like a professional athlete.</v>

1539
01:03:12.841 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should get a hug in pill form,</v>

1540
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.200
<v Speaker 5>take it five times day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1541
01:03:17.201 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 5>He just getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's going to be in here,</v>

1542
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.380
<v Speaker 5>get a pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1543
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.780
<v Speaker 5>I was doing like soul cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was doing like spinning for a while</v>

1544
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 5>just because whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a great episode of the</v>

1545
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:31.570
<v Speaker 5>unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1546
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 5>You ever watch that show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1547
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:35.420
<v Speaker 5>It's funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a couple episodes.</v>

1548
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 5>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gray went down for like two episodes and</v>

1549
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:41.820
<v Speaker 5>I almost abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell you folks if you're watching it</v>

1550
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:43.310
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I've talked a lot of people in</v>

1551
01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:46.110
<v Speaker 5>to watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you get to like episode six of</v>

1552
01:03:46.111 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 5>season one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't panic.</v>

1553
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:52.200
<v Speaker 5>It's sucks for two episodes and then it</v>
<v Speaker 5>bounces back wrong.</v>

1554
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they made fun of spinning.</v>

1555
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh there's one with a nick kroll and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1556
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 5>he's the spinach truck and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to give it up to any of that but,</v>

1557
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:05.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a cult,</v>

1558
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.430
<v Speaker 5>these fucking soul cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cycle and cry.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They'll play like sheryl crow or like</v>

1560
01:04:12.421 --> 01:04:14.040
<v Speaker 5>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Neil,</v>

1561
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:17.160
<v Speaker 5>Brendan always says that I have the</v>
<v Speaker 5>musical taste of a 45 year old divorcee.</v>

1562
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 5>I love an inspirational Kelly Clarkson</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1563
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 5>I swear to fucking God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sheryl crow,</v>

1564
01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Alana's Morissette.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will just get in there and you just</v>

1565
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 5>start crying because you were in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of pain and you're working really hard</v>

1566
01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:32.460
<v Speaker 5>and you're just vulnerable and we feel</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's okay to cry cause you're</v>

1567
01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:34.890
<v Speaker 5>sweating and it's like no one's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>know sweater tears.</v>

1568
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:37.410
<v Speaker 5>It's me and a bunch of book publicists</v>
<v Speaker 5>crying,</v>

1569
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:41.540
<v Speaker 5>but Jim Publicist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it's $35 a fucking class.</v>

1570
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.640
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that much.</v>

1571
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you buy like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>packages,</v>

1572
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 5>it ends up being like 28 I have a thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>called a Peloton bike.</v>

1573
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1574
01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:52.791
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried it.</v>

1575
01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 5>It's supposed to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried somebody else's do a live spin</v>

1576
01:04:55.831 --> 01:04:57.870
<v Speaker 5>class with people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have it here.</v>

1577
01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.770
<v Speaker 5>So do you just spin it and you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1578
01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.150
<v Speaker 5>they give it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use it,</v>

1579
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.750
<v Speaker 5>but I have one here.</v>

1580
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.900
<v Speaker 5>I can get in a groove and I can check</v>
<v Speaker 5>out and think about other things and</v>

1581
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.200
<v Speaker 5>it's like a moving meditation for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I feel about regular running.</v>

1582
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 5>When I run the hills I love running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now I'm running with my dog.</v>

1583
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 5>It's a different because I always have</v>

1584
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.890
<v Speaker 4>to keep an eye on him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's pretty good.</v>

1585
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 4>He waits and waits for me and then I run</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's so much different than any dog.</v>

1586
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:27.420
<v Speaker 4>She's just following now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just running amazing.</v>

1587
01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's great.</v>

1588
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.580
<v Speaker 4>He's great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's not at all.</v>

1589
01:05:30.581 --> 01:05:35.050
<v Speaker 4>My other dogs have been psycho so I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to have them on leashes cause they</v>

1590
01:05:35.051 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 4>would attack their dog dug holes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a bunch of pit bulls so I'd run</v>

1591
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:42.470
<v Speaker 4>with them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my masters,</v>

1592
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.320
<v Speaker 4>I just never ran with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's too fucking big.</v>

1593
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 4>This thing is bad for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard on their bones.</v>

1594
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.360
<v Speaker 4>He's limping a little bit too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He runs around too much in the yard.</v>

1595
01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 4>He loves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1596
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 4>he's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're too big.</v>

1597
01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:56.160
<v Speaker 4>There was sort of meant to just hang out</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm running really steep inclines.</v>

1598
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 4>Golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dog is,</v>

1600
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:00.240
<v Speaker 4>that's great for them.</v>

1601
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.320
<v Speaker 4>Running with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best feeling.</v>

1602

<v Speaker 2>coyotes think you're on the pack so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't kill you.</v>

1647
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what you do at wow.</v>

1648
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Fire up that Google and make sure I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not wrong.</v>

1649
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they roll in the shit so that the coyote</v>

1650
01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:46.234
<v Speaker 2>doesn't kill them.</v>

1651
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:51.660
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy I follow on instagram that</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a pet coyote and he hunts coyotes</v>

1652
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:56.140
<v Speaker 4>and he uses this pet coyote help them</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt coyotes.</v>

1653
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.000
<v Speaker 4>I know like this person dogs and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt.</v>

1654
01:07:58.001 --> 01:07:58.661
<v Speaker 4>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1655
01:07:58.661 --> 01:08:03.430
<v Speaker 4>hunting coyote is important in areas</v>
<v Speaker 4>where coyotes attack deer.</v>

1656
01:08:03.431 --> 01:08:06.700
<v Speaker 4>Fawns and coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this in California?</v>

1657
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:07.580
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1658
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:08.890
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a hunter.</v>

1659
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guys that just a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

1660
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.990
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he found a puppy,</v>

1661
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 4>a coyote puppy that had been abandoned</v>

1662
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 5>and so he adopted it and she lives with</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1663
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 5>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes can attuned to human faces.</v>

1664
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:23.720
<v Speaker 5>Like they're basically sociopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1665
01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 5>they're not like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't domesticate them.</v>

1666
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not true because this dog seems to</v>

1667
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:32.950
<v Speaker 5>be very playful with him and like cause</v>
<v Speaker 5>biting his hand and I looked at and</v>

1668
01:08:32.951 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not hurting him and these,</v>

1669
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 5>he's petting it and the dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's playing with other dogs,</v>

1670
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:40.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can raise,</v>

1671
01:08:40.281 --> 01:08:43.490
<v Speaker 5>cause it's like it's a baby and work</v>
<v Speaker 5>with these,</v>

1672
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 5>this place wolf connection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And essentially it's like,</v>

1673
01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well which one's the most wolf?</v>

1674
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:48.220
<v Speaker 5>Which one is the highest content of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wolf?</v>

1675
01:08:48.221 --> 01:08:49.700
<v Speaker 5>Wolfen it like with the blood and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

1676
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:52.370
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's back to the nature nurture thing.</v>

1677
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 5>It's that there are some wolves that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were raised by dogs that have more</v>

1678
01:08:55.491 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 5>doglike qualities and some dogs are</v>
<v Speaker 5>raise like waltz and have more wolf</v>

1679
01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.030
<v Speaker 5>light qualities.</v>

1680
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like the nature and nurture thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1681
01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:02.740
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This Chi,</v>

1682
01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.910
<v Speaker 5>this is what does it got rolling and</v>
<v Speaker 5>feces.</v>

1683
01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 5>They're really common and possibly dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient instinct to mask his sent,</v>

1684
01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 5>which then able to animal to sneak up on</v>
<v Speaker 5>their prey without detection.</v>

1685
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:13.400
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you might keep her.</v>

1686
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 5>So all I guess dogs do it with other dog</v>
<v Speaker 5>poop as well.</v>

1687
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:19.580
<v Speaker 5>But my dog doesn't roll in my other dog</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1688
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:22.070
<v Speaker 5>Only Coyote Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does it,</v>

1689
01:09:22.071 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anything or fucking tanks,</v>

1690
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 5>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're probably not worried about a</v>

1691
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 5>fucking coyotes hunt in fucking packs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they learn are one and they surround</v>

1692
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:33.680
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And tell you the story about the guy who</v>

1693
01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 5>worked at the pet food store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worked at a pet food store,</v>

1694
01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 5>also worked at a veterinarian's place</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they got this dog in,</v>

1695
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.710
<v Speaker 5>it was one of those giant pit bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those like hundred and 20 pounds</v>

1696
01:09:44.711 --> 01:09:46.520
<v Speaker 5>and muscular damn pit bulls.</v>

1697
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 5>And it was covered with cuts all over</v>
<v Speaker 5>its body.</v>

1698
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:51.830
<v Speaker 5>We're cool card,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds and hundreds of stitches.</v>

1699
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.230
<v Speaker 5>And so he asked the owner like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened was,</v>

1700
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:55.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1701
01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:57.050
<v Speaker 5>I came home and he had gotten out of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>yard.</v>

1702
01:09:57.051 --> 01:09:59.330
<v Speaker 5>He was covered in blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all fucked up because I don't</v>

1703
01:09:59.331 --> 01:10:01.280
<v Speaker 5>know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1704
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they stitch the dog up and then they</v>

1705
01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:06.800
<v Speaker 5>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally follow a blood trail up into</v>

1706
01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 5>the hills where he finds nine dead</v>
<v Speaker 5>coyote,</v>

1707
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.440
<v Speaker 5>his pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They lured him in and then the coyotes</v>

1708
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:18.910
<v Speaker 5>ambushed him and he killed the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1717
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a monster.</v>

1718
01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Don't I had my ear bitten off by one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:41.030
<v Speaker 5>It happened so fucking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>

1720
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.150
<v Speaker 5>I didn't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you said it didn't mean mean to do</v>

1721
01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:45.550
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just paint didn't mean it.</v>

1722
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.990
<v Speaker 5>It was like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

1723
01:10:46.991 --> 01:10:48.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to defend it if we talked</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it on the vodcasts.</v>

1724
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:49.761
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

1725
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:53.360
<v Speaker 5>but I just go fucking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even feel it.</v>

1726
01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I felt no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how fucking precise it was.</v>

1727
01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.160
<v Speaker 5>So they say about shark bites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you don't,</v>

1728
01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.770
<v Speaker 5>you don't feel the shark bite until you</v>
<v Speaker 5>realize your legs missing.</v>

1729
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.940
<v Speaker 5>That girl Bethany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she said it was like an orgasm.</v>

1730
01:11:04.941 --> 01:11:08.300
<v Speaker 5>It was like bliss cause so much dopamine</v>
<v Speaker 5>rushes to the area so that you keep</v>

1731
01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:10.170
<v Speaker 5>fighting like it actually felt good</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1732
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm comfortable about a 13 year old</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about orgasms.</v>

1733
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going</v>

1734
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.580
<v Speaker 4>to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to jail.</v>

1735
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're,</v>

1736
01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm putting that in there cause I</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to fuck a shark.</v>

1737
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't see me play.</v>

1738
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I do feel myself walking on egg shells</v>
<v Speaker 4>around anything sexual all the time.</v>

1739
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Now a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say this right now,</v>

1740
01:11:31.141 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 4>you can say whatever the fucking next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know women are next and they</v>

1741
01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:35.140
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should,</v>

1742
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 4>if women are predators and using their</v>
<v Speaker 4>power to coerce people,</v>

1743
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:40.590
<v Speaker 4>they should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you see my Harvey Weinstein bit,</v>

1744
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.540
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1745
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:42.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

1746
01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:42.873
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

1747
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I'll see you Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:45.241
<v Speaker 4>Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1749
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:47.250
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't,</v>

1750
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's nonsense.</v>

1751
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Any God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1752
01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:52.620
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know guys that have been victimized by</v>

1753
01:11:52.621 --> 01:11:54.030
<v Speaker 4>women at work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a guy,</v>

1754
01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 4>a tj.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember the amazing atheist was telling</v>

1755
01:11:56.431 --> 01:11:58.120
<v Speaker 4>the story about the woman that he worked</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

1756
01:11:58.121 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 4>Zoe's always grabbing his ass and making</v>
<v Speaker 4>them uncomfortable.</v>

1757
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 4>And she was like his boss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was real socially awkward and in this</v>

1758
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 4>fucked up situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's super rare.</v>

1759
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.210
<v Speaker 4>And I think that this is a balancing</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1760
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:09.991
<v Speaker 4>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1761
01:12:09.991 --> 01:12:11.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to thought it was the</v>

1762
01:12:11.371 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 4>most hilarious thing about the women's</v>
<v Speaker 4>march that um,</v>

1763
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.120
<v Speaker 4>people were angry that these white women</v>
<v Speaker 4>were wearing pink pussy hats because not</v>

1764
01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:24.990
<v Speaker 4>all women have the justice because not</v>
<v Speaker 4>all women have vaginas because there's</v>

1765
01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:27.000
<v Speaker 4>trans women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1766
01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 4>women have that too because women of</v>
<v Speaker 4>color,</v>

1767
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 4>it's both their offensive to women of</v>
<v Speaker 4>color and Trans Women.</v>

1768
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:35.590
<v Speaker 4>How many trans women were marching in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the women's March and</v>

1769
01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.470
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know they were trans based on</v>
<v Speaker 4>their appearance.</v>

1770
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Calm Down Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know them personally,</v>

1771
01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:45.030
<v Speaker 4>so I knew that they would train and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bluto oh,</v>

1772
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:49.950
<v Speaker 4>sniff them out for</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking dude.</v>

1773
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a thread on my twitter that I</v>

1774
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:59.400
<v Speaker 4>wasn't even involved with where these</v>
<v Speaker 4>trans people and these lesbians were</v>

1775
01:12:59.401 --> 01:13:04.401
<v Speaker 4>going at it back and forth and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating because lesbians are one of</v>

1776
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 4>the few groups that don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidated to talk shit to trans</v>

1777
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:09.780
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1778
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.870
<v Speaker 4>They're like [inaudible] against the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1779
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.410
<v Speaker 4>and they were saying that these trans</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are homophobic and these trans</v>

1780
01:13:16.411 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 4>women can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking crazy.</v>

1781
01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:21.480
<v Speaker 4>It was for days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for seven or eight days that we're going</v>

1782
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 4>at it back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but essentially the Trans Women,</v>

1783
01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.850
<v Speaker 4>this is what the lesbians were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the va,</v>

1784
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.350
<v Speaker 4>the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intersection,</v>

1785
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.490
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the way you know the violence</v>

1786
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.710
<v Speaker 4>between women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women on women,</v>

1787
01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 4>violence in relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>domestic violence.</v>

1788
01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:42.670
<v Speaker 4>The statistics were skewed because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it is trans women that were attacking</v>

1789
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.120
<v Speaker 4>women that they were in relationships</v>
<v Speaker 4>with because these women that are trans</v>

1790
01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:50.910
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the same behavior that men</v>

1791
01:13:50.911 --> 01:13:53.190
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the inclination towards domestic</v>

1792
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:55.650
<v Speaker 4>violence check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they were saying that and she was</v>

1793
01:13:55.651 --> 01:13:59.720
<v Speaker 4>citing statistics about how many of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these women that were the,</v>

1794
01:13:59.721 --> 01:14:02.040
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the victimizers were not,</v>

1795
01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.120
<v Speaker 4>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would not specify their gender at</v>

1796
01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:07.650
<v Speaker 4>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about their current</v>

1797
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:09.690
<v Speaker 4>gender in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like a weird thing now.</v>

1798
01:14:09.691 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could arrested if you're a</v>

1799
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.040
<v Speaker 5>trans woman for beating up a woman and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will say,</v>

1800
01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you're a woman.</v>

1801
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:17.261
<v Speaker 5>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1802
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:19.400
<v Speaker 5>I am a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're born a woman,</v>

1803
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's none of your fucking business.</v>

1804
01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:21.431
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1805
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there was this really deep,</v>

1806
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:29.230
<v Speaker 5>that's fascinating because one of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>lesbians had started this with these</v>

1807
01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:32.850
<v Speaker 5>trans women was very educated about</v>
<v Speaker 5>these statistics and was,</v>

1808
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.920
<v Speaker 5>was attacking these trans women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she was saying essentially like,</v>

1809
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 5>don't go round and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you've been a woman for a</v>

1810
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 5>fucking year and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they understand the struggle fuck off.</v>

1811
01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1812
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 5>And because you were just had male</v>
<v Speaker 5>privilege two years ago or whatever,</v>

1813
01:14:47.591 --> 01:14:50.140

01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:16.850
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I heard we're not supposed</v>

01:17:16.851 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 5>to eat a chick flick into that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat anymore.</v>

1879
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:23.570
<v Speaker 5>I was somewhere the other the other day</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

1880
01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:24.291
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's go to this restaurant.</v>

1881
01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:24.891
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't.</v>

1882
01:17:24.891 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 5>That's a Mario Batali restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1883
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 5>I'll buck and can everyone stop raping</v>
<v Speaker 5>people so I can eat my favorite pasta</v>

1884
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.060
<v Speaker 5>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monique telling everybody to boycott</v>

1885
01:17:32.061 --> 01:17:34.610
<v Speaker 5>netflix crazy hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1886
01:17:34.611 --> 01:17:39.280
<v Speaker 5>that's insane when we getting a half a</v>
<v Speaker 5>million dollars for an hour,</v>

1887
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.470
<v Speaker 5>but it's like Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for most people that's like good at Sane</v>

1888
01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:44.420
<v Speaker 5>fucking amount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's an insane amount of money</v>

1889
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:47.510
<v Speaker 5>as her comparing herself to Chris Rock's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not relatable,</v>

1890
01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 5>she's not as famous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a scale and pay disparity stuff</v>

1891
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:57.100
<v Speaker 5>is tricky because if you get paid based</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the value that you bring,</v>

1892
01:17:57.101 --> 01:17:59.330
<v Speaker 5>you know else was going on that Kathy</v>
<v Speaker 5>Griffin,</v>

1893
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.270
<v Speaker 5>Kathy Griffin was saying something about</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ib.</v>

1894
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:06.430
<v Speaker 5>She did 23 standup shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>23 standing ovations,</v>

1895
01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 5>do a special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she would be willing to do a special</v>

1896
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:12.920
<v Speaker 5>bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to make sure she gets equal pay</v>

1897
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 5>for equal pay for women and she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>making it a part of that like say no and</v>

1898
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:18.440
<v Speaker 5>go somewhere else.</v>

1899
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many outlets now.</v>

1900
01:18:20.001 --> 01:18:21.240
<v Speaker 5>There's Apps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's fucking hoot.</v>

1901
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:22.890
<v Speaker 5>There's so many places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just say no.</v>

1902
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:25.610
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They pay you what they think.</v>

1903
01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:29.900
<v Speaker 5>It's worth it based on how popular you</v>
<v Speaker 5>are and based on how popular your</v>

1904
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:32.130
<v Speaker 5>standup is based on what they think they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can get out.</v>

1905
01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:33.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1906
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:36.260
<v Speaker 5>that's why Dave Chappelle gets the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why Amy Schumer got a lot.</v>

1907
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:39.600
<v Speaker 5>She was selling out</v>
<v Speaker 5>arenas.</v>

1908
01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Monique's not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for her to compare herself to those</v>

1909
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:44.330
<v Speaker 5>two people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking crazy angry and she's</v>

1910
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:48.650
<v Speaker 5>basing it on her tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like are their box office for movies</v>

1911
01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 5>that she was in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1912
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:50.300
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1913
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're not just getting paid</v>
<v Speaker 5>that amount.</v>

1914
01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:54.800
<v Speaker 5>You're getting paid when the special</v>
<v Speaker 5>areas that tickets are going to sell</v>

1915
01:18:54.801 --> 01:18:58.910
<v Speaker 5>because that's special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's streaming so crazy when they start</v>

1916
01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 5>to boycott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to book,</v>

1917
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.640
<v Speaker 5>we need to boycott.</v>

1918
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:06.800
<v Speaker 5>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could the head of Netflix who openly</v>

1919
01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 5>lynch someone and not one person would</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop watching that?</v>

1920
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.540
<v Speaker 5>They were in trouble though with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Spacey thing.</v>

1921
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 5>They had to do something about that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did and they did.</v>

1922
01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:18.920
<v Speaker 5>They lost a lot of money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1923
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:20.410
<v Speaker 5>They lost 39 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1924
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:24.560
<v Speaker 5>Between that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Kevin Spacey thing,</v>

1925
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.880
<v Speaker 5>they</v>
<v Speaker 5>rebel.</v>

1926
01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw them when we were,</v>

1927
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:29.230
<v Speaker 5>when we were there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was where Gore vidal used to go to</v>

1929
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:34.880
<v Speaker 5>bank dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like that it had to get this</v>

1930
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:36.490
<v Speaker 5>bad for people to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

1931
01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.100
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to hire these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's going to,</v>

1932
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 5>it has to be like a bottom line issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not going to hire a rapist</v>

1933
01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:43.160
<v Speaker 5>because it's too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen the Gore Vidal</v>

1934
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:44.570
<v Speaker 5>William F.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buckley documentary?</v>

1935
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.890
<v Speaker 5>We're a details.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1936
01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:48.210
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1937
01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:49.550
<v Speaker 5>The opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They hated each other.</v>

1938
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:50.900
<v Speaker 5>William F.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buckley was,</v>

1939
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:57.330
<v Speaker 5>he was a British conservative guy who</v>
<v Speaker 5>was very popular during the day and this</v>

1940
01:19:57.831 --> 01:20:01.790
<v Speaker 5>is from the 1960s on television.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were debating back and forth.</v>

1941
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:03.500
<v Speaker 5>Gore Vidal and William F.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buckley,</v>

1942
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.890
<v Speaker 5>liberal versus conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like on national television.</v>

1943
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 5>And it was like these really contentious</v>
<v Speaker 5>highly charged debates and it kind of</v>

1944
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 5>sunk William f Buckley's career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause at one time Gore Vidal called him</v>

1945
01:20:16.621 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 5>a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You called them a neo Nazi or something.</v>

1946
01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then go William F.</v>

1947
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Buckley said something called him a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking queer and I'll,</v>

1948
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.290
<v Speaker 5>I'll punch your face up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sock you in your nose.</v>

1949
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 5>And you'll stay plastered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like lost his cool on television called</v>

1950
01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 5>them a queer on television and it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this whoa moment and William f</v>

1951
01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:41.400
<v Speaker 5>Buckley's career,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to see who really is.</v>

1952
01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pressured like I love thinking about</v>

1953
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 5>what in 30 years or when we look back</v>
<v Speaker 5>and be like,</v>

1954
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe we used just fucking say</v>

1955
01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:48.300
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1956
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.020
<v Speaker 5>You know like retard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to just say retard,</v>

1957
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.140
<v Speaker 5>but only the retards but not</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the human who does the word is not</v>

1958
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:05.370
<v Speaker 5>the word is retarded means like to slow</v>
<v Speaker 5>the growth of something.</v>

1959
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:10.890
<v Speaker 5>Retarded ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know like or like like okay,</v>

1960
01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.930
<v Speaker 5>like denying someone birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is retarded.</v>

1961
01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like socially retarded.</v>

1962
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Tiding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slowing progress.</v>

1963
01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's a bad word.</v>

1964
01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I think is a bad thing is to mock</v>

1965
01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:25.050
<v Speaker 5>someone who has a disability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that you're always</v>

1966
01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:26.760
<v Speaker 5>talking about that when you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>that word.</v>

1967
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:29.760
<v Speaker 5>I think we have a real problem with</v>
<v Speaker 5>language policing.</v>

1968
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.260
<v Speaker 5>I think we have a real problem with</v>
<v Speaker 5>denying the use of sounds there.</v>

1969
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 5>So this is what a word supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you make a noise.</v>

1970
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 5>So I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

1971
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.530
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there has to be context.</v>

1972
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Like I understand I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's supposed to be a sound that you</v>

1973
01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:49.041
<v Speaker 5>make so I can understand what you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to convey and that's retarded.</v>

1974
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:50.670
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mean,</v>

1975
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's missing a chromosome,</v>

1976
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:54.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1977
01:21:54.151 --> 01:21:54.661
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1978
01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:56.560
<v Speaker 5>that would be me saying that's down</v>
<v Speaker 5>syndrome though.</v>

1979
01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:57.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

1980
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.720
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 5>I think it's figuring out what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology is.</v>

1982
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 5>The word I did not know this happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>

1983
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 5>Someone said in a writer's room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1984
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:08.460
<v Speaker 5>she's uppity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not know that that was a slave</v>

1985
01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 5>term.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all learned very quickly that that</v>

1986
01:22:10.741 --> 01:22:12.340
<v Speaker 5>was a term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it means.</v>

1987
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:14.610
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ideology of it was to describe a</v>

1988
01:22:14.611 --> 01:22:19.290
<v Speaker 5>slave that was acting out and we learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh wow.</v>

1989
01:22:19.291 --> 01:22:21.570
<v Speaker 5>I always thought up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was someone who is like a high</v>

1990
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:23.400
<v Speaker 5>Falutin like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1991
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:24.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some rich person.</v>

1992
01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.140
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was just someone who is um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or council Trent and would not</v>

1993
01:22:28.141 --> 01:22:31.710
<v Speaker 5>participate or who is resisting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's actually has origins in it.</v>

1994
01:22:31.711 --> 01:22:36.240
<v Speaker 5>Same with like patty wagon is like</v>
<v Speaker 5>offensive to Irish people cause it used</v>

1995
01:22:36.241 --> 01:22:38.870
<v Speaker 5>to describe drunk Irish people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Irish people don't care.</v>

1996
01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.950
<v Speaker 5>Trust me in one quarter of course it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like non Irish people are the ones who</v>

1997
01:22:42.951 --> 01:22:45.390
<v Speaker 5>were offended and funny that one quarter</v>
<v Speaker 5>Irish,</v>

1998
01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.360
<v Speaker 5>I can't really say I'm Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I was one quarter black I'd be,</v>

1999
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:53.040
<v Speaker 5>you would be forever fucking Afro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would be a part of the community.</v>

2000
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:57.090
<v Speaker 5>And then what's the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was another one under your thumb.</v>

2001
01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:59.460
<v Speaker 5>If you have someone under your thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a rolling stones song.</v>

2002
01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:02.550
<v Speaker 5>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it used to be that was the thickness of</v>

2003
01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:03.960
<v Speaker 5>a switch that you could hit your wife</v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

2004
01:23:03.961 --> 01:23:06.020
<v Speaker 5>It had to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it couldn't thicker than your thumb.</v>

2005
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's the,</v>

2006
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.750
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it ediology or etymology?</v>

2007
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Etymology of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2008
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 4>those words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I just did.</v>

2009
01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:13.950
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2010
01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 4>do you know the term faggot where that</v>
<v Speaker 4>came from?</v>

2011
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes?</v>

2012
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2013
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:21.753
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2014
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:25.000
<v Speaker 4>And do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did it turn into gay slur?</v>

2015
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this will piss me off on Louis ck show.</v>

2016
01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:33.120
<v Speaker 4>They use this urban myth that what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>meant was that a bundle of sticks was a</v>

2017
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:37.990
<v Speaker 4>faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm a gay man was a faggot cause</v>

2018
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:40.570
<v Speaker 4>they were a bundle of sticks and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would burn them in a fire.</v>

2019
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:44.140
<v Speaker 4>That's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he know that?</v>

2020
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's convenient to ignore.</v>

2021
01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh you got to do is research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not hard.</v>

2022
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.830
<v Speaker 4>What a bundle of sticks was referred to</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a burden.</v>

2023
01:23:52.831 --> 01:23:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Some woman they would call a burdensome</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

2024
01:23:55.661 --> 01:23:58.390
<v Speaker 4>a faggot because she was like a bundle</v>
<v Speaker 4>of sticks.</v>

2025
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Very difficult to carry around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be awkward.</v>

2026
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:06.690
<v Speaker 4>So a man who act like a woman was a fac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2027
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.070
<v Speaker 4>That's what the term meant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it came from.</v>

2028
01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the absolute origins of that</v>

2029
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:16.210
<v Speaker 4>term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when people say there was a gay guy</v>

2030
01:24:16.211 --> 01:24:18.910
<v Speaker 4>and Louis ck show that was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was,</v>

2031
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 4>it was him and Nick Depalo and Louie</v>
<v Speaker 4>were all playing cards together and</v>

2032
01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:25.540
<v Speaker 4>someone said some faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you realize why that's so offensive</v>

2033
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 4>is because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2034
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 4>they used to burn people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no fucking history of gay people</v>

2035
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:31.500
<v Speaker 4>being burned like witches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

2036
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the Salem witch trials,</v>

2037
01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.290
<v Speaker 4>they didn't burn witches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They drown them.</v>

2038
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.010
<v Speaker 4>They drowned them and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how fucking insane the hysteria</v>

2039
01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:41.680
<v Speaker 4>around the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two dogs in the Salem witch trials,</v>

2040
01:24:41.681 --> 01:24:44.260
<v Speaker 4>there were dogs were witches live is</v>
<v Speaker 4>mass hysteria.</v>

2041
01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Do you know why they think they did</v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

2042
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Why they think what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2043
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:51.350
<v Speaker 4>The whole witch trial thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2044
01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious fanaticism or got there was a</v>

2045
01:24:55.691 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 4>late frost and this has been proven by</v>
<v Speaker 4>core samples of the ground.</v>

2046
01:25:00.431 --> 01:25:03.160
<v Speaker 4>They had a late frost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you have a late frost on wheat,</v>

2047
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 4>bacterial growth on the wheat.</v>

2048
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 4>It re,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it essentially,</v>

2049
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Ergo is very similar to lysergic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very similar to lsd and cows were dying</v>

2050
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:17.280
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2051
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.390
<v Speaker 4>And they thought it was like witchcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2052
01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little bit of that,</v>

2053
01:25:20.891 --> 01:25:25.891
<v Speaker 4>but that could have been another symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just diseases hepatitis back.</v>

2054
01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 4>But ergo is a psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so these people were literally on</v>

2055
01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:34.030
<v Speaker 4>acid and they were freaking the fuck out</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking they were being heckled by</v>

2056
01:25:34.031 --> 01:25:37.000
<v Speaker 4>witches and they're paranoid was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their mind.</v>

2057
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't they think men were being</v>

2058
01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:41.470
<v Speaker 4>witches as well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess a couple of men,</v>

2059
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:44.410
<v Speaker 4>men did die but and babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kill a couple of babies.</v>

2060
01:25:44.411 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 4>She's just cries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost their fucking minds while they were</v>

2061
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 4>on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

2062
01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:51.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given the situation when men are in a</v>

2063
01:25:51.101 --> 01:25:53.770
<v Speaker 4>position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they almost always wore back then</v>

2064
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:57.490
<v Speaker 4>and then something's happening to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would go for the weakest thing,</v>

2065
01:25:57.491 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 4>which is probably a woman or a single</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman or a woman is weird in any way.</v>

2066
01:26:01.961 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 4>And just like that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's also just</v>

2067
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 2>that sort of annoying that now people</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2068
01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.980
<v Speaker 2>this is a witch hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a witch hunt.</v>

2069
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without even knowing that that word is</v>

2070
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 2>actually something to describe when men</v>
<v Speaker 2>use to hunt women and now they're using</v>

2071
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 2>it as a way cause it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2072
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men thinking that we're like hunting</v>

2073
01:26:16.761 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>them or it's some kind of like mccarthy</v>

2074
01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:19.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2075
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.650
<v Speaker 4>We'll witch hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that you're looking for</v>

2076
01:26:21.651 --> 01:26:23.670
<v Speaker 4>something that's not really their</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2077
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2078
01:26:24.771 --> 01:26:25.604
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2079
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.990
<v Speaker 4>and I guess I just don't know a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are doing then.</v>

2080
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a real problem we have,</v>

2081
01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:35.800
<v Speaker 4>like we said earlier about tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about being on trial,</v>

2082
01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.610
<v Speaker 4>naming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a mass shaming.</v>

2083
01:26:37.611 --> 01:26:40.580
<v Speaker 4>When did you say there's definitely that</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on for sure.</v>

2084
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.480
<v Speaker 4>But I'm saying what I'm saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people identifying with all women or men</v>

2085
01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:46.090
<v Speaker 4>identifying with all men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Like especially man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it like I had this bit that I was</v>

2087
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 4>doing for awhile about um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bumper sticker that I saw in a car.</v>

2088
01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.550
<v Speaker 4>It said girls kick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2089
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate that shit.</v>

2090
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2091
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:59.420
<v Speaker 4>some of them are lazy and even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2092
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:00.880
<v Speaker 4>we're getting into this too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the bit,</v>

2093
01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:03.560
<v Speaker 4>I do point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point is you can never have that</v>

2094
01:27:03.561 --> 01:27:05.630
<v Speaker 4>about men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a guy have a bumper sticker that</v>

2095
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 4>said boys kick ass and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull the fuck over.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2100

2112
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:47.990
<v Speaker 2>because you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's entitlement.</v>

2113
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have to like watch a fucking</v>

2119
01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are,</v>

2120
01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:01.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're now on the team that's attacking</v>

2121
01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:04.210
<v Speaker 4>and there's a tribal like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2122
01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:07.750
<v Speaker 4>this is no different than someone like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Patriots were fucking kicking ass.</v>

2124
01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:10.770
<v Speaker 4>that's tribal too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

2125
01:28:10.771 --> 01:28:13.020
<v Speaker 4>It's a natural inclination that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2126
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:14.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's also at the same time,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2130
01:28:19.471 --> 01:28:21.960
<v Speaker 2>for me it's actually the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of really amazing men that</v>

2131

<v Speaker 4>They're guilty.</v>

2136
01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:33.880
<v Speaker 4>They're saying that you hate all men.</v>

<v Speaker 4>this and well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

2145
01:28:47.861 --> 01:28:49.540
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine being a woman who's been working</v>

<v Speaker 3>to look into that research.</v>

2156
01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.630
<v Speaker 1>There are some women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few,</v>

<v Speaker 3>about all of them to give myself a false</v>

2162
01:29:24.041 --> 01:29:26.320
<v Speaker 3>sense of safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that have been divorced a</v>

<v Speaker 3>you like you had no idea what people are</v>

2172
01:29:52.241 --> 01:29:55.750
<v Speaker 3>very different in the beginning of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with money is you people</v>

2173
01:29:55.751 --> 01:29:58.480
<v Speaker 3>have real personal sovereignty in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of a relationship.</v>

2174
01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.400
<v Speaker 3>I like interesting beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship</v>

2175
01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.020
<v Speaker 1>you lock on like is this going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that makes me feel better about</v>

2176
01:30:03.021 --> 01:30:06.020
<v Speaker 1>life is just going to be the person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings me joy and this is going to be</v>

2177
01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:09.320
<v Speaker 1>the person that brings me lust and sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fun.</v>

2178
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards you get bored with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and then people get resentful</v>

2179
01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.260
<v Speaker 1>and Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2180
01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.010
<v Speaker 1>And this is the thing about men with</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2181
01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I've always said like when a man with</v>
<v Speaker 1>money as dating a woman who doesn't have</v>

2182
01:30:21.081 --> 01:30:23.000
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's this weird dynamic like the</v>

2183
01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.490
<v Speaker 1>woman like it at first or some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get it first.</v>

2184
01:30:25.491 --> 01:30:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man,</v>

2185
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:28.940
<v Speaker 1>when the man with money is dating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman that doesn't have any money,</v>

2186
01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:30.890
<v Speaker 1>the woman is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

2187
01:30:30.891 --> 01:30:32.450
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

2188
01:30:32.451 --> 01:30:36.860
<v Speaker 1>But then when they get married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got money to now it's like now</v>

2189
01:30:36.861 --> 01:30:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you're just another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a rich lady now.</v>

2190
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now I have money,</v>

2191
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.620
<v Speaker 1>like gone fucking divorces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2192
01:30:42.621 --> 01:30:43.454
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bridge.</v>

2193
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.371
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2194
01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:46.500
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there they get entitled the</v>

2195
01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:47.950
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I would never take money of</v>

2196
01:30:47.951 --> 01:30:48.784
<v Speaker 3>the guy of dating.</v>

2197
01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Well you had married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different.</v>

2198
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2199
01:30:51.931 --> 01:30:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that dynamic of the guy having all</v>

2200
01:30:54.181 --> 01:30:56.610
<v Speaker 1>the money and the woman being like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>waitress or something like that.</v>

2201
01:30:56.611 --> 01:30:58.180
<v Speaker 1>But that's a normal dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.860
<v Speaker 1>When it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like men like it because like look at</v>

2203
01:31:01.861 --> 01:31:02.581
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2204
01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so advanced in comparison to what</v>

2205
01:31:05.611 --> 01:31:07.620
<v Speaker 1>she had financially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where she is.</v>

2206
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I have all these things that I can offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>her that she could never get on her own.</v>

2207
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>We've got to fly to Paris on a private</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet.</v>

2208
01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blow your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2209
01:31:14.191 --> 01:31:15.001
<v Speaker 1>that kind of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2210
01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the woman marries his fucking</v>

2211
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:19.800
<v Speaker 1>ass hole and then next thing you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is rich too.</v>

2212
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:24.630
<v Speaker 1>She's got Gucci bags and a big diamond</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's driving a Ferrari and she's</v>

2213
01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:25.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2214
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to suck this guy's Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anymore.</v>

2215
01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of it.</v>

2216
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2217
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not impressed anymore because</v>

2218
01:31:33.961 --> 01:31:37.500
<v Speaker 1>she's wealthy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's not a wealthy guy anymore.</v>

2219
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.740
<v Speaker 1>He's just a guy cause she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

2220
01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I see it there now equals and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have something that I can't</v>

2221
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:44.890
<v Speaker 3>access on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need him anymore.</v>

2222
01:31:45.190 --> 01:31:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

2223
01:31:46.071 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've not had money before and um,</v>

2224
01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I've been hungry and poor before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I get that,</v>

2225
01:31:52.671 --> 01:31:54.910
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just maybe things are gonna</v>

2226
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:57.140
<v Speaker 3>change in terms of like maybe we'll look</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and 40 years and be like,</v>

2227
01:31:57.141 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>remember when 40 olds you just used date</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke 20</v>

2228
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.390
<v Speaker 4>year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2229
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's still going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2230
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 4>We're biologically wired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys are biologically wired to want</v>

2231
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:08.014
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2232
01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 4>fuck women that are fertile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get that.</v>

2233
01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 4>It might be a liability wired to want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck successful or men that are,</v>

2234
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:19.360
<v Speaker 4>that have their shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're more emotionally stable.</v>

2235
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:22.220
<v Speaker 4>They're physically more together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Are You my dad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are You my dad?</v>

2237
01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 4>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is not even just a dad thing.</v>

2238
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:28.740
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a position of power like this.</v>

2239
01:32:28.741 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Someone is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've accomplished something.</v>

2240
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:34.030
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's looking to be the new</v>
<v Speaker 4>Darwinism is this is like,</v>

2241
01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:36.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to date a man who has</v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

2242
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't really need protection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2243
01:32:37.561 --> 01:32:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Cause we have alarm systems and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lock on my door and whatever,</v>

2244
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:43.210
<v Speaker 4>but we're still wired to seek men that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are Alphas and then have power and that</v>

2245
01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:45.430
<v Speaker 4>have resources even though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2246
01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.850
<v Speaker 4>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's going to go anytime</v>

2247
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.630
<v Speaker 4>soon unless we go full socialist.</v>

2248
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Like we're not as vulnerable as we were</v>
<v Speaker 4>2000 years ago.</v>

2249
01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:53.650
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2250
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Well we're definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure 2000 years ago,</v>

2251
01:32:56.441 --> 01:33:00.160
<v Speaker 4>men and women and had a much more</v>
<v Speaker 4>different dynamic than they have in 2018</v>

2252
01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's getting better.</v>

2253
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 4>I think overall we have less violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have less crime.</v>

2254
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:08.530
<v Speaker 4>We have less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everything today than we did 2000</v>

2255
01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think in,</v>

2256
01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:13.000
<v Speaker 4>but I think the amount of radical change</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening,</v>

2257
01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between 1960 and today,</v>

2258
01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:20.440
<v Speaker 4>if we go another 50 years in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be even more insane.</v>

2259
01:33:20.441 --> 01:33:23.830
<v Speaker 4>But it just might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the got the people that thrive are</v>

2260
01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:27.530
<v Speaker 4>the ones that are able to have some self</v>
<v Speaker 4>control over their primordial brain.</v>

2261
01:33:27.531 --> 01:33:29.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I want a Ferrari.</v>

2262
01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Like I would love to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just doesn't make sense.</v>

2263
01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to suck that Donald</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sterling Guy's Dick.</v>

2264
01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

2265
01:33:35.411 --> 01:33:36.141
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seem worth it.</v>

2266
01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:38.530
<v Speaker 4>I love to eat pizza every night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll fucking die.</v>

2267
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.030
<v Speaker 4>That's not hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get fat.</v>

2268
01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:40.471
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

2269
01:33:40.471 --> 01:33:43.450
<v Speaker 4>we'll just start to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of dating the person that</v>

2270
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 4>we are sort of primally attracted to and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just go like,</v>

2271
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:48.460
<v Speaker 4>I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I want,</v>

2272
01:33:48.461 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 4>but I can't have everything I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a fucking human adult.</v>

2273
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:56.370
<v Speaker 4>I think there's also a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way human beings react and the way</v>

2274
01:33:56.411 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 4>we even think and the way what we think</v>
<v Speaker 4>is acceptable and isn't acceptable,</v>

2275
01:34:00.251 --> 01:34:02.950
<v Speaker 4>changes with the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think like,</v>

2276
01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:07.570
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the problems with going back</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like 1960 and being upset at some of</v>

2277
01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 4>the way people behaved because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2278
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:12.010
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the way people behaved back</v>

2279
01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:12.270
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

2280
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:13.810
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know better now,</v>

2281
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:18.010
<v Speaker 4>but to get mad and a man who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behaved a certain way,</v>

2282
01:34:18.011 --> 01:34:19.450
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about like drugging and</v>

2283
01:34:19.451 --> 01:34:21.580
<v Speaker 4>raping and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but certain,</v>

2284
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:24.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago when it classic acceptable</v>

2285
01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.090
<v Speaker 4>sexist behavior from 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was just normal.</v>

2286
01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think this is just a part of the</v>

2287
01:34:30.911 --> 01:34:33.070
<v Speaker 4>culture and people thought that's how</v>
<v Speaker 4>you behaved.</v>

2288
01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Now people are shifting and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2289
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:38.440
<v Speaker 4>and also I think one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going on in this is one of the</v>

2290
01:34:38.441 --> 01:34:40.780
<v Speaker 4>things that's empowered the women's</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement in the powered a lot of other</v>

2291
01:34:40.781 --> 01:34:44.080
<v Speaker 4>movements is access to information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's radical.</v>

2292
01:34:44.081 --> 01:34:47.650
<v Speaker 4>It's happening so fast and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's inundating us and we have to catch</v>

2293
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:49.710
<v Speaker 4>up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's happening so goddamn</v>

2294
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.410
<v Speaker 4>quickly that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just trying,</v>

2295
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:52.310
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does,</v>

2296
01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 4>okay now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's not okay now what can we do?</v>

2297
01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:56.350
<v Speaker 4>What can we not do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And access to each other.</v>

2298
01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Like never before have 10</v>

2299
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 3>women all assaulted by the same man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to meet each other.</v>

2300
01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how else would we run into the grocery</v>

2301
01:35:03.921 --> 01:35:04.251
<v Speaker 3>store?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2302
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:06.050
<v Speaker 3>were you assaulted by that guy by any</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance?</v>

2303
01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Like we were able to find each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

2304
01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you talking about Steve Corral</v>

2305
01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:11.480
<v Speaker 3>and the office?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it you that was talking about that?</v>

2306
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:15.260
<v Speaker 3>What about you watched the old episodes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the office,</v>

2307
01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 3>which is not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was such a creep.</v>

2308
01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 3>You can't really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was kind of like bumbling,</v>

2309
01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what was the difference?</v>

2310
01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I think the percepta sewed where a girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows up to sell purses and he's just</v>

2311
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes a big to do.</v>

2312
01:35:34.191 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Just like you can have the conference</v>
<v Speaker 3>room and guess what?</v>

2313
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I just got this espresso maker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't make me give it to you cause I</v>

2314
01:35:39.711 --> 01:35:40.521
<v Speaker 3>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2315
01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:42.710
<v Speaker 3>do you need a ride home?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a ride home.</v>

2316
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 3>But didn't feel creepy or did the ride</v>
<v Speaker 3>home thing was a very particular creepy</v>

2317
01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:48.040
<v Speaker 3>thing based today's world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2318
01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:51.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think what I know about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>English version,</v>

2319
01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the intention was for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American version.</v>

2320
01:35:52.731 --> 01:35:56.360
<v Speaker 3>The idea was to make him kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>polarizing and it makes you</v>

2321
01:35:56.361 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

2322
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy that it wasn't that long ago.</v>

2323
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:08.630
<v Speaker 3>Tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to explain.</v>

2324
01:36:08.631 --> 01:36:11.510
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is why a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>were getting annoyed because when you</v>

2325
01:36:11.511 --> 01:36:14.390
<v Speaker 3>get granular about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes us seem like we're just being</v>

2326
01:36:14.391 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Hug me at the comedy store and it</v>

2327
01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:20.660
<v Speaker 3>feels different than when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call him Joe.</v>

2328
01:36:20.661 --> 01:36:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Blow hugs me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just something creepy about Joe</v>

2329
01:36:23.031 --> 01:36:26.180
<v Speaker 3>blow and there's something not creepy</v>
<v Speaker 3>about you and I can't explain it and I</v>

2330
01:36:26.181 --> 01:36:30.110
<v Speaker 3>can't tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I sound crazy and manic and history</v>

2331
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 3>doesn't sound because that's the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way with gay guys.</v>

2332
01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:34.550
<v Speaker 3>There's certain gay guys and hugged me</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's creepy.</v>

2333
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:39.680
<v Speaker 3>There's certain gay guys that hug me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hug me.</v>

2334
01:36:39.681 --> 01:36:40.514
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

2335
01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Get my hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all just warm and friendly and</v>

2336
01:36:42.771 --> 01:36:44.130
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if the game,</v>

2337
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.840
<v Speaker 3>but then there's other guys that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang onto me a little or they'll squeeze</v>

2338
01:36:47.841 --> 01:36:50.270
<v Speaker 3>my back a little and it just gets a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>

2339
01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:51.230
<v Speaker 3>little extra.</v>

2340
01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Females are kind of trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more granular stuff.</v>

2341
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 3>I know it sounds like I'm being crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I promise</v>

2342
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.903
<v Speaker 3>proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>

2343
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:13.090
<v Speaker 3>but the crazier I sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just making me thirsty.</v>

2344
01:37:14.210 --> 01:37:16.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hug that lasts a little too</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

2345
01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy office</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a bad date.</v>

2346
01:37:23.841 --> 01:37:27.390
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you both eight eight each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other out and went down on each other.</v>

2347
01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you're anonymous and then</v>

2348
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 22 or 23 like this is like poor</v>

2349
01:37:33.441 --> 01:37:36.850
<v Speaker 3>judgment does a lot of cruelty involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2350
01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody described it as revenge</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn for women.</v>

2351
01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2352
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:47.910
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are not comparable crimes and I,</v>

2353
01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't speak to saying who's guilty and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that sort of,</v>

2354
01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I</v>

2355
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 2>don't think that that this person is</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming forward equating it to rape.</v>

2356
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I think women know that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>different echelons.</v>

2357
01:38:01.891 --> 01:38:03.690
<v Speaker 2>There's rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault,</v>

2358
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 2>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2359
01:38:04.741 --> 01:38:06.690
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about it and none of</v>

2360
01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>us were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I do know in my twenties I'm</v>

2361
01:38:10.711 --> 01:38:11.880
<v Speaker 2>not saying as he's as guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2362
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in my twenties I had a lot of sex</v>

2363
01:38:14.251 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 2>that I felt I was coerced into that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>transactional sex that I didn't want to</v>

2364
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2365
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:21.210
<v Speaker 2>and this is something we talk about in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the female brain movie,</v>

2366
01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:24.650
<v Speaker 2>is that men are less able to read cues</v>
<v Speaker 2>or emotional cues on,</v>

2367
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:28.880
<v Speaker 2>on faces than women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so apparent.</v>

2368
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:33.120
<v Speaker 2>So we have evolved to cry four times</v>
<v Speaker 2>more easily because men have a harder</v>

2369
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:34.890
<v Speaker 2>time reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2370
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:39.330
<v Speaker 2>emotional cues on faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why women crying until we crazier</v>

2371
01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:42.720
<v Speaker 2>because men are designed to sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>see movement and to hunt and to,</v>

2372
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2373
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:44.610
<v Speaker 2>You're not designed to sort of read</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2374
01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is she frustrated or angry?</v>

2375
01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:46.951
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2376
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:48.690
<v Speaker 2>have you ever been on a double date with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife?</v>

2377
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.060
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2378
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you think that hit her and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine you on a double date.</v>

2379
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:56.850
<v Speaker 2>That was so weird thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done those things really in the</v>

2380
01:38:56.851 --> 01:39:00.230
<v Speaker 2>very early stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But have you ever like,</v>

2381
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go on a double date and like you</v>

2382
01:39:02.461 --> 01:39:05.070
<v Speaker 2>have to fucking talk to the guy and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking you a million questions about</v>

2383
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 2>hunting and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just listen to my podcast.</v>

2384
01:39:07.021 --> 01:39:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have to fucking do this for</v>
<v Speaker 2>free?</v>

2385
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And then your wife is talking to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other girl and you think it's going well</v>

2386
01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:14.460
<v Speaker 2>and the girl gets the car and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2387
01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 2>oh my well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

2388
01:39:15.451 --> 01:39:16.950

<v Speaker 2>I couldn't fucking stand her.</v>

2389
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:19.350
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you guys got along great,</v>

2390
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2391

<v Speaker 2>has that ever happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2392
01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.160
<v Speaker 2>She's just had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just talks like if she,</v>

2393
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:30.930
<v Speaker 2>if she thought something was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would let everybody know like right</v>

2394
01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:33.870
<v Speaker 2>away while she would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be obvious or just,</v>

2395
01:39:33.871 --> 01:39:35.460
<v Speaker 2>just sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's like,</v>

2396
01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

2397
01:39:37.111 --> 01:39:38.400
<v Speaker 2>and we talk about the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2398
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.820
<v Speaker 2>it's just men are not as good at reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions on faces.</v>

2399
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:42.840
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to say like,</v>

2400
01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Whitney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

2401
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:44.783
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

2402
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 2>You might just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2403
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:47.610
<v Speaker 2>she's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's move on.</v>

2404
01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys can't understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a discrepancy between what I'm</v>

2405
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>saying and how I'm saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like about just reading,</v>

2406
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:56.670
<v Speaker 2>like how muscles move on on human faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you can look up,</v>

2407
01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the difference and you know,</v>

2408
01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:01.440
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not defending men in that area.</v>

2409
01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that that an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that might come up at some</v>

2410
01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:07.170
<v Speaker 2>point as people who have autism are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really going to be fucked in all of</v>

2411
01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:09.840
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who can't pick up on social cues</v>

2412
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 2>because so much of this is nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fear that we're going to get to a</v>

2413
01:40:13.021 --> 01:40:15.900
<v Speaker 2>place where we're going to have to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign contracts and ship before we have</v>

2414
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:17.390
<v Speaker 2>sex and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I,</v>

2415
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:18.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2416
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I know that in my twenties and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing up just talking about it,</v>

2417
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.050
<v Speaker 2>is that when men made physical man says</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2418
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I would be giving off these nonverbal</v>
<v Speaker 2>cues.</v>

2419
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't saying no,</v>

2420
01:40:29.851 --> 01:40:32.460
<v Speaker 2>but my body was saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying it's necessarily a</v>

2421
01:40:32.461 --> 01:40:34.920
<v Speaker 2>guy is supposed to like be able to read</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body language,</v>

2422
01:40:34.921 --> 01:40:37.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's what was happening cause I</v>
<v Speaker 2>froze up because of my trauma response</v>

2423
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:38.880
<v Speaker 2>and I was scared.</v>

2424
01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And also we are conditioned to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>submissive to men.</v>

2425
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am conditioned to feel shame if I</v>

2426
01:40:44.041 --> 01:40:45.960
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck a guy in a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

2427
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I spent totally the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you would feel shame if you</v>

2428
01:40:50.881 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>fucked a guy too quick about a guy on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first day and you feel shame.</v>

2429
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this sort of like unspoken rule</v>

2430
01:40:56.321 --> 01:40:58.390
<v Speaker 2>that you like kind of have to fuck a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the third day.</v>

2431
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:40:59.410 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh totally am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not think that Jamie's never heard</v>

2433
01:41:02.831 --> 01:41:03.350
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2434
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I feel like guilt and shame and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult and I'm a prude and I'm like,</v>

2435
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 2>would I ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2436
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:10.780
<v Speaker 2>this might just be me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like every,</v>

2437
01:41:10.781 --> 01:41:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean every girl that I know that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just my generation or</v>

2438
01:41:13.361 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 2>something and guy out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2439
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do is just get three dates in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're in.</v>

2440
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.630
<v Speaker 2>But think about all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about negotiate.</v>

2441
01:41:19.631 --> 01:41:22.750
<v Speaker 2>So just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the tip is like something we joke</v>

2442
01:41:22.751 --> 01:41:23.584
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2443
01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 2>But it is based in the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiating for sex.</v>

2444
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.450
<v Speaker 2>So if someone is starting to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the tip,</v>

2445
01:41:28.451 --> 01:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>that means I've already said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

2446
01:41:29.951 --> 01:41:31.330
<v Speaker 2>well come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about just a blowjob?</v>

2447
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:32.231
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2448
01:41:32.231 --> 01:41:33.400
<v Speaker 2>just come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the tip.</v>

2449
01:41:33.401 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like we joke about it but that</v>
<v Speaker 2>means it in negotiation is going on.</v>

2450
01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:39.790
<v Speaker 2>And then I've already said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you just get worn down.</v>

2451
01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:43.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's like transactional sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think women are kind of just,</v>

2452
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I won't generalize about all women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2453
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:46.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think some women are like sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2454
01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>transactional sex anymore.</v>

2455
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.550
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel like I'm being used as a</v>

2456
01:41:51.551 --> 01:41:52.384
<v Speaker 2>blow up doll.</v>

2457
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:55.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that girl fell as,</v>

2458
01:41:55.601 --> 01:41:58.870
<v Speaker 2>she felt like she was like rush through</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner and like went back and was just</v>

2459
01:41:58.871 --> 01:42:03.871
<v Speaker 2>sort of expected to be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of what's happening is</v>

2460
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that men were promised something from</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn and women were promised something</v>

2461
01:42:07.751 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 2>from romantic comedies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men were promised that women like won it</v>

2462
01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:14.200
<v Speaker 2>all the time and women had been promised</v>
<v Speaker 2>that men like want to talk to us.</v>

2463
01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think these expectations are</v>
<v Speaker 2>clashing.</v>

2464
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:18.910
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a little bit of nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a little bit of nurture.</v>

2465
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:23.880
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of it being media</v>
<v Speaker 4>misrepresentations of actual</v>

2466
01:42:23.881 --> 01:42:26.760
<v Speaker 4>relationships and that's the models that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are acting on</v>

2467
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different for every person</v>
<v Speaker 2>because every person has a different</v>

2469
01:42:30.501 --> 01:42:32.930
<v Speaker 2>experience with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has a different ability to read</v>

2470
01:42:32.931 --> 01:42:34.520
<v Speaker 2>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a different nature and</v>

2471
01:42:34.521 --> 01:42:37.160
<v Speaker 2>nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone had different fucking parenting</v>

2472
01:42:37.670 --> 01:42:40.970
<v Speaker 4>problem with like sometimes you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be with that person and you're</v>

2473
01:42:40.971 --> 01:42:43.260
<v Speaker 4>there and you're there and what do you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>

2474
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.050
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I do,</v>

2475
01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I literally had sex before just to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of there.</v>

2476
01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:50.631
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2477
01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to argue with this person</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

2478
01:42:52.371 --> 01:42:56.060
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like this first one feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled to my body and I feel shame and</v>

2479
01:42:56.061 --> 01:42:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm embarrassed and like it's just all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff that's really kind of hard to</v>

2480
01:42:59.091 --> 01:43:03.140
<v Speaker 2>explain and I think it probably is</v>
<v Speaker 2>annoying to the guy and I just like,</v>

2481
01:43:03.141 --> 01:43:05.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be difficult and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been so gas lit to believe that I'm</v>

2482
01:43:05.871 --> 01:43:08.030
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just gets like really messy and then</v>

2483
01:43:08.031 --> 01:43:10.470
<v Speaker 2>by the time you figure it out you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>already had sex and you're just like,</v>

2484
01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:10.700
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

2485
01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.170
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I have my parking pass back?</v>

2486
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:15.110
<v Speaker 4>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is part of just being a human and</v>

2487
01:43:15.111 --> 01:43:19.850
<v Speaker 4>trying to navigate your way through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking treacherous waters of just</v>

2488
01:43:19.851 --> 01:43:22.280
<v Speaker 4>social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual interactions.</v>

2489
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't figure it out until I was 32</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

2490
01:43:24.201 --> 01:43:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't able to like articulate or</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out whether I actually want to be</v>

2491
01:43:27.291 --> 01:43:29.510
<v Speaker 2>having sex or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like my advice to all my guy friends</v>

2492
01:43:29.511 --> 01:43:33.140
<v Speaker 2>is do not have sex with girls and under</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 cause like I could not,</v>

2493
01:43:33.230 --> 01:43:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the ability to even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>or say what I wanted until I was</v>

2494
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:39.890
<v Speaker 4>for men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of men feel like if you have sex</v>

2495
01:43:39.891 --> 01:43:43.910
<v Speaker 4>with a girl who's under 30 then it's fun</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can have fun.</v>

2496
01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.420
<v Speaker 4>But if you have sex with a girl who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>over 30 their biological clock is</v>

2497
01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:52.421
<v Speaker 4>ticking and the present time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should sound nice pressuring you into</v>

2498
01:43:53.481 --> 01:43:54.291
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2499
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 4>relationship very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your intentions?</v>

2500
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Where's this going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what we,</v>

2501
01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.180
<v Speaker 4>how we stand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we yet</v>

2502
01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:02.580

2503

<v Speaker 2>You can find plenty of women in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties what have you like are you just</v>

2504
01:44:05.581 --> 01:44:07.500

<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2505
01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Let's work this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

2506
01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.600
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to like start</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to each other I guess and like</v>

2507
01:44:12.601 --> 01:44:14.820
<v Speaker 2>setting expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds like a nightmare.</v>

2508
01:44:14.821 --> 01:44:16.410
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it so much drama.</v>

2509
01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also,</v>

2510
01:44:18.001 --> 01:44:21.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is totally like I,</v>

2511
01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably shouldn't say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking someone was like,</v>

2512
01:44:24.841 --> 01:44:27.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they had dinner and afterwards</v>

2513
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.760
<v Speaker 2>they s whatever and she wasn't into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2514
01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:32.910
<v Speaker 2>that is already fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never want to have sex after dinner.</v>

2515
01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like full of Lasagna.</v>

2516
01:44:36.710 --> 01:44:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want anything in my body</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I've eaten.</v>

2517
01:44:40.531 --> 01:44:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I need a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to have sex before I eat.</v>

2518
01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So He's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to Fart.</v>

2519
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to,</v>

2520
01:44:47.851 --> 01:44:52.851
<v Speaker 2>if I'm just assume that not any sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>after dinner it's not consensual.</v>

2521
01:44:53.670 --> 01:44:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Super Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I grossed out by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

2523
01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.240
<v Speaker 2>if I just like eat chicken farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want your,</v>

2524
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick together.</v>

2525
01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:03.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

2526
01:45:03.591 --> 01:45:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I just know that I've had a lot of sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my twenties that I didn't want to be</v>

2527
01:45:06.811 --> 01:45:10.650
<v Speaker 2>having that felt transactional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just didn't feel,</v>

2528
01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:11.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

2529
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who really wins and all those</v>

2530
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:16.130
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes and sex robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2531
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 4>prostitution was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See the problem we even would,</v>

2532
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:21.260
<v Speaker 4>prostitution being legals is still</v>
<v Speaker 4>shameful.</v>

2533
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:25.070
<v Speaker 4>It's still looked down upon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas massage keep your job,</v>

2534
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:26.820
<v Speaker 4>you get to keep,</v>

2535
01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:29.130
<v Speaker 2>what did you get to keep your job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say no.</v>

2536
01:45:29.131 --> 01:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean like if you're afraid of sexually</v>
<v Speaker 2>assaulting someone by accident or having</v>

2537
01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:37.440
<v Speaker 2>an inter personal relationship at work</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff that's going on,</v>

2538
01:45:37.441 --> 01:45:40.050
<v Speaker 2>just like having sex with a hooker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're not gonna get fired,</v>

2539
01:45:40.110 --> 01:45:40.740
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to work</v>

2540
01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.270
<v Speaker 4>port you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2541
01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:47.400
<v Speaker 4>But it's very problematic in that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>establishes this dynamic between a man</v>

2542
01:45:47.401 --> 01:45:49.230
<v Speaker 4>and a woman where it's very</v>
<v Speaker 4>transactional.</v>

2543
01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2544
01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:53.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you get accustom to</v>

2545
01:45:53.131 --> 01:45:55.650
<v Speaker 4>transactional sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could make it worse when you're</v>

2546
01:45:55.651 --> 01:45:58.440
<v Speaker 4>actually what it's like then your</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought is just I just got to pay for</v>

2547
01:45:58.441 --> 01:45:58.960
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2548
01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Why would I deal with your bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just be a grownup baby.</v>

2549
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:03.710
<v Speaker 4>I decided to get my dick sucked all</v>

2550
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I just mean if like men need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I literally was thinking about the</v>

2551
01:46:06.471 --> 01:46:07.700
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like I would like someone to</v>

2552
01:46:07.701 --> 01:46:12.440
<v Speaker 2>invent like a virtual reality game so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that women can understand what sex feels</v>

2553
01:46:12.441 --> 01:46:15.200
<v Speaker 2>like from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be so amazing.</v>

2554
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about it</v>

2555
01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 4>more amazing for guy than is for a woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets,</v>

2556
01:46:18.741 --> 01:46:23.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm like to be willing to like throw</v>
<v Speaker 4>away your career and take that big of a</v>

2557
01:46:23.351 --> 01:46:24.730
<v Speaker 4>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what it is.</v>

2558
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:28.840
<v Speaker 4>No it's this what the way I described it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in one of my specials,</v>

2559
01:46:28.841 --> 01:46:33.841
<v Speaker 4>I said being a man is like having a</v>
<v Speaker 4>small 24 hours sperm factory with a very</v>

2560
01:46:36.401 --> 01:46:40.570
<v Speaker 4>shitty agreement with the union.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got one delivery truck that's your</v>

2561
01:46:40.571 --> 01:46:41.404
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2562
01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:45.340
<v Speaker 4>And you've got one warehouse and</v>
<v Speaker 4>packages are piling up every day</v>

2563
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:49.150
<v Speaker 2>and you dig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these fucking packages</v>

2564
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:53.520
<v Speaker 1>and the more it stacks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more desperate you get,</v>

2565
01:46:53.521 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 1>the more you're willing to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we do stupid things.</v>

2566
01:46:56.340 --> 01:47:00.840
<v Speaker 1>The nature of being a human being is men</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to get rid of calm cause</v>

2567
01:47:00.841 --> 01:47:04.170
<v Speaker 1>we're making it all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Day long we're making Kom were come</v>

2568
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:05.850
<v Speaker 1>factories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we are.</v>

2569
01:47:05.851 --> 01:47:06.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

2570
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.800
<v Speaker 1>when a man doesn't have sex for a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

2571
01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't like I went through a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did an experiment on my website like a</v>

2572
01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:15.180
<v Speaker 1>few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years back where I didn't jerk off</v>

2573
01:47:15.181 --> 01:47:16.210
<v Speaker 1>for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2574
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2575
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you get so desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just touching people.</v>

2576
01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Just getting a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Dick gets hard.</v>

2577
01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bizarre.</v>

2578
01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause most of the time guys handle it by</v>

2579
01:47:26.251 --> 01:47:29.340
<v Speaker 1>just jerking off you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a relief.</v>

2580
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2581
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you literally a backed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have pressure and you relieve it.</v>

2582
01:47:33.090 --> 01:47:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's like to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

2583
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I do know is you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a thing that you have to get rid</v>

2584
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:41.220
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have the end.</v>

2585
01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a guy being horny</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like day one of no jerking off versus</v>

2586
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:48.660
<v Speaker 1>day 30 you're a totally different human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

2587
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.850
<v Speaker 1>You're a desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2588
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:54.060
<v Speaker 1>and men who have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever get touched and don't ever</v>

2589
01:47:54.061 --> 01:47:57.600
<v Speaker 1>get to have sex are extremely desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll do almost anything that</v>

2590
01:47:57.601 --> 01:48:01.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll negotiate in very bizarre ways in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to be involved in relationships.</v>

2591
01:48:01.261 --> 01:48:05.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why you see men that are quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy whipped,</v>

2592
01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 1>like why are they pussy whipped and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that?</v>

2593
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the only option they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are weak people and the only</v>

2594
01:48:11.881 --> 01:48:15.360
<v Speaker 1>option they have is to acquiesce to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever desires and needs the woman</v>

2595
01:48:15.361 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

2596
01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to submit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to submit,</v>

2597
01:48:18.181 --> 01:48:20.640
<v Speaker 1>and then she'll throw some pussy at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dog.</v>

2598
01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:24.240
<v Speaker 1>It's some fucking scratch your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's literally what happened.</v>

2599
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And just thought of airborne posts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teddy has</v>

2600
01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:34.650

<v Speaker 1>these men had no lack of putsy in their</v>

2601
01:48:35.431 --> 01:48:36.560
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These which men?</v>

2602
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Powerful men that are going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is whenever they want it.</v>

2603
01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's still,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this woman who was the one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>managers that casino.</v>

2614

<v Speaker 1>entire staff watch him eat curry before</v>

2615

<v Speaker 1>They would have to watch him eat.</v>

2616
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It would come into his dressing room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't talk to them.</v>

2617
01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 1>He would watch him eat and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would do when he wanted,</v>

2618
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:31.530
<v Speaker 1>when he was eating his food before us</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then he had someone,</v>

2620
01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:37.770
<v Speaker 1>a security guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuck him into bed at night.</v>

2621
01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:40.590
<v Speaker 1>They had a tuck him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he laid in bed and they would talk</v>

2622
01:49:40.591 --> 01:49:44.190
<v Speaker 1>him in and then shut the lights off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed the door like he mental</v>

2623
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:46.800
<v Speaker 1>illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That delusions of grand jury,</v>

2624
01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 1>a separation</v>

2625
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 5>from normal society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This thought that he is royalty,</v>

2626
01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what I think.</v>

2627
01:49:53.561 --> 01:49:56.050
<v Speaker 5>I think the same behavior that kings</v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

2628
01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:59.680
<v Speaker 5>You see that with dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see that with celebrities that are,</v>

2629
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:04.600
<v Speaker 5>especially celebrities that again became</v>
<v Speaker 5>super famous 50 60 years ago,</v>

2630
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:06.430
<v Speaker 5>like bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2631
01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 5>he was famous 60 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people like Danny Masterson who is</v>

2632
01:50:09.701 --> 01:50:11.530
<v Speaker 5>young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's not,</v>

2633
01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:13.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Danny masterson one is interesting</v>

2634
01:50:13.961 --> 01:50:18.020
<v Speaker 5>because he's a scientology</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientology.</v>

2635
01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:20.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I think he's left.</v>

2636
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they could embrace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this is Paul Haggis too.</v>

2637
01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:28.240
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the things that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were saying about him because they</v>

2638
01:50:28.241 --> 01:50:31.390
<v Speaker 5>think that he's being set up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand by right.</v>

2639
01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:31.931
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2640
01:50:31.931 --> 01:50:33.500
<v Speaker 5>I know Leah Remini I heard her saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2641
01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.830
<v Speaker 5>She was saying these are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true.</v>

2642
01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.650
<v Speaker 5>Danny masterson didn't leave like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was employee.</v>

2643
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:43.060
<v Speaker 5>I've been hearing this for years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fuck didn't you cool?</v>

2644
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:46.990
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell everybody this is my phone as a</v>

2645
01:50:46.991 --> 01:50:48.010
<v Speaker 5>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still look like that.</v>

2646
01:50:48.011 --> 01:50:48.970
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if this is true,</v>

2647
01:50:48.971 --> 01:50:50.730
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to tell you because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to,</v>

2648
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:53.410
<v Speaker 5>you feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 years from now I know.</v>

2649
01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:54.244
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2650
01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I had heard creepy shit about him,</v>

2651
01:50:56.351 --> 01:50:57.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's like why didn't the young guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that?</v>

2652
01:50:57.701 --> 01:51:00.790
<v Speaker 5>Who can fuck anyone whenever he wants?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to do something like that.</v>

2653
01:51:00.791 --> 01:51:02.550
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand if you have all this,</v>

2654
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:05.440
<v Speaker 5>the packages and the sperm building up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why can't you just jerk off?</v>

2655
01:51:05.441 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you just fuck someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>consensually?</v>

2656
01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:09.460
<v Speaker 5>That's a different thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rape things at different things.</v>

2657
01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:13.110
<v Speaker 5>The rape thing is dehumanizing power</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2658
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:14.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2659
01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.630
<v Speaker 5>you say no fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't say no to me,</v>

2660
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:18.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fucking do this to you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2661
01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:20.680
<v Speaker 5>there's a that's not sex.</v>

2662
01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 5>There's something way more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if you can get hard when a woman</v>

2663
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:28.150
<v Speaker 5>is crying and wants you to stop and</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

2664
01:51:28.151 --> 01:51:30.970
<v Speaker 5>please stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't rape me.</v>

2665
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:34.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you to do this to me and</v>

2666
01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:36.340
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could still do that.</v>

2667
01:51:36.341 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 5>That's like some Viking Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really some because it's like,</v>

2668
01:51:39.671 --> 01:51:42.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean there could be some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously not to defend it,</v>

2669
01:51:42.521 --> 01:51:46.330
<v Speaker 5>but some sort of survival instinct in</v>
<v Speaker 5>being able to procreate with a women</v>

2670
01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:48.940
<v Speaker 5>who's not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like our biology has still not checked</v>

2671
01:51:48.941 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 5>for like overpopulation and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we no longer need to force</v>

2672
01:51:52.541 --> 01:51:56.200
<v Speaker 5>ourselves upon women to proliferate the</v>
<v Speaker 5>species.</v>

2673
01:51:56.620 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 5>There's gotta be some leftover ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible rape DNA.</v>

2674
01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:04.180
<v Speaker 5>Cause there were a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>

2675
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:08.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean Genghis Khan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his genes or in some ungodly.</v>

2676
01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:10.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull this money.</v>

2677
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2678
01:52:11.801 --> 01:52:13.030
<v Speaker 5>I keep telling that neck again.</v>

2679
01:52:14.230 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 5>I can see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's interesting like I'm just so</v>

2680
01:52:18.281 --> 01:52:21.430
<v Speaker 5>curious how things are going to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like are the people that are going to</v>

2681
01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:24.680
<v Speaker 5>proliferate the ones that have the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>self control whereas it used to be your,</v>

2682
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:28.000
<v Speaker 5>your masculinity or your value is</v>
<v Speaker 5>defined by how strong you are.</v>

2683
01:52:28.001 --> 01:52:31.960
<v Speaker 5>But how powerful and maybe the new power</v>
<v Speaker 5>is self control and restraint.</v>

2684
01:52:32.170 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 5>Well I think maybe people need to start</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at each other as other human</v>

2685
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:39.940
<v Speaker 5>beings instead of us versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's part of the woman's</v>

2686
01:52:39.941 --> 01:52:41.860
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's mission and part of the men's</v>

2687
01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:44.440
<v Speaker 5>side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an issue I think we have to get</v>

2688
01:52:44.441 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 5>past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2689
01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

2690
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dan Harris from good morning America</v>

2691
01:52:49.911 --> 01:52:52.730
<v Speaker 1>was on the podcast the other day and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about in terms of politics,</v>

2692
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 1>he was saying toxic tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that term because that,</v>

2693
01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:57.584
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

2694
01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:00.620
<v Speaker 1>that is across the board an issue in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

2695
01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:02.360
<v Speaker 1>right versus left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2696
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:04.700
<v Speaker 1>That's an issue in this country with</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically everything.</v>

2697
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Men versus women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to just look at each</v>

2698
01:53:07.431 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 1>other as human beings and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not pro men.</v>

2700
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not pro woman either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro human and there's a lot of</v>

2701
01:53:15.711 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 1>really shitty men out there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of really shitty women.</v>

2702
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2703
01:53:19.841 --> 01:53:22.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem if we lump everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

2704
01:53:22.611 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women want this and women or not women</v>

2705
01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:27.080
<v Speaker 1>are not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are not going to lie about rape.</v>

2706
01:53:27.081 --> 01:53:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Women are not going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2707
01:53:28.311 --> 01:53:30.400
<v Speaker 1>they are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are going to lie about it because</v>

2708
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:31.620
<v Speaker 1>people are liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2709
01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:36.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly formed human beings and they are</v>

2710
01:53:36.711 --> 01:53:40.970
<v Speaker 1>now a part of a righteous tribe of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are attacking this other</v>

2711
01:53:40.971 --> 01:53:41.450
<v Speaker 1>tribe.</v>

2712
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:43.640
<v Speaker 2>And it's like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most women didn't March.</v>

2713
01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.720
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2714
01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:45.650
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2715
01:53:45.650 --> 01:53:46.350
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>

2716
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:50.620
<v Speaker 2>they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 million women were marching.</v>

2717
01:53:50.710 --> 01:53:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Most women did not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2718
01:53:53.250 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but the numbers are pretty staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staggering.</v>

2719
01:53:55.131 --> 01:53:59.570
<v Speaker 2>But there is something interesting I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what happens when a group of</v>

2720
01:53:59.571 --> 01:54:01.160
<v Speaker 2>women get together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2721
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.800
<v Speaker 2>cause I think that has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my experience,</v>

2722
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:06.710
<v Speaker 2>especially like in the workplace and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like trying to do some</v>

2723
01:54:06.711 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 2>research on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2724
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:09.800
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know enough about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's this thing called,</v>

2725
01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's called favoritism bias</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's how women in a workplace</v>

2726
01:54:13.641 --> 01:54:18.200
<v Speaker 2>actually compete with each other because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid that the man is going to</v>

2727
01:54:18.201 --> 01:54:19.970
<v Speaker 2>think that they're favoring their</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender.</v>

2728
01:54:19.971 --> 01:54:23.030
<v Speaker 2>So they're actually shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Queen Bee Syndrome or</v>

2729
01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:26.270
<v Speaker 2>something where it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced a lot of competition</v>

2730
01:54:26.271 --> 01:54:28.730
<v Speaker 2>with other women because there was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much scarcity for jobs.</v>

2731
01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like women just getting in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>workforce like in the last 10,</v>

2732
01:54:31.521 --> 01:54:32.870
<v Speaker 2>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of new.</v>

2733
01:54:32.871 --> 01:54:33.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

2734
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 2>this is bucking my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Hell No.</v>

2735
01:54:36.170 --> 01:54:38.330
<v Speaker 2>So I think for women actually be on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same team,</v>

2736
01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:42.410
<v Speaker 2>not to support toxic tribalism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually kind of a refreshing thing to</v>

2737
01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:43.700
<v Speaker 2>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2738
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:46.250
<v Speaker 2>we're not competing for a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not competing for a job.</v>

2739
01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 2>We're actually going to unite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2740
01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that kind of healing</v>

2741
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least for now.</v>

2742
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with</v>

2743
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:53.400
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2744
01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced women confiding in me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about other women in comedy and there</v>

2745
01:54:59.631 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>are so shitty and judgmental and</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical.</v>

2746
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had women say things about</v>

2747
01:55:05.611 --> 01:55:06.750
<v Speaker 1>other women comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2748
01:55:06.751 --> 01:55:07.620
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2749
01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really think she's like that?</v>

2750
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2751
01:55:09.961 --> 01:55:10.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2752
01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:12.030
<v Speaker 1>she's a fucking hatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking terrible.</v>

2753
01:55:12.031 --> 01:55:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And this now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2754
01:55:12.961 --> 01:55:13.794
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2755
01:55:13.890 --> 01:55:14.910
<v Speaker 1>She is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2756
01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:15.870
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2757
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:18.030
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get really angry about it and</v>

2758
01:55:18.031 --> 01:55:20.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is it like what is that like?</v>

2759
01:55:20.461 --> 01:55:21.120
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2760
01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I you complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

2761
01:55:22.991 --> 01:55:26.980
<v Speaker 2>there can only be one woman each show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's fucking her or me.</v>

2762
01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Or it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2763
01:55:28.031 --> 01:55:29.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's like a primal thing of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

2764
01:55:29.861 --> 01:55:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like I want protection from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man cause of whatever.</v>

2765
01:55:32.411 --> 01:55:34.450
<v Speaker 2>There's all that sort of like old</v>
<v Speaker 2>primordial shed.</v>

2766
01:55:34.630 --> 01:55:36.520
<v Speaker 2>But competition between women like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2767
01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:41.350
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time I'm kind of not</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that and it's kind of Nice for</v>

2768
01:55:41.351 --> 01:55:43.380
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2769
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.151
<v Speaker 2>and we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>

2770
01:55:44.151 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I definitely know even though I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2771
01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are,</v>

2772
01:55:48.330 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 2>my concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who I was talking about</v>

2773
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:53.070
<v Speaker 2>this the other day is that basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are just going to stop hiring</v>

2774
01:55:53.071 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 2>women or stop hiring mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like putting,</v>

2775
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 2>mixing people gender is up in offices</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just too scary.</v>

2776
01:55:57.871 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned and I'm concerned there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a little bit of a backlash</v>

2777
01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:05.490
<v Speaker 2>that guys are smoking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not worth hiring a woman because</v>

2778
01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to be a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2779
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.010
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2780
01:56:08.011 --> 01:56:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I never hire pretty assistance or I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>never hire a pretty girl to be in my</v>

2781
01:56:11.011 --> 01:56:13.170
<v Speaker 2>office because I'm just too scared the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way men are gonna Act,</v>

2782
01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.810
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a little crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate,</v>

2783
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

2784
01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:18.000
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to get sued.</v>

2785
01:56:18.190 --> 01:56:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one wants to get sued.</v>

2786
01:56:20.261 --> 01:56:23.680
<v Speaker 4>You change the office dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a really hot assistant and</v>

2787
01:56:23.681 --> 01:56:26.290
<v Speaker 4>she's walking around with all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>other guys in the office and the other</v>

2788
01:56:26.291 --> 01:56:28.570
<v Speaker 4>guys in the office like getting their</v>
<v Speaker 4>cups of coffee,</v>

2789
01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:30.700
<v Speaker 4>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah,</v>

2790
01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:35.530
<v Speaker 4>her assistant and his men recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I see a god it's like skis it</v>

2791
01:56:35.531 --> 01:56:37.360
<v Speaker 4>on a check and like Ah,</v>

2792
01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:40.550
<v Speaker 2>well if you have need an intern or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you have two women that</v>

2793
01:56:40.551 --> 01:56:45.500
<v Speaker 2>are equally qualified and one is</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight and 55 and one is 22 and</v>

2794
01:56:45.501 --> 01:56:47.660
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that can be equally</v>

2795
01:56:47.661 --> 01:56:50.630
<v Speaker 2>qualified but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who are you going higher or you</v>

2796
01:56:50.631 --> 01:56:51.171
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2797
01:56:51.171 --> 01:56:52.970
<v Speaker 2>this is a liability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those could be a problem.</v>

2798
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 55 year old lady might be fucking</v>

2799
01:56:56.071 --> 01:57:01.071
<v Speaker 4>crazy and the know how to use dropbox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She might be like really interested in,</v>

2800
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:03.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the things that we're interested</v>

2801
01:57:03.991 --> 01:57:05.490
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make it easier to talk to her.</v>

2802
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Or it could be the opposite of the 55</v>
<v Speaker 4>year old might be wise and you know,</v>

2803
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:14.610
<v Speaker 4>very calm to be around it and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's a good the individual.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2807
01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like potential liability.</v>

2808
01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:24.310
<v Speaker 4>If someone has a 55 year old intern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2809
01:57:24.311 --> 01:57:26.560
<v Speaker 4>well don't you need money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a red flag in your money.</v>

2810
01:57:26.590 --> 01:57:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2811
01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a PA on the show that I was on</v>

2812
01:57:30.281 --> 01:57:32.830

<v Speaker 4>you're a PA and you're 39 and he turned</v>

2814
01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:38.530
<v Speaker 4>out to be out fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was on pills.</v>

2815
01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.453
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was on.</v>

2816
01:57:39.690 --> 01:57:40.523
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2817
01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:43.210
<v Speaker 4>do I had to tell people I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you see the way he's moving?</v>

2818
01:57:43.410 --> 01:57:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Like he turns really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2819
01:57:45.701 --> 01:57:48.120
<v Speaker 4>that guy's on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 100% and then you go,</v>

2820
01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:50.170
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sure I go watch him.</v>

2821
01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I go watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2822
01:57:51.401 --> 01:57:53.190
<v Speaker 4>he's twitchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swiveling around.</v>

2823
01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.780
<v Speaker 4>He's always talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can never shut the fuck up.</v>

2824
01:57:55.781 --> 01:57:58.630
<v Speaker 4>He interrupts conversations and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>injects with these long,</v>

2825
01:57:58.631 --> 01:58:03.130
<v Speaker 4>boring stories of his own guys on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>100% 39 year old intern.</v>

2826
01:58:03.131 --> 01:58:05.260
<v Speaker 4>They fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to firing him like right after</v>

2827
01:58:05.261 --> 01:58:06.760
<v Speaker 4>this one job that we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was like,</v>

2828
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:07.743
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2829
01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:09.310
<v Speaker 2>It was tricky though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>

2830
01:58:09.311 --> 01:58:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a bunch of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bosses and they're like,</v>

2831
01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:13.540
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just stop hiring women.</v>

2832
01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

2833
01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2834
01:58:15.161 --> 01:58:15.971
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other kids,</v>

2835
01:58:15.971 --> 01:58:18.190
<v Speaker 2>they're just so afraid of getting sued</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're so afraid of interoffice</v>

2836
01:58:18.250 --> 01:58:21.370
<v Speaker 2>relationships and that sort of shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's good backfire.</v>

2837
01:58:21.570 --> 01:58:24.570
<v Speaker 4>I am too free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm to free to have input on this.</v>

2838
01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:24.980
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2839
01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:25.801
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2840
01:58:25.801 --> 01:58:29.430
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a weird dynamic when men</v>
<v Speaker 4>and women work together and you have a</v>

2841
01:58:29.431 --> 01:58:32.010
<v Speaker 4>really hilarious bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people working in an office</v>

2842
01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:33.240
<v Speaker 4>together like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2843
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 4>the way they interact with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very strange.</v>

2844
01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Like honey badgers in a fucking cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is weird.</v>

2845
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like your,</v>

2846
01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 4>this is your new family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're with</v>

2847
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 3>these people eight hours a day and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only asleep for five and then you</v>

2848
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.690
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2849
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 3>How long do you see your wife every day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2850
01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2851
01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're in traffic for three,</v>

2852
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:55.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like what,</v>

2853
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.510
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your life is these people and so</v>

2854
01:58:58.511 --> 01:59:03.511
<v Speaker 3>then your sexual situation gets weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>because helping bonds with them,</v>

2855
01:59:03.731 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 3>trauma bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially people</v>

2856
01:59:05.730 --> 01:59:08.880
<v Speaker 1>that never fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to fuck forever and they</v>

2857
01:59:08.881 --> 01:59:11.490
<v Speaker 1>just hug each other a little and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet to each other for it,</v>

2858
01:59:11.491 --> 01:59:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but nothing ever comes of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they both know,</v>

2859
01:59:14.370 --> 01:59:17.070
<v Speaker 1>they both know they really want to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to.</v>

2860
01:59:17.071 --> 01:59:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of a little flirty and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little affectionately.</v>

2861
01:59:20.431 --> 01:59:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they exchange the silly text</v>

2862
01:59:22.681 --> 01:59:26.340
<v Speaker 1>messages and then the wife will find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an inappropriate emotional</v>

2863
01:59:26.341 --> 01:59:27.510
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

2864
01:59:27.511 --> 01:59:28.344
<v Speaker 1>well what does that mean,</v>

2865
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.700
<v Speaker 3>friends?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2866
01:59:31.150 --> 01:59:34.150
<v Speaker 3>my work husband type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had that sort of step off of that.</v>

2867
01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.430
<v Speaker 3>People do have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had for people to openly talk about</v>

2868
01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:38.260
<v Speaker 3>their work husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2869
01:59:38.261 --> 01:59:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is dark.</v>

2870
01:59:39.941 --> 01:59:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember with Chris Taleah I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing a show that Chris,</v>

2871
01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Leah and we would spend all day together</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day and we were like having this</v>

2872
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:49.540
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're also acting his girlfriend</v>

2873
01:59:49.541 --> 01:59:51.610
<v Speaker 3>and boyfriend and we were sort of super</v>
<v Speaker 3>bonded.</v>

2874
01:59:51.611 --> 01:59:53.410
<v Speaker 3>And then because you spend all day</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to each other,</v>

2875
01:59:53.411 --> 01:59:55.180
<v Speaker 3>confiding in each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing all these experiences,</v>

2876
01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.130
<v Speaker 3>by the time you get home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do your actual boyfriend and you're</v>

2877
01:59:57.131 --> 01:59:57.964
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I?</v>

2878
01:59:59.170 --> 02:00:01.960
<v Speaker 3>And then you and then a month later I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2879
02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:04.120
<v Speaker 3>because remember when that director</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelled at me and they're like,</v>

2880
02:00:04.121 --> 02:00:04.841
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2881
02:00:04.841 --> 02:00:06.160
<v Speaker 3>I thought I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't listen to me.</v>

2882
02:00:06.161 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only because I've invested</v>

2883
02:00:08.141 --> 02:00:11.020
<v Speaker 3>everything and that other person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden it starts driving a</v>

2884
02:00:11.021 --> 02:00:14.110
<v Speaker 3>wedge between you and your actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you're supposed to do in</v>

2885
02:00:14.111 --> 02:00:17.140
<v Speaker 3>relationships is keep everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold it.</v>

2886
02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:20.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like not ejaculating basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally.</v>

2887
02:00:20.051 --> 02:00:22.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like hold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if something crazy happens to me at</v>

2888
02:00:22.451 --> 02:00:24.010
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't confide in someone at work.</v>

2889
02:00:24.011 --> 02:00:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I have to wait till I get home and bore</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of my boyfriend.</v>

2890
02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I know this dude who is a very funny guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he brings this woman on the road</v>

2891
02:00:30.331 --> 02:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>with them and when he brings this woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road with him,</v>

2892
02:00:32.131 --> 02:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>his wife freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She does like it.</v>

2893
02:00:35.850 --> 02:00:38.010

<v Speaker 1>He's got a woman opening act and his</v>

2894
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>wife is fucking freaking.</v>

2895
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you truly think I'm all for female</v>
<v Speaker 3>opening acts?</v>

2896
02:00:45.621 --> 02:00:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Obviously panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2897
02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:52.860
<v Speaker 3>do you think he has any interest in it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2898
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:53.960
<v Speaker 3>he just wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2899
02:00:53.961 --> 02:00:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I support having a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's nice.</v>

2900
02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.410
<v Speaker 3>She's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a good comic.</v>

2901
02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.350
<v Speaker 3>And he has her open forum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2902
02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I used to open for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2903
02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2904
02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2905
02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that thing,</v>

2906
02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:06.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2907
02:01:06.631 --> 02:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you're experiencing this thing that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2908
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:09.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

2909
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:11.320
<v Speaker 3>the wife is not a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing.</v>

2910
02:01:11.321 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 3>I think comics also have a bond that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like the outside person can never</v>

2911
02:01:15.551 --> 02:01:17.910
<v Speaker 3>totally understand as well.</v>

2912
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Way We joke around with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if just the things you and I have</v>

2913
02:01:21.201 --> 02:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>said to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2914
02:01:22.130 --> 02:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>If we said these things in an office,</v>

2915
02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human resources,</v>

2916
02:01:26.690 --> 02:01:27.920

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2917
02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd go to jail more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the worst.</v>

2918
02:01:31.781 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 3>But thank God that NBC lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those friends writers made a lot of</v>

2919
02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:37.080
<v Speaker 3>progress for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2920
02:01:37.081 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 3>So there's this famous lawsuit on</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

2921

2922
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:44.000
<v Speaker 2>the writers in the writer's room because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying something about the</v>

02:01:44.001 --> 02:01:48.470
<v Speaker 2>actresses are sang like fucking them</v>
<v Speaker 2>with twigs or I think something crazy.</v>

2924
02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sued,</v>

2925
02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the writer's assistant sued the writers</v>

2926

<v Speaker 2>creative process.</v>

2929
02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:01.950
<v Speaker 5>But it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it certainly is.</v>

2930
02:02:01.951 --> 02:02:05.160
<v Speaker 5>And especially with Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have said ridiculous shit to each</v>

2931
02:02:05.161 --> 02:02:06.030
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like about each other off like like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>

2936
02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.330
<v Speaker 5>How loud?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you do the weird fuck you bro.</v>

2937
02:02:18.331 --> 02:02:21.580
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a top me,</v>

2938
02:02:21.581 --> 02:02:23.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm a top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just going to give in.</v>

2939
02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.450
<v Speaker 5>You're just going to give in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2940
02:02:24.451 --> 02:02:27.720
<v Speaker 5>spinning your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rub it on your butt and we will do that</v>

2941
02:02:27.721 --> 02:02:31.830
<v Speaker 5>to each other because it's how we make</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other laugh that we need something</v>

2942
02:02:31.831 --> 02:02:35.160
<v Speaker 5>really extreme in completely forbidden</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make each other laugh.</v>

2943
02:02:35.190 --> 02:02:37.320
<v Speaker 5>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that is so fascinating.</v>

2944
02:02:37.321 --> 02:02:39.690
<v Speaker 5>I think Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just have to go off the grid a little</v>

2945
02:02:39.691 --> 02:02:41.430
<v Speaker 5>bit every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just too much porn.</v>

2946
02:02:41.490 --> 02:02:43.440
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is we need gags and fucking</v>

2947
02:02:43.441 --> 02:02:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Mascara running and fucking belt around</v>
<v Speaker 5>your neck.</v>

2948
02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:50.620
<v Speaker 5>We need the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need gagging to record the</v>

2949
02:02:50.621 --> 02:02:51.250
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

2950
02:02:51.250 --> 02:02:54.140
<v Speaker 2>We have a certain threshold of</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline we need or something.</v>

2951
02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I get around calm it take,</v>

2952
02:02:55.771 --> 02:02:56.600
<v Speaker 2>it took</v>

2953
02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:59.390
<v Speaker 5>all long to delineate the difference</v>
<v Speaker 5>between like how to act around comics</v>

2954
02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:02.450
<v Speaker 5>and how to act around human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I also think like part of the reason</v>

2955
02:03:02.451 --> 02:03:03.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little manic when I first see a</v>
<v Speaker 5>comic,</v>

2956
02:03:03.951 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 5>it's like a puppy seeing its own or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

2957

<v Speaker 5>get to be like,</v>

2961
02:03:14.631 --> 02:03:16.790
<v Speaker 5>I spent all day just be more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't say that.</v>

2962
02:03:16.791 --> 02:03:17.570
<v Speaker 5>Don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't say it.</v>

2963
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's our,</v>

2964
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:20.960
<v Speaker 5>our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the culture of,</v>

2965
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:22.640
<v Speaker 5>of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>standup comedy.</v>

2966
02:03:22.641 --> 02:03:23.900
<v Speaker 5>It's very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:26.600
<v Speaker 5>There's the community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the reasons why I'm very</v>

2968
02:03:26.601 --> 02:03:30.220
<v Speaker 5>protective of that community and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I've thought was</v>

2969
02:03:30.221 --> 02:03:31.160
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2970
02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I've said about this</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole Louis C k thing,</v>

2971
02:03:33.651 --> 02:03:36.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did it to one of us.</v>

2972
02:03:36.670 --> 02:03:38.590
<v Speaker 5>You did it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't him.</v>

2973
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.900
<v Speaker 5>Not that he should do it to anybody that</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to be a jerk off in front</v>

2974
02:03:41.901 --> 02:03:42.734
<v Speaker 5>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2975
02:03:42.850 --> 02:03:46.430
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think fighters are interns on</v>

2976
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:49.370
<v Speaker 5>our writing staff are the same as</v>
<v Speaker 5>standard too,</v>

2977
02:03:49.371 --> 02:03:50.181
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2978
02:03:50.181 --> 02:03:52.220
<v Speaker 5>It's like standups is one thing kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2979
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:53.870
<v Speaker 5>You just had a thing you'd like to beat</v>
<v Speaker 5>off,</v>

2980
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:55.820
<v Speaker 5>pick on someone your own size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2981
02:03:55.821 --> 02:03:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Come shirt off in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2982
02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:01.680
<v Speaker 5>Now as a 35 year goal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see that.</v>

2983
02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.670
<v Speaker 5>And apparently he did do that to some</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedians and they laughed and he</v>

2984
02:04:04.671 --> 02:04:05.740
<v Speaker 5>thought it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2985
02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:06.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2986
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Well there's some women that he did that</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2987
02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.140
<v Speaker 5>It didn't come out and they thought it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was funny,</v>

2988
02:04:12.170 --> 02:04:13.970
<v Speaker 5>but there's a difference between Lake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2989
02:04:13.971 --> 02:04:15.080
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

2990
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:18.890
<v Speaker 5>stop please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I could lose my job if I challenge</v>

2991
02:04:18.891 --> 02:04:19.850
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2992
02:04:19.851 --> 02:04:20.631
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There'll be,</v>

2993
02:04:20.631 --> 02:04:21.920
<v Speaker 5>nobody is doing that now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2994
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:23.630
<v Speaker 5>No one's beaten up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put them anybody anymore.</v>

2995
02:04:23.631 --> 02:04:26.570
<v Speaker 5>I think that's over most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You still,</v>

2996
02:04:26.571 --> 02:04:28.580
<v Speaker 5>there's still people scared to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2997
02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:33.530
<v Speaker 5>I guess I just am curious what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the neurology is of being,</v>

2998
02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:36.920
<v Speaker 5>being able to get an erection when a</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl is going stop.</v>

2999
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 5>The worst is if he didn't</v>

3000
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:39.960
<v Speaker 3>get an erection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like three quarters hard.</v>

3001
02:04:39.961 --> 02:04:44.961
<v Speaker 3>Like that's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a woman goes like being humiliated as</v>

3002
02:04:45.841 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 3>an aphrodisiac or shame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's driven by shame.</v>

3003
02:04:48.751 --> 02:04:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit to that for</v>

3004
02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:51.990
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3005
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was reading this thing about</v>

3006
02:04:54.691 --> 02:04:57.210
<v Speaker 3>pedophiles and like I'm not supportive</v>
<v Speaker 3>of pedophiles,</v>

3007
02:04:57.211 --> 02:05:01.020
<v Speaker 3>but like if you are a pedophile and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have horrible thoughts,</v>

3008
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.290
<v Speaker 3>there's nowhere where you can go unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can afford therapy where you can</v>

3009
02:05:04.291 --> 02:05:04.740
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3010
02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:07.890
<v Speaker 3>I have some really fucked up thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I want to fuck a kid.</v>

3011
02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 3>And because shame is the engine a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia and you have nowhere to go.</v>

3012
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Or if you dukes go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to go,</v>

3013
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're disgusting.</v>

3014
02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And they have nowhere to quell that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shame and stop the cycle.</v>

3015
02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you act on it,</v>

3016
02:05:19.921 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 3>then you have more shame and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just makes it worse.</v>

3017
02:05:22.050 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 3>And most pedophiles were molested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3018
02:05:24.451 --> 02:05:28.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's this just this fucked up cycle</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no social acceptable place</v>

3019
02:05:28.141 --> 02:05:30.210
<v Speaker 3>to go express that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wave in Aa you can go,</v>

3020
02:05:30.211 --> 02:05:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Hey I want a drink or I want to do drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

3021
02:05:32.581 --> 02:05:35.020
<v Speaker 3>There's no like place for them to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:40.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's also because it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your thing is victimizing children,</v>

3023
02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the zero tolerance for that</v>

3024
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:43.890
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people want to kill you.</v>

3025
02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.810
<v Speaker 3>They literally think you should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed,</v>

3026
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:49.260
<v Speaker 3>but there shouldn't be a place like aa</v>
<v Speaker 3>or somewhere where you go to go.</v>

3027
02:05:49.261 --> 02:05:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Like how would we know if it even works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

3028
02:05:52.690 --> 02:05:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I know what works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullets smell what's in your head,</v>

3029
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.270
<v Speaker 3>what's in your head work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

3030
02:05:57.970 --> 02:05:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Someone's a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

3031
02:05:59.161 --> 02:06:02.910
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about the fact that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a pedophile that means someone</v>

3032
02:06:02.911 --> 02:06:06.630
<v Speaker 3>molested you and you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were a victim at some point as</v>

3033
02:06:06.631 --> 02:06:09.660
<v Speaker 3>victims become perpetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like how do you break that cycle</v>

3034
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:13.200
<v Speaker 3>without just constantly shaming people</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause then you shame them into isolation</v>

3035
02:06:13.201 --> 02:06:18.201
<v Speaker 3>and isolation is where shame thrives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one day we'll have some sort of a</v>

3036
02:06:18.211 --> 02:06:23.090
<v Speaker 3>form of therapy that can literally erase</v>
<v Speaker 3>inclinations and that can erase surgery.</v>

3037
02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:25.890
<v Speaker 3>That fucking takes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's what they were trying to do</v>

3038
02:06:25.891 --> 02:06:27.830
<v Speaker 3>right when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3039
02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.040
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring those back.</v>

3040
02:06:31.090 --> 02:06:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Like what ever you have to do with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>drill and fucking,</v>

3041
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:35.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause when you see,</v>

3042
02:06:35.701 --> 02:06:38.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was reading about the dark web</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the deep web or the dark dark.</v>

3043
02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hundred years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like 90% of it is child pornography</v>

3044
02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:46.080
<v Speaker 3>and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many.</v>

3045
02:06:46.081 --> 02:06:51.081
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck it makes me homicidal</v>
<v Speaker 3>hero cop.</v>

3046
02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.570
<v Speaker 3>This guy was like a hero cop got his arm</v>
<v Speaker 3>blown off and it was like being,</v>

3047
02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:00.740
<v Speaker 3>and then they just caught them child</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn like Oh fuck no fucking vegas</v>

3048
02:07:02.251 --> 02:07:04.110
<v Speaker 3>shooter apparently had a bunch of child</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>

3049
02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:05.610
<v Speaker 3>Not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3050
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:06.481
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>

3051
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:09.930
<v Speaker 3>but like to stop that cycle is just so</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the same idea of like jerking</v>

3052
02:07:09.931 --> 02:07:14.250
<v Speaker 3>off on someone and being turned on by</v>
<v Speaker 3>them being scared,</v>

3053
02:07:14.610 --> 02:07:16.740
<v Speaker 3>being sexually aroused by a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being scared.</v>

3054
02:07:16.741 --> 02:07:18.180
<v Speaker 3>There's something fucking going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3055
02:07:18.181 --> 02:07:20.490
<v Speaker 3>And I dunno if its nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's nurture or if it's fucking</v>

3056
02:07:20.491 --> 02:07:23.670
<v Speaker 3>viking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pedophile thing is also,</v>

3057
02:07:23.671 --> 02:07:27.120
<v Speaker 3>it's such a forbidden topic that no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>even wants to express any sort of</v>

3058
02:07:27.121 --> 02:07:29.730
<v Speaker 3>sympathy for those people at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be thought of as a</v>

3059
02:07:29.731 --> 02:07:31.920
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia sympathizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>

3060
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a thing that you can't</v>

3061
02:07:34.321 --> 02:07:35.730
<v Speaker 3>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're the,</v>

3062
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.680
<v Speaker 4>the recidivism rate is so high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's a way to,</v>

3063
02:07:40.681 --> 02:07:42.460
<v Speaker 4>if it's an adult technically and</v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction,</v>

3064
02:07:42.490 --> 02:07:44.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think it's probably a mental</v>
<v Speaker 4>illness or if some sort of trauma</v>

3065
02:07:44.741 --> 02:07:46.990
<v Speaker 4>therapy because those people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatized.</v>

3066
02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're addicted to cigarettes,</v>

3067
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3068
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:53.230
<v Speaker 4>you go through therapy and you kick them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you get back on the cigarettes</v>

3069
02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 4>10 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

3070
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 4>But if you're addicted to fucking kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you live and then another kid</v>

3071
02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:02.860
<v Speaker 4>gets fucked because you couldn't keep it</v>
<v Speaker 4>together anymore.</v>

3072
02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

3073
02:08:03.881 --> 02:08:05.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm not willing to take that risk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3074
02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:08.770
<v Speaker 4>that becomes a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially someone who has young</v>

3075
02:08:08.771 --> 02:08:12.130
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That freaks me the fuck out.</v>

3076
02:08:12.131 --> 02:08:15.880
<v Speaker 4>And I like most fathers who are hearing</v>
<v Speaker 4>my voice thinking about this right now,</v>

3077
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:17.010
<v Speaker 4>I want to murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3078
02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:19.720
<v Speaker 4>I just want to take that person out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the food chain.</v>

3079
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:22.090
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to take that risk.</v>

3080
02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:23.470
<v Speaker 4>And I guess the one thing I would say is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3081
02:08:23.471 --> 02:08:27.460
<v Speaker 4>people you know have a lot of sympathy</v>
<v Speaker 4>for children who are molested or victims</v>

3082
02:08:27.461 --> 02:08:30.010
<v Speaker 4>of pedophiles until they grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3083
02:08:30.011 --> 02:08:33.700
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of women who are victims of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ended up manifesting as the women</v>

3084
02:08:33.701 --> 02:08:36.020
<v Speaker 4>who can say no or the women who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3085
02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:37.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatized and,</v>

3086
02:08:37.821 --> 02:08:41.860
<v Speaker 4>and freeze up and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those women hypersexual that's the</v>

3087
02:08:41.861 --> 02:08:43.340
<v Speaker 4>other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Torn stars.</v>

3088
02:08:43.730 --> 02:08:47.440
<v Speaker 4>A lot of women that get involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>adult industry were molested as</v>

3089
02:08:47.441 --> 02:08:49.120
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a giant percentage.</v>

3090
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:52.480
<v Speaker 4>What I say is all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say it's all of them</v>

3091
02:08:52.481 --> 02:08:54.700
<v Speaker 4>cause I know there's a lot of women that</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it just because they enjoy it and</v>

3092
02:08:54.701 --> 02:08:57.550
<v Speaker 4>that's totally cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there were a lot,</v>

3093
02:08:57.910 --> 02:09:00.670
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some survey they did once,</v>

3094
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:01.960
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back in the day.</v>

3095
02:09:01.961 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 4>And it was some alarming number.</v>

3096
02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people can never come to the,</v>

3097
02:09:07.170 --> 02:09:09.220
<v Speaker 4>to come to terms with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to a therapist who was</v>

3098
02:09:09.221 --> 02:09:10.870
<v Speaker 4>saying something about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3099
02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:14.050
<v Speaker 4>plastics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people that get crazy plastic</v>

3100
02:09:14.051 --> 02:09:17.830
<v Speaker 4>surgery do it because they were molested</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're trying to change their face.</v>

3101
02:09:17.831 --> 02:09:20.050
<v Speaker 4>So when they look in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the person that got molested.</v>

3102
02:09:20.170 --> 02:09:22.150
<v Speaker 4>What they thought about Michael Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 4>and really?</v>

3103
02:09:22.151 --> 02:09:23.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the big theories about</v>

3104
02:09:23.651 --> 02:09:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jackson is his father abused</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

3105
02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know my theory about Michael Jackson</v>

3106
02:09:28.931 --> 02:09:30.640
<v Speaker 4>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't say it again,</v>

3107
02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:33.340
<v Speaker 4>tell me everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a Castrato.</v>

3108
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I think he had his balls removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why his voice was so</v>

3109
02:09:36.671 --> 02:09:39.040
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a common thing that used to do</v>

3110
02:09:39.041 --> 02:09:40.630
<v Speaker 4>with singers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3111
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of [inaudible] music,</v>

3112
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:45.940
<v Speaker 4>but is she going to teach Whitney</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cummings?</v>

3113
02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:49.680
<v Speaker 4>They used to do that with opera singers</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than I do.</v>

3114
02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:52.890
<v Speaker 4>You know a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3115
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:55.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not to eat cookies while we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3116
02:09:56.770 --> 02:10:00.190
<v Speaker 4>There's no sugar in those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so hungry.</v>

3117
02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's very little,</v>

3118
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:03.350
<v Speaker 4>those are no cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have very little sugar.</v>

3119
02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:06.200
<v Speaker 4>The glycaemic index on those as</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely low,</v>

3120
02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:08.530
<v Speaker 4>get hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it cause my body</v>

3121
02:10:08.531 --> 02:10:11.020
<v Speaker 4>burns fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat very little carbohydrates.</v>

3122
02:10:11.110 --> 02:10:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Like this morning I ate eggs and a fat</v>
<v Speaker 4>beef.</v>

3123
02:10:14.621 --> 02:10:18.360
<v Speaker 4>So you never have life sugar spike or</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar dips because you don't eat.</v>

3124
02:10:18.361 --> 02:10:20.260
<v Speaker 4>You have any spikes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3125
02:10:20.261 --> 02:10:23.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating fat most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he fat in meat.</v>

3126
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:24.880
<v Speaker 4>That's what I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly.</v>

3127
02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:26.920
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to just regroup here.</v>

3128
02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:30.640
<v Speaker 4>I need to start from it's way healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way better cognitively.</v>

3129
02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 4>This is what I don't get mentally this</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3130
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I take four naps a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think any now.</v>

3131
02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:38.670
<v Speaker 4>It was always so fucking tire.</v>

3132
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm on Beta blockers to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a whole other thing.</v>

3133
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:42.890
<v Speaker 4>But you're on Beta blockers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beta blockers,</v>

3134
02:10:43.110 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Beta blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get really bad migraines and it's</v>

3135
02:10:46.911 --> 02:10:48.590
<v Speaker 4>hormonal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think I figured that out.</v>

3136
02:10:48.970 --> 02:10:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lead a blockers are supposed to keep</v>

3137
02:10:50.661 --> 02:10:52.010
<v Speaker 4>you from getting nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3138
02:10:52.011 --> 02:10:56.030
<v Speaker 4>It stops like adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think from what I've understand,</v>

3139
02:10:56.990 --> 02:11:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of archers use that test</v>
<v Speaker 4>for it because when you're on the like</v>

3140
02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 4>an archery competitions and the nerves</v>
<v Speaker 4>will make you shaky.</v>

3141
02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:09.320
<v Speaker 4>So I produced a lot of adrenaline and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cortisol at the tiniest things cause I'm</v>

3142
02:11:09.321 --> 02:11:11.450
<v Speaker 4>a fucking trauma surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every damn hug.</v>

3143
02:11:11.451 --> 02:11:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Women don't want to hug you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking bad.</v>

3144
02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:19.760
<v Speaker 4>And so I was getting really bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>migraines because of my neuro chemical</v>

3145
02:11:19.761 --> 02:11:21.320
<v Speaker 4>spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would get too much adrenaline and too</v>

3146
02:11:21.321 --> 02:11:24.240
<v Speaker 4>much cortisol when I get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I take two Beta blockers a day.</v>

3147
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm a catch Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had your balls cut off today would</v>

3148
02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 4>be your place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way you're developing.</v>

3149
02:11:33.021 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 4>They do it to a boy when they're very</v>
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>

3150
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:38.330
<v Speaker 4>There's actually recordings of cast</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trados from like the early 19 hundreds</v>

3151
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:41.150
<v Speaker 4>see if you can get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What surgeon does?</v>

3152
02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Jamie got us pulled off youtube before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3153
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.990
<v Speaker 4>did it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull it from there.</v>

3154
02:11:44.991 --> 02:11:45.970
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>

3155
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:48.880
<v Speaker 4>because it's like um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>child porn.</v>

3156
02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:49.401
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3157
02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:50.810
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's a,</v>

3158
02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:54.740
<v Speaker 4>because the recording,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets flagged by Youtube as being</v>

3159
02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:57.560
<v Speaker 4>their proprietary or their property,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their property.</v>

3160
02:11:57.561 --> 02:12:01.250
<v Speaker 4>And so anything that you use that</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else's stuff can get you pulled</v>

3161
02:12:01.251 --> 02:12:04.250
<v Speaker 4>off of youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know like there's a shit load of</v>

3162
02:12:04.251 --> 02:12:07.850
<v Speaker 4>people out there that have like these</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature videos.</v>

3163
02:12:07.851 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 4>There's a big one we get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gives us pulled all the time.</v>

3164
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:12.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that own things for it.</v>

3165
02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Like the way you would license</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

3166
02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.920
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do something like that or you</v>

3167
02:12:15.921 --> 02:12:18.560
<v Speaker 4>could give them your ad revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'd have to give them like all the</v>

3168
02:12:18.561 --> 02:12:20.190
<v Speaker 4>ad revenue from a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3169
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.240
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if we played a clip from the</v>

3170
02:12:23.241 --> 02:12:25.700
<v Speaker 4>office and we played it and you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>see it on the show,</v>

3171
02:12:25.730 --> 02:12:27.790
<v Speaker 4>we would totally get flagged and pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3172
02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:31.790
<v Speaker 4>And if it happens more than one time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can lose your whole channel.</v>

3173
02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:38.630
<v Speaker 4>You could argue it that it's fair use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have a license to do it.</v>

3174
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:41.750
<v Speaker 4>And if you're making money off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might not be considered fair use.</v>

3175
02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:45.560
<v Speaker 4>So listen to this sound with this sound</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we're hearing,</v>

3176
02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:47.180
<v Speaker 4>and Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the name of this?</v>

3177
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:55.280
<v Speaker 4>This is a young man who had his balls</v>
<v Speaker 4>removed and one of the things that</v>

3178
02:12:55.281 --> 02:12:57.230
<v Speaker 4>happens to them as they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3179
02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:59.720
<v Speaker 4>they never really develop masculine</v>
<v Speaker 4>traits.</v>

3180
02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:02.120
<v Speaker 4>This guy got fat because he had no</v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone,</v>

3181
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:07.330
<v Speaker 4>no testosterone is no balls and so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this haunting high pitched,</v>

3182
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:11.990
<v Speaker 4>almost female but not quite sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was a preferred sound.</v>

3183
02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:17.200
<v Speaker 4>So much so that they would take children</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sell them off and they would get</v>

3184
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:20.960
<v Speaker 4>their balls cut off at a young age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they would develop to be cussed.</v>

3185
02:13:20.961 --> 02:13:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Strados can't handle things.</v>

3186
02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:25.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my thought about Michael</v>

3187
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Michael Jackson's voice was so</v>

3188
02:13:28.131 --> 02:13:31.940
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so high pitched and like falsetto</v>

3189
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.050
<v Speaker 4>was so pure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>

3190
02:13:34.290 --> 02:13:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean no one's going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no way to know,</v>

3191
02:13:36.661 --> 02:13:39.180
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a retard and I have my own</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts.</v>

3192
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:40.710
<v Speaker 4>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are my thoughts.</v>

3193
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:43.530
<v Speaker 4>The surgeon who did that surgery after</v>
<v Speaker 4>he dies,</v>

3194
02:13:43.531 --> 02:13:46.950
<v Speaker 4>why aren't I coming forward and getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>$5 million for this story?</v>

3195
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:49.560
<v Speaker 4>Because that surgeon's going to go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking jail.</v>

3196
02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:53.550
<v Speaker 4>You do that shit in America for saint to</v>
<v Speaker 4>took a kid,</v>

3197
02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 4>cut his balls off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>

3198
02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.380
<v Speaker 4>It might not even be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might just be a stupid person.</v>

3199
02:13:58.381 --> 02:13:59.880
<v Speaker 4>It was a dumb idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is more likely.</v>

3200
02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.430
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a pretty good explanation.</v>

3201
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3202
02:14:04.610 --> 02:14:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't sound anything like that.</v>

3203
02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:09.750
<v Speaker 4>You hear Jermaine Jackson saying he</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds like a man.</v>

3204
02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jackson never sounded like come</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

3205
02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:13.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all weird.</v>

3206
02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The well,</v>

3207
02:14:14.821 --> 02:14:19.560
<v Speaker 4>it's also the abuse that he suffered as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a child and his incredible connection to</v>

3208
02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:22.350
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This bizarre connections you get</v>

3209
02:14:22.351 --> 02:14:23.070
<v Speaker 4>stunted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3210
02:14:23.070 --> 02:14:23.520
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>

3211
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:27.810
<v Speaker 8>The doctor that killed him or was in</v>
<v Speaker 8>jail for killing them wrote in a book</v>

3212
02:14:27.811 --> 02:14:30.870
<v Speaker 8>that his parents had him chemically</v>
<v Speaker 8>castrated.</v>

3213
02:14:31.650 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like taking those real,</v>

3214
02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:34.620
<v Speaker 8>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean that's what he wrote in a book.</v>

3215
02:14:34.621 --> 02:14:37.130
<v Speaker 8>I'm reading on some New Zealand new sub.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how</v>

3216
02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I could they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They done that to trauma.</v>

3217
02:14:39.021 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Lester's they've do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do that to trauma loss is to giving</v>

3218
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:42.780
<v Speaker 4>them the option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3219
02:14:42.781 --> 02:14:46.560
<v Speaker 4>so that you don't know Michael Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemically castrated by parents claims.</v>

3220
02:14:46.561 --> 02:14:49.640
<v Speaker 4>Dr t this is my fucking theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn,</v>

3221
02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:51.730
<v Speaker 4>and I'm writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Bet I'm right.</v>

3222
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:53.010
<v Speaker 4>I Bet I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3223
02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:54.900
<v Speaker 4>the also his children were in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

3224
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:57.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a heterosexual man,</v>

3225
02:14:57.061 --> 02:15:01.620
<v Speaker 4>but heinous things happen to Michael in</v>
<v Speaker 4>his lifetime that actually changed or</v>

3226
02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:04.680
<v Speaker 4>had him morph into who he thought he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

3227
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:06.510
<v Speaker 4>One of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to Murray,</v>

3228
02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:09.450
<v Speaker 4>was his parents are arranging for his</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical castration.</v>

3229
02:15:09.630 --> 02:15:13.290
<v Speaker 4>His testes were never remove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but injections were given to Michael</v>

3230
02:15:13.290 --> 02:15:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Jackson to maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His voice is high pitched voice of a</v>

3231
02:15:16.081 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 4>child that went long beyond puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He places much of the blame for</v>

3232
02:15:20.161 --> 02:15:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Jackson's extrordinary but difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>life at the feet of his family.</v>

3233
02:15:23.551 --> 02:15:24.960
<v Speaker 4>I fucking knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let me ask you.</v>

3234
02:15:24.961 --> 02:15:27.450
<v Speaker 4>It was right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That stops testosterone production like</v>

3235
02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:30.120
<v Speaker 4>what's given to kids on are</v>
<v Speaker 4>transitioning and that sort of thing.</v>

3236
02:15:30.150 --> 02:15:32.430
<v Speaker 4>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why he was so skinny.</v>

3237
02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:34.590
<v Speaker 4>He never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was a child,</v>

3238
02:15:35.130 --> 02:15:38.750
<v Speaker 4>they did that to him as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Teen boys can you still go?</v>

3239
02:15:38.751 --> 02:15:39.930
<v Speaker 4>You still grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women are tall.</v>

3240
02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:41.100
<v Speaker 4>You're tall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're taller than me.</v>

3241
02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:42.780
<v Speaker 8>Lot of Gmos.</v>

3242
02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:44.360
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3243
02:15:44.361 --> 02:15:47.550
<v Speaker 4>it's just a different genes that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't stop you from growing tall</v>

3244
02:15:47.551 --> 02:15:49.950
<v Speaker 4>stops your muscles from developing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3245
02:15:49.951 --> 02:15:51.420
<v Speaker 4>but and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what does that have to do with</v>

3246
02:15:51.421 --> 02:15:53.160
<v Speaker 4>the vocal cords?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause something about your vocal cords.</v>

3247
02:15:53.161 --> 02:15:56.160
<v Speaker 4>Testosterone changes your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why when a woman turns into a</v>

3248
02:15:56.161 --> 02:15:59.130
<v Speaker 4>transgender man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their voice becomes a different food.</v>

3249
02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Is that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3250
02:16:03.930 --> 02:16:06.370
<v Speaker 4>it's all legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chemically castrate though.</v>

3251
02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:10.220
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy because that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we talked about this in Roseanne.</v>

3252
02:16:10.490 --> 02:16:11.490
<v Speaker 4>It's doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3253
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:13.770
<v Speaker 4>If that doctor's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I bet he is right.</v>

3254
02:16:14.250 --> 02:16:15.840
<v Speaker 4>If you wrote about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he's right.</v>

3255
02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:17.850
<v Speaker 4>He self published it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just what does that mean?</v>

3256
02:16:17.851 --> 02:16:20.670
<v Speaker 4>No one's giving them bucktail cause the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck's gonna give it a factual book deal</v>

3257
02:16:20.671 --> 02:16:22.760
<v Speaker 4>to the guy who killed Michael Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

3258
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3259
02:16:25.391 --> 02:16:26.250
<v Speaker 4>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took it away.</v>

3260
02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh did they get there and he lost it.</v>

3261
02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.910
<v Speaker 4>He lost his book deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the thing came out about a Hetero,</v>

3262
02:16:31.090 --> 02:16:34.120
<v Speaker 4>him thinking that it's okay for young</v>
<v Speaker 4>boys to have sex with gay men.</v>

3263
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:35.570
<v Speaker 4>Not Great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not great,</v>

3264
02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:38.290
<v Speaker 4>not a great brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Community has a different take on that.</v>

3265
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:40.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a different take on it.</v>

3266
02:16:40.241 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Then the straight community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of gay,</v>

3267
02:16:42.581 --> 02:16:46.840
<v Speaker 4>young gay boys having sex with gay men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't bother them in the same way</v>

3268
02:16:46.841 --> 02:16:47.890
<v Speaker 4>with a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

3269
02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:50.620
<v Speaker 4>obviously I'm not speaking for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>community and I don't want to</v>

3270
02:16:50.621 --> 02:16:54.010
<v Speaker 4>generalize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reactions that I've had from gay</v>

3271
02:16:54.011 --> 02:16:56.350
<v Speaker 4>friends that talk about it say it's way</v>
<v Speaker 4>more common.</v>

3272
02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that was the Bryan singer thing</v>

3273
02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:00.340
<v Speaker 4>that Brian Senior had those parties at</v>
<v Speaker 4>his house.</v>

3274
02:17:00.341 --> 02:17:02.200
<v Speaker 4>We had a whole pool full of fucking gay</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid</v>

3275
02:17:02.290 --> 02:17:05.710
<v Speaker 3>and Morrissey also demanded Kevin Spacey</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and I'm like,</v>

3276
02:17:05.711 --> 02:17:07.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3277
02:17:07.390 --> 02:17:10.690
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how like how do you know if you're</v>

3278
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:13.510
<v Speaker 3>17 and like we were just talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power dynamic.</v>

3279
02:17:13.511 --> 02:17:14.980
<v Speaker 3>How do you even know you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out who you are.</v>

3280
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:17.350
<v Speaker 3>You're looking for a father figure or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you abused yourself.</v>

3281
02:17:17.351 --> 02:17:19.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know until they grow up and</v>

3282
02:17:19.181 --> 02:17:21.340
<v Speaker 3>figure it out in therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was really conceptual.</v>

3283
02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3284
02:17:22.250 --> 02:17:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's weird that we put this</v>
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary date to like 18 arbitrary,</v>

3285
02:17:27.370 --> 02:17:29.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can go to war now you're 18</v>

3286
02:17:29.061 --> 02:17:33.020
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured out it's 32 who I was when,</v>

3287
02:17:33.021 --> 02:17:35.030
<v Speaker 4>when she should be allowed to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say 50.</v>

3288
02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:36.073
<v Speaker 4>I say</v>

3289
02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:39.650
<v Speaker 3>didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3290
02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:41.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's so it's like,</v>

3291
02:17:41.731 --> 02:17:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3292
02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:46.290
<v Speaker 3>should you be allowed to drive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drove like a maniac when I was young.</v>

3293
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I just never should have had a car until</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like 23 years old.</v>

3294
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:52.300
<v Speaker 3>When should you be able to drink?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When should you be to at all,</v>

3295
02:17:52.350 --> 02:17:53.310
<v Speaker 3>if at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3296
02:17:53.311 --> 02:17:54.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>

3297
02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:57.690
<v Speaker 3>And once you be able to have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question too because you</v>

3298
02:17:57.691 --> 02:18:01.770
<v Speaker 3>only do it for a certain amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the time you can't do it anymore,</v>

3299
02:18:01.771 --> 02:18:03.000
<v Speaker 3>that's when you finally know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

3300
02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm 35 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I finally am qualified to be a mother</v>

3301
02:18:06.541 --> 02:18:09.150
<v Speaker 3>and this is when you stopped being</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically capable than nuts.</v>

3302
02:18:09.450 --> 02:18:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a couple more years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can still shoot one out.</v>

3303
02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my shits on ice,</v>

3304
02:18:15.961 --> 02:18:18.120
<v Speaker 3>so I think I might have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might have more time,</v>

3305
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:20.640
<v Speaker 3>but you have to find someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would really raise a kid with.</v>

3306
02:18:21.150 --> 02:18:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to find the perfect nanny.</v>

3307
02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:29.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a guy that I think is a plus and</v>

3308
02:18:29.371 --> 02:18:31.030
<v Speaker 3>if he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give the child to you.</v>

3309
02:18:31.470 --> 02:18:33.220
<v Speaker 3>You seem to maybe doing a pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

3310
02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Raise them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raise them in the forest.</v>

3311
02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you said it's just like it.</v>

3312
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:39.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a very real fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm finally for the first time like,</v>

3313
02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to get my shit together on that,</v>

3314
02:18:41.641 --> 02:18:43.530
<v Speaker 3>but then I get super scared about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3315
02:18:43.531 --> 02:18:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I want to bring kids into this world</v>

3316
02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:50.100
<v Speaker 3>today</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the books and medicine and</v>

3317
02:18:50.101 --> 02:18:53.400
<v Speaker 3>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were shitting kitchen floors.</v>

3318
02:18:53.730 --> 02:18:56.460
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're here to have water in</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years.</v>

3319
02:18:56.510 --> 02:18:57.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have water.</v>

3320
02:18:57.710 --> 02:18:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to figure this out.</v>

3321
02:18:58.880 --> 02:18:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Can you be drinking salt water,</v>

3322
02:19:00.210 --> 02:19:01.710
<v Speaker 4>panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking out.</v>

3323
02:19:01.711 --> 02:19:06.711
<v Speaker 4>But that's also why we correct things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the technology ingenuity and I</v>

3324
02:19:07.051 --> 02:19:11.430
<v Speaker 4>also think is ironically as it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy like Donald Trump as president is</v>

3325
02:19:11.431 --> 02:19:16.431
<v Speaker 4>going to really activate people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to start moving in liquid</v>

3326
02:19:16.861 --> 02:19:20.730
<v Speaker 4>at this fucking women's March.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Part of that is having to grab the</v>

3327
02:19:20.731 --> 02:19:24.360
<v Speaker 4>pussy president had to get this bad in</v>
<v Speaker 4>order for us to wake the fuck up because</v>

3328
02:19:24.361 --> 02:19:26.130
<v Speaker 4>we were all zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sleep walkers.</v>

3329
02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 4>He's the reason why those pussy hats</v>

3330
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.650
<v Speaker 3>that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever's making a wind fall off those</v>

3331
02:19:30.651 --> 02:19:34.130
<v Speaker 3>goddamn puts me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be thanking Dora people down</v>

3332
02:19:34.131 --> 02:19:36.860
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sally knows how to make pussy hats like</v>

3333
02:19:36.861 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if he is behind the selling of</v>

3334
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:39.831
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3335
02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:41.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing to see all the</v>

3336
02:19:41.061 --> 02:19:43.170
<v Speaker 3>commercialization of it and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>capital I know</v>

3337
02:19:43.690 --> 02:19:48.460
<v Speaker 1>going to make us much more appreciative</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the environmental protection agency</v>

3338
02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3339
02:19:50.170 --> 02:19:53.680
<v Speaker 1>all the restrictions at Obama put an</v>
<v Speaker 1>offshore drilling if anything goes</v>

3340
02:19:53.681 --> 02:19:54.480
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3341
02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's just opened up offshore</v>
<v Speaker 1>drilling everywhere.</v>

3342
02:19:56.831 --> 02:19:57.550
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3343
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what he's done and what he's</v>

3344
02:19:59.611 --> 02:20:01.840
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that he's done a lot of</v>

3345
02:20:01.841 --> 02:20:05.080
<v Speaker 1>really crazy things with the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with state,</v>

3346
02:20:05.350 --> 02:20:07.000
<v Speaker 1>with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3347
02:20:07.001 --> 02:20:08.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's bureau of land management</v>

3348
02:20:08.921 --> 02:20:10.900
<v Speaker 1>areas or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3349
02:20:10.930 --> 02:20:13.120
<v Speaker 1>W W I don't know which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which organization.</v>

3350
02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:18.300
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely state land that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>public land that's now being diminished</v>

3351
02:20:18.591 --> 02:20:21.070
<v Speaker 1>to state parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're now being diminished and they're</v>

3352
02:20:21.071 --> 02:20:24.790
<v Speaker 1>opening them up from mining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're opening them up for extraction</v>

3353
02:20:24.791 --> 02:20:26.380
<v Speaker 1>of minerals and resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3354
02:20:26.650 --> 02:20:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And all this is close to rivers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>watersheds and all these different areas</v>

3355
02:20:31.481 --> 02:20:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that are very important for different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ECOSYS tines.</v>

3356
02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying stuff.</v>

3357
02:20:36.371 --> 02:20:37.950
<v Speaker 1>In terms of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delaware,</v>

3358
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:40.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's earthquakes in Oklahoma all the</v>

3359
02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:44.050
<v Speaker 1>time now that never used to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that's directly attributed to</v>

3360
02:20:44.051 --> 02:20:46.270
<v Speaker 1>fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're drilling these giant holes in</v>

3361
02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:49.660
<v Speaker 1>the ground and pumping all this water in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and fluids and all this shit they</v>

3362
02:20:49.661 --> 02:20:51.160
<v Speaker 1>used for fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3363
02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to energize people and get</v>

3364
02:20:53.951 --> 02:20:57.430
<v Speaker 1>people to understand that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's real consequences to just</v>

3365
02:20:57.431 --> 02:21:01.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking about money and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also how ridiculous it is that a guy who</v>

3366
02:21:01.781 --> 02:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>has more money than he could ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking possibly spend is only thinking</v>

3367
02:21:05.171 --> 02:21:09.700
<v Speaker 1>about money in his thigh is in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking about America.</v>

3368
02:21:09.730 --> 02:21:12.870
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking about people prospering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting jobs and this not,</v>

3369
02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but clearly it's not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear it clearly there's some</v>

3370
02:21:16.511 --> 02:21:19.480
<v Speaker 1>personal profit that's being extracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all this.</v>

3371
02:21:19.481 --> 02:21:20.270
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3372
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3373
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:21.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like his people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3374
02:21:21.481 --> 02:21:22.140
<v Speaker 3>his hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3375
02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.610
<v Speaker 3>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I love Oprah.</v>

3376
02:21:23.611 --> 02:21:26.160
<v Speaker 3>She's a delight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the left to go like,</v>

3377
02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:28.920
<v Speaker 3>let's have old purvi president and bcs</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter page.</v>

3378
02:21:29.130 --> 02:21:31.710
<v Speaker 3>This is our president and Kendra letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3379
02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:32.561
<v Speaker 3>our president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3380
02:21:32.561 --> 02:21:33.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no oprah.</v>

3381
02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's hire another celebrity who isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified to be the breath.</v>

3382
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't it oprah?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't telling anybody.</v>

3383
02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys remember the secret?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember the fucking secrets?</v>

3384
02:21:42.391 --> 02:21:42.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back.</v>

3385
02:21:42.991 --> 02:21:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And when oprah was telling everybody you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have anything you want,</v>

3386
02:21:45.631 --> 02:21:48.650
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of imagine it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3387
02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.060
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fuck,</v>

3388
02:21:51.061 --> 02:21:52.620
<v Speaker 3>are we watching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>

3389
02:21:52.621 --> 02:21:54.850
<v Speaker 3>it's not great to also be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3390
02:21:54.851 --> 02:21:57.180
<v Speaker 3>let's have this other celebrity be</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

3391
02:21:57.600 --> 02:21:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful Lady in her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have anything</v>

3392
02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.460
<v Speaker 1>problem with Oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think what we should have is</v>

3393
02:22:02.461 --> 02:22:07.461
<v Speaker 1>someone who is extremely educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is incredibly nuanced and well</v>

3394
02:22:08.521 --> 02:22:13.290
<v Speaker 1>thought out opinions and things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's got a really good grasp of</v>

3395
02:22:13.291 --> 02:22:14.930
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to run it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3396
02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:19.000
<v Speaker 3>let's stop electing rich celebrities to</v>
<v Speaker 3>run our country.</v>

3397
02:22:19.001 --> 02:22:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Tried it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work out so well.</v>

3398
02:22:21.010 --> 02:22:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or an oil</v>

3399
02:22:23.170 --> 02:22:24.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3400
02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:26.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe it worked out if in the mining</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry</v>

3401
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:28.710
<v Speaker 5>and then it's like just tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the idea of being like,</v>

3402
02:22:28.711 --> 02:22:30.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't think oprah should be our next</v>
<v Speaker 5>president is like,</v>

3403
02:22:30.421 --> 02:22:32.460
<v Speaker 5>well you're sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

3404
02:22:32.490 --> 02:22:33.810
<v Speaker 5>You're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No I'm not.</v>

3405
02:22:33.811 --> 02:22:36.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like we should be able to say we</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think certain people are</v>

3406
02:22:36.841 --> 02:22:39.210
<v Speaker 5>qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop yelling at me.</v>

3407
02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.400
<v Speaker 5>Do you read your comments on instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should I just stop and you never do so</v>

3408
02:22:43.530 --> 02:22:44.490
<v Speaker 5>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rarely.</v>

3409
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:46.770
<v Speaker 5>Very rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they'll look in and I'll see</v>

3410
02:22:46.771 --> 02:22:48.480
<v Speaker 5>someone that's a dick and I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 5>block them.</v>

3411
02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:51.710
<v Speaker 5>That's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I tried to like engage and like</v>

3412
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:55.200
<v Speaker 5>try to like see what's going on but the</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of shit or just too insane,</v>

3413
02:22:55.201 --> 02:22:57.300
<v Speaker 5>it's not worth that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just put out good things.</v>

3414
02:22:57.301 --> 02:22:59.550
<v Speaker 5>Try to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And is that a crazy person or is that a</v>

3415
02:22:59.551 --> 02:23:02.340
<v Speaker 5>person that masquerades as being sane</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then behind closed doors?</v>

3416
02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:03.630
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be both.</v>

3417
02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:04.980
<v Speaker 5>A mix of both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could be both.</v>

3418
02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:06.810
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you ever hear about that guy that</v>

3419
02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:10.950
<v Speaker 5>got fired from reddit and he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>awful shit on reddit and posting all</v>

3420
02:23:10.951 --> 02:23:15.050
<v Speaker 5>these terrible things and they found out</v>
<v Speaker 5>his personal identity and they uh,</v>

3421
02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:19.020
<v Speaker 5>went after him and then got him fired</v>
<v Speaker 5>from his job and it devastated his life.</v>

3422
02:23:19.021 --> 02:23:21.840
<v Speaker 5>I think I was married with kids and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>takes life completely fell apart.</v>

3423
02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:25.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People enjoy being a con anonymously.</v>

3424
02:23:25.711 --> 02:23:27.810
<v Speaker 5>They enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I found on</v>

3425
02:23:27.811 --> 02:23:29.520
<v Speaker 5>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone says something really</v>

3426
02:23:29.521 --> 02:23:31.110
<v Speaker 5>particularly heinous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd go to,</v>

3427
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:33.900
<v Speaker 5>their pays are almost always private.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're almost always have like a</v>

3428
02:23:33.901 --> 02:23:38.040
<v Speaker 5>blocked page because they're cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just a lot of like very deeply</v>

3429
02:23:38.041 --> 02:23:41.250
<v Speaker 5>unhappy people that will lash out at</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody that's in the public spotlight</v>

3430
02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.710
<v Speaker 5>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially a woman.</v>

3431
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Crazy question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a man this happened to someone I</v>

3432
02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:50.790
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a man is engaging with relationships</v>

3433
02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:55.200
<v Speaker 5>with other women on the Internet as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>character,</v>

3434
02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:57.060
<v Speaker 5>is it cheating?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3435
02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:59.860
<v Speaker 5>it's just he's picked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's having a character's.</v>

3436
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:03.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well who is he an artist is you're right</v>

3437
02:24:03.541 --> 02:24:05.380
<v Speaker 5>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3438
02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:07.110
<v Speaker 5>Didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3439
02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:11.140
<v Speaker 5>just sort of pretty adrenaline free job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:13.950
<v Speaker 5>He's probably fucking completely bored</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of his mind and it gives them a</v>

3441
02:24:13.951 --> 02:24:15.300
<v Speaker 5>chart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it like a video game?</v>

3442
02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:18.000
<v Speaker 5>Cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this feels kind of like a video game in</v>

3443
02:24:18.001 --> 02:24:19.440
<v Speaker 5>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a little bit of a way.</v>

3444
02:24:19.441 --> 02:24:20.790
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's role playing.</v>

3445
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a simulation.</v>

3446
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:24.600
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a little bit way it's just being</v>

3447
02:24:24.601 --> 02:24:25.490
<v Speaker 5>deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3448
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:28.110
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's fantasy wishes he was someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

3449
02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like is that if your wife has online as</v>

3450
02:24:32.251 --> 02:24:36.630
<v Speaker 5>a different person aging with men and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pictures of her own pussy,</v>

3451
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:39.760
<v Speaker 5>that's when it gets weird dicey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3452
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Pussy flying through the air.</v>

3453
02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:45.990
<v Speaker 5>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know who's here.</v>

3454
02:24:45.991 --> 02:24:49.960
<v Speaker 5>This is what's going to win flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if the same of flashlights,</v>

3455
02:24:50.050 --> 02:24:53.100
<v Speaker 5>it's going to go on robots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's going to win sex.</v>

3456
02:24:53.101 --> 02:24:54.300
<v Speaker 5>Robots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robots.</v>

3457
02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:57.120
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're closing in to your point about</v>

3458
02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:58.590
<v Speaker 5>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think that that also works a</v>

3459
02:24:58.591 --> 02:25:00.470
<v Speaker 5>muscle of to humanizing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

3460
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:03.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also changes your reward system.</v>

3461
02:25:03.121 --> 02:25:07.400
<v Speaker 5>Like instead of like learning to be an</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting charismatic person who's</v>

3462
02:25:07.410 --> 02:25:12.060
<v Speaker 5>caring and kind and reaping the rewards</v>
<v Speaker 5>of real relationships with people that</v>

3463
02:25:12.061 --> 02:25:15.840
<v Speaker 5>care about you and you care about them</v>
<v Speaker 5>and understanding real true love instead</v>

3464

<v Speaker 3>I don't like this one bit.</v>

3485
02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.860
<v Speaker 3>You posted that thing of that robot</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping</v>

3486
02:26:15.850 --> 02:26:17.500
<v Speaker 3>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many of them carry.</v>

3487
02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Was she that episode of Black Mirror</v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

3488
02:26:20.051 --> 02:26:23.080
<v Speaker 3>One metal head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new ones I haven't seen.</v>

3489
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:26.610
<v Speaker 3>The new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Season of black mirror is amazing.</v>

3490
02:26:26.611 --> 02:26:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Insane and one of the episodes has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>row,</v>

3491
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of robots that are going after</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and it's called metal head.</v>

3492
02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying because very realistic</v>

3493
02:26:36.970 --> 02:26:40.600
<v Speaker 3>and t incredibly realistic and probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>represents something that's going to</v>

3494
02:26:40.601 --> 02:26:42.640
<v Speaker 3>exist in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it's going with the other way.</v>

3495
02:26:42.641 --> 02:26:43.271
<v Speaker 3>I'm to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby,</v>

3496
02:26:43.271 --> 02:26:45.720
<v Speaker 3>can you just fuck the robot tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm tired.</v>

3497
02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:47.620
<v Speaker 3>That's when you know it's over eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two months.</v>

3498
02:26:47.621 --> 02:26:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Send them over to the robot that was on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your side.</v>

3499
02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Please don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't impel Milo's maybe.</v>

3500
02:26:53.151 --> 02:26:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll allow him to fuck a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the robot has to look exactly like</v>

3501
02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:02.320
<v Speaker 3>you have a spare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd get the robot.</v>

3502
02:27:02.321 --> 02:27:03.520
<v Speaker 3>We'd order it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would come in and be like,</v>

3503
02:27:03.521 --> 02:27:04.720
<v Speaker 3>is that what I look like?</v>

3504
02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:08.590
<v Speaker 3>And you'd put your hand up and just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mirror.</v>

3505
02:27:08.591 --> 02:27:12.170
<v Speaker 3>It would put its hand up and you'd both</v>
<v Speaker 3>like move perfectly in sync.</v>

3506
02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:16.060
<v Speaker 3>It was up to age with me though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have to age.</v>

3507
02:27:16.061 --> 02:27:18.550
<v Speaker 3>It would have to get older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I get older to have to get wrinkles</v>

3508
02:27:18.551 --> 02:27:22.150
<v Speaker 3>and gray hairs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to through the dirt look worse.</v>
