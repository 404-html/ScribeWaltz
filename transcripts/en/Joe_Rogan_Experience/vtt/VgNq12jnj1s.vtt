00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where ally,</v>

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>what's up buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kick you again.</v>

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Always a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

7
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>You to me are like this guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on this never ending project </v>

8
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>that occasionally you release these </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of these never ending projects,</v>

9
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but I look at your podcast has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>great work,</v>

10
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>this long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never ending like dramatic </v>

11
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so exciting and interesting.</v>

12
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>But when you were talking before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast about podcasting,</v>

13
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think of what you do as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything remotely like what I do.</v>

14
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do so many podcasts in my cabinet.</v>

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start it,</v>

16
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:49.521
<v Speaker 1>you start talking and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have like preparation and research </v>

17
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:55.131
<v Speaker 1>and you know when you're doing hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 1>history that's like a great work.</v>

18
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you're doing like this thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>evergreen,</v>

19
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:03.141
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be passed down forever </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bit torrent did the fuck out of </v>

20
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Danieli.</v>

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Bolelli had a great line to me cause you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

22
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>he does a history podcast now too and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>started off by doing just a,</v>

23
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my common sense kind of his,</v>

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and he said the difference with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history one is you actually have to,</v>

25
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>it has to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to make sense when you're done.</v>

26
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a huge.</v>

27
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean I sit there like forever and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up in my,</v>

28
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>my wife's never heard it by the way I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids don't understand why anybody </v>

29
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>would want to hear me talk and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

30
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I come out of the studio and </v>

31
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sweat pouring off me and I'm trying</v>

32
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll look at it and it doesn't</v>

33
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>mean you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear a mistake and you'll have to</v>

34
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>repair the mistake and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're just doing a,</v>

35
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>when I'm talking on the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and we make a mistake,</v>

36
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll say afterwards on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I got that wrong on the history one,</v>

37
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:49.041
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's forever and so you really have to </v>

38
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>dot your i's and cross your t's and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

39
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It makes it a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>When you do in common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially just sort of ranting </v>

41
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>about your thoughts on what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a pretty good description.</v>

42
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>When you do those and you release them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find out you made an error,</v>

44
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>that is a fucking pain in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

46
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

47
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I recently blamed one on concussions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain damage or something like that.</v>

48
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in reference to Hillary Clinton.</v>

49
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

50
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about that stuff they </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw out of airplanes to jam radars and</v>

52
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I called it flash and of course it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaff and all of course 10,000</v>

53
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>military people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>it's chaffed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

55
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>of course I know the chaff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have brought it up.</v>

56
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>It's brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make fun of people who are </v>

57
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

58
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the history show,</v>

59
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

60
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go recut that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Refixed it.</v>

61
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot more editing than I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

64
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

65
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>like I said like you have a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you also have this thing,</v>

66
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>the heart cast are killing me by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

67
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to at some point I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to just do like one podcast a year,</v>

68
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

69
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I am the slowest podcaster in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one claim to fame number one in </v>

70
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>time it takes to get a new show out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

71
00:02:55.891 --> 00:03:00.891
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with calling your </v>

72
00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:00.891
<v Speaker 1>thing a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an audio show.</v>

73
00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It is at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It evolved into that unintentionally.</v>

74
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.940
<v Speaker 1>But you have a podcast too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do getting longer,</v>

75
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>longer between Joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be like when I listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your podcasts,</v>

77
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>like the one on Martin Luther and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the name of that one?</v>

78
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>The prophets had to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that one you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about lutherism from you.</v>

80
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the history.</v>

81
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Right Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

82
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's happening with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that are like learning about </v>

83
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>certain aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of history from,</v>

84
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>from you and from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your stuff.</v>

85
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:36.181
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of responsibility if billy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense that you're spending </v>

86
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>as much time on them is what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is.</v>

87
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:43.231
<v Speaker 1>I think originally if you recall that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shows if you go listen to the old </v>

88
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:47.101
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't sound like the newer ones is </v>

89
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:49.291
<v Speaker 1>because I thought I was just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about funky stuff in history and </v>

90
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>then people wrote and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know the story.</v>

91
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:55.111
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell more of the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you inadvertently start telling </v>

92
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:55.111
<v Speaker 1>the story and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

93
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not qualified to tell the story.</v>

94
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And so it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

95
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

96
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting.</v>

97
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>The way it's evolved and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

98
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I warn people when they go and buy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old shows,</v>

100
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>the old shows aren't going to sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite the same because they were good by</v>

102
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>2007 podcasting standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the standards of what we all do are </v>

103
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>so much higher than when we started </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing them.</v>

104
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you grade this on a curve,</v>

105
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>go to itunes and look at the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's up there with you and compare it </v>

106
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>to the stuff that was up there 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

107
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I was competing with kids in dorm rooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago.</v>

108
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Now we're competing with NPR and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the pro outfits.</v>

109
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the sound quality for sure.</v>

110
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>But also like podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get better at doing it,</v>

111
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get better at the flow of the </v>

112
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

113
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 1>You get better at like being in tune </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the person that you're talking to </v>

114
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.161
<v Speaker 1>or at least attempting to like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something for people that are </v>

115
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:54.451
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you try to consider like how a </v>

116
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:56.611
<v Speaker 1>podcast is made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we're doing is </v>

117
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.431
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to express ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're also trying to monitor </v>

118
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.461
<v Speaker 1>ourselves at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you're not too overbearing or </v>

119
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes you have a point and you </v>

120
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

121
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 1>I gotTa make this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other person's talking,</v>

122
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:11.461
<v Speaker 1>you don't know when to jump in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to listen to the </v>

123
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:11.461
<v Speaker 1>person who's talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you forget your point and you're</v>

124
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

125
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

126
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird juggling act because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>both doing it.</v>

127
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Sort of free balling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both ad libbing,</v>

128
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>doing it live.</v>

129
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what's happening to me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ashamed to say it,</v>

130
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>but I was starting to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

131
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm 59,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned and I'm starting to get that.</v>

132
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>You forget the name or you forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I compare it to a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have more stuff in my computer,</v>

134
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but the computer is slower than it used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

135
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll have this point where I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be talking and everything will be going </v>

136
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>good and then all of a sudden there'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be this really long pause.</v>

137
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 1>What I can't think of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we have to just,</v>

138
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is a bed and he has to cut out </v>

139
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 1>and just eat a sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two pieces together.</v>

140
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:52.291
<v Speaker 1>While I tried to remember the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person I wanted to say or so I'm </v>

141
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:55.981
<v Speaker 1>getting to the point now where I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure I could go live anymore without </v>

142
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:58.801
<v Speaker 1>these really long pauses where I forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to say or I forget the </v>

143
00:05:58.801 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>point I was making or the tangent I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

144
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:04.661
<v Speaker 1>so 10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be very interesting </v>

145
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:04.661
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

146
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>It's also deals with the amount of hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive space you have.</v>

147
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I think if you told her remembering </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like there's things that I used </v>

148
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.991
<v Speaker 1>to know so well just 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago that I just have pushed </v>

149
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>aside because I haven't brought it up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

150
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone into that folder in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind in the tabs now.</v>

151
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I went to try to pull it out now </v>

152
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

153
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

154
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're our space on the warehouse floor </v>

155
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>is filled bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for that.</v>

156
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>And the bus isn't what it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>

157
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.880
<v Speaker 1>The Bas speed is not what it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to crank that up with this </v>

158
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so much healthier than I am.</v>

159
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is coffee.</v>

160
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>This is not how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of healthy,</v>

161
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just speed.</v>

162
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Where I come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee is health food.</v>

163
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon?</v>

164
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Oregon healthiest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

165
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a couple of people that </v>

166
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>aren't so healthy in Oregon just in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leading the charge.</v>

167
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you like living up there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific northwest?</v>

168
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from here and,</v>

169
00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:01.921
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and coming back home is weird because I </v>

170
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.851
<v Speaker 1>told my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife recently see my kids are </v>

171
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Oregonians and I haven't gotten used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fact.</v>

172
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.920
<v Speaker 1>It just seems weird to me and I told her</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still feel like this Angeleno up in </v>

173
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been there 20 years.</v>

174
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start feeling,</v>

175
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're from the east coast to </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

176
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like you're an Angeleno or </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you still think of yourself as a </v>

177
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.011
<v Speaker 1>transplant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been here for 22 years as long as </v>

178
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've been here forever.</v>

179
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like this is home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lived here more than I've lived </v>

180
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go home with home,</v>

181
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>when you go back to where you were from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it feel like coming home or does it</v>

182
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>feel foreign?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels weird.</v>

183
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to make me insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I used to go a look where my high </v>

184
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.581
<v Speaker 1>school was and I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would bring back the feelings of </v>

185
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 1>being in high school again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was.</v>

186
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.680
<v Speaker 1>When I graduated from high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have nightmares that I didn't </v>

187
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>graduate and I'd have to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty classic.</v>

188
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>The algebra class I forgot that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't drop or whatever.</v>

189
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

190
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I had to go back like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

191
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fucking have to drop out or </v>

192
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to go back to school </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the dread of the.</v>

193
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like the school was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

194
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:08.050
<v Speaker 1>It was really like the uncertainty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and life and the insecurity </v>

195
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

196
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the angst that teen angst of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 1>slowly realizing that we're not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly realizing but becoming an adult </v>

198
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.730
<v Speaker 1>and knowing that it's just a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>away that I'm going to be completely </v>

199
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>responsible for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm completely lost,</v>

200
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's is unbelievable pressure that</v>

201
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:28.960
<v Speaker 1>comes with going from being a teenager </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a time.</v>

202
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really mean to say unbelievable is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to compare to be like growing up</v>

203
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>a kid in Laos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>or you're living in fucking Somalia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of,</v>

205
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different crisis that are </v>

206
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.461
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really like the most privileged </v>

207
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:45.461
<v Speaker 1>angst possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Home.</v>

208
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Reasonably the same when you go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sea,</v>

209
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>because I come back here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my mom I was reading this.</v>

210
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading this book written by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember,</v>

211
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>William Buckley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous,</v>

213
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>

214
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 2>talk to his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book about,</v>

215
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad getting old and getting ready to</v>

216
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:06.561
<v Speaker 2>pass away and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at one point his dad who was in </v>

217
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:06.561
<v Speaker 2>Florida said he wanted to go home to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

218
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:11.481
<v Speaker 2>which I guess was Connecticut and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said dying in Florida was like contrary </v>

219
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 2>to nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we wanted to go home where everything</v>

220
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>was the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>

221
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.280
<v Speaker 2>if I went home to die home is anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like home was I drive to the places I'm </v>

222
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 2>from and it doesn't even know it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring a bell anymore.</v>

223
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>The place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I wanted to go home to die,</v>

224
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to have a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>because everything is so different to if</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fifth,</v>

226
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 2>for those who don't know Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like every 15 years,</v>

227
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.220
<v Speaker 2>bulldozes itself and rebuilds itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like three generations of La </v>

228
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 2>bulldozing from where my time was.</v>

229
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 2>And so I go up and down these streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a foreign city to me.</v>

230
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:47.781
<v Speaker 2>Now also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mass exodus of people is never </v>

231
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:47.781
<v Speaker 2>subsided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are in Oregon now.</v>

232
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Just so you don't mean we've got better </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants in better theater and </v>

233
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 2>everything because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>California's that go.</v>

234
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I first moved up there,</v>

235
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>if you had a California license plate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like an invitation to have your</v>

236
00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.750
<v Speaker 2>car get keyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

237
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the California's were not popular in </v>

238
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Colorado either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to school there,</v>

239
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 2>California Californians were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>

240
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Now I think probably x Californians are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the majority.</v>

241
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the case with boulder.</v>

242
00:10:10.121 --> 00:10:15.121
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was living in Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that a lot of people moved up </v>

243
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:15.121
<v Speaker 1>right after the earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in boulder to four years.</v>

244
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to school there.</v>

245
00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:18.970
<v Speaker 1>People will like check please soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground starts shaking boulder,</v>

246
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago,</v>

247
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there before the podcast for the </v>

248
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>podcast started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you like it?</v>

249
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I was only there for a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for four months.</v>

250
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>We planned on living there for a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe permanently.</v>

251
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.130
<v Speaker 1>But along the way my wife got pregnant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were at 8,500</v>

252
00:10:36.131 --> 00:10:38.060
<v Speaker 1>feet above sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

253
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just brutal.</v>

254
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>They say that Colorado in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like around the Denver area has a very </v>

255
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.441
<v Speaker 1>high rate of premature births.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And low birth weight because of the lack</v>

256
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:51.520
<v Speaker 1>of oxygen I would never have thought.</v>

257
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I would've thought you'd have your kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>born with like superhuman lungs be like </v>

258
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.461
<v Speaker 1>one of those Sherpas in Tibet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think if you live there and you </v>

259
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 1>grow up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like if you live there and grow</v>

260
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:06.361
<v Speaker 1>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking to an endurance </v>

261
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.461
<v Speaker 1>runner that lives there and he said it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes three years for the body to </v>

262
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:09.700
<v Speaker 1>completely acclimate where you get all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of training up there.</v>

263
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>But I have all the Olympic guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do the bicycling and everything up </v>

264
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of the altitude.</v>

265
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

266
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.341
<v Speaker 1>that's a big thing with any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic competition training that </v>

267
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 1>involves endurance training at altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference,</v>

268
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you lived there your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life,</v>

269
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.770
<v Speaker 1>your body's accustomed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're adapted to it.</v>

270
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's probably fine for your kids because</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a lot of people who have kids </v>

271
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.311
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if you were from sea </v>

272
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.400
<v Speaker 1>level like here and then you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a shock to your system.</v>

273
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Like you tried to go up a flight of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs and you're like,</v>

274
00:11:38.381 --> 00:11:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kinda remind you.</v>

275
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean for sure if you were at 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

276
00:11:42.941 --> 00:11:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tired and boulder.</v>

277
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:46.450
<v Speaker 1>You must've been out in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

278
00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>we're in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

279
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>85,</v>

280
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.200
<v Speaker 1>8,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet above sea level.</v>

281
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you work out there,</v>

282
00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:53.640
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

283
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

284
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

285
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're just standing around </v>

286
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems normal.</v>

287
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you and I were having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation up there,</v>

288
00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:06.581
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be any different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you had to walk up a flight of </v>

289
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:06.581
<v Speaker 1>stairs or climb a ladder or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

290
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:06.990
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

291
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I age 30 fucking years in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

292
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.980
<v Speaker 1>going back to my high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to my neighborhood where I </v>

293
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.281
<v Speaker 1>grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks pretty much the same so it </v>

294
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>hasn't really blown up.</v>

295
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>But I grew up in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper falls,</v>

296
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a small,</v>

297
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>like a suburb of Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a small place.</v>

298
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>It's always been small lets you go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

299
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:36.181
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I went back to the house where I </v>

300
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>grew up like about a year and a half ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty much the same.</v>

301
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm jealous because I go to these </v>

302
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.191
<v Speaker 1>websites that say you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the San Fernando Valley in the 19 </v>

303
00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 1>seventies and look at pictures and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like it looks now you have to go</v>

304
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 1>to Jerry's Deli and look at those old </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>

305
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:49.970
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have books actually had.</v>

306
00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 1>And this is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I get older,</v>

307
00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever cared about La history when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived here,</v>

308
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but now that I'm getting nostalgic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

309
00:12:55.061 --> 00:13:00.061
<v Speaker 1>I buy all these old books with pictures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Magic Mountain when I was a kid in </v>

310
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland when I was a kid.</v>

311
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating because this area </v>

312
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.400
<v Speaker 1>used to be ranches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

313
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And horse country and having.</v>

314
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I took my wife back to my high </v>

315
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>school recently and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my high school's turned into like,</v>

316
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you know the Beverly Hills high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when it's like.</v>

317
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And so she looks at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

318
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:15.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see how you were raised,</v>

319
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

320
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>it's melt like manure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all dirt roads.</v>

321
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It was really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that for me.</v>

322
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 1>So she doesn't believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>The pictures at Jerry's Deli on Ventura </v>
<v Speaker 1>up here,</v>

324
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they have these pictures from the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 hundreds of these big giant high </v>

325
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>resolution photos and it's like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields and stuff.</v>

326
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Rolling Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at an a timelapse just </v>

327
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.230
<v Speaker 1>watch it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it all build.</v>

328
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

329
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 1>what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's got this view of the entire </v>

330
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.661
<v Speaker 1>valley and you look at it and it's full </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see those pictures from Jerry's </v>

331
00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Deli and it's empty and it basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

332
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 1>70 years or something.</v>

333
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It's full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole country,</v>

335
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>if you really stop and think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to people about that a</v>

336
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:58.150
<v Speaker 1>lot lately because we've been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing how bizarre this,</v>

337
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:03.151
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>election has been and how recent this </v>

338
00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:06.631
<v Speaker 1>country has existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How recent is recently this country was </v>

339
00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:06.631
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

340
00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:11.431
<v Speaker 1>when you think about 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76 and you think about the rest of the </v>

341
00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is an insanely new country.</v>

342
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the west.</v>

343
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.640
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife's grandfather died recently.</v>

344
00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:21.641
<v Speaker 1>He was 94 and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you realize that two of your </v>

345
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:24.931
<v Speaker 1>grandfather's lifespans and there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>non natives here on the west coast.</v>

346
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>That's too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lifetime.</v>

347
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>

348
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that way.</v>

349
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:37.110
<v Speaker 1>How quick this gigantic thing it took </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>

350
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should correct the.</v>

351
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already heard it.</v>

352
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:44.371
<v Speaker 1>Hardcore history error in that comment I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should say in the Pacific northwest </v>

353
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:44.371
<v Speaker 1>because they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

354
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were Spanish missions.</v>

355
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>And see that's how you get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

356
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.280
<v Speaker 1>We go three generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three generations now.</v>

357
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish were here a long time ago,</v>

358
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but up in the Pacific northwest,</v>

359
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

360
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's funny,</v>

361
00:14:55.851 --> 00:15:00.851
<v Speaker 2>you can tell where the tide of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Spanish conquest sort of broke </v>

362
00:15:00.851 --> 00:15:01.200
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

363
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you stop getting those Hispanic names </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all the communities and all of a </v>

364
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 2>sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to Lahabra?</v>

365
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.891
<v Speaker 2>What happened to all those wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish names and you're no longer in </v>

366
00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:15.011
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're in Russia actually owned a </v>

367
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:15.011
<v Speaker 2>little bit of that territory once upon a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

368
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:17.600
<v Speaker 2>but now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's a native American name or,</v>

369
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 2>or some name from some really early </v>
<v Speaker 2>settler or pioneer or something like </v>

370
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about how recently </v>

371
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 2>slavery existed in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

372
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

373
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 2>65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think about 18,</v>

374
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 2>65 to 2016 is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

375
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:34.080
<v Speaker 2>and then let's remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

376
00:15:34.081 --> 00:15:39.081
<v Speaker 2>you still had the Jim crow laws and </v>
<v Speaker 2>segregation up until you and I were </v>

377
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:39.081
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

378
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:43.180
<v Speaker 2>My mom did a film in Florida in 1972 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about the apologies to </v>

379
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 2>floridians out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the civilized part of Florida,</v>

380
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.120
<v Speaker 2>we were in the swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a place called Weeki wachee if </v>

381
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you've ever been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big draw is they have a live mermaid</v>

382
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>show that they try to get you to slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>down for enough to eat at the local cafe</v>

383
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're in Weeki wachee Florida.</v>

384
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:05.081
<v Speaker 2>We took a picture when we left and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole hotel staff was out there and it </v>

385
00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 2>looks like something out of a time more </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you realize you're like three or</v>

386
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 2>five years of segregation has been gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that long.</v>

387
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:16.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how recent this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I realized the more I talk to </v>

388
00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:19.511
<v Speaker 2>young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even being 50 sounds like a long time </v>

389
00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:19.511
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you and I were kids,</v>

390
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.580
<v Speaker 2>that was the tail end of the time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a black person in certain </v>

391
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 2>states in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't stay in a bunch of hotels.</v>

392
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

393
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really recent.</v>

394
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really recent.</v>

395
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this cop on my from Baltimore,</v>

396
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Michael Wood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was telling me about the laws </v>

397
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 2>that they had in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had a systematic,</v>

398
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.220
<v Speaker 2>they really had racism that was so a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the city that you couldn't sell </v>

399
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:52.271
<v Speaker 2>houses in certain areas to Bach people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank Robinson tells a story about being</v>

400
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 2>with the Baltimore Orioles and he says </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got traded from the Cincinnati reds,</v>

401
00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.440
<v Speaker 2>the Baltimore Orioles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his wife was able to find a house </v>

402
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.671
<v Speaker 2>really quickly until they realized it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't Brooks Robinson's wife who's a </v>

403
00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 2>white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Frank Robinson's wife.</v>

404
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden the house </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared right off,</v>

405
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two seconds later.</v>

406
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:10.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's almost a,</v>

407
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:15.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to say about that </v>

408
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:15.340
<v Speaker 2>because there's two kinds of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the kind where the government is</v>

409
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:15.560
<v Speaker 2>involved in the states involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

410
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:17.480
<v Speaker 2>system institutionalized.</v>

411
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.840
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a white home buyer whose neighbors,</v>

412
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:25.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was an all in the </v>

413
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:27.621
<v Speaker 2>family episode where Archie bunker or </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the neighbors was going to sell </v>

414
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 2>to a black family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the other white neighbors </v>

415
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.861
<v Speaker 2>freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's not really like </v>

416
00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:34.751
<v Speaker 2>government racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like good old fashioned one to </v>

417
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:34.751
<v Speaker 2>one racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

418
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Well they used to do this thing called </v>
<v Speaker 2>blockbusting and it happened with my </v>

419
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:38.540
<v Speaker 2>grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather lived in Newark,</v>

420
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these realtors would go door to door</v>

421
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:47.921
<v Speaker 2>and literally tell the homeowners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people are moving into the </v>

422
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:51.071
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sell your home and the </v>

423
00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:51.071
<v Speaker 2>property values are going crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

424
00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just started selling like crazy.</v>

425
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather was like,</v>

426
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I like black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck off my lawn.</v>

427
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.720
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

428
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 3>they left in the neighborhood changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First it became black,</v>

429
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.260
<v Speaker 3>then it became Puerto Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then before my grandfather died it </v>

430
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 3>had been like a weird mixture of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnicities,</v>

431
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Dominicans and different people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>different environments.</v>

432
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 3>But it was a really fascinating place to</v>
<v Speaker 3>live because there was extreme,</v>

433
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 3>there was poverty and then there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of crime and stuff.</v>

434
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Like the next door neighbor when my </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandfather lived there is a kid who was</v>

435
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:29.970
<v Speaker 3>selling crack and they battering rammed </v>
<v Speaker 3>his front door.</v>

436
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 3>He had it all reinforced everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had An audi in the driveway,</v>

437
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 3>like the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just selling drugs and they,</v>

438
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke down as doorway and arrested.</v>

439
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 3>I've never thought it was a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatic moment,</v>

440
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of it was like when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at like a bad neighborhood,</v>

441
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you go down the street and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a war zone.</v>

442
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Guns are going off and people getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>stabbed for the most part.</v>

443
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.770
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty friendly and lively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just when you're dealing with poor </v>

444
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 3>people in a crime ridden neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

445
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.640
<v Speaker 3>it's just gonna happen more often than </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to happen in a place that's </v>

446
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 3>really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most of the time when you go outside</v>

447
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.180
<v Speaker 3>it would be people playing music and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was kids playing in the street and</v>

448
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 3>it was people hanging out in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>steps.</v>

449
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 3>It was really interesting to watch like </v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

450
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the time I was a little kid </v>

451
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 3>remembering his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

452
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.271
<v Speaker 3>his neighborhood to what it was before </v>
<v Speaker 3>he died and it had just kept shifting </v>

453
00:19:20.271 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 3>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're new,</v>

454
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 3>new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a lower income,</v>

455
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.960
<v Speaker 3>disenfranchised groups would move into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the area.</v>

456
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this I'm sure already,</v>

457
00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:34.601
<v Speaker 2>but for the listeners state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole theory on how if you </v>

458
00:19:34.601 --> 00:19:34.850
<v Speaker 2>look at boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

459
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the wave of immigrants most recent </v>

460
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.330
<v Speaker 2>was because boxing became a way for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to get out of the ghetto.</v>

461
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.920
<v Speaker 2>And so if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

462
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.490
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds up into the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 twenties and thirties,</v>

463
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:51.491
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of Jewish boxers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their parents had come over on </v>

464
00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:53.720
<v Speaker 2>the boat and they were first generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian boxers during the same period.</v>

465
00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Irish boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

466
00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:00.290
<v Speaker 2>and then you move to areas where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean poor African Americans have </v>

467
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:00.620
<v Speaker 2>always been in boxing for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because for the same reason,</v>

468
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

469
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I saw a whole article once on America's </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration story as told through </v>

470
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:12.431
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would suggest that by the time </v>

471
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:15.370
<v Speaker 2>the next generation came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time the parents had done </v>

472
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:15.370
<v Speaker 2>well enough so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.280
<v Speaker 2>the kids didn't have to go into boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

474
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.260
<v Speaker 2>But it was an interesting story that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the article was entitled </v>

476
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.451
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you see any great Jewish </v>

477
00:20:25.451 --> 00:20:27.191
<v Speaker 2>boxers anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it went down the whole list and I </v>

478
00:20:27.191 --> 00:20:27.191
<v Speaker 2>didn't know there were Jewish boxers </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first.</v>

479
00:20:27.191 --> 00:20:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benny Leonard.</v>

480
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.440
<v Speaker 2>There a lot of Jewish maxie Rosenbloom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them.</v>

481
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

482
00:20:31.181 --> 00:20:32.950
<v Speaker 3>there was a ton of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the early days.</v>

483
00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:37.951
<v Speaker 3>But it's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always the immigrants first </v>

484
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:37.951
<v Speaker 3>generation people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

485
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we've seen a lot now is Russians.</v>

486
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same system though,</v>

487
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:41.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

488
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:46.490
<v Speaker 2>you have newcomers who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make their way into the system and </v>

489
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.490
<v Speaker 2>boxing is the best thing they bring to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the table.</v>

490
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also that you,</v>

491
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 2>growing</v>

492
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>up in these really hard environments </v>
<v Speaker 1>were fisticuffs are much more common and</v>

493
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.800
<v Speaker 1>people seek to train themselves to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to fight because they're dealing </v>

494
00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.830
<v Speaker 1>with conflict all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely right.</v>

495
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a lot of the kids in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

496
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

497
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 1>no bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:08.491
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity and these kids are growing up </v>

499
00:21:08.491 --> 00:21:08.491
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:21:08.491 --> 00:21:11.490
<v Speaker 1>they just no desire for the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class white kid to go into </v>

501
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just no desire.</v>

502
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Those of us who've tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried it once just for the fun of it </v>

503
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and that was enough to kick me out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

504
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:24.421
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't look so fun anymore after I came </v>

505
00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:24.421
<v Speaker 1>home with a black eye and I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just one day at practice.</v>

506
00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who do it for a living </v>

507
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that's everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you only try.</v>

508
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You try it for one day.</v>

509
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

510
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

511
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.340
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy to say now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a huge fan of boxing </v>

512
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.831
<v Speaker 1>because I grew up in an era where it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great errors in boxing </v>

513
00:21:37.831 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 1>history and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think long enough that you want to,</v>

514
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.680
<v Speaker 1>you want to see what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had a buddy that I worked with,</v>

515
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.040
<v Speaker 1>he was the one who showed up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>black guy after the weekend was over and</v>

516
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:45.780
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take him,</v>

517
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll fool around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I learned that I didn't </v>

518
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 1>know is how much some of these guys just</v>
<v Speaker 1>love it because you think who would like</v>

519
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:56.371
<v Speaker 1>getting hit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I met one of these guys and he was </v>

520
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:56.371
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand the sport,</v>

521
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 1>you just don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but season he's put some gloves on.</v>

522
00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>We'll go in there.</v>

523
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Well that's when you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 1>especially I have a soft face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

525
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that guy's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how you're supposed to teach </v>

526
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.031
<v Speaker 1>somebody about boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to even think about </v>

527
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:09.031
<v Speaker 1>sparring for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

528
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I think he was going to show me a lesson</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these gonna Cheat on you.</v>

529
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.490
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

530
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy of mine do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

531
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 1>They know how to quite already and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put gloves on.</v>

532
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 1>You beat the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was waiting with one punch,</v>

533
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:23.761
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not make it more one that I </v>

534
00:22:23.761 --> 00:22:23.761
<v Speaker 1>learned my lesson pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a smart guy.</v>

535
00:22:23.761 --> 00:22:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Joe took one punch and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

536
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.150
<v Speaker 1>got through my defense with the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and that was it.</v>

537
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn stuff.</v>

538
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.040
<v Speaker 1>This is like boxing the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really should be taught to someone.</v>

539
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.040
<v Speaker 1>If you really want someone to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should teach them the proper </v>

540
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.621
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals on how to move their body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you slowly teach them how to </v>

541
00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:44.761
<v Speaker 1>slowly hit things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about protective head gear for the </v>

542
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:44.761
<v Speaker 1>new guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about that?</v>

543
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:46.050
<v Speaker 1>That protective headgear does less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>

544
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I know I've read that actually there </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

545
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 1>they're also removing it from Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

546
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

547
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I had mentioned to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they used to have boxing in the </v>

548
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they even just show it anymore?</v>

549
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Did they show it because I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

550
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't see it as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so big when I was a kid.</v>

551
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what they decide to put on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they decide.</v>

552
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be based on ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

553
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Because like archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see archery for like 30 seconds.</v>

554
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arrow flew through the air next.</v>

555
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then gymnastics is always a big one.</v>

556
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:18.001
<v Speaker 1>People have watched people flip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my wife there was this </v>

557
00:23:18.001 --> 00:23:18.600
<v Speaker 1>competition called a biathlon will you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ski and shoot?</v>

558
00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making that up.</v>

559
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

560
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it's really an Olympic sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a weird sport.</v>

561
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:28.771
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a strange combination with those </v>

562
00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:28.771
<v Speaker 1>scandinavians just kick everybody's rear</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

563
00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're all out there skiing and</v>

564
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

565
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.760
<v Speaker 1>It's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of moose in that area.</v>

566
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:39.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Olympics are strange in what is a </v>

567
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.901
<v Speaker 1>metal and what is not like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ballroom dancing is an Olympic </v>

568
00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:44.680
<v Speaker 1>synchronized swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an Olympics.</v>

569
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not denigrating anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a professional synchronized </v>

570
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.710
<v Speaker 1>swimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

571
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

572
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Please do a lot like curling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen that one?</v>

573
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>

574
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that was what they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>on like cruises for old people,</v>

575
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>shuffleboard.</v>

576
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It's very close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no brooms involved in.</v>

577
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Shuffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does no brooms and know what's curling.</v>

578
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to drink the other guy out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way.</v>

579
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to knock your.</v>

580
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never quite mastered the.</v>

581
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I was in Newfoundland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to say it now because people </v>

582
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:16.690
<v Speaker 1>got mad at me because I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

583
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.200
<v Speaker 1>we're calling new found blend that gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>its newfoundland.</v>

584
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 1>They're probably correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct me again.</v>

585
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably fucking it up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to try,</v>

586
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 1>but I was making fun of curling and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>went crazy.</v>

587
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 1>They were so upset at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

588
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:30.731
<v Speaker 1>come on folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are not people to get get mad at </v>

589
00:24:30.731 --> 00:24:30.731
<v Speaker 1>you either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hardy.</v>

590
00:24:30.731 --> 00:24:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Say it's very cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Different kinds of different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

592
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 1>but what I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do to decide like what goes</v>

593
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:39.490
<v Speaker 1>on the air?</v>

594
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It must just be based on popularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

595
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.430
<v Speaker 1>The Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>

596
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:48.431
<v Speaker 1>if I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm the network executive deciding </v>

597
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:48.431
<v Speaker 1>what goes on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm going to base it on.</v>

598
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Did you see all those videos of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting robbed that were just walking </v>

599
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>down the street and Rio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio?</v>

600
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I go to a website sometimes when I'm</v>

601
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>bored and have nothing better to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>

602
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that people upload,</v>

603
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to blow your mind and say wow,</v>

604
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:04.250
<v Speaker 1>that and half of them are from Brazil </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>

605
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're always terrible.</v>

606
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 1>You just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's giving me a,</v>

607
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:12.851
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unusually wrong version of what </v>

608
00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:12.851
<v Speaker 1>Brazil is light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they said the Olympics,</v>

609
00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

610
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 1>do you know half the videos on this site</v>
<v Speaker 1>or from Rio?</v>

611
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

612
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does have a history of violence,</v>

613
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:24.101
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange place and that's kind of </v>

614
00:25:24.101 --> 00:25:26.321
<v Speaker 1>the reverse of la in that La you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you essentially have the expensive homes</v>

615
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:31.160
<v Speaker 1>in the hills and then the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the less expensive homes are on the</v>

616
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:33.350
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Rio it's the opposite.</v>

617
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.170
<v Speaker 1>The people on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like near the ocean,</v>

618
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:40.520
<v Speaker 1>it's the really expensive homes and up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hills with this amazing views are</v>

619
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 1>all the favelas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all these houses that don't have</v>

620
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:47.891
<v Speaker 1>any windows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have dirt floors and </v>

621
00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:51.160
<v Speaker 1>there's like extreme extreme poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some of these communities they </v>

622
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.641
<v Speaker 1>can't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police can't even go into right </v>

623
00:25:54.641 --> 00:25:54.641
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really hardcore.</v>

624
00:25:54.641 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see city of God the movie?</v>

625
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw the preview.</v>

626
00:25:57.741 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Does that count?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does not count,</v>

627
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes Boyz in the hood look like Mary</v>

628
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:05.960
<v Speaker 1>poppins and it's based on life in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>favela is like really,</v>

629
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 1>really based on it.</v>

630
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Like these kinds of actual scenarios </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do take place where young kids </v>

631
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.620
<v Speaker 1>with guns form gangs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

632
00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:17.000
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like 10 year old kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't.</v>

633
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:22.001
<v Speaker 1>That almost seemed to be like a law of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature though because you do see it </v>

634
00:26:22.001 --> 00:26:25.211
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to the poor countries or </v>

635
00:26:25.211 --> 00:26:25.211
<v Speaker 1>poor parts of the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

636
00:26:25.211 --> 00:26:29.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about how the poor </v>

637
00:26:29.591 --> 00:26:31.241
<v Speaker 1>communities are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty much like the nicer </v>

638
00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 1>communities in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to go down to compton all</v>

639
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 1>the time when I worked in news down here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Compton in the daytime.</v>

640
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It looks just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are trying to keep their lawns </v>

641
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.781
<v Speaker 1>mowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out there working on their </v>

642
00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:43.781
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything.</v>

643
00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's when darkness falls that things can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little weird on certain street </v>

644
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 1>corners and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.</v>

645
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember going down,</v>

646
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:48.560
<v Speaker 1>they just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

647
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody here is really trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

648
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really keeping up their homes </v>

649
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.030
<v Speaker 1>and trying to make everything nice.</v>

650
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at nighttime they're just victims.</v>

651
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

652
00:26:57.151 --> 00:27:02.151
<v Speaker 1>they shut their doors and close their </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows and try to stay out of what's </v>

653
00:27:02.151 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 1>going on outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is weird that it's night,</v>

654
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.180
<v Speaker 1>like there's something happens to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's not as much people that </v>

655
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.930
<v Speaker 1>sleep all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be one of those people once </v>

656
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 1>upon a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but compton,</v>

657
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 1>like if you looked at a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

658
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>like how many people are getting by and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people are fucking it up,</v>

659
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a great neighborhood.</v>

660
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like 100 people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>by and one guy's fucking it up.</v>

661
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>You like one issue out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in compton it might be three and </v>

662
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.771
<v Speaker 1>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough to give the whole </v>

663
00:27:33.771 --> 00:27:33.771
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

664
00:27:33.771 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take very many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

665
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine has a gym in Compton </v>

666
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:39.320
<v Speaker 1>and I was telling we were headed there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

667
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Compton.</v>

668
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.510
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy I was going with like,</v>

669
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to compton.</v>

670
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking wrong.</v>

671
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just go there.</v>

672
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.210
<v Speaker 1>What does this compton cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just googled compton in his story.</v>

673
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:56.211
<v Speaker 1>Just came up from yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the fuck is this the guys that </v>

674
00:27:56.211 --> 00:27:57.930
<v Speaker 1>ride horses through Compton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's even legal.</v>

675
00:27:57.931 --> 00:27:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you could do that in la </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

676
00:27:59.621 --> 00:28:04.621
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in New York they have to have a </v>

677
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:04.621
<v Speaker 1>device that hooks up to the horse so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

678
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have manure on the streets.</v>

679
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:10.551
<v Speaker 1>How did they get around that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is lyrice cowboys roping and </v>

680
00:28:10.551 --> 00:28:13.611
<v Speaker 1>riding right in the heart of Compton </v>
<v Speaker 1>have found their hobby contains some of </v>

681
00:28:13.611 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a regular nine to five job,</v>

682
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:19.700
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hossley said good for him.</v>

683
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm in favor of that.</v>

684
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.250
<v Speaker 1>But you're not a cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep the horse.</v>

685
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cows.</v>

686
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You're a horse boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

687
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 1>You're in a horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a backyard horse?</v>

688
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we beat that.</v>

689
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.130
<v Speaker 1>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

690
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:37.131
<v Speaker 1>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that like I've seen them </v>

691
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:37.131
<v Speaker 1>in Burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burbank.</v>

692
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:40.290
<v Speaker 1>There's sections of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where NBC is.</v>

693
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno tonight show the sections of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that are at question.</v>

694
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:49.010
<v Speaker 1>So you're allowed to have a stable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your yard and people will just ride </v>

695
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.740
<v Speaker 1>horses down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it all the time.</v>

696
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:55.130
<v Speaker 1>They used to have a place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickwick stables right outside of </v>

697
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Burbank that was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 1>They used to have the equestrian center </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there when I was a kid 50 years ago</v>

699
00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:58.290
<v Speaker 1>or whenever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

700
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Horse Horse riding makes you a cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd not accounting less cows are </v>

701
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.350
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

702
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that the Rogan standard on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think that's a fact.</v>

703
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's the fact that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower,</v>

704
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>will you call them cowboys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they would chase cow.</v>

705
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 1>They would herd them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

706
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with you.</v>

707
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have the expertise to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete on that subject.</v>

708
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.610
<v Speaker 1>They have the competition policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does is they have an actual ranch </v>

709
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:23.650
<v Speaker 1>called richland farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking at it up,</v>

710
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>try to find out like more pictures or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it really looks like,</v>

711
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

712
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

713
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they had enough open </v>
<v Speaker 1>property out there to look at that.</v>

714
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

715
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 1>So they have chickens and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressed and these guys are doing </v>

716
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 1>little things with their horses where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're running them through routine for</v>

717
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

718
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

719
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>

720
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.160
<v Speaker 1>when people find open spaces and spaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are vacant and they start </v>

721
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.331
<v Speaker 1>reclaiming them and occasionally good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things come out of that and you know </v>

722
00:29:54.331 --> 00:29:57.511
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of cities in the United </v>

723
00:29:57.511 --> 00:29:58.410
<v Speaker 1>States and in Europe and stuff that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had built giant open spaces,</v>

724
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a central park in New York </v>

725
00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:03.420
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>

726
00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It changes the whole feel of these urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>centers don't have to have big open </v>

727
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 1>pieces of territory in the midst of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>urban sprawl.</v>

728
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what they'd done,</v>

729
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:12.370
<v Speaker 1>got more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>La needs more of that.</v>

730
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it keeps it from growing.</v>

731
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the really smart things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boulder's Don's,</v>

732
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>they buy up all the open space when lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>are available all around boulder.</v>

733
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:25.981
<v Speaker 1>They just buy it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city buys it up and they just </v>

734
00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:26.650
<v Speaker 1>prevent people from building on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it costs like $9,000</v>

735
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:28.720
<v Speaker 1>a month to have an apartment in boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

736
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it's super expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

737
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately it's probably a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

738
00:30:33.071 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

739
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it from your own living purposes.</v>

740
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that's what I want.</v>

741
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I look in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can park anywhere.</v>

742
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I tell Angelenos that near that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the only people,</v>

743
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.380
<v Speaker 1>New Yorkers and Angelenos understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say I can park anywhere dude.</v>

744
00:30:46.381 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 1>And they just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

745
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy Steve moved from New York.</v>

746
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>He was living in Brooklyn and he moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Seattle and he was like,</v>

747
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I should have been here a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh totally.</v>

748
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.870
<v Speaker 1>He's like fucking traffics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

749
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:04.050
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are complaining but they don't </v>

750
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 1>know like it takes 10 minutes more to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get where you're going.</v>

751
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 1>That's it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

752
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:11.071
<v Speaker 1>nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the old days if you and I </v>

753
00:31:11.071 --> 00:31:11.071
<v Speaker 1>wanted to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to live where the work was now.</v>

754
00:31:11.071 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the actors don't live here </v>
<v Speaker 1>much anymore,</v>

755
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Well Open space I think is a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart thing because people left their </v>

757
00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 1>own devices will really fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

758
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 1>They'll just build on top of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stack things up and stuff.</v>

759
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 1>People in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

760
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.170
<v Speaker 1>the views gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gone,</v>

761
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.830
<v Speaker 1>chicken ranch next to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that this country</v>

762
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:35.350
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting is public land,</v>

763
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.500
<v Speaker 1>these gigantic national parks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone,</v>

764
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 1>all these different places that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to.</v>

765
00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Mostly in the West though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 1>that was a win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sage brush rebellion type thing </v>

767
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 1>happened up in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

768
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The one area where they're still having </v>
<v Speaker 1>trials about and everything that the </v>

769
00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.250
<v Speaker 1>were they see 20 years ago I would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered their names right off the </v>

770
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.951
<v Speaker 1>bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a wilderness thing up in </v>

771
00:31:58.951 --> 00:31:58.951
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had that whole thing.</v>

772
00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their complaint was that the federal </v>

773
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.621
<v Speaker 1>government doesn't have big tracks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>land in the eastern part of the country </v>

774
00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:07.831
<v Speaker 1>where things started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reverted that land back to the </v>

775
00:32:07.831 --> 00:32:10.591
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had these huge swaths of land </v>

776
00:32:10.591 --> 00:32:12.781
<v Speaker 1>in the West because it was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different government by the time they </v>

777
00:32:12.781 --> 00:32:12.781
<v Speaker 1>were out here in the west.</v>

778
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kinda thankful they do because if </v>

779
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be here anymore.</v>

780
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way I look at it and just be </v>

781
00:32:21.751 --> 00:32:21.751
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

782
00:32:21.751 --> 00:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Most likely that that whole land thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was really confusing for people.</v>

783
00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:26.580
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell is going on because if you.</v>

784
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Unless you really dive into the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to find out who's angry at who </v>

785
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.731
<v Speaker 1>and why is the government moving in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people and what's what's </v>

786
00:32:35.731 --> 00:32:36.670
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a few of these sort of</v>

787
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 1>rancher type disputes with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

788
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Remember there was one in Nevada as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

789
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I actually can speak to this a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit because what I was a talk radio host</v>

790
00:32:44.321 --> 00:32:49.321
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people were actually a large part </v>

791
00:32:49.321 --> 00:32:52.081
<v Speaker 2>of any talk radio show audience and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were a little different back in the day </v>

792
00:32:52.081 --> 00:32:54.040
<v Speaker 2>of say the Clinton administration in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mid 19 nineties,</v>

793
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:56.020
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the modern movement kind of grew out</v>

794
00:32:56.021 --> 00:33:01.021
<v Speaker 2>of that and if you understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of those people in those small </v>

795
00:33:01.021 --> 00:33:04.411
<v Speaker 2>towns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people essentially made a living </v>

796
00:33:04.411 --> 00:33:07.951
<v Speaker 2>in resource extraction so they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the big factories that they had </v>

797
00:33:07.951 --> 00:33:11.371
<v Speaker 2>back east and Detroit and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They logged or they mind or they did </v>

798
00:33:11.371 --> 00:33:13.300
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things and so when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government will decide,</v>

799
00:33:13.301 --> 00:33:16.060
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a problem with the spotted owl,</v>

800
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.950
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to cut back on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>logging.</v>

801
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:23.430
<v Speaker 2>The people in places like Portland where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got a software job or </v>

802
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.430
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they they're like,</v>

803
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.530
<v Speaker 2>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wonderful thing,</v>

804
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.430
<v Speaker 2>but those devastated some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities and you know,</v>

805
00:33:27.431 --> 00:33:32.431
<v Speaker 2>it's everything from the schools in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas not getting a lot of tax </v>

806
00:33:32.431 --> 00:33:33.130
<v Speaker 2>dollars anymore or the problem they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Oregon.</v>

807
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of those small </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

808
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.240
<v Speaker 2>All the young people are gone because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no jobs.</v>

809
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 2>So the old people who have homes stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no jobs because everybody was in</v>

810
00:33:41.231 --> 00:33:46.231
<v Speaker 2>logging and they get very resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they wanted the public land </v>

811
00:33:46.231 --> 00:33:50.371
<v Speaker 2>turned over to private people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hoping the private people </v>

812
00:33:50.371 --> 00:33:50.740
<v Speaker 2>would start off the meals again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people could work.</v>

813
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:56.070
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like the media really didn't </v>

814
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.800
<v Speaker 2>really didn't look at that side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

815
00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.780
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying these people are right or</v>

816
00:33:58.781 --> 00:34:03.781
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but understand that this wasn't a </v>

817
00:34:03.781 --> 00:34:03.781
<v Speaker 2>question of the government's got to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of our net.</v>

818
00:34:03.781 --> 00:34:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It was jobs and I think we can all </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand jobs.</v>

819
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on in Oregon was cattle,</v>

820
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 3>ranchers and public land and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>decrease.</v>

821
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today's.</v>

822
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to pay for public land.</v>

823
00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I had ever ventured into public </v>

824
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:23.501
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand the whole cattle </v>

825
00:34:23.501 --> 00:34:25.871
<v Speaker 3>grazing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I was in the first time I was </v>

826
00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:25.871
<v Speaker 3>in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went,</v>

827
00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took a float down the Missouri River.</v>

828
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 3>We went down to where the Missouri </v>
<v Speaker 3>Breaks and Montana's beautiful.</v>

829
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

830
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these cows everywhere.</v>

831
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

832
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:37.610
<v Speaker 3>this is public land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

833
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:43.060
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve had a sort of explained </v>

834
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.491
<v Speaker 3>to me how they kind of leased the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let cows graze this land and they </v>

835
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:48.040
<v Speaker 3>do it at this riddick.</v>

836
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made a lot of these laws in the </v>

837
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:53.890
<v Speaker 2>late 18 hundreds of safety with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mining ones in the claims to that.</v>

838
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.800
<v Speaker 2>So they have updated a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

839
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:56.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

840
00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.280
<v Speaker 3>but then Nevada guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or excuse me,</v>

841
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.060
<v Speaker 3>the Oregon guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to pay.</v>

842
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 3>That was part of what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to pay their bill to </v>

843
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 3>least as far as experience</v>

844
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.980
<v Speaker 2>and there's different parties involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had these ranchers,</v>

845
00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:13.981
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to do that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of people in the community </v>

846
00:35:13.981 --> 00:35:14.560
<v Speaker 2>who were sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much to that part,</v>

847
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.920
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that the ranchers were mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same people that they were mad </v>

848
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:19.920
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

849
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.030
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why you hear a lot of people </v>

850
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.030
<v Speaker 2>speak in these things saying I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

851
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their side,</v>

852
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:29.580
<v Speaker 2>but we all generally have sympathy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we would like the federal </v>

853
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.931
<v Speaker 2>government to stop telling us how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>logs we can cut or those kinds of </v>

854
00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:34.180
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a traditional American thing.</v>

855
00:35:34.181 --> 00:35:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Get the government off my back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever</v>

856
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's points on both sides though,</v>

857
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh absolutely.</v>

858
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:46.521
<v Speaker 4>Because when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you look at some that's been </v>

859
00:35:46.521 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 4>clear cut and you see like how much it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>devastating.</v>

860
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:54.801
<v Speaker 4>It's devastating when you see a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>swath of land that used to be filled </v>

861
00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 4>with old growth trees and they replanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a single mono crop instead and use,</v>

862
00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:03.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they always call it like they want you </v>

863
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.190
<v Speaker 4>to think it's like growing tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 4>they always say this is a renewable crop</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yes and no.</v>

865
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like you said,</v>

866
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 4>the clear cuts are awful because you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>think to yourself,</v>

867
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.720
<v Speaker 4>couldn't you take like every fifth tree </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a lot of times private land owners </v>

868
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 4>will do a better job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not always.</v>

869
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they'll just think my kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to go to college.</v>

870
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:20.910
<v Speaker 4>It's time to just level everything on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this hill.</v>

871
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes though they're attitude is </v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

872
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 4>this is my view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I look out,</v>

873
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:30.741
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see a clear cut as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take every third or fourth tree </v>

874
00:36:30.741 --> 00:36:30.741
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it becomes like a,</v>

875
00:36:30.741 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 4>an extra bank account for some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

876
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's if your whole business is the </v>

877
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.951
<v Speaker 4>logging business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can imagine like we were up in the </v>

878
00:36:39.951 --> 00:36:40.800
<v Speaker 4>redwood forest recently and as we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving up there,</v>

879
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:45.801
<v Speaker 4>you pass these lumber yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was this one lumber yard where </v>

880
00:36:45.801 --> 00:36:48.540
<v Speaker 4>it's just massive logs and massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>amounts.</v>

881
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 4>They're just stacked up and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at like in terms of the number </v>

882
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.991
<v Speaker 4>of years of growth you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're looking at this huge lumber </v>

883
00:36:56.991 --> 00:36:59.400
<v Speaker 4>yard filled with trees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many years of growth is that?</v>

884
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.650
<v Speaker 4>How do you sustain it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

885
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean if this is how much you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

886
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 4>how do you make sure you have that much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>

887
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 4>20 years?</v>

888
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing right now is,</v>

889
00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:11.100
<v Speaker 4>is the Canadians are logging a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Russia,</v>

890
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Speaker 4>in the places like below the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

891
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.930
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a forest line in Siberia and </v>

892
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.261
<v Speaker 4>they're logging a lot there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's Kinda like gold that grows </v>

893
00:37:21.261 --> 00:37:25.101
<v Speaker 4>for those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in one sense you find it hard to </v>

894
00:37:25.101 --> 00:37:25.101
<v Speaker 4>tell them not to because I'm doing just </v>
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

895
00:37:25.101 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 4>but you can't log and make money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other hand,</v>

896
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all do kind of share this and so it's</v>

897
00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:34.611
<v Speaker 4>hard to figure out how to manage things </v>
<v Speaker 4>she does for the greater good as they </v>

898
00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:37.911
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the good point is that it's </v>

899
00:37:37.911 --> 00:37:37.911
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

900
00:37:37.911 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 4>it's no ones you could call it property,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it is,</v>

901
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:44.151
<v Speaker 4>is like we're all sharing the resources </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the earth and what's going on in the </v>

902
00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Amazon right now.</v>

903
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens when people move in and </v>

904
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.761
<v Speaker 4>farm for cattle is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments against factory farming and </v>

905
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 4>against supporting the meat industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>pollutes rivers and all that devastating</v>

906
00:37:57.421 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 4>deforestation to at a ridiculously high </v>
<v Speaker 4>rate.</v>

907
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:04.020
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of what's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's fueling the deforestation is they</v>

908
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:09.021
<v Speaker 4>chopped down all these trees so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can make gland for these cattle to </v>

909
00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:10.020
<v Speaker 4>graze on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can see by the way,</v>

910
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:11.470
<v Speaker 4>how much money is involved because some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

911
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.950
<v Speaker 4>in some of those countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that campaign,</v>

912
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times they're indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

913
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.470
<v Speaker 4>it gets violent and people die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I mean?</v>

914
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 4>That's how much money we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

915
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed.</v>

916
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:25.641
<v Speaker 4>They were killed some nun that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>protesting against the logging she got </v>

917
00:38:25.641 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 4>murdered recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that uncommon.</v>

918
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:27.890
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

919
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.240
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody kind of knows this is,</v>

920
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're taking.</v>

921
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty brave when you think about </v>

922
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.581
<v Speaker 4>what those people do because they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the threatening letters long before </v>

923
00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:37.581
<v Speaker 4>happens to them</v>

924
00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and then to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire people like that and whether or</v>

925
00:38:39.301 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 1>not I agree with a specific cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows if they're even getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>

927
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just might get bullets.</v>

928
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.670
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start making a massive,</v>

929
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:51.690
<v Speaker 1>making a lot of noise and making it </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic for the people that are </v>

930
00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 1>earning a shitload of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopping those trees down,</v>

931
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 1>things can get real ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get real nasty.</v>

932
00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I was in Mount Rainier and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I ever saw like real clear </v>

933
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 1>cut areas and that's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because it rains so much,</v>

934
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 1>you would think like it's a real fertile</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

935
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:10.681
<v Speaker 1>like whatever trees that they do have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was talking to one of the </v>

936
00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 1>guys was up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the cops that was um,</v>

937
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

938
00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 1>it was a forest ranger type character.</v>

939
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that they do it,</v>

940
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but it takes like 20 years for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things become trees again.</v>

941
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use different growth trees for </v>

942
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.220
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can grow the quick,</v>

943
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always hear from the guys who want to </v>

944
00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:30.961
<v Speaker 1>grow hemp and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

945
00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:30.961
<v Speaker 1>if they would just grow hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would make it.</v>

946
00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:33.280
<v Speaker 1>But it would make up for some uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old growth trees,</v>

947
00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 1>they'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go into some of these,</v>

948
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 1>there are some Oregon hotels for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

949
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:40.981
<v Speaker 1>they're all built with old growth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in there and you see what old </v>

950
00:39:40.981 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>growth can do and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

951
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 1>there are no other logs that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this with.</v>

952
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

953
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the band saws that they use to </v>

954
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:50.460
<v Speaker 1>cut that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

955
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole different level of tree.</v>

956
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.940
<v Speaker 1>But the replacement time periods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hundred and 50 years or something</v>

957
00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 1>for those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

958
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't really think about it.</v>

959
00:39:58.241 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It's totally unsustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right,</v>

960
00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it looks nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a company called urban hardwoods</v>

961
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and they're in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of them and they make like </v>

962
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.580
<v Speaker 1>tables and desks and stuff out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most incredible looking.</v>

963
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:16.591
<v Speaker 1>Would they take like real wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real giant tree and they'll turn </v>

964
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that giant tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll cut chunks out of it and turn it</v>

965
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 1>into a table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got like the outside edge.</v>

966
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:26.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like the natural edge of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to know a guy who was a big </v>

967
00:40:26.971 --> 00:40:26.971
<v Speaker 1>investor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dead now,</v>

968
00:40:26.971 --> 00:40:31.891
<v Speaker 1>but he would find investments to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go by and he went and somehow he was so </v>

969
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:36.931
<v Speaker 1>proud of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd got himself a piece of a Koa Wood </v>

970
00:40:36.931 --> 00:40:41.041
<v Speaker 1>forest in Hawaii and he showed me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deed and the deed from the guy he bought</v>

971
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 1>it from had been signed by light King </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kamehameha or something.</v>

972
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So he was bragging to me for years about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and then found out later Hawaii </v>

973
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let him cut any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He.</v>

974
00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:56.460
<v Speaker 1>He bought it all on the premise that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had this valuable would and but for </v>

975
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 1>environmental and heritage reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't let him,</v>

976
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.680
<v Speaker 1>he was totally screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

977
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you got a cool forest,</v>

978
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.780
<v Speaker 1>a gorgeous heart and valuable and rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

979
00:41:05.781 --> 00:41:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think many like guitars out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

980
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I know they make pool cues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to make ships out of it.</v>

981
00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:12.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those old wooden ships.</v>

982
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 1>The different densities of trees and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different grains and patterns.</v>

984
00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at actual like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardwood,</v>

985
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fascinating and Admin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not invention,</v>

986
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>but creation of nature like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

987
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the variety of the grain and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look.</v>

988
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's really like a work of art and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange how it affects us visually.</v>

989
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at a piece of redwood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been polished and sanded and cut,</v>

990
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like you see the grain in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

991
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so pretty.</v>

992
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:42.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

993
00:41:42.131 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how that affects us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering who's winning the pool for</v>

994
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Speaker 1>what they thought we would talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

995
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:54.640
<v Speaker 1>How many people had hardwoods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody there,</v>

996
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 1>right about hemp though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as the construction material,</v>

997
00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.440
<v Speaker 1>they make that stuff called hempcrete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that?</v>

998
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like no product that they make with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemp.</v>

999
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has incredible installation values.</v>

1000
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:09.551
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult to light on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be used a lot up until </v>

1001
00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:14.081
<v Speaker 1>about the thirties and forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pretty big crop for a lot of </v>

1002
00:42:14.081 --> 00:42:16.901
<v Speaker 1>industrial use is everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who looks into it for five </v>

1003
00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:16.901
<v Speaker 1>minutes knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of those things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>stoners love to sit down and talk to you</v>

1005
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1006
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You know man Henry Ford made the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Washington.</v>

1007
00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do George Washington grew pot bro?</v>

1008
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Ben Franklin smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably did good stuff.</v>

1010
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Hard to prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Well they definitely liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1012
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:38.831
<v Speaker 1>there definitely were into hemp and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were definitely into using it as a </v>

1013
00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:38.831
<v Speaker 1>commodity and a textile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:40.340
<v Speaker 1>and you can go back and forth about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1015
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Like the pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dress like that.</v>

1016
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 1>The first tech waste and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first drafts of the declaration of </v>

1017
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.351
<v Speaker 1>independence was written on hemp and </v>
<v Speaker 1>parachutes sales sales with a lot of </v>

1018
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:54.540
<v Speaker 1>stuff we used in both world wars for </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment in fabric,</v>

1019
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the term canvas comes from the word</v>

1020
00:42:57.411 --> 00:43:00.310
<v Speaker 1>cannabis because that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made a member that actually.</v>

1021
00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting how it's becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

1023
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:06.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's another thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about this time.</v>

1024
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like slowly in your state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington state,</v>

1025
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:14.621
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're studying to see so much money </v>

1026
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 1>coming in from it being legal that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to trickle down into other states.</v>

1027
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It's almost kind of a great experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1028
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said before and I,</v>

1029
00:43:19.351 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I might've even said on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very first time we got together,</v>

1030
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we may have talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:25.560
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1032
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:30.670
<v Speaker 1>because we have this divergence between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the states and the federal government </v>

1033
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a couple of weeks ago the federal </v>

1034
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.331
<v Speaker 1>government decided to leave marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified as a schedule one drug for </v>

1035
00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:40.601
<v Speaker 1>the same reason they always did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is they say that the research </v>

1036
00:43:40.601 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 1>doesn't show anything and then you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what they're not really permitted do</v>

1037
00:43:41.451 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 1>the research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this catch 22.</v>

1038
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:48.850
<v Speaker 1>So at some point either the feds are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to move toward the states </v>

1039
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.450
<v Speaker 1>or somebody going to get into power that</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1040
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 1>enough of this dichotomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to crack down.</v>

1041
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what that would look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1042
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It would look ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't crack down.</v>

1043
00:43:56.601 --> 00:44:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Now the amount of money that Colorado is</v>
<v Speaker 1>making is changed.</v>

1044
00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of life for so many people </v>

1045
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their real estate values have gone up.</v>

1046
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 1>The drunk driving accidents have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>way down,</v>

1047
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>drunk driving arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way down,</v>

1048
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 1>violent crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way down.</v>

1049
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating what's happened </v>

1050
00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.261
<v Speaker 1>to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what the feds have already done </v>

1051
00:44:17.261 --> 00:44:17.261
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1052
00:44:17.261 --> 00:44:17.261
<v Speaker 1>in roundabout ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1053
00:44:17.261 --> 00:44:21.731
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they've said and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these places is if you have a </v>

1054
00:44:21.731 --> 00:44:24.461
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get pain medication prescribed</v>

1055
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a medical marijuana card,</v>

1056
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>a judge just upheld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they?</v>

1057
00:44:28.611 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 1>That you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you can be denied a gun.</v>

1058
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't deny people guns for drinking</v>

1059
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 1>the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1060
00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.520
<v Speaker 1>so the only reason that that works is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have a disagreement between </v>

1061
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.770
<v Speaker 1>state and federal law and they're siding</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the higher law,</v>

1062
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 1>which is the way the law is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1063
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but at what point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point do we have such a of a </v>

1064
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:52.401
<v Speaker 1>division between the reality on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground in these states and what federal </v>

1065
00:44:52.401 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 1>law says that the rubber's gonna meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road somewhere.</v>

1066
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be a moment where </v>

1067
00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you have a rubber meets the road moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1068
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's an interesting case with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>National Rifle Association too,</v>

1069
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:09.230
<v Speaker 1>because the NRA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always a course pro gun and </v>

1070
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.931
<v Speaker 1>really trying to stop any laws that </v>
<v Speaker 1>infringe upon the rights of people to </v>

1071
00:45:11.931 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 1>uphold the second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get to this pot thing,</v>

1072
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to fuck with the pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1073
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may be wrong about this,</v>

1074
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:23.391
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that they did come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say that you shouldn't be denying </v>

1075
00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:24.600
<v Speaker 1>people's rights the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>

1076
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot.</v>

1077
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.450
<v Speaker 1>It's in their interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in their interest to.</v>

1078
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:33.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of closet pot smokers out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because it's obviously the </v>

1079
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.970
<v Speaker 1>stereotype is always been that it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you lazy and it makes you dumb and sort </v>

1080
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:41.930
<v Speaker 1>of gives you brain damage and you forget</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that's been shown time and time </v>

1081
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.930
<v Speaker 1>again to not be true.</v>

1082
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you are high as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do forget things like when you're in</v>

1083
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:51.051
<v Speaker 1>the throws of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading a study once where </v>

1084
00:45:51.051 --> 00:45:54.141
<v Speaker 1>they were studying population in Jamaica</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of these people who were 75 </v>

1085
00:45:54.141 --> 00:45:58.320
<v Speaker 1>years old had been doing it their whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and they didn't show any.</v>

1086
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Anything that would make you your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulge out,</v>

1087
00:46:01.771 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 1>your hair stand up and made nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed that out of the ordinary in terms</v>

1088
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 1>of whether you're talking about cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates,</v>

1089
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:10.500
<v Speaker 1>are any of these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there were something like that,</v>

1090
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be beaten into our head.</v>

1091
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:16.911
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all the contents of </v>

1092
00:46:16.911 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drugs and all the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are making money off of marijuana </v>

1093
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:22.310
<v Speaker 1>remaining in this schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One category which are pretty </v>

1094
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.771
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that make money </v>

1095
00:46:24.771 --> 00:46:24.771
<v Speaker 1>off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The category is ridiculous.</v>

1096
00:46:24.771 --> 00:46:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just crazy.</v>

1097
00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what's going on in Arizona?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted about it.</v>

1098
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I think yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who were protesting against</v>

1099
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.900
<v Speaker 1>marijuana being legalized in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are spending the most money.</v>

1100
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.650
<v Speaker 1>We're talking hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars to try to keep marijuana illegal</v>

1101
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 1>and Arizona are directly tied to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

1102
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:51.870
<v Speaker 1>That's directly tied to pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically the stuff that killed </v>

1103
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 1>prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that stuff called?</v>

1104
00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Fentanyl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fentanyl.</v>

1105
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1106
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Arizona was a weird state of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some very conservative people.</v>

1107
00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the alcohol industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that there was one.</v>

1108
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's the alcohol industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also the,</v>

1109
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:07.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fentanyl industry.</v>

1110
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It might be a little bit earlier to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you scroll down a little bit further,</v>

1111
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:13.470
<v Speaker 1>see if you find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just bizarre that we allow that</v>

1112
00:47:13.471 --> 00:47:18.240
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it's so transparent today as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to this stuff all went on behind</v>

1113
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:23.241
<v Speaker 1>the scenes 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is why marijuana got </v>

1114
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:27.050
<v Speaker 1>made illegal area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fentanyl maker donates big to campaign </v>

1115
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Speaker 1>opposing pot legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fast.</v>

1116
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1117
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>A $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards</v>

1118
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.100
<v Speaker 2>defeating a ballot initiative that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>make recreational use of marijuana </v>

1119
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.440
<v Speaker 2>illegal under Arizona law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just criminals here.</v>

1120
00:47:36.441 --> 00:47:41.441
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of crooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you guys would spend that </v>

1121
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 2>much money to stop a drug that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with what you do,</v>

1122
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:48.300
<v Speaker 2>but I'll make the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is pretty much what my </v>

1123
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:48.300
<v Speaker 2>political show has been about since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very beginning,</v>

1124
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 2>is that that's a fact of factor of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption in our system.</v>

1125
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1126
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 2>when it's a pay to play system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1127
00:47:56.231 --> 00:48:01.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to impact somebody </v>

1128
00:48:01.231 --> 00:48:02.590
<v Speaker 2>else's business by legalizing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else than the way you fight,</v>

1129
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 2>that is you go out there and you donate </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1130
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.710
<v Speaker 2>to the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1131
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the people getting what they </v>

1132
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1133
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's whomever donates the most.</v>

1134
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.541
<v Speaker 2>And I remember Justice Scalia before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>died was part of a ruling where he </v>

1135
00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:15.541
<v Speaker 2>basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a,</v>

1136
00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:16.420
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bug.</v>

1137
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:21.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a feature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way the system is supposed </v>

1138
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:21.420
<v Speaker 2>to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1139
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.230
<v Speaker 2>money is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to represent the views of </v>

1140
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.680
<v Speaker 2>people and if it's poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can bundle it all together and then</v>

1141
00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's no money,</v>

1142
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's not a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who care and that was the theory,</v>

1143
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:35.910
<v Speaker 2>but what it's really done is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is mean if you don't have money flowing </v>

1144
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>into Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't count.</v>

1145
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.960
<v Speaker 2>You're not at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1146
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:42.961
<v Speaker 2>So there's whole sectors of the American</v>
<v Speaker 2>society that are essentially </v>

1147
00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:44.920
<v Speaker 2>unrepresented because there's no money </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from them.</v>

1148
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wasn't this sort of structure,</v>

1149
00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 2>the government structure that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforces that or,</v>

1150
00:48:50.681 --> 00:48:55.681
<v Speaker 2>or relies upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of established before </v>

1151
00:48:55.681 --> 00:48:58.771
<v Speaker 2>corporations were and definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>established before corporations were </v>

1152
00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:02.761
<v Speaker 2>allowed to act as an individual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>donate insane amounts of money to </v>

1153
00:49:02.761 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 2>campaigns the problem.</v>

1154
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:08.550
<v Speaker 2>And you look at it and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see how it happened because you </v>

1155
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 2>could see that that the people that gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little money back in the days when you</v>

1156
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 2>could only give this much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a little influence.</v>

1157
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:18.751
<v Speaker 2>So what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to influence them to let you </v>

1158
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:19.610
<v Speaker 2>give a little bit more and slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 2>surely you evolve into a system.</v>

1159
00:49:19.611 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was talking to my wife about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this the other day where we were talking</v>

1160
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:27.391
<v Speaker 2>about how it was never a good system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a fairer system back when I </v>

1161
00:49:27.391 --> 00:49:31.741
<v Speaker 2>was a kid in the 19 seventies because </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the money came from entities </v>

1162
00:49:31.741 --> 00:49:34.120
<v Speaker 2>that represented people who were blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>collar people.</v>

1163
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:39.390
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when unions were big a private employee </v>

1164
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.390
<v Speaker 2>unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the public employee unions.</v>

1165
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.311
<v Speaker 2>They're so popular now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were a pipe fitter or a </v>

1166
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 2>plumber or those people that had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electricians had pretty powerful unions,</v>

1167
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.660
<v Speaker 2>those people would bundle money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those unions would give money to </v>

1168
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.301
<v Speaker 2>candidates that sort of compensated for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you had corporate money or</v>

1169
00:49:54.341 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever and other directions.</v>

1170
00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.430
<v Speaker 2>In the 19 eighties when the Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting waxed regularly and were</v>

1171
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.430
<v Speaker 2>due to Reagan changing tax policies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever else,</v>

1172
00:50:03.431 --> 00:50:08.431
<v Speaker 2>we started to get some really wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and the union started getting </v>

1173
00:50:08.431 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 2>less powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>

1174
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:10.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Willie Sutton,</v>

1175
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:11.790
<v Speaker 2>the bank robber was famously asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 2>why do you rob banks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

1177
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 2>that's where the money is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1178
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:16.230
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1179
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 2>after 84,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially after Mondale got waxed by </v>

1180
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1181
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>that's when superdelegates started to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went and they looked and they said,</v>

1182
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we need to compete?</v>

1183
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at the longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>trends,</v>

1184
00:50:26.471 --> 00:50:28.490
<v Speaker 2>the people that Republicans tend to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from,</v>

1185
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:33.670
<v Speaker 2>they're just getting more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that we tend to get money </v>

1186
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.670
<v Speaker 2>from or getting weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when,</v>

1187
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:38.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the role Bill Clinton played in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Leadership Council where </v>

1188
00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 2>they basically said we can go and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from those same sources.</v>

1189
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 2>So they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1190
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:46.211
<v Speaker 2>so fast forward to now everybody's taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>money from those same sources and the </v>

1191
00:50:46.211 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 2>people that are lower and middle class </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no way to break into that game.</v>

1192
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you know Lawrence Lessig,</v>

1193
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 2>the Harvard law professor did a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>book called Republic last,</v>

1194
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:59.801
<v Speaker 2>where he pointed out how he went and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewed politicians who didn't even </v>

1195
00:50:59.801 --> 00:51:04.301
<v Speaker 2>realize there was another side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes to the issue they were voting </v>

1196
00:51:04.301 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Speaker 2>on because they hadn't heard from any </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1197
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you almost.</v>

1198
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:11.350
<v Speaker 2>You almost felt like a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were almost blameless because in </v>

1199
00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:11.350
<v Speaker 2>their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1200
00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares about this or I would've </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some money coming in for that.</v>

1201
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It's strange how the systems evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the one thing you can say for sure </v>

1202
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 2>is you're not getting money from people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't have money,</v>

1203
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:25.060
<v Speaker 2>and so eventually we get to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dichotomy where there's a lot of people </v>

1204
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.391
<v Speaker 2>in this country right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that old line about taxation </v>

1205
00:51:28.391 --> 00:51:30.461
<v Speaker 2>without representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in this country not </v>

1206
00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:30.461
<v Speaker 2>represented a 100 percent.</v>

1207
00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to think about how many people </v>

1208
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:36.670
<v Speaker 3>feel disenfranchised by the system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like it's gonna be fixed</v>

1209
00:51:36.671 --> 00:51:41.671
<v Speaker 3>anytime soon because the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are contributing to these </v>

1210
00:51:41.671 --> 00:51:42.340
<v Speaker 3>campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the percentage of human</v>

1211
00:51:42.341 --> 00:51:47.341
<v Speaker 3>beings on this landmass is very small </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the amount of people that have </v>

1212
00:51:47.341 --> 00:51:51.811
<v Speaker 3>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very small amount of people that </v>

1213
00:51:51.811 --> 00:51:54.280
<v Speaker 3>are affecting the lives of a vast </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of people and it becomes a very</v>

1214
00:51:54.281 --> 00:51:59.281
<v Speaker 3>weird sort of a scenario when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue with the same representative </v>

1215
00:51:59.281 --> 00:52:04.170
<v Speaker 3>government structure that we had back </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was impossible to communicate </v>

1216
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:04.170
<v Speaker 3>with people and the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1217
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Like you had a Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Morse code or a guy on a horse </v>

1218
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:09.180
<v Speaker 3>with a letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hard,</v>

1219
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:13.771
<v Speaker 3>so this is why they decided to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>representative government in the first </v>

1220
00:52:13.771 --> 00:52:13.771
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1221
00:52:13.771 --> 00:52:14.470
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't communicate with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that you can.</v>

1222
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:15.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1223
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.530
<v Speaker 3>we really ultimately have to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one day it is one person,</v>

1224
00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:24.070
<v Speaker 3>one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do we all as a mass has 300 million</v>

1225
00:52:24.071 --> 00:52:29.071
<v Speaker 3>people get to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a hundred 90 million people </v>

1226
00:52:29.071 --> 00:52:29.770
<v Speaker 3>think one thing and the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think another thing.</v>

1227
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.540
<v Speaker 3>How does this all work out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do,</v>

1228
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.330
<v Speaker 3>how do we decide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because right now we have delicates,</v>

1229
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.940
<v Speaker 3>we have representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have senators,</v>

1230
00:52:36.941 --> 00:52:41.941
<v Speaker 3>we have all these different people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a buffer us from the actual </v>

1231
00:52:41.941 --> 00:52:43.960
<v Speaker 3>decisions that are being made and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think as we,</v>

1232
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:50.010
<v Speaker 3>as it becomes easier and easier to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate and express your opinions </v>

1233
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 3>and give your thoughts on things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the option of voting online and the </v>

1234
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:57.661
<v Speaker 3>option of voting directly for issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>without representation seems more and </v>

1235
00:52:57.661 --> 00:52:58.600
<v Speaker 3>more enticing to people.</v>

1236
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'd have to change the </v>

1237
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>constitution and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1238
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.500
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So old as fuck.</v>

1239
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I hate to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on.</v>

1240
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading a book right now that talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about our government actually operating </v>

1241
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.240
<v Speaker 2>sort of between the lines of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the constitution.</v>

1242
00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:17.241
<v Speaker 2>So there's room to maneuver and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for understandable reasons like </v>

1243
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:21.831
<v Speaker 2>security and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that nuclear bombs were </v>

1244
00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:24.501
<v Speaker 2>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed everything that within those </v>

1245
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:25.080
<v Speaker 2>lines there's room to sort of expand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you can do,</v>

1246
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.440
<v Speaker 2>but you do that generation after </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation and then you look around and </v>

1247
00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.231
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did we get from where we were in </v>

1248
00:53:33.231 --> 00:53:35.691
<v Speaker 2>1942 where we are now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost inexplicably and and </v>

1249
00:53:35.691 --> 00:53:39.710
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when I talk about reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to figure out how you can dial </v>

1250
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:43.041
<v Speaker 2>things back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've come so far beyond any point </v>

1251
00:53:43.041 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 2>you could dial it back to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes really hard to imagine.</v>

1252
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have an old mainframe </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer that you've patched and patched</v>

1253
00:53:48.661 --> 00:53:53.661
<v Speaker 2>and patched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only way now to make any real </v>

1254
00:53:53.661 --> 00:53:55.110
<v Speaker 2>reform is to throw the computer out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy a new Mac and start from scratch and</v>

1255
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 2>nobody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1256
00:53:56.401 --> 00:53:57.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't even figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that done.</v>

1257
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like we need an asteroid to </v>

1258
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.541
<v Speaker 3>take out the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just come down and boom and wreck the </v>

1259
00:54:05.541 --> 00:54:10.011
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a big earthquake or a title wave </v>

1260
00:54:10.011 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 3>have to be a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A big,</v>

1261
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 3>big thing that unfortunately kills a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

1262
00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Then the government will step in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1263
00:54:14.611 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1264
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.830
<v Speaker 3>we have to take care of all of you down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your security martial law.</v>

1265
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 3>People on the street corner was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>government's dead or the hits them.</v>

1266
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.120
<v Speaker 3>How symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbol amatic.</v>

1267
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:29.300
<v Speaker 3>It would be symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be rather simple maddox and </v>

1268
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.620
<v Speaker 3>ignored with how amazing it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if that's the only place where an </v>

1269
00:54:32.701 --> 00:54:37.701
<v Speaker 3>asteroid hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it hit the Pentagon and the White </v>

1270
00:54:37.701 --> 00:54:37.701
<v Speaker 3>House,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if like this is too broken up.</v>

1271
00:54:37.701 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Chunks of space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rock one slams into the Pentagon.</v>

1272
00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Kills everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Blaine.</v>

1273
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the god of terror.</v>

1274
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 3>The God of terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1275
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really almost the only way.</v>

1276
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Something has to be catastrophic in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order for them to try to reset and </v>

1277
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.160
<v Speaker 3>rebuild a completely new system and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would have to agree.</v>

1278
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to get to together and go,</v>

1279
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:04.041
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going to go back to that thing </v>

1280
00:55:04.041 --> 00:55:05.931
<v Speaker 3>that was written on him by people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote with feathers or are we going to </v>

1281
00:55:05.931 --> 00:55:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Redo this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna figure this out from a </v>

1282
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.811
<v Speaker 3>modern perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing what we know now about our </v>

1283
00:55:11.811 --> 00:55:14.661
<v Speaker 3>ability to communicate and knowing what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know now about all the things that </v>

1284
00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:18.741
<v Speaker 3>are the founding fathers of this country</v>
<v Speaker 3>did an amazing job of trying to protect </v>

1285
00:55:18.741 --> 00:55:19.380
<v Speaker 3>from corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1286
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:24.710
<v Speaker 3>trying to make sure that their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their vision of what America could be,</v>

1287
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:30.860
<v Speaker 3>that this experiment in self government </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they put all these safeguards in </v>

1288
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:34.821
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way they could have ever </v>

1289
00:55:34.821 --> 00:55:37.041
<v Speaker 3>predicted how far technology would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken us in the 200 plus years since </v>

1290
00:55:37.041 --> 00:55:38.330
<v Speaker 3>they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way they,</v>

1291
00:55:38.331 --> 00:55:38.590
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1292
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't have any idea.</v>

1293
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:45.500
<v Speaker 3>So now that we know where we are now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can sort of extrapolate where it's </v>

1294
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 3>going to be in the next 50 a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and maybe plan for the future,</v>

1295
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 3>the digital future that we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with now.</v>

1296
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.260
<v Speaker 3>And then we thought it was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would have put in some,</v>

1297
00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:00.890
<v Speaker 3>some things that people would agree with</v>
<v Speaker 3>in regards to like what the NSA got </v>

1298
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 3>caught with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1299
00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.070
<v Speaker 3>with the mass surveillance of the.</v>

1300
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that for because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to go there.</v>

1301
00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:07.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking not that long ago,</v>

1302
00:56:07.521 --> 00:56:09.190
<v Speaker 2>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they force you,</v>

1303
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.750
<v Speaker 2>because we all understand that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>history is an evolution,</v>

1304
00:56:11.751 --> 00:56:16.751
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all of this is the result of decades </v>

1305
00:56:16.751 --> 00:56:19.401
<v Speaker 2>and decades and generations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations of building stuff on top of </v>

1306
00:56:19.401 --> 00:56:20.870
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had to pick the time that was</v>

1307
00:56:20.871 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>most transformative for all those you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about,</v>

1308
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to go back to the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>between 1947 and 1948.</v>

1309
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:34.530
<v Speaker 2>That's when Harry Truman and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government passed these rules that made </v>

1310
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 2>everything we talk about today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NSA,</v>

1311
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.720
<v Speaker 2>the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things are developments from </v>

1312
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.140
<v Speaker 2>like national security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean NSC.</v>

1313
00:56:44.141 --> 00:56:49.141
<v Speaker 2>60 eight is one of those big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of these rules that created the </v>

1314
00:56:49.141 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>modern United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it the secret government that</v>

1315
00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 2>we know about today.</v>

1316
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go back in time,</v>

1317
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you can certainly understand what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were thinking.</v>

1318
00:56:58.571 --> 00:57:03.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to remember how crazy it was </v>

1319
00:57:03.571 --> 00:57:06.001
<v Speaker 2>after the second world war and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that the Soviet Union was this </v>

1320
00:57:06.001 --> 00:57:09.091
<v Speaker 2>threat to the whole world and now you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have nuclear weapons and can you really </v>

1321
00:57:09.091 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 2>declare war if there's nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be,</v>

1322
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of things where </v>

1323
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you go here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of get what was going on,</v>

1324
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:16.730
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't take Harry Truman Long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1325
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:21.870
<v Speaker 2>after he left office to say I made a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes including things like the CIA </v>

1326
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:23.200
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once you start those programs,</v>

1327
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:28.710
<v Speaker 2>there's an autopilot that that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they develop a momentum of their </v>

1328
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you said today,</v>

1329
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 2>because I would make this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to look at this the way my</v>

1330
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:35.650
<v Speaker 2>stepfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was a total profit and loss guy,</v>

1331
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.570
<v Speaker 2>and you would look at something like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>CIA,</v>

1332
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:39.490
<v Speaker 2>you would say the CIA is a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

1333
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:44.700
<v Speaker 2>They miss all the big things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's the fall of the Soviet </v>

1334
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you name it,</v>

1335
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.241
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CIA has got major failures and then </v>

1336
00:57:48.241 --> 00:57:48.241
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:57:48.241 --> 00:57:48.460
<v Speaker 2>all the things that they've done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were nefarious that they shouldn't have.</v>

1338
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.160
<v Speaker 2>So if this were a private business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd turn around and go,</v>

1339
00:57:51.161 --> 00:57:51.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1340
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a last thing right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1341
00:57:53.561 --> 00:57:58.561
<v Speaker 2>let's take that division scrap it </v>
<v Speaker 2>startled you can't do that in a </v>

1342
00:57:58.561 --> 00:58:02.641
<v Speaker 2>government for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to decide this </v>

1343
00:58:02.641 --> 00:58:06.301
<v Speaker 2>whole area has been a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's start over and that's the </v>

1344
00:58:06.301 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 2>problem because I'm not sure you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform things that are,</v>

1345
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:10.060
<v Speaker 2>that are flawed at the seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1346
00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1347
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 2>and the CIA is a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even the NSA,</v>

1348
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see that this week they're,</v>

1349
00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:20.791
<v Speaker 2>once again trying to slip a bill and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would allow the government without </v>

1350
00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:20.791
<v Speaker 2>a warrant to track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:22.300
<v Speaker 2>every website you go to an all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1352
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.420
<v Speaker 2>how does this stuff get that far?</v>

1353
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:30.420
<v Speaker 2>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to attach it to a totally </v>

1354
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:30.420
<v Speaker 2>unrelated bill so that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1355
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they get away with this?</v>

1356
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Most likely it's just justifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>something they're already doing well and</v>

1357
00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 2>they're legitimately afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's stuff to be afraid of,</v>

1358
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 2>so I don't always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1359
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:45.030
<v Speaker 2>you have to cut them a little slack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no waiting at all about the </v>

1360
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>downside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1361
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:50.581
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like the only thing we pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to is the terror side of the </v>

1362
00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:50.581
<v Speaker 2>ledger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the fact that,</v>

1363
00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:54.660
<v Speaker 2>do you John Mccain or Lindsey Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really want the government </v>

1364
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:54.910
<v Speaker 2>knowing every webs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially Lindsey Graham.</v>

1365
00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be some websites there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he really would not like the </v>

1366
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 2>government to know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1367
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.000
<v Speaker 2>At least think about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1368
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know how you stop this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic.</v>

1369
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:07.540
<v Speaker 2>We're such a fearful people that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to kill us.</v>

1370
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what we've done.</v>

1371
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Other people we know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Payback is probably likely.</v>

1372
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:13.990
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what's.</v>

1373
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:19.350
<v Speaker 2>What's really sad is I've always had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this rose colored view of us and I </v>

1374
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 2>acknowledged that it's a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but always look at the myth</v>

1375
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:25.210
<v Speaker 4>of America as I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 19 fifties high school textbook view</v>

1376
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:30.220
<v Speaker 4>of American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That to me is what I want to move </v>

1377
00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.471
<v Speaker 4>towards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when they talk about creating a more </v>

1378
00:59:32.471 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 4>perfect union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to me is the goal and anything that</v>

1379
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 4>conflicts with that self image to me is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>

1380
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.430
<v Speaker 4>So when you see sometimes how we really </v>
<v Speaker 4>operate anything Dick Cheney does,</v>

1381
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't use the word evil,</v>

1382
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:46.370
<v Speaker 4>so I'll use the word nefarious Dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheney is to me when you say what do you</v>

1383
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 4>want to avoid in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to avoid.</v>

1384
00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:52.280
<v Speaker 4>We're Dick Cheney wants us to go because</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing conflicts with my 19 fifties,</v>

1385
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 4>mythological American textbook idea than</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Cheney wants us to be.</v>

1386
00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've done,</v>

1387
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:00.920
<v Speaker 4>some of the things based on that 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>47,</v>

1388
01:00:00.921 --> 01:00:02.330
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>48 America,</v>

1389
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 4>which we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1390
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 4>we have to do everything to stop global </v>
<v Speaker 4>communism.</v>

1391
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:10.210
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna take over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you look at some of the things we </v>

1392
01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 4>did and you realize some of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with today is blowback.</v>

1393
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 4>You don't know how to undo that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1394
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 4>you almost think it's like permanent </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage.</v>

1395
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 4>Look at the way some in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See us.</v>

1396
01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1397
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:22.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk to people like I remember </v>

1398
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.251
<v Speaker 4>talking to Sam Harris about this and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was talking about what you have to see </v>

1399
01:00:24.251 --> 01:00:27.521
<v Speaker 4>things a certain way and I said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not going to help you solve </v>

1400
01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:29.921
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you solve the problem if we've </v>

1401
01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:32.471
<v Speaker 4>already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we've already soiled our bed so much </v>

1402
01:00:32.471 --> 01:00:32.780
<v Speaker 4>that you don't know how to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to go and say,</v>

1403
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:33.680
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're sorry about this.</v>

1404
01:00:33.681 --> 01:00:36.410
<v Speaker 4>Can we start from scratch?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that in foreign affairs.</v>

1405
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Just like you can't do it with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mainframe computer.</v>

1406
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.620
<v Speaker 4>That is the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1407
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to reverse course to a point where </v>

1408
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 4>we can once again fix stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1409
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:46.370
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too damaged.</v>

1410
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:51.430
<v Speaker 4>I think it just has to dry out slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>but surely look all the wounds of the </v>

1411
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.800
<v Speaker 4>past to heal up and dry out and it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes time.</v>

1412
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 4>How do you do it when they're still </v>
<v Speaker 4>after?</v>

1413
01:00:55.371 --> 01:00:58.430
<v Speaker 4>You mean we've already made enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>people mad at us so that thereafter us.</v>

1414
01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Well now we have to go protect ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>by going and getting them,</v>

1415
01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:06.251
<v Speaker 4>so we perpetuate the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't figure out how to jump off </v>

1416
01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:06.251
<v Speaker 4>the merry go round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1417
01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:11.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it moves that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're trying to make a </v>

1418
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:13.580
<v Speaker 4>battleship move like a race car and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>just think it takes a long time to shift</v>

1419
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:18.581
<v Speaker 4>course and when we're looking at these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are in the Middle East that </v>

1420
01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:21.440
<v Speaker 4>are opposing the US right now and angry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and want to attack the US right now,</v>

1421
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 4>you're most likely never going to get to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1422
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 4>You might get to their grandchildren and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that might be the only way.</v>

1423
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:33.310
<v Speaker 4>Things slowly but surely settled down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the argument for the NSA and </v>

1424
01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:37.841
<v Speaker 4>the CIA to continue to monitor things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are really kind of ridiculous and </v>

1425
01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:41.261
<v Speaker 4>invasive level because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people out there that hate us or hate </v>

1426
01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:45.910
<v Speaker 4>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate the military and hate what's </v>

1427
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.910
<v Speaker 4>happened to them and so many martyrs are</v>
<v Speaker 4>created.</v>

1428
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:47.120
<v Speaker 4>Every time a drone strike was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

1429
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 4>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

1430
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.140
<v Speaker 4>how do you get that next generation to </v>
<v Speaker 4>not hate us when we're busy killing </v>

1431
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:53.240
<v Speaker 4>their parents because their parents want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill us.</v>

1432
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the cycle and I can't figure out </v>

1433
01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.641
<v Speaker 4>how to break the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you protect ourselves from their </v>

1434
01:02:00.641 --> 01:02:02.240
<v Speaker 4>anti American parents in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't turn them against us to.</v>

1435
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

1436
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.270
<v Speaker 4>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It definitely makes sense in the.</v>

1437
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.420
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one has a real logical answer to </v>

1438
01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1439
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:16.390
<v Speaker 4>he talked to the Ron Paul supporters and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think we should just separate and </v>

1440
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.460
<v Speaker 4>don't police the world and take care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our own and just stay there and still </v>

1441
01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:21.600
<v Speaker 4>people will want to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1442
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1443
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:27.201
<v Speaker 4>And then you talk to the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Dick Cheney camp that like you're</v>

1444
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:32.421
<v Speaker 4>out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're living in a dream movie world in </v>

1445
01:02:32.421 --> 01:02:35.430
<v Speaker 4>the real world is dirty and nasty and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>need all these people.</v>

1446
01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:40.431
<v Speaker 4>We need all these operatives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need people constantly monitoring </v>

1447
01:02:40.431 --> 01:02:40.710
<v Speaker 4>these hotspots all around the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>because like,</v>

1448
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:45.890
<v Speaker 4>look what's going on in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking testing nuclear bombs </v>

1449
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 4>now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>

1450
01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:48.410
<v Speaker 4>We're flying by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>

1451
01:02:48.411 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 4>We're making these threatening gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were flying fighter jets around North</v>

1452
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Korea.</v>

1453
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.100
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1454
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:58.560
<v Speaker 4>it's really spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's spooky because something can happen</v>

1455
01:02:58.561 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 4>and we don't have anybody over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1456
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 4>at least as far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1457
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:04.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we have some deep,</v>

1458
01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:09.681
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep undercover CIA people working as </v>

1459
01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:10.050
<v Speaker 4>North Korean soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'll tell you what upsets me though,</v>

1460
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:12.810
<v Speaker 4>because what we were just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting off the merry go round.</v>

1461
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.940
<v Speaker 4>It means kind of not perpetuating the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same mistakes we've made before.</v>

1462
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:23.150
<v Speaker 4>But what drives me crazy about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>system is that the people who make </v>

1463
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.150
<v Speaker 4>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've always said,</v>

1464
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've forgiven people,</v>

1465
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 4>make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna make a mistake,</v>

1466
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be allowed to make another</v>

1467
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 4>one though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1468
01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:33.540
<v Speaker 4>At the highest levels of government when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you send people to war and we shouldn't </v>

1469
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:33.900
<v Speaker 4>have gone to war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll cut you some slack,</v>

1470
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want you then going on cnn </v>
<v Speaker 4>and being the expert who tells us how to</v>

1471
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 4>handle the next crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1472
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Because your track record sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick Cheney's got a terrible track </v>

1473
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We still listen to him.</v>

1474
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:48.531
<v Speaker 4>He still gets to be a person who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who moves the public debate and there's </v>

1475
01:03:48.531 --> 01:03:49.860
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at the John Bolton's.</v>

1476
01:03:49.861 --> 01:03:54.861
<v Speaker 4>There's a heck of a lot of these guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are consistently and regularly </v>

1477
01:03:54.861 --> 01:03:56.290
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we put them out there as though,</v>

1478
01:03:56.291 --> 01:04:01.291
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is somebody you should listen to </v>

1479
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:01.291
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the show.</v>

1480
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:01.291
<v Speaker 4>He's going to analyze how we should </v>
<v Speaker 4>handle North Korea.</v>

1481
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was wrong as heck about Iraq and </v>

1482
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:07.791
<v Speaker 4>all these other things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to listen to him on that </v>

1483
01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:09.981
<v Speaker 4>next subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't make people who are wrong in </v>

1484
01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:09.981
<v Speaker 4>this country pay the price,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means you know,</v>

1485
01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:14.920
<v Speaker 4>if you're in a private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a doctor and you screw up a </v>

1486
01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:14.920
<v Speaker 4>few surgeries and people who should not </v>
<v Speaker 4>die,</v>

1487
01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>

1488
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:16.980
<v Speaker 4>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll be out of business.</v>

1489
01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 4>They will take your license.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You won't get to kill anymore.</v>

1490
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:24.231
<v Speaker 4>People in government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can continue to make these errors </v>

1491
01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be promoted.</v>

1492
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.210
<v Speaker 4>You'll be in a position to make more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1493
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 4>that'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over the long haul,</v>

1494
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.250
<v Speaker 4>do you wonder like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what motivation is Dick Cheney have?</v>

1495
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:33.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't even have a heart.</v>

1496
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:39.770
<v Speaker 4>They took his heart out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They stuck some cadaver heart in their </v>

1497
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.100
<v Speaker 4>worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a 19 fifties us high school</v>

1498
01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:42.510
<v Speaker 4>textbook worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1499
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is he doing it?</v>

1500
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:49.010
<v Speaker 4>Like what is his motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuing to keep Pistons on who you </v>

1501
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.010
<v Speaker 4>ask?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's money.</v>

1502
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:53.841
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's powerful friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to these people and they'll </v>

1503
01:04:53.841 --> 01:04:53.841
<v Speaker 4>give you the old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know how the world works.</v>

1504
01:04:53.841 --> 01:04:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1505
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.400
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at that point you have to say to </v>

1506
01:04:59.400 --> 01:04:59.400
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1507
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.941
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the constitution is just a piece </v>

1508
01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.300
<v Speaker 4>of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at some point there's a rubber meets</v>

1509
01:05:03.301 --> 01:05:04.810
<v Speaker 4>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be my word for today's.</v>

1510
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.620
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan showed me my fly in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ointment for today's Joe Rogan show.</v>

1511
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.860
<v Speaker 4>But there's got to be a point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody has to sit down and say,</v>

1512
01:05:10.861 --> 01:05:12.720
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a constitution that does this.</v>

1513
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Here's the way the world really works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now either we're going to go back to one</v>

1514
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>or we're going to discard</v>

1515
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:23.130
<v Speaker 2>one and completely embrace the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point we embrace the hypocrisy </v>

1516
01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>that we still live like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the world's a difficult,</v>

1517
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>tough place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're acting like that.</v>

1518
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1520
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.110
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely makes sense.</v>

1521
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And that dichotomy is what makes so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans angry.</v>

1522
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1524
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:40.590
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that we've limited the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of attacks on American soil to </v>

1525
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.450
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 and Pearl Harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1526
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you had the Orlando attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you classify the </v>

1527
01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lando attack was a crazy fuck that lived</v>

1528
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:50.680
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was a gun wolf stuff.</v>

1529
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>What's that guy proven to be gay or is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like what that is?</v>

1530
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

1531
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1532
01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.560
<v Speaker 2>but that's a perfect example though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1533
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.540
<v Speaker 2>of why this is so tough to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself against.</v>

1534
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the same thing by the way,</v>

1535
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 2>the country has been worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>American radicals for decades.</v>

1536
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go look at how we treated the 19 </v>

1537
01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.661
<v Speaker 2>sixties leftist radicals that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting bombs in the Pentagon and stuff </v>

1538
01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:15.661
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1539
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:19.930
<v Speaker 2>it always blows my mind to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if those guys were doing that today,</v>

1540
01:06:19.931 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 2>we might waterboard them at Guantanamo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1541
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think the domestic radical idea has</v>

1542
01:06:26.351 --> 01:06:31.351
<v Speaker 2>been something the government's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about since the first red scare </v>

1543
01:06:31.351 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>in the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 era and the anarchists and that whole</v>

1544
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.210
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1545
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>And I think whenever you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

1546
01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>whenever you have people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge,</v>

1547
01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be people that oppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people and they're going to try to</v>

1548
01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:43.060
<v Speaker 2>go through some people that are opposing</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1549
01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go through legal channels</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to protest legally and</v>

1550
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:51.130
<v Speaker 2>they're going to organize and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches and other people are gonna say,</v>

1551
01:06:51.131 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work.</v>

1552
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.430
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do this guerrilla style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do this.</v>

1553
01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.990
<v Speaker 2>So now we come to the hacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1554
01:06:55.991 --> 01:06:57.400
<v Speaker 2>That's where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1555
01:06:57.401 --> 01:07:02.401
<v Speaker 2>I argued in the last common sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>program that that the hacks are kind of </v>

1556
01:07:02.401 --> 01:07:06.241
<v Speaker 2>a chickens coming home to roost thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when we deputize our </v>

1557
01:07:06.241 --> 01:07:07.570
<v Speaker 2>representatives to keep some secrets </v>
<v Speaker 2>from us,</v>

1558
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:10.240
<v Speaker 2>because we all understand that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be some of those,</v>

1559
01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:12.800
<v Speaker 2>but if you did that in a private </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

1560
01:07:12.801 --> 01:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you work for a boss,</v>

1561
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.780
<v Speaker 2>you're your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're delivering pizzas at the Pizza </v>

1562
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Company and the boss says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you listen to?</v>

1563
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I have to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible deniability,</v>

1564
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:22.330
<v Speaker 2>so if you have to stamp something top </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret on your,</v>

1565
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:27.331
<v Speaker 2>on your order form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't look at it and we'll all be </v>

1566
01:07:27.331 --> 01:07:27.331
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1567
01:07:27.331 --> 01:07:30.931
<v Speaker 2>so one day you're out with prostitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and drinking beer and you don't deliver </v>

1568
01:07:30.931 --> 01:07:32.140
<v Speaker 2>your pizza and you think if I put top </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret on this,</v>

1569
01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>the boss won't see it will be great.</v>

1570
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's human nature that after a you're </v>

1571
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>going to start to classify stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really shouldn't be secret,</v>

1572
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:43.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I W I t and I said this in the last </v>

1573
01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:46.681
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to an intelligence operative </v>

1574
01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:48.361
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't tell me anything except I </v>

1575
01:07:48.361 --> 01:07:50.020
<v Speaker 2>asked him a question once about if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to guess what percentage of stuff is</v>

1576
01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:52.690
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that Americans would agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be kept secret.</v>

1577
01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:54.730
<v Speaker 2>He said about 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1578
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 2>what's the rest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1579
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>everything you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1580
01:07:57.701 --> 01:08:02.701
<v Speaker 2>cover your own rear end corporate deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a senator doesn't want his </v>

1581
01:08:02.701 --> 01:08:04.480
<v Speaker 2>constituents to know about for 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he'll get voted,</v>

1582
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the and it's.</v>

1583
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:11.220
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a point where when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping that much stuff from the </v>

1584
01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:11.220
<v Speaker 2>American people that they have a right </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>

1585
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be inevitable that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be literally leaks like you're </v>

1586
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:16.350
<v Speaker 2>trying to cover too much.</v>

1587
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With,</v>

1588
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>with two little concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's natural.</v>

1589
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:23.891
<v Speaker 2>I think in some of these guys like </v>
<v Speaker 2>William beneath the one that everybody </v>

1590
01:08:23.891 --> 01:08:23.891
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1591
01:08:23.891 --> 01:08:28.631
<v Speaker 2>I went through every channel I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to go to and I ended up with </v>

1592
01:08:28.631 --> 01:08:32.710
<v Speaker 2>officers pointing federal agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing machine guns at me as I came </v>

1593
01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:36.521
<v Speaker 2>out of the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when when the system breaks down to </v>

1594
01:08:36.521 --> 01:08:39.641
<v Speaker 2>the point where the whistleblowers go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the proper channels and they </v>

1595
01:08:39.641 --> 01:08:42.641
<v Speaker 2>become the ones who get into trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you're asking for leaks and it's </v>

1596
01:08:42.641 --> 01:08:46.001
<v Speaker 2>hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel sorry for you that they leaked </v>

1597
01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:46.590
<v Speaker 2>that vital information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you haven't been keeping nonvital</v>

1598
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 2>information from us for so long that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might not have happened.</v>

1599
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And then you do get release of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that none of us thinks should be </v>

1600
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.550
<v Speaker 2>released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the terrible problem.</v>

1601
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like leaks are not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable now,</v>

1602
01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's baked into the pie that baked </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

1603
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.440
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's almost no way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep stuff secret now operative at the </v>

1604
01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:13.901
<v Speaker 2>Democratic and Republican parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much would you want to bake it into </v>

1605
01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:16.841
<v Speaker 2>the cake that you try to see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a leak against your </v>

1606
01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:19.361
<v Speaker 2>opponents before the next election?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much does that now become a part of </v>

1607
01:09:19.361 --> 01:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>your strategize?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1608
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1609
01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll put out a little stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hacked on the DNC kind of attitude,</v>

1610
01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:25.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1611
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if and if the Russians are,</v>

1612
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:29.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Putin said that,</v>

1613
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.040
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't we just look,</v>

1614
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 2>the American people should know this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1615
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 2>So we released this information or </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody releases this information,</v>

1616
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>but if they only release information on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one side,</v>

1617
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.940
<v Speaker 2>have they influenced the election?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1618
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be careful how that works</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1619
01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 2>They have the ability to sort of set the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tone of the discussion.</v>

1620
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what if they checked the </v>

1621
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they checked like what kinds of crazy</v>

1622
01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:55.290
<v Speaker 2>shit was said when they realize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump was running away with it,</v>

1623
01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:57.560
<v Speaker 2>heard something that there'd been a hack</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1624
01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 2>and it was like new news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not up to speed,</v>

1625
01:09:59.451 --> 01:10:04.451
<v Speaker 2>but that there had been at the RNC to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see everybody's freaking out now</v>

1626
01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 2>over the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again we have to make the disclaimer</v>

1627
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:12.390
<v Speaker 2>that the Russian hackers or whomever I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this Russian hackers would get mad </v>

1628
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.910
<v Speaker 2>at me when I say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whomever it was that did this,</v>

1629
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:19.260
<v Speaker 2>that they've been known to alter stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to take it all with a grain </v>

1630
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:19.260
<v Speaker 2>of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1631
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 2>but what came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess was a list,</v>

1632
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.120
<v Speaker 2>and this is from the Democratic Party's </v>
<v Speaker 2>main list of donors,</v>

1633
01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their internal documents which shows the</v>

1634
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:30.251
<v Speaker 2>top donors how much they gave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what was given in return,</v>

1635
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Basadur ships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>director of homeland security,</v>

1636
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:35.690
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>

1637
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the funky part that says old </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost as the republic.</v>

1638
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>It was called the spoil system in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early 18 hundreds,</v>

1639
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:45.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I win election.</v>

1640
01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 2>So all my buddies get jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1641
01:10:47.151 --> 01:10:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who supported me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there've been asked though,</v>

1642
01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:55.061
<v Speaker 2>ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hatch act was one where they tried </v>

1643
01:10:55.061 --> 01:10:57.440
<v Speaker 2>to limit that and both parties act like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do it anymore.</v>

1644
01:10:57.441 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes out that they still do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people freak out.</v>

1645
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.980
<v Speaker 2>But here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the Democrats do it,</v>

1646
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the Republicans do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see a list from the last </v>

1647
01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Republican administration who their top </v>
<v Speaker 2>donors were.</v>

1648
01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:15.580
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is look at who the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambassadors were and especially the </v>

1649
01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:15.580
<v Speaker 2>ambassadors to good places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1650
01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Who is the ambassador to Bermuda who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ambassador to London?</v>

1651
01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:25.220
<v Speaker 2>The UK one is always a coveted position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much did that guy give and because </v>

1652
01:11:26.401 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 2>it's always been the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a part of me that goes,</v>

1653
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1654
01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:34.731
<v Speaker 2>But the other part of me goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the corruption you wish more </v>

1655
01:11:34.731 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Americans knew was built into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1656
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you found out that the guy who's in </v>

1657
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 2>charge of making sure this country safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Homeland Security Department got</v>

1658
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the job because he gave money to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

1659
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>how much less safer we than if you gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to the most qualified candidate.</v>

1660
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many people are doing it for </v>

1661
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.410
<v Speaker 3>vanity positions just so they can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are that ambassador.</v>

1662
01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a way to reform joe,</v>

1664
01:11:57.211 --> 01:12:02.211
<v Speaker 2>so all we have to do is get some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich marijuana grower to give them </v>

1665
01:12:02.211 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 2>enough money so that he becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Department of Homeland Security Director</v>

1666
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.260
<v Speaker 2>and you could get that corruption thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>working in your favor.</v>

1667
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.300
<v Speaker 3>That's actually possible with the amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money that I'm making in Colorado.</v>

1668
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:11.050
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>

1669
01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>You would never direct your homeland </v>
<v Speaker 2>security made all of his money growing </v>

1670
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.550
<v Speaker 2>weed and it comes full circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much have you</v>

1671
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:23.590
<v Speaker 3>paid attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the controversy about the Clinton </v>

1672
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Foundation.</v>

1673
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I have a special relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clintons.</v>

1674
01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:32.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in talk radio during that whole </v>

1675
01:12:32.171 --> 01:12:34.130
<v Speaker 2>administration and there they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unique people as a couple and</v>

1676
01:12:34.131 --> 01:12:37.820
<v Speaker 2>they're very hard to describe and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always try to be fair.</v>

1677
01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:38.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1678
01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm very into fair and seeing context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's be honest.</v>

1679
01:12:41.151 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 2>These are two people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1680
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:48.430
<v Speaker 2>here's the way I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're Hillary Clinton and they have </v>

1681
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:49.670
<v Speaker 2>been after you since before your husband</v>
<v Speaker 2>was president,</v>

1682
01:12:49.671 --> 01:12:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Arkansas,</v>

1683
01:12:50.571 --> 01:12:51.590
<v Speaker 2>they were after them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1684
01:12:51.591 --> 01:12:54.950
<v Speaker 2>So you know how on you they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1685
01:12:55.370 --> 01:13:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you stay so far away from any </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines that nobody could ever come close </v>

1686
01:13:00.741 --> 01:13:02.090
<v Speaker 2>to saying you were?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't.</v>

1687
01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.290
<v Speaker 2>They both walk and straddle and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1688
01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:08.630
<v Speaker 2>if you talked to people in Arkansas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just say that's the Clintons.</v>

1689
01:13:08.631 --> 01:13:13.631
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they walk the straddle the line and a </v>

1690
01:13:13.631 --> 01:13:13.631
<v Speaker 2>lot of times they go in too much of one.</v>

1691
01:13:13.631 --> 01:13:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this with Anthony </v>

1692
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Wiener,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I a long time ago.</v>

1693
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:22.870
<v Speaker 2>If you know that stuff's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you go and run for office </v>

1694
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with Clinton.</v>

1695
01:13:23.451 --> 01:13:26.000
<v Speaker 2>If you know you're the most watched man </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>

1696
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:31.210
<v Speaker 2>why on earth would you have an affair </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a teenage intern who you know will </v>

1697
01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:31.590
<v Speaker 2>not stay quiet about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1698
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.810
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it boggles the mind.</v>

1699
01:13:32.811 --> 01:13:36.830
<v Speaker 2>So if you're Hillary Clinton and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got everyone trying to come up with dirt</v>

1700
01:13:36.831 --> 01:13:41.831
<v Speaker 2>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you do anything that was even </v>

1701
01:13:41.831 --> 01:13:42.860
<v Speaker 2>suspicious and yet they still walk that </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

1702
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1703
01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:44.700
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1704
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.700
<v Speaker 3>that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their patterns and their behavior and </v>

1705
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.131
<v Speaker 3>their attitudes towards things were </v>
<v Speaker 3>established in the 19 eighties when the </v>

1706
01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:55.251
<v Speaker 3>world was a much simpler place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can get away with what happened </v>

1707
01:13:55.251 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 3>in Mena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas with all that craziness,</v>

1708
01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:56.960
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1709
01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.710
<v Speaker 3>the dropping drugs out of airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1710
01:14:01.711 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know,</v>

1711
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 3>which is all part of that narco series,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narco series,</v>

1712
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody was in on it.</v>

1713
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy who got shot and killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is about to testify</v>

1714
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 4>for George Bush?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck was his name?</v>

1715
01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1716
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:18.880
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1717
01:14:18.881 --> 01:14:19.320
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1718
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 4>the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the drug pilot.</v>

1719
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 4>I remember the story of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dammit.</v>

1720
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:25.150
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the story though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1721
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:30.180
<v Speaker 4>So client assessment I into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously some people knew about this.</v>

1722
01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:36.061
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the CIA was involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy was involved with some cowboys </v>

1723
01:14:36.061 --> 01:14:40.081
<v Speaker 4>and the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were bringing drugs in from what </v>

1724
01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:40.081
<v Speaker 4>they were doing that during the Iran </v>
<v Speaker 4>contra thing in the 80.</v>

1725
01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 4>So it's not old news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1726
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:46.530
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so somehow or another that was </v>

1727
01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:49.420
<v Speaker 4>standard operational procedure at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>on some level,</v>

1728
01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:54.570
<v Speaker 4>whether it's rogue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rogue agents and the CIA or rogue people</v>

1729
01:14:54.701 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 4>in the government or whoever was </v>
<v Speaker 4>profiting on it.</v>

1730
01:14:57.670 --> 01:14:59.050
<v Speaker 4>And that was also of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was,</v>

1731
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:04.530
<v Speaker 4>what was going on in south central Los </v>
<v Speaker 4>Angeles during the contrast in the </v>

1732
01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:08.801
<v Speaker 4>center versus the Sandinista.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a relationship that they were </v>

1733
01:15:08.801 --> 01:15:11.641
<v Speaker 4>making money by selling drugs in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ghetto and they were taking that money </v>

1734
01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:15.511
<v Speaker 4>and it was directly affecting global </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics in a country that cared about </v>

1735
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:15.550
<v Speaker 4>reform.</v>

1736
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 4>How many of those things have to happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>before somebody would turn around and </v>

1737
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1738
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 4>we have a big problem and we have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>weed that problem,</v>

1739
01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:26.260
<v Speaker 4>so out of the CIA or whichever agency </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to,</v>

1740
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.240
<v Speaker 4>you want a name so that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen again.</v>

1741
01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:33.241
<v Speaker 4>When that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know I remember I'm looking into police </v>

1742
01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:34.690
<v Speaker 4>departments that had problems and in La </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was growing up,</v>

1743
01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.150
<v Speaker 4>you knew which ones to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1744
01:15:37.151 --> 01:15:39.340
<v Speaker 4>there was one in Signal Hill and we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew you don't.</v>

1745
01:15:39.341 --> 01:15:44.341
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to get pulled over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So eventually they had to disband the </v>

1746
01:15:44.341 --> 01:15:46.540
<v Speaker 4>whole police department and start from </v>
<v Speaker 4>scratch because every time they tried to</v>

1747
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:51.541
<v Speaker 4>reform it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a culture in that little </v>

1748
01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:54.030
<v Speaker 4>police department that absorbed new </v>
<v Speaker 4>members and the people that wouldn't </v>

1749
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:56.200
<v Speaker 4>become part of the culture ended up </v>
<v Speaker 4>transferring out or whatever.</v>

1750
01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:58.120
<v Speaker 4>And the people that worked with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture state.</v>

1751
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:02.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a microcosm of how all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant agencies work where,</v>

1752
01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 4>how do you change the culture of </v>
<v Speaker 4>something when you would have to get rid</v>

1753
01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:11.191
<v Speaker 4>of the people who are there now who all </v>
<v Speaker 4>bought in or they wouldn't still be </v>

1754
01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:11.360
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1755
01:16:11.361 --> 01:16:12.610
<v Speaker 4>you were saying about the mainframe </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>

1756
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:14.800
<v Speaker 4>If you wanted to start the CIA over </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

1757
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.590
<v Speaker 4>would you use any of the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it now?</v>

1758
01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.690
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to know because I think if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

1759
01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:21.940
<v Speaker 4>you'd end up with an agency that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

1760
01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:26.941
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're keeping America safe and if we </v>

1761
01:16:26.941 --> 01:16:28.750
<v Speaker 4>have to dose people with Lsd as happened</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the late fifties,</v>

1762
01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:32.560
<v Speaker 4>early 19 sixties as a way to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>that our people aren't dosed with Lsd,</v>

1763
01:16:32.561 --> 01:16:35.470
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the pilot was barry seal's.</v>

1764
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:36.240
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to remember it.</v>

1765
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:38.290
<v Speaker 4>So you're having the same problem by </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1766
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:41.410
<v Speaker 4>A little bit too many goddamn people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too much stuff in our brain.</v>

1767
01:16:41.411 --> 01:16:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Too much data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the.</v>

1768
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:49.080
<v Speaker 4>So the Clintons in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pretty much were able to get away </v>

1769
01:16:49.841 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 4>with pretty much whatever they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1770
01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:54.990
<v Speaker 4>they had so much immense power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1771
01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.160
<v Speaker 4>She's Arkansas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>governor of Arkansas.</v>

1772
01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was a frequent freaks,</v>

1773
01:16:58.931 --> 01:17:03.931
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just whipping his dick out all </v>

1774
01:17:03.931 --> 01:17:05.461
<v Speaker 4>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's funny is not exactly a </v>

1775
01:17:05.461 --> 01:17:07.190
<v Speaker 4>pipeline to the White House either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in that sense it was.</v>

1776
01:17:07.191 --> 01:17:09.190
<v Speaker 4>It was a little like getting somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

1777
01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mississippi as your president.</v>

1778
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 4>It's just a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1779
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1780
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.780
<v Speaker 4>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no doubt whatsoever,</v>

1781
01:17:14.781 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 4>but this time when all this stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on,</v>

1782
01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:24.340
<v Speaker 4>established their behavior patterns </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe and then will mean Arkansas of </v>

1783
01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:28.050
<v Speaker 4>course is where the CIA was dropped or </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in the CIA,</v>

1784
01:17:28.051 --> 01:17:29.120
<v Speaker 4>some rogue agent.</v>

1785
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:34.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was like a systemic </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing inside the CIA where the top of </v>

1786
01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.841
<v Speaker 4>the CIA was aware of it and condoned it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sanctioned in with someone was </v>

1787
01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 4>bringing in drugs and they bring it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs to Arkansas.</v>

1788
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:44.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a coincidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking governor of Arkansas gets </v>

1789
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:48.671
<v Speaker 4>fast track to becoming the president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably in some way related in </v>

1790
01:17:48.671 --> 01:17:50.690
<v Speaker 4>some some fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's.</v>

1791
01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:54.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's the most important </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect of his governorship,</v>

1792
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 4>but there's some connection there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be.</v>

1793
01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:02.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go look at Bill Clinton in the </v>

1794
01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.261
<v Speaker 4>primaries when he was basically chosen </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be the Democratic candidate to run </v>

1795
01:18:05.261 --> 01:18:09.671
<v Speaker 4>against the elder George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you look at those stiffs he was up </v>

1796
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:10.700
<v Speaker 4>against.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.080
<v Speaker 4>It's how it always is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1798
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:12.980
<v Speaker 4>when you look and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1799
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:18.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of people who I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>never vote for 2 million years and </v>

1800
01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:18.250
<v Speaker 4>there's one person who's got some </v>
<v Speaker 4>charisma.</v>

1801
01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how it happens that way.</v>

1802
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody wanted to say,</v>

1803
01:18:21.981 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the part that's rigged.</v>

1804
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Listen to the two parties who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>private entities that can do whatever </v>

1805
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:28.960
<v Speaker 4>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone said to me the other day,</v>

1806
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.380
<v Speaker 4>what happens if Hillary Clinton drops </v>
<v Speaker 4>out for health reasons?</v>

1807
01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.980
<v Speaker 4>You know who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who naturally does the job devolve to,</v>

1808
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:37.990
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever the Democratic National </v>

1809
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:37.990
<v Speaker 4>Committee wants it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really fascinating.</v>

1810
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:42.221
<v Speaker 4>When I was a registered Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make themselves out to be like a </v>

1811
01:18:42.221 --> 01:18:43.030
<v Speaker 4>constitutional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pillar of ours.</v>

1812
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:48.070
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're a private entity that can do </v>

1813
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:50.021
<v Speaker 4>what they want and they will do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want if they have to have that </v>

1814
01:18:50.021 --> 01:18:53.381
<v Speaker 4>comes down to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all the people that voted in the </v>

1815
01:18:53.381 --> 01:18:53.900
<v Speaker 4>primaries for hilary or Bernie or it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

1816
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 4>So now who are you being represented by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the king.</v>

1817
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Just choose someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1818
01:18:58.311 --> 01:19:00.530
<v Speaker 4>this is what you're down to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're down to like a monarchy.</v>

1819
01:19:00.730 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 4>Well you said the funding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've talked about the founding fathers</v>

1820
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:05.780
<v Speaker 4>earlier and I'm always blown away that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Madison,</v>

1821
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:09.710
<v Speaker 4>who's the guy who's most responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing the constitution was like 23.</v>

1822
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:12.500
<v Speaker 4>I was the most irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1823
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:17.530
<v Speaker 4>goof off in the world I think at 23.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you look at those guys and you </v>

1824
01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:21.401
<v Speaker 4>realize how much they had a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they called factions there version </v>

1825
01:19:21.401 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 4>of factions is what we would call </v>
<v Speaker 4>parties today.</v>

1826
01:19:22.581 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 4>And they thought it was poisonous and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet it was like a generation later.</v>

1827
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 4>And what did they have cropping up </v>
<v Speaker 4>factions.</v>

1828
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.250
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be a really difficult thing.</v>

1829
01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:36.251
<v Speaker 4>It must be an evolutionary natural thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to normally develop in a society like </v>

1830
01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:40.991
<v Speaker 4>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you decided that that was the </v>

1831
01:19:40.991 --> 01:19:43.721
<v Speaker 4>poison pill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could you write into the founding </v>

1832
01:19:43.721 --> 01:19:44.150
<v Speaker 4>documents that prevented that?</v>

1833
01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:45.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1834
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:50.501
<v Speaker 4>but to me that's the root of so much of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our evil in this country is we have two </v>

1835
01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:53.600
<v Speaker 4>parties that control a corrupt system </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in order to fix the corrupt system,</v>

1836
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.870
<v Speaker 4>the two parties would have to be on </v>
<v Speaker 4>board to do it.</v>

1837
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:58.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1838
01:19:58.071 --> 01:20:03.071
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually asking what if we said </v>

1839
01:20:03.071 --> 01:20:03.071
<v Speaker 4>the Fox to redesign the chicken coop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the Fox is interest.</v>

1840
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also what we were talking about,</v>

1841
01:20:04.521 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the CIA or the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're them to redesign this thing,</v>

1842
01:20:08.641 --> 01:20:10.510
<v Speaker 4>you're asking relinquished some pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1843
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 4>And to redesign it away where they can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get back into it.</v>

1844
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Even if they had to do it to save us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's when it gets really wiggy.</v>

1845
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:22.100
<v Speaker 4>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you spying on us anymore </v>

1846
01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.201
<v Speaker 4>and the next nine slash 11 attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have happened because they couldn't </v>

1847
01:20:24.201 --> 01:20:24.201
<v Speaker 4>spot on us.</v>

1848
01:20:24.201 --> 01:20:24.270
<v Speaker 4>You better believe they'll point that </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1849
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also if you had to redesign it,</v>

1850
01:20:26.671 --> 01:20:31.671
<v Speaker 4>you would have to eliminate some jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no way this thing is </v>

1851
01:20:31.671 --> 01:20:33.360
<v Speaker 4>operating at 100 percent efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody really audited it,</v>

1852
01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.940
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the CIA or the FBI or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>NSA,</v>

1853
01:20:36.941 --> 01:20:39.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean do 100 percent sure they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>their best,</v>

1854
01:20:39.511 --> 01:20:41.490
<v Speaker 4>but there's no way it's done really </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1855
01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:46.730
<v Speaker 4>It's just the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government fucks up almost </v>

1856
01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:46.730
<v Speaker 4>everything because most people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to work for the government.</v>

1857
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:49.050
<v Speaker 4>So who do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a bunch of people that,</v>

1858
01:20:49.051 --> 01:20:49.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1859
01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1860
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:56.060
<v Speaker 4>is anybody clamoring to be the guy at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the NSA that gets to read Dan Carlin's </v>

1861
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:56.850
<v Speaker 4>email?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>

1862
01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I think what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a better way to put it as it's </v>

1863
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.741
<v Speaker 4>the systems decline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it just deteriorates over time </v>

1864
01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:03.741
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1865
01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Every system is remarkably hard to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and fix and the government,</v>

1866
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 4>especially as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got 240 years of,</v>

1867
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:14.210
<v Speaker 4>of deadwood and you don't often go in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and have a spring cleaning </v>

1868
01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:14.210
<v Speaker 4>session.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1869
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:16.950
<v Speaker 4>and I think the founding fathers were </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who were aware,</v>

1870
01:21:16.951 --> 01:21:21.951
<v Speaker 4>they used to talk about lifespans of </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries and so you know that computer </v>

1871
01:21:21.951 --> 01:21:26.151
<v Speaker 4>analogy we use as a pretty good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an old computer that we've </v>

1872
01:21:26.151 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 4>patched many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many times and also tasked to do many,</v>

1873
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 4>many more things in the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever envisioned because you have a great</v>

1874
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:36.381
<v Speaker 4>depression or you have a second world </v>
<v Speaker 4>war or you have nuclear weapons appear </v>

1875
01:21:36.381 --> 01:21:40.461
<v Speaker 4>on the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all of a sudden we have a flexible </v>

1876
01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:40.650
<v Speaker 4>constitution to deal with unforseeables </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you pointed out.</v>

1877
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how flexible is it?</v>

1878
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean at what point have you stretched </v>
<v Speaker 4>it so far that it's become a fig leaf?</v>

1879
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.510
<v Speaker 4>I try to remind people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did a whole series on the decline and</v>

1880
01:21:48.511 --> 01:21:53.511
<v Speaker 4>fall of the Roman republic and what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people don't know is that when </v>

1881
01:21:53.511 --> 01:21:55.320
<v Speaker 4>the Roman Empire first appeared in for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time afterwards,</v>

1882
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.980
<v Speaker 4>they kept all the forms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Senators were still elected.</v>

1883
01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have an all powerful emperor,</v>

1884
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:06.530
<v Speaker 4>but they still went through the process </v>
<v Speaker 4>of electing senators as though nothing </v>

1885
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.990
<v Speaker 4>had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They still held elections,</v>

1886
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 4>they still had people giving money to </v>
<v Speaker 4>senators to give them favors,</v>

1887
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 4>but we had a system in Rome as if I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1888
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 4>but at that point it was a total </v>
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship,</v>

1889
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.460
<v Speaker 4>but we elected senators anyway because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the forms had a long and noble tradition</v>

1890
01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:26.400
<v Speaker 4>that was tied to the way Roman saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves the same way.</v>

1891
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 4>We're tied to that 19 fifties high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school textbook of who we are.</v>

1892
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:35.570
<v Speaker 4>If we had a dictator someday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would never be able to get rid of </v>

1893
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:36.360
<v Speaker 4>senators and because the forms are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1894
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:41.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the biggest fears about </v>

1895
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:41.630
<v Speaker 4>the Patriot Act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Patriot Act two as well,</v>

1896
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:44.160
<v Speaker 4>is that if something did happen in </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial law was declared,</v>

1897
01:22:44.161 --> 01:22:49.161
<v Speaker 4>would we really have the same system </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we think we have when we have that </v>

1898
01:22:49.161 --> 01:22:53.991
<v Speaker 4>19 fifties textbook version of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or would we really have a military </v>

1899
01:22:53.991 --> 01:22:57.000
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship that's disguised?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just read a book,</v>

1900
01:22:57.001 --> 01:23:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it was called American coup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know back 20 years ago,</v>

1901
01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 4>people who wrote those books were </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy people who had no real.</v>

1902
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 4>Now the people writing those books are </v>
<v Speaker 4>all insiders and they have</v>

1903
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.770
<v Speaker 2>generals writing blurbs on the back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

1904
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.280
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a boring book because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks so much about fema and Katrina and</v>

1905
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:17.281
<v Speaker 2>all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes when you're diagramming </v>

1906
01:23:17.281 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 2>how these things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not spy thriller type stuff.</v>

1907
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.410
<v Speaker 2>It's really sometimes run of the mill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had this problem.</v>

1908
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 2>We had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His point is that we've been living in a</v>

1909
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:31.141
<v Speaker 2>society that's operating between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines in the constitution for 50 years </v>

1910
01:23:31.141 --> 01:23:36.121
<v Speaker 2>now and that the government is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely petrified about all the </v>

1911
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:39.790
<v Speaker 2>threats out there to us and in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect us.</v>

1912
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Things like little writings on hemp </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper from 240 years ago are not going </v>

1913
01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:49.441
<v Speaker 2>to stand in the way of us protecting us </v>
<v Speaker 2>from another nine slash 11 or a nuclear </v>

1914
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.110
<v Speaker 2>bomb going off in a harbor or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1915
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 2>When of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument to that is like,</v>

1916
01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 2>of course you're going to say you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting us.</v>

1917
01:23:54.251 --> 01:23:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Of course that's sometimes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you're not,</v>

1918
01:23:57.731 --> 01:24:00.970
<v Speaker 2>but how convenient is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are also controlling</v>

1919
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:06.030
<v Speaker 3>vast amounts of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling so much of the ability of </v>

1920
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:10.360
<v Speaker 3>the United States citizens to to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>their jobs,</v>

1921
01:24:10.361 --> 01:24:12.130
<v Speaker 3>to get through life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1922
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:17.340
<v Speaker 3>to do anything they want to do without </v>
<v Speaker 3>being infringed on by this group of </v>

1923
01:24:17.771 --> 01:24:22.390
<v Speaker 3>people that sort of got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got elected in some sort of a weird,</v>

1924
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:27.391
<v Speaker 3>strange way in an antiquated system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really make any sense anymore </v>

1925
01:24:27.391 --> 01:24:29.290
<v Speaker 3>and there's only really held accountable</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to a certain extent.</v>

1926
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:34.650
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the weirder aspects about </v>
<v Speaker 3>real government corruption because the </v>

1927
01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:38.140
<v Speaker 3>real corruption as the legal shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the ledger,</v>

1928
01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:43.141
<v Speaker 3>showing what people did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what and what they received for those </v>

1929
01:24:43.141 --> 01:24:47.191
<v Speaker 3>donations and how much they gave and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much they got out of it and how they </v>

1930
01:24:47.191 --> 01:24:50.371
<v Speaker 3>became like that is how is that legal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>insider trading is illegal.</v>

1931
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:56.320
<v Speaker 3>How is that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Martha Quinn goes to jail,</v>

1932
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.000
<v Speaker 3>not Martha Quinn.</v>

1933
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.830
<v Speaker 3>She went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1934
01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.770
<v Speaker 3>the MTC zero j from MTV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martha Stewart rather goes to jail for a</v>

1935
01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:04.720
<v Speaker 3>stock trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1936
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:09.750
<v Speaker 3>where she was not honest about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that she knew about </v>

1937
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.090
<v Speaker 3>profiting off of stocks rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1938
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.000
<v Speaker 3>it's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the disparity.</v>

1939
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.240
<v Speaker 3>It's insane how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much weird corruption is just </v>

1940
01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.740
<v Speaker 3>entangled into the system that the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to get rid of what would have to be </v>

1941
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you would have to stop all those jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

1942
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:31.650
<v Speaker 3>that evolve around all that money coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and you're dealing with untold </v>

1943
01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:35.881
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars and that it's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>siphoned from the system by all these </v>

1944
01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:40.351
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lobbyists and all the special </v>

1945
01:25:40.351 --> 01:25:42.961
<v Speaker 3>interest groups that constantly work in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Washington hive to extract those </v>

1946
01:25:42.961 --> 01:25:43.960
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At this point,</v>

1947
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.670
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible without a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>reset of the system.</v>

1948
01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at how.</v>

1949
01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Look at how things changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1950
01:25:51.451 --> 01:25:53.700
<v Speaker 2>when the founding fathers set up war </v>
<v Speaker 2>powers,</v>

1951
01:25:53.701 --> 01:25:55.680
<v Speaker 2>which they understood to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing,</v>

1952
01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.340
<v Speaker 2>they separated the part where we decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to war from the power of fighting </v>

1953
01:26:01.711 --> 01:26:03.800
<v Speaker 2>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they gave the power to fight the war</v>

1954
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:05.630
<v Speaker 2>to the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the commander in chief,</v>

1955
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 2>but they did not give him the power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to go to war.</v>

1956
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too much power for one guy.</v>

1957
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 2>They gave that to Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Congress has the power to declare war</v>

1958
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.080
<v Speaker 2>once they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president has really extreme </v>

1959
01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.811
<v Speaker 2>emergency authority to fight the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Harry Truman took us into Korea in </v>

1960
01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:27.431
<v Speaker 2>1950,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called it a police action and he </v>

1961
01:26:27.431 --> 01:26:31.481
<v Speaker 2>called it a police action because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to declare a war to have a </v>

1962
01:26:31.481 --> 01:26:32.230
<v Speaker 2>police action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he sent the united.</v>

1963
01:26:32.231 --> 01:26:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean we lost 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys or something in Korea.</v>

1964
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1965
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.790
<v Speaker 2>a lot more Koreans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1966
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:40.040
<v Speaker 2>once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've never declared war again.</v>

1967
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:43.070
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no president even throws that out there,</v>

1968
01:26:43.071 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 2>that they would love to have a support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a declaration of support by Congress.</v>

1969
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.580
<v Speaker 2>But once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1970
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:53.650
<v Speaker 2>you break an important wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall that says that the president </v>

1971
01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:56.561
<v Speaker 2>has basically unlimited powers and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and now he has the right to decide </v>

1972
01:26:56.561 --> 01:27:00.761
<v Speaker 2>when war time is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a firewall that had been built </v>

1973
01:27:00.761 --> 01:27:03.230
<v Speaker 2>into the system that once it's broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can never repair that.</v>

1974
01:27:03.231 --> 01:27:08.231
<v Speaker 2>You can never go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress has no way to repair that </v>

1975
01:27:08.231 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 2>firewall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now somebody said to me,</v>

1976
01:27:08.481 --> 01:27:13.481
<v Speaker 2>if donald trump's elected president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can he use a nuclear bomb against a </v>

1977
01:27:13.481 --> 01:27:17.561
<v Speaker 2>country or could he decide I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>scare the heck out of North Korea and </v>

1978
01:27:17.561 --> 01:27:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to know drop a bomb off their </v>
<v Speaker 2>coast?</v>

1979
01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he can do it without asking anybody </v>

1980
01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 2>and the only people that might tell him </v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1981
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Are the military and the military starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the president,</v>

1982
01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:32.201
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost as scary as a president </v>

1983
01:27:32.201 --> 01:27:32.201
<v Speaker 2>that can drop a nuclear bomb whenever he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to.</v>

1984
01:27:32.201 --> 01:27:36.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the founder's construction of the </v>

1985
01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.580
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In in their mind,</v>

1986
01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 2>you would have had to have gone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress and say,</v>

1987
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:42.080
<v Speaker 2>can we drop a nuclear bomb on North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea?</v>

1988
01:27:42.081 --> 01:27:47.081
<v Speaker 2>And then Congress would have voted </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided and then the president would </v>

1989
01:27:47.081 --> 01:27:47.270
<v Speaker 2>have been empowered to take whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>measures are necessary.</v>

1990
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've that firewall is gone.</v>

1991
01:27:49.521 --> 01:27:52.730
<v Speaker 2>The president has extreme emergency </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority in foreign policy.</v>

1992
01:27:52.731 --> 01:27:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Now he didn't have to ask Congress for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1993
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.400
<v Speaker 2>There's only one thing congress can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the power of the purse so they</v>

1994
01:27:58.401 --> 01:28:03.401
<v Speaker 2>can cut off the funds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can you imagine our troops say in </v>

1995
01:28:03.401 --> 01:28:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Iraq or Afghanistan and the congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want them there anymore,</v>

1996
01:28:05.601 --> 01:28:10.601
<v Speaker 2>so the choice they have is to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>sending a meals and replacement bullets </v>

1997
01:28:10.601 --> 01:28:11.600
<v Speaker 2>and it's not going to happen.</v>

1998
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:16.040
<v Speaker 2>So those are the ways that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution gets destroyed.</v>

1999
01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 2>And Truman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2000
01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.550
<v Speaker 2>you look at what we mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CIA,</v>

2001
01:28:19.551 --> 01:28:24.551
<v Speaker 2>the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that power truman did more damage to </v>

2002
01:28:24.551 --> 01:28:27.881
<v Speaker 2>this country and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one presidency than anyone I can </v>

2003
01:28:27.881 --> 01:28:27.881
<v Speaker 2>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2004
01:28:27.881 --> 01:28:31.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I cut him some slack because he </v>

2005
01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:32.020
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world had never existed.</v>

2006
01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It existed in his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a whole new challenges to deal </v>

2007
01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:40.541
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when Obama came into office </v>

2008
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.020
<v Speaker 2>and promised to undo the extremes of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>previous administration,</v>

2009
01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.600
<v Speaker 2>had he done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have said,</v>

2010
01:28:44.601 --> 01:28:45.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 happened.</v>

2011
01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>We freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we fixed it,</v>

2012
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2013
01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 2>we got our balance back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By not doing that,</v>

2014
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:53.930
<v Speaker 2>he caught a fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's the rule,</v>

2015
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:55.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When both parties agree on something,</v>

2016
01:28:55.791 --> 01:29:00.791
<v Speaker 2>it becomes the way we do things now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if Truman had left office and </v>

2017
01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Eisenhower had come in as a member of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other party and</v>

2018
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.000
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2019
01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 4>the CIA thing is more like an American </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gestapo,</v>

2020
01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

2021
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:10.500
<v Speaker 4>Truman is a blip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when he decides to embrace the CIA,</v>

2022
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 4>now that's the way we do business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if the two parties don't sort of look</v>

2023
01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 4>out for each other and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2024
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:18.870
<v Speaker 4>nine slash 11 is a one off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strange experience,</v>

2025
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:24.110
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we understand how somebody could </v>

2026
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:24.180
<v Speaker 4>overreact and freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll fix it and instead say,</v>

2027
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll keep things the way they are.</v>

2028
01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.630
<v Speaker 4>Then you take it another step down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another firewall has been broken in.</v>

2029
01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.280
<v Speaker 4>The constitution has been stretched </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2030
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:37.520
<v Speaker 4>to the point where there were big holes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now is there a fourth amendment </v>

2031
01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:40.461
<v Speaker 4>anymore really mean there's amendments </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the constitution and people will say </v>

2032
01:29:40.461 --> 01:29:40.461
<v Speaker 4>to me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan,</v>

2033
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:45.950
<v Speaker 4>you say our freedoms going away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me when we repealed in amendment </v>

2034
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.950
<v Speaker 4>doesn't work that way.</v>

2035
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Rome didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2036
01:29:46.411 --> 01:29:48.990
<v Speaker 4>They kept the senators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the forms stay,</v>

2037
01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.160
<v Speaker 4>but the reality can be changed mightily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2038
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it seems like once it's changed,</v>

2039
01:29:57.570 --> 01:30:02.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that old saying about a power </v>

2040
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.570
<v Speaker 4>loss never recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly where,</v>

2041
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:03.960
<v Speaker 4>and let's understand something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

2042
01:30:03.961 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 4>let's not take the American people off </v>
<v Speaker 4>the blame list.</v>

2043
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.720
<v Speaker 4>If another nine slash 11 happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to go and call for the </v>

2044
01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 4>heads of the people that voted against </v>
<v Speaker 4>spying on,</v>

2045
01:30:12.481 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how we are.</v>

2046
01:30:14.071 --> 01:30:19.071
<v Speaker 4>We're such a panicky people that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>not willing to suck up a lot of </v>

2047
01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:19.740
<v Speaker 4>casualties if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's what's required to defend some</v>

2048
01:30:19.741 --> 01:30:24.741
<v Speaker 4>of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to say you can't spy on </v>

2049
01:30:24.741 --> 01:30:24.741
<v Speaker 4>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just understand some nasty Americans are</v>

2050
01:30:24.741 --> 01:30:29.391
<v Speaker 4>going to get fertilizer bombs and blow </v>
<v Speaker 4>up stuff sometimes because they slipped </v>

2051
01:30:29.391 --> 01:30:31.320
<v Speaker 4>through that protection for you and me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone else.</v>

2052
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:33.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if over time,</v>

2053
01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 4>like going back to that battleship </v>
<v Speaker 4>analogy,</v>

2054
01:30:35.131 --> 01:30:40.131
<v Speaker 4>like that's going to be the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that clears this up is that the people </v>

2055
01:30:40.131 --> 01:30:43.071
<v Speaker 4>that started getting elected into office</v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with the new level of transparency </v>

2056
01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:46.230
<v Speaker 4>and the people that are growing up now </v>
<v Speaker 4>who will eventually become politicians.</v>

2057
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:51.470
<v Speaker 4>They grow up in a different world and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>their view of what's possible and not </v>

2058
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:55.440
<v Speaker 4>possible is very different than like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about the Clintons who kind</v>

2059
01:30:55.450 --> 01:31:00.450
<v Speaker 4>of had an open pass to kind of do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of shit that they wanted to do back in </v>

2060
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:06.201
<v Speaker 4>the 19 eighties and the nineties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still kind of operating like </v>

2061
01:31:06.201 --> 01:31:10.041
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton and the Clintons just kind of </v>

2062
01:31:10.041 --> 01:31:11.370
<v Speaker 4>doing their thing and it's like if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the difference between here's.</v>

2063
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:16.820
<v Speaker 4>This is not a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the difference between </v>

2064
01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.850
<v Speaker 4>what Hillary Clinton says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the FBI found out about her emails </v>

2065
01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:25.490
<v Speaker 4>versus what the FBI says about what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>found out about Hillary Clinton's </v>

2066
01:31:25.741 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 4>emails.</v>

2067
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:30.120
<v Speaker 4>Someone's lying and I don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the FBI.</v>

2068
01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Someone's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like her version of it is a lie.</v>

2069
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:38.600
<v Speaker 4>It's just not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what she's saying is not what </v>

2070
01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.951
<v Speaker 4>they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the assumption built into that </v>

2071
01:31:42.951 --> 01:31:45.471
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The assumption is that I know that </v>

2072
01:31:45.471 --> 01:31:48.321
<v Speaker 4>that's not the real spin that the FBI </v>
<v Speaker 4>director put on it and the five percent </v>

2073
01:31:48.321 --> 01:31:50.880
<v Speaker 4>of Americans who read newspapers know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's not the spin,</v>

2074
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:56.270
<v Speaker 4>but the majority of people that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to reach will simply hear what I </v>

2075
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 4>say and if they want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing.</v>

2076
01:31:58.111 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all have.</v>

2077
01:31:59.831 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 4>If</v>

2078
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 2>you want to support that candidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

2079
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:07.020
<v Speaker 2>you're inclined to believe what they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>and disinclined to believe what the </v>

2080
01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.501
<v Speaker 2>other guy says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the problem about the </v>

2081
01:32:10.501 --> 01:32:12.661
<v Speaker 2>binary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesser of two evils thing we get into </v>

2082
01:32:12.661 --> 01:32:13.390
<v Speaker 2>because Hillary Clinton is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most unpopular candidates.</v>

2083
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell,</v>

2084
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have two daughters and they constantly</v>

2085
01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:21.571
<v Speaker 2>asked me these really uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about why don't we have women </v>

2086
01:32:21.571 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 2>presidents and all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm all in favor of that.</v>

2087
01:32:21.971 --> 01:32:23.420
<v Speaker 2>And I have a lot of women who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2088
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2089
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:29.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most qualified candidate we've ever </v>

2090
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.430
<v Speaker 2>had for high offices is all just sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I try to tell them is,</v>

2091
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 2>is this really the person you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poster child though,</v>

2092
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>as the first woman president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'll tell you what,</v>

2093
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 2>if current trends continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't imagine Republicans are going to</v>

2094
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 2>lay up on her at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2095
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:45.750
<v Speaker 2>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire Clinton administration was </v>

2096
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.750
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans trying to get them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2097
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Speaker 2>So imagine she gets elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that they continue to hound her </v>

2098
01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 2>the way they do and remembering that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to walk that line,</v>

2099
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:52.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being the Clintons,</v>

2100
01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:57.840
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing in their travel gates at Rose </v>

2101
01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Hill law firms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's going to be something they </v>

2102
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:01.320
<v Speaker 2>find eventually they will impeach her </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

2103
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 2>And if she's the first woman president </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be impeached,</v>

2104
01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>how does that help you as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2105
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>if the first African American president </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been impeached,</v>

2106
01:33:08.741 --> 01:33:10.120
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't look very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2107
01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And I got to say President Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2108
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot of stuff he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a scandal standpoint,</v>

2109
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.560
<v Speaker 2>he'd been pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2110
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.520
<v Speaker 2>by if you grade these people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>curve,</v>

2111
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.980
<v Speaker 2>his scandal record's been pretty good.</v>

2112
01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:23.740
<v Speaker 2>If you don't count accidental deaths and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drones,</v>

2113
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.130
<v Speaker 2>that's not a scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That standard operating procedure.</v>

2114
01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:28.310
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we do.</v>

2115
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 2>That's foreign policy baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2116
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.930
<v Speaker 2>that's not a a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a feature.</v>

2117
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.960
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like a scandal when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out the numbers of innocent people </v>

2118
01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.220
<v Speaker 2>killed by drones and how many have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the,</v>

2119
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:42.880
<v Speaker 2>the real issues with him saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was gonna support whistleblowers.</v>

2120
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they've actually done with and </v>

2121
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.910
<v Speaker 2>blowers and how hard they've been on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of the press has been a very,</v>

2122
01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:53.020
<v Speaker 2>very confusing time for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were Obama supporters eight years </v>

2123
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:53.530
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thought like,</v>

2124
01:33:53.531 --> 01:33:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the answer.</v>

2125
01:33:55.301 --> 01:34:00.301
<v Speaker 2>Like finally we have the super </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate young guy who has a view of </v>

2126
01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.100
<v Speaker 2>the world that's similar to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2127
01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.950
<v Speaker 2>he said all the right things when he ran</v>
<v Speaker 2>for office.</v>

2128
01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.070
<v Speaker 2>And but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2129
01:34:06.071 --> 01:34:11.071
<v Speaker 2>what he had said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go and overturn the </v>

2130
01:34:11.071 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 2>mistakes of the previous administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had he done that,</v>

2131
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:15.130
<v Speaker 2>he would have reestablished a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>firewalls that we ripped apart.</v>

2132
01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 2>It's always interesting to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorize why that didn't happen.</v>

2133
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:21.340
<v Speaker 2>People love to tell you those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2134
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:23.890
<v Speaker 2>they took him in the back room and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed him the Kennedy assassination.</v>

2135
01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Said any questions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Bill Hicks bit,</v>

2136
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of you can say,</v>

2137
01:34:29.441 --> 01:34:31.000
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took him in the back room and said,</v>

2138
01:34:31.001 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 2>here are the threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stopped last month.</v>

2139
01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you really want to do what you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you don't,</v>

2140
01:34:34.841 --> 01:34:37.090
<v Speaker 2>but you would love the president to at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least say,</v>

2141
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:42.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hold a televised press </v>

2142
01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.431
<v Speaker 2>conference now and I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here is what I said when I ran for </v>

2143
01:34:44.431 --> 01:34:45.970
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why I can't do it right when they</v>

2144
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:46.980
<v Speaker 2>don't though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but what was going to say when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that,</v>

2146
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:51.340
<v Speaker 2>you open up the door to what the hell's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2147
01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:56.820
<v Speaker 2>He gave you this small promise and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>small promise and maybe a healthcare </v>

2148
01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:00.240
<v Speaker 2>reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said he was going to essentially </v>

2149
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:00.240
<v Speaker 2>repair</v>

2150
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the constitution and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the story?</v>

2151
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:35:02.571 --> 01:35:03.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2153
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:07.560
<v Speaker 1>it's just so hard to guess and he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to tell you.</v>

2154
01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of those things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gonna all have to debate about to </v>

2155
01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the end of time and then go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angry.</v>

2156
01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as everyone says,</v>

2157
01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:19.091
<v Speaker 1>the what happens when you get the truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly without limits candidate into </v>

2158
01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:21.880
<v Speaker 1>office without those firewalls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2159
01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to say,</v>

2160
01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 1>listen to the president can drop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear bomb on anybody wants to </v>

2161
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.721
<v Speaker 1>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to have a president </v>

2162
01:35:31.721 --> 01:35:31.721
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2163
01:35:31.721 --> 01:35:31.721
<v Speaker 1>I can drop a nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

2164
01:35:31.721 --> 01:35:32.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that.</v>

2165
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's also hard to understand like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen a guy like trump,</v>

2166
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get back to the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 1>Foundation before I forget,</v>

2167
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:43.840
<v Speaker 1>but while were you seeing a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and you listened to the people </v>

2168
01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.981
<v Speaker 1>that have actually interviewed him or </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to him and have conversations </v>

2169
01:35:47.981 --> 01:35:47.981
<v Speaker 1>with him?</v>

2170
01:35:47.981 --> 01:35:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what,</v>

2171
01:35:48.681 --> 01:35:51.530
<v Speaker 1>head of military that he was discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with what he was talking about,</v>

2172
01:35:51.531 --> 01:35:53.550
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2173
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:55.610
<v Speaker 1>we just use nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That line.</v>

2174
01:35:55.611 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:35:56.001 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard about that,</v>

2176
01:35:57.111 --> 01:36:00.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wonder like what was the tone of</v>

2177
01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:01.580
<v Speaker 1>that discussion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2178
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're just being curious versus.</v>

2179
01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2180
01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 1>or was he being silly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2181
01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's Donald Trump,</v>

2182
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a charmer.</v>

2183
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 1>So he's this public figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He meets people,</v>

2184
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he talks to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts on this persona.</v>

2185
01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:20.951
<v Speaker 1>Obviously a lot of this stuff he says in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways he's like a comedian </v>

2186
01:36:20.951 --> 01:36:25.550
<v Speaker 1>because he's saying so many things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and whether or not he believes it</v>

2187
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:30.551
<v Speaker 1>or not is not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is they're going to get a big </v>

2188
01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:30.551
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to kill,</v>

2189
01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:30.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2190
01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:33.830
<v Speaker 1>So I told the president of Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall just got 10 foot higher.</v>

2191
01:36:34.230 --> 01:36:36.560
<v Speaker 1>He's doing stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing lines.</v>

2192
01:36:36.561 --> 01:36:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Those are punchlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2193
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:42.820
<v Speaker 1>It might not be that funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got it's a punch and he's </v>

2194
01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:45.890
<v Speaker 1>saying those in weird places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's saying like it's,</v>

2195
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:50.950
<v Speaker 1>it's part of what makes him interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he's like this weird entertainer</v>

2196
01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:53.660
<v Speaker 1>that's hijack the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say interesting.</v>

2197
01:36:53.661 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like a very generous use of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

2198
01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2199
01:36:56.790 --> 01:37:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what interests be though we should </v>

2200
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.790
<v Speaker 1>get these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because,</v>

2201
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter,</v>

2202
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:07.270
<v Speaker 1>some of the trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't ever want a broad brush </v>

2203
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:09.701
<v Speaker 1>because I know a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to vote for trump that are old </v>

2204
01:37:09.701 --> 01:37:09.701
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find people that are,</v>

2205
01:37:09.701 --> 01:37:10.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's certainly a,</v>

2206
01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:15.230
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an edge on some of those people that </v>

2207
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:15.230
<v Speaker 1>support them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2208
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:15.230
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has certain racism,</v>

2209
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:15.470
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things.</v>

2210
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:17.360
<v Speaker 1>We see them on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2211
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2212
01:37:18.621 --> 01:37:20.590
<v Speaker 1>when one of them was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2213
01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:22.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Donald Trump is this,</v>

2214
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they conservative is one of the words </v>

2215
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:27.800
<v Speaker 1>they like to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

2216
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:28.270
<v Speaker 1>all those kinds of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2217
01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:33.290
<v Speaker 1>but to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no American who understands the United </v>

2218
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:35.630
<v Speaker 1>States well would want to vote for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong man.</v>

2219
01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 1>That whole attitude of wanting some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong man figure is unamerican is I can</v>

2220
01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:41.810
<v Speaker 1>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go study your,</v>

2221
01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:46.940
<v Speaker 1>your Roman republic history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the strong men riding in on a </v>

2222
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.800
<v Speaker 1>white horse that really signaled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the end.</v>

2223
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:49.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2224
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:53.280
<v Speaker 1>don't anyone who wants too much power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and promises to use it to.</v>

2225
01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>That's somebody to be afraid of in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>book</v>

2226
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.610
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2227
01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.000
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not a measured person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not want some strong man.</v>

2228
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Well this is things that he says that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2229
01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 3>that he's just trying to get a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

2230
01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.160
<v Speaker 3>what did he say about Mccain as that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes people that didn't get caught.</v>

2231
01:38:09.931 --> 01:38:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you saying?</v>

2232
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.830
<v Speaker 3>When he was basically a guy who get five</v>
<v Speaker 3>deferments or whatever it had that's a,</v>

2233
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:18.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll say,</v>

2234
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:22.800
<v Speaker 3>well what else does that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also what he does.</v>

2235
01:38:22.801 --> 01:38:25.410
<v Speaker 3>He says those outrageous things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hits those punches.</v>

2236
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:30.411
<v Speaker 3>Will someone's raping him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he's got like these punchlines </v>

2237
01:38:30.411 --> 01:38:34.070
<v Speaker 3>was up against on the primary stage with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of stiff robotic people </v>

2238
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:37.821
<v Speaker 3>repeating talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a little like Clinton wasn't his </v>

2239
01:38:37.821 --> 01:38:37.821
<v Speaker 3>primary is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2240
01:38:37.821 --> 01:38:42.100
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the early nineties when when it's a </v>

2241
01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:44.181
<v Speaker 3>bunch of deadbeats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stiff cardboard cutout pretend figures </v>

2242
01:38:44.181 --> 01:38:48.020
<v Speaker 3>and one person that you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to say next and that </v>

2243
01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:48.020
<v Speaker 3>becomes interesting.</v>

2244
01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:51.620
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>charismatic type people that we are so </v>

2245
01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 3>attracted to really are not what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want as a leader.</v>

2246
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:59.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't want that person that needs so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much attention that they polish their </v>

2247
01:38:59.450 --> 01:39:02.841
<v Speaker 3>persona to a point where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly influential because a lot of </v>

2248
01:39:02.841 --> 01:39:04.350
<v Speaker 3>that persona,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that when you're seeing is it's</v>

2249
01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.870
<v Speaker 3>like they're entertainers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what it is.</v>

2250
01:39:06.871 --> 01:39:11.871
<v Speaker 3>When you're a really charismatic person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've figured out a way to speak in a </v>

2251
01:39:11.871 --> 01:39:14.490
<v Speaker 3>way that people like you more and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've.</v>

2252
01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 3>You've exercised that to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a well honed muscle with incredible</v>

2253
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:21.420
<v Speaker 3>endurance and you have a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity to how people are perceiving</v>

2254
01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:26.421
<v Speaker 3>you so you know how to come across as </v>
<v Speaker 3>noble and patriotic and brilliant and </v>

2255
01:39:26.421 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all know that some of the things that</v>

2256
01:39:27.991 --> 01:39:30.510
<v Speaker 3>people say like standard things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

2257
01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:35.511
<v Speaker 3>there's some of them that you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't even be able to say anymore </v>

2258
01:39:35.511 --> 01:39:38.510
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't mean anything and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be allowed to just hijack </v>

2259
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:39.660
<v Speaker 3>those words and just use it to gain </v>
<v Speaker 3>merit.</v>

2260
01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Like God bless our troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck do you mean?</v>

2261
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:45.360
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by the national anthem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people freak out over that,</v>

2262
01:39:45.361 --> 01:39:46.020
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2263
01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd be nice if we freaked out a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit about what these songs and flags and</v>

2264
01:39:49.261 --> 01:39:54.261
<v Speaker 3>symbols represent instead of freaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out over the symbol and ignoring the </v>

2265
01:39:54.261 --> 01:39:54.261
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2266
01:39:54.261 --> 01:39:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you when we're talking about a</v>

2267
01:39:55.591 --> 01:40:00.591
<v Speaker 3>person who's an incredible position of </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence and they're saying these </v>

2268
01:40:00.591 --> 01:40:02.400
<v Speaker 3>things that are kind of not like a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentence.</v>

2269
01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:07.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not really what you thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just knew that other people have </v>

2270
01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.130
<v Speaker 3>said that it's something you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're saying it,</v>

2271
01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.080
<v Speaker 3>but you're saying it about a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing.</v>

2272
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You're saying about the young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children,</v>

2273
01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:17.541
<v Speaker 3>of all the people that are here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 18 year old kids that are sent over </v>

2274
01:40:17.541 --> 01:40:20.460
<v Speaker 3>there to shoot people they've never met </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're saying,</v>

2275
01:40:20.490 --> 01:40:22.080
<v Speaker 3>God bless those people.</v>

2276
01:40:22.410 --> 01:40:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Who is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is God?</v>

2277
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Are you saying the invisible man in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky with the harp?</v>

2278
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:31.610
<v Speaker 3>Is that who you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying God bless our kids to </v>

2279
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.600
<v Speaker 3>go kill other people's kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure that that's how you want to</v>

2280
01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:38.601
<v Speaker 3>say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you just wanted to have this open </v>

2281
01:40:38.601 --> 01:40:41.361
<v Speaker 3>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless our troops to do I want our </v>

2282
01:40:41.361 --> 01:40:44.031
<v Speaker 3>troops to be safe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course do what do I wish that we </v>

2283
01:40:44.031 --> 01:40:44.031
<v Speaker 3>didn't have to use them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have to have.</v>

2284
01:40:44.031 --> 01:40:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a.</v>

2285
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:48.660
<v Speaker 3>not a negative in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form towards the military,</v>

2286
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:51.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's these expressions that leaders </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just.</v>

2287
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 3>They are freely to plug into.</v>

2288
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like a happy birthday to you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a weird like youtube.</v>

2289
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:01.210
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with massive issues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are super,</v>

2290
01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:06.420
<v Speaker 2>like not just charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the consequences of being wrong or </v>

2291
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or being unsuccessful or massive to just</v>

2292
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:11.280
<v Speaker 2>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned something I,</v>

2293
01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I've always found very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2294
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:16.500
<v Speaker 2>which is the charisma of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

2295
01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a poly sci professor back in college who</v>

2296
01:41:18.821 --> 01:41:23.821
<v Speaker 2>happened to be a German guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was sort of viewing our system </v>

2297
01:41:23.821 --> 01:41:24.120
<v Speaker 2>from outside our system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2298
01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:29.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how I used to take such a </v>

2299
01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:30.300
<v Speaker 2>problem with you Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you have a president that combines </v>

2300
01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.290
<v Speaker 2>two jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were a European country,</v>

2301
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 2>that would be two jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the bean counter guy,</v>

2302
01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:37.360
<v Speaker 2>the one you were mentioning how you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be president,</v>

2303
01:41:37.361 --> 01:41:42.361
<v Speaker 2>the one that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's maybe not so great at the big </v>

2304
01:41:42.361 --> 01:41:44.731
<v Speaker 2>speeches and you don't want that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to the funerals and representing </v>

2305
01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:44.731
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2306
01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have in Europe,</v>

2307
01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.720
<v Speaker 2>chancellors or presidents that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people physically represent the soul.</v>

2308
01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:51.310
<v Speaker 2>They go to the funerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>

2309
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you want John Wayne to be that guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you want some bean counter to be </v>

2310
01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.990
<v Speaker 2>the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in your country you require both of </v>

2311
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:00.990
<v Speaker 2>those things in the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2312
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:03.670
<v Speaker 2>do you know how often you get John Wayne</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is also a bean counter?</v>

2313
01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:05.140
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your problem.</v>

2314
01:42:05.141 --> 01:42:10.141
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up usually electing the John </v>

2315
01:42:10.141 --> 01:42:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Wayne and wishing you had a bean </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>

2316
01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:11.920
<v Speaker 2>So I mean in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2317
01:42:11.921 --> 01:42:14.200
<v Speaker 2>those are two separate jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

2318
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was getting at by the expressions</v>

2319
01:42:17.081 --> 01:42:22.081
<v Speaker 2>is like saying things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless the troops or God bless </v>

2320
01:42:22.081 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just the whole way of talking as</v>

2321
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:28.411
<v Speaker 2>a politician is so it's so false and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted that we know that they're going</v>

2322
01:42:29.491 --> 01:42:34.491
<v Speaker 2>to stand in front of all these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this preplanned out speech that is </v>

2323
01:42:34.491 --> 01:42:38.731
<v Speaker 2>like this weird rally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird artificial strip club,</v>

2324
01:42:39.191 --> 01:42:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Dj voice that they put on.</v>

2325
01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:41.780
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2326
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.800
<v Speaker 2>but this is why trump was so even to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive early on because he exposed </v>

2327
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.510
<v Speaker 2>what happened to Rubio was a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2328
01:42:49.511 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 2>If you remember the primary debates with</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump and rubio,</v>

2329
01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:57.420
<v Speaker 2>rubio kept repeating the talking points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then Christy among other people said,</v>

2330
01:42:57.521 --> 01:43:02.521
<v Speaker 2>that's a talking point and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it and then he said it again two </v>

2331
01:43:02.521 --> 01:43:03.490
<v Speaker 2>more times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost proving that this is all scripted</v>

2332
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:06.010
<v Speaker 2>to the fun part of Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Earlier on.</v>

2333
01:43:06.011 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Was he exposed all of that is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes get the feeling that he didn't</v>

2334
01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>prep it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was.</v>

2335
01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.190
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know what he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

2336
01:43:12.191 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I loved trying to imagine the dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know before these debates,</v>

2337
01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:19.750
<v Speaker 2>they always have someone stand in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other candidate.</v>

2338
01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you get to stand in for trump if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like when Hillary Clinton </v>

2339
01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:28.081
<v Speaker 2>practicing her debates who sits there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because I mean because you don't </v>

2340
01:43:28.081 --> 01:43:28.930
<v Speaker 2>know median or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is is that,</v>

2341
01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.110
<v Speaker 2>is that that was the fun.</v>

2342
01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.800
<v Speaker 2>He exposed kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2343
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:36.160
<v Speaker 2>the artificial Kabuki theater sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2344
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:41.161
<v Speaker 2>This has developed and I liked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's good when more </v>

2345
01:43:41.161 --> 01:43:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Americans see what it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2346
01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:44.020
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time you're right.</v>

2347
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:49.050
<v Speaker 2>They either get fooled by that or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've heard it so many times they </v>

2348
01:43:49.050 --> 01:43:49.240
<v Speaker 2>don't even pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump helped expose that.</v>

2349
01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:51.260
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was good for the system.</v>

2350
01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we've gone quite a bit farther down </v>

2351
01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.961
<v Speaker 2>that road and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it is so good for the </v>

2352
01:43:58.961 --> 01:44:01.631
<v Speaker 2>system anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think anybody who would beat </v>

2353
01:44:01.631 --> 01:44:01.631
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2354
01:44:01.631 --> 01:44:01.631
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2355
01:44:01.631 --> 01:44:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Democrats keeps saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't vote for Hillary Clinton,</v>

2356
01:44:03.981 --> 01:44:06.500
<v Speaker 2>you're going to put trump in office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be your fault.</v>

2357
01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:11.650
<v Speaker 2>And I keep saying it's not my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put Hillary Clinton up as your </v>

2358
01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:11.650
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>

2359
01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2008,</v>

2360
01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 2>we saw how unpopular she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She shouldn't have lost a Barack Obama.</v>

2361
01:44:15.021 --> 01:44:20.021
<v Speaker 2>She was going to be correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you realize if she hadn't had a 70 </v>

2362
01:44:20.021 --> 01:44:21.740
<v Speaker 2>something year old democratic socialists</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2363
01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:26.741
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not have a ton of charisma and a </v>

2364
01:44:26.741 --> 01:44:26.741
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever heard from her.</v>

2365
01:44:26.741 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Only two primary challengers up on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

2366
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.870
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't be here if Joe Biden and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the first time I can think of that.</v>

2367
01:44:32.871 --> 01:44:35.360
<v Speaker 2>A vice president hasn't tried to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2368
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.600
<v Speaker 2>If Joe Biden had run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be up against trump now and I </v>

2369
01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:40.600
<v Speaker 2>don't think trump would stand a chance </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

2370
01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.371
<v Speaker 2>and I don't like Joe Biden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just think he's a zero and right </v>

2371
01:44:45.371 --> 01:44:47.690
<v Speaker 2>now trump is a negative running against </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary who's a negative zero kicks.</v>

2372
01:44:47.691 --> 01:44:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Both their rear end.</v>

2373
01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's also a zero who's had no </v>

2374
01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:54.450
<v Speaker 3>negative consequences of eight years in </v>
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>

2375
01:44:54.451 --> 01:44:59.451
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is amazing because he's known for </v>

2376
01:44:59.451 --> 01:44:59.451
<v Speaker 3>gaffes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2377
01:44:59.451 --> 01:44:59.451
<v Speaker 3>he's a goofy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2378
01:44:59.451 --> 01:45:01.650
<v Speaker 3>we used to have this thing in Boston and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stitches comedy club.</v>

2379
01:45:01.651 --> 01:45:04.560
<v Speaker 3>We'd call it Joe Biden tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was 1988 malarkey.</v>

2380
01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.170
<v Speaker 3>He's an Irish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would steal other people's material.</v>

2381
01:45:07.171 --> 01:45:09.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what you would do like I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.600
<v Speaker 3>because people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but biden plagiarize Kennedy's speeches </v>

2383
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 3>when he was running for president and </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a big deal.</v>

2384
01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:18.090
<v Speaker 3>I recall everybody's Kinda forgot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2385
01:45:18.091 --> 01:45:23.091
<v Speaker 3>but he lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally just stole giant passages out </v>

2386
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:23.091
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something we look back on now and</v>

2387
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:23.360
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2388
01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:26.310
<v Speaker 3>the good old days when that was the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing we could slam somebody for.</v>

2389
01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still doing it like didn't </v>

2390
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Mellinia or how did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or she stole a.</v>

2391
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:32.670
<v Speaker 3>She claimed she didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a remarkable coincidence.</v>

2392
01:45:32.671 --> 01:45:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Michelle Obama's exact words,</v>

2393
01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:36.060
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are the odds?</v>

2394
01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.360
<v Speaker 3>She didn't write that shit anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody I wouldn't be surprised and </v>

2395
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:41.790
<v Speaker 3>someone brought this up and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2396
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 3>but someone suggested it and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably right that trump did it</v>

2397
01:45:46.861 --> 01:45:51.861
<v Speaker 3>on purpose and plagiarized Michelle </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama speech so that people would talk </v>

2398
01:45:51.861 --> 01:45:53.700
<v Speaker 3>about it so it would give even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to his campaign.</v>

2399
01:45:53.730 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2400
01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Trump questions like Michael Moore of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all people came out with a piece about </v>

2401
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.141
<v Speaker 2>three weeks ago and he started the piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>off by saying something to the effect </v>

2402
01:46:04.141 --> 01:46:04.870
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to believe what I'm about</v>

2403
01:46:04.871 --> 01:46:09.871
<v Speaker 2>to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will tell you that I have spoken </v>

2404
01:46:09.871 --> 01:46:12.781
<v Speaker 2>to people who are in the know who tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>me that trump doesn't even want this </v>

2405
01:46:12.781 --> 01:46:17.041
<v Speaker 2>gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is something that has gotten </v>

2406
01:46:17.041 --> 01:46:17.041
<v Speaker 2>out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was more of a,</v>

2407
01:46:17.041 --> 01:46:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll get a TV series afterwards and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't expect you to do this,</v>

2408
01:46:21.010 --> 01:46:22.120
<v Speaker 2>and I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2409
01:46:22.121 --> 01:46:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that's true,</v>

2410
01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.890
<v Speaker 2>this is the most unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funky,</v>

2411
01:46:26.891 --> 01:46:30.070
<v Speaker 2>weird American political history story </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard.</v>

2412
01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the last gasps of a dying </v>
<v Speaker 3>empire.</v>

2413
01:46:33.211 --> 01:46:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think you can continue the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way they've been doing it.</v>

2414
01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:41.160
<v Speaker 3>I think this is showing us that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are no good representatives.</v>

2415
01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:42.990
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no good candidates.</v>

2416
01:46:42.991 --> 01:46:45.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know about them.</v>

2417
01:46:45.421 --> 01:46:47.760
<v Speaker 3>If they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would know about them.</v>

2418
01:46:47.970 --> 01:46:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's some young</v>

2419
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 4>that are coming up and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 4>young congress people that are coming up</v>

2420
01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:58.970
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this was in Lawrence lessig spoke </v>

2421
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.970
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a republic loss,</v>

2422
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.970
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anyone wants to go check out,</v>

2423
01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 4>he put it on the Internet for free now </v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can read it.</v>

2424
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.440
<v Speaker 4>And one was the Harvard maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2425
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:06.260
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2426
01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:09.450
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things he said in that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was so interesting because he showed how</v>

2427
01:47:09.451 --> 01:47:11.580
<v Speaker 4>people who are getting started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2428
01:47:11.581 --> 01:47:12.890
<v Speaker 4>running for mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2429
01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:17.900
<v Speaker 4>the low level things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the parties begin the weeding out </v>

2430
01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:21.561
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing that they want to </v>

2431
01:47:21.561 --> 01:47:21.561
<v Speaker 4>know is how good are you at raising </v>
<v Speaker 4>money?</v>

2432
01:47:21.561 --> 01:47:23.040
<v Speaker 4>And this determines whether or not the </v>
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>

2433
01:47:23.041 --> 01:47:28.041
<v Speaker 4>let's this mayoral candidate put the Rod</v>
<v Speaker 4>after their name or that may oral </v>

2434
01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:28.620
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in other words,</v>

2435
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:33.680
<v Speaker 4>from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the main qualifications is how </v>

2436
01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:33.680
<v Speaker 4>good are you at raising money?</v>

2437
01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.790
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fast forward to when that guy or </v>

2438
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.790
<v Speaker 4>woman is up on the stage running for </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

2439
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:40.200
<v Speaker 4>And then they have four other elected </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions leading up to that.</v>

2440
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:44.610
<v Speaker 4>All of which require you to be a better </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundraiser when that's one of the number</v>

2441
01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 4>one qualifications required for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>parties to let you progress.</v>

2442
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:50.730
<v Speaker 4>Then what do you end up with at the end </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the line?</v>

2443
01:47:51.010 --> 01:47:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Mean what are the carrots and sticks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're looking for?</v>

2444
01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:56.010
<v Speaker 4>A little bit different than maybe what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I as voters are looking for.</v>

2445
01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.930
<v Speaker 4>That's why trump is such a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2446
01:47:57.931 --> 01:48:00.120
<v Speaker 4>Because he's a guy who has so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

2447
01:48:00.121 --> 01:48:03.300
<v Speaker 4>He funded allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allegedly.</v>

2448
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 4>People like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He obviously has money credit.</v>

2449
01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:09.690
<v Speaker 4>He got really good credit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he gets sell some of his shit and</v>

2450
01:48:09.691 --> 01:48:11.400
<v Speaker 4>he would have money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He owned some of that stuff.</v>

2451
01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it does have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and maybe as money is wrapped up </v>

2452
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of that stuff.</v>

2453
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.190
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2454
01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to stop voting for 70 year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and it's not an age is kind of </v>

2455
01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.910
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as a person who just mentioned to </v>

2456
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.910
<v Speaker 4>you that at 50 I'm starting to forget </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2457
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:27.360
<v Speaker 4>I can only imagine what I'll be like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years.</v>

2458
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said that about Hillary Clinton and </v>

2459
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.390
<v Speaker 4>people call me sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like that sex.</v>

2460
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's an old lady.</v>

2461
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:36.150
<v Speaker 4>Trump is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an old man.</v>

2462
01:48:36.151 --> 01:48:41.151
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could watch those TV shows from </v>

2463
01:48:41.151 --> 01:48:44.751
<v Speaker 4>like the 19 fifties and you see their </v>
<v Speaker 4>portrayal of a 70 year old sitting on </v>

2464
01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:47.260
<v Speaker 4>the porch falling asleep and widdling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what this is.</v>

2465
01:48:47.490 --> 01:48:50.250
<v Speaker 4>Seventy may be the new 60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but 68 grade either.</v>

2466
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely not the prime of your </v>

2467
01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:55.520
<v Speaker 4>cognitive abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the primary.</v>

2468
01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:58.290
<v Speaker 4>This level may be good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your bas speed is terrible.</v>

2469
01:48:58.410 --> 01:48:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2470
01:48:59.071 --> 01:49:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the bus that trump trump,</v>

2471
01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:03.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean doesn't even have experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's even more bizarre.</v>

2472
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:08.810
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this elderly statesman that has so much </v>

2473
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:12.081
<v Speaker 4>knowledge and so much so much invested </v>
<v Speaker 4>in our system of government and really </v>

2474
01:49:12.081 --> 01:49:14.340
<v Speaker 4>believes in it so much that he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lead this country and make America great</v>

2475
01:49:14.341 --> 01:49:19.341
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you've got a super rich guy who's </v>

2476
01:49:19.341 --> 01:49:19.341
<v Speaker 4>famous for going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fired.</v>

2477
01:49:19.341 --> 01:49:19.710
<v Speaker 4>And when trump supporters say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2478
01:49:19.711 --> 01:49:22.110
<v Speaker 4>he'll pick the best people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always want to point out,</v>

2479
01:49:22.111 --> 01:49:27.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's already shown some of the people </v>

2480
01:49:27.111 --> 01:49:28.140
<v Speaker 4>that he likes and there's the same old </v>
<v Speaker 4>group of people you had before,</v>

2481
01:49:28.141 --> 01:49:33.141
<v Speaker 4>but he's not going and picking other </v>
<v Speaker 4>business people who've now he goes and </v>

2482
01:49:33.141 --> 01:49:33.540
<v Speaker 4>finds this and you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2483
01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:38.010
<v Speaker 4>it's the same group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I get Donald Trump presiding over the</v>

2484
01:49:38.011 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 4>same old group of people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong about everything so far.</v>

2485
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:46.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the problem is that how do</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get away from the people who are </v>

2486
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:49.731
<v Speaker 4>consistently wrong in a merit system?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that should be promoted are </v>

2487
01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 4>the ones who are right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More often.</v>

2488
01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:56.610
<v Speaker 4>We don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have the same faces forever for A.</v>

2489
01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:58.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean the same guys who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are on,</v>

2490
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:03.660
<v Speaker 4>I always say on if CNN is going to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just name one these experts to tell </v>

2491
01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.580
<v Speaker 4>us what this latest North Korean nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 4>missile thing,</v>

2492
01:50:04.581 --> 01:50:09.581
<v Speaker 4>these would you please put up their </v>
<v Speaker 4>track record the way you would put up </v>

2493
01:50:09.581 --> 01:50:11.140
<v Speaker 4>the wins and loss record of a manager in</v>
<v Speaker 4>baseball.</v>

2494
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you want that manager who's who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>four and 72 explaining to you the world </v>

2495
01:50:16.230 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 4>series strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or are you going to say,</v>

2496
01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:19.840
<v Speaker 4>this guy doesn't know Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if they put the records of these</v>

2497
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 4>people they have on the programs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd look at it and go,</v>

2498
01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:24.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm not listening to this guy.</v>

2499
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 4>He's consistently wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2500
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.980
<v Speaker 4>but once someone becomes someone that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people recognize in that regard,</v>

2501
01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.510
<v Speaker 4>you're an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in the Rolodex a quote.</v>

2502
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>

2503
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:41.550
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is the weirdest time ever in </v>

2504
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.550
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's ever been anything</v>

2505
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:42.040
<v Speaker 4>weirder than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2506
01:50:42.041 --> 01:50:47.041
<v Speaker 4>let me show you what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What bothers in independent like yours </v>

2507
01:50:47.041 --> 01:50:49.261
<v Speaker 4>truly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the demographics of the </v>

2508
01:50:49.261 --> 01:50:51.900
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the independence or actually the last </v>

2509
01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.950
<v Speaker 4>poll I saw were a slight majority now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so divide the pie into three Democrats,</v>

2510
01:50:53.951 --> 01:50:58.951
<v Speaker 4>Republicans and everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what the independents are </v>

2511
01:50:58.951 --> 01:50:58.951
<v Speaker 4>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not a party.</v>

2512
01:50:58.951 --> 01:50:59.890
<v Speaker 4>We don't have a candidate we could agree</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon,</v>

2513
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:02.560
<v Speaker 4>but we're everyone else where the king </v>
<v Speaker 4>makers in this election,</v>

2514
01:51:02.561 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you watch a TV and watch CNN or Fox</v>

2515
01:51:05.561 --> 01:51:08.770
<v Speaker 4>and they have 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>analysts talking about politics on there</v>

2516
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:13.860
<v Speaker 4>on election night and everything else </v>
<v Speaker 4>and half of them are democratic </v>

2517
01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.101
<v Speaker 4>operators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>operatives and half a Republican </v>

2518
01:51:17.101 --> 01:51:17.101
<v Speaker 4>operatives.</v>

2519
01:51:17.101 --> 01:51:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Where the heck is anybody who could </v>
<v Speaker 4>speak for that giant slice of the pot </v>

2520
01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:25.260
<v Speaker 4>and you would think that that common </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense would dictate you would grab some </v>

2521
01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:25.260
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2522
01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:30.241
<v Speaker 4>What our independence thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead they asked Democrats and </v>

2523
01:51:30.241 --> 01:51:30.241
<v Speaker 4>Republicans and independents are </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

2524
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:32.200
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not saying that because I have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

2525
01:51:32.201 --> 01:51:34.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that because it confounds me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

2526
01:51:35.070 --> 01:51:40.070
<v Speaker 4>It seems pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like if CNN or any of these </v>

2527
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:43.531
<v Speaker 4>news networks decided to help support </v>
<v Speaker 4>this independent idea and bring in </v>

2528
01:51:43.531 --> 01:51:47.170
<v Speaker 4>independence and and show that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>independence or the vast majority of the</v>

2529
01:51:47.171 --> 01:51:52.171
<v Speaker 4>voters are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the majority of the slight majority </v>

2530
01:51:52.171 --> 01:51:54.281
<v Speaker 4>of majority of the voters in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they showed that and promoted that </v>

2531
01:51:54.281 --> 01:51:54.760
<v Speaker 4>idea and people that people would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2532
01:51:54.761 --> 01:51:58.920
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that kind of reporting in on it like</v>

2533
01:51:58.930 --> 01:52:03.930
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think they're complicit because </v>

2534
01:52:03.930 --> 01:52:05.890
<v Speaker 4>they have relationships with the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they know that where's the money,</v>

2535
01:52:05.891 --> 01:52:08.350
<v Speaker 4>the money is interviewing and getting on</v>
<v Speaker 4>camera.</v>

2536
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 4>The people that are the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now and most likely to win.</v>

2537
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:16.620
<v Speaker 4>That's why one of the most amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that trump did was all that shit </v>

2538
01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:20.641
<v Speaker 4>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he did talk about Mexicans being </v>

2539
01:52:20.641 --> 01:52:20.641
<v Speaker 4>rapists and all this nuts about the wall</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all the.</v>

2540
01:52:20.641 --> 01:52:23.350
<v Speaker 4>All the different crazy things that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said when he did that,</v>

2541
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:26.290
<v Speaker 4>the news was forced to cover him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were forced to.</v>

2542
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:29.290
<v Speaker 4>They liked it as long as we were still </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the primary stage.</v>

2543
01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought there's no way this guy's </v>

2544
01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 4>gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody said that there's no way this </v>

2545
01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 4>guy's gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2546
01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 4>I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2547
01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 4>One of the people that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2548
01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:38.710
<v Speaker 4>he's now neck and neck with Hillary and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the national polls.</v>

2549
01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:40.300
<v Speaker 4>I will say this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2550
01:52:40.301 --> 01:52:40.780
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2551
01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:45.900
<v Speaker 4>and didn't I just say you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to people who have a bad track </v>

2552
01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:45.900
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was wrong about that.</v>

2553
01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>So bear that</v>

2554
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.550
<v Speaker 2>in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2555
01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.680
<v Speaker 2>and one on my trump analysis on how far </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll go.</v>

2556
01:52:48.681 --> 01:52:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So just be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2557
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the American electoral </v>

2558
01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:55.330
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2559
01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:57.380
<v Speaker 2>an analyst does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they notice important states.</v>

2560
01:52:57.381 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>You have to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2561
01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:00.030
<v Speaker 2>This state has to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2562
01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:03.320
<v Speaker 2>as Ohio goes or as Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain places,</v>

2563
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and then there are other places that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>gimmes.</v>

2564
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:08.390
<v Speaker 2>This state will always go blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This state will always go red.</v>

2565
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:13.630
<v Speaker 2>So the battle ground are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the states that are the toss ups in </v>

2566
01:53:13.630 --> 01:53:15.620
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of those states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton is leading.</v>

2567
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And so the attitude that the sharpies at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least have is that it doesn't matter </v>

2568
01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:25.121
<v Speaker 2>what the polls look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it matters how Ohio goes and it matters </v>

2569
01:53:25.121 --> 01:53:25.420
<v Speaker 2>how Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2570
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the choke points that the real</v>

2571
01:53:29.181 --> 01:53:30.980
<v Speaker 2>sharpies work from for you.</v>

2572
01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Hillary Clinton decides four years </v>

2573
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:35.980
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to run for president,</v>

2574
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:35.980
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into Ohio now.</v>

2575
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Start working those places now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when people talk about trump not </v>

2576
01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 2>having a robust establishment or </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization on the ground,</v>

2577
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:49.570
<v Speaker 2>this is where he's going to get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll kill him in those states and </v>

2578
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:50.140
<v Speaker 2>then he may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>

2579
01:53:50.141 --> 01:53:55.141
<v Speaker 2>you could conceivably come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>election where trump gets more actual </v>

2580
01:53:55.141 --> 01:53:58.391
<v Speaker 2>votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Clinton wins the electoral college </v>

2581
01:53:58.391 --> 01:54:01.421
<v Speaker 2>and winds the key states and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sharpies who do this for a living </v>

2582
01:54:01.421 --> 01:54:06.220
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as consultants and as campaign </v>

2583
01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:06.220
<v Speaker 2>strategist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they,</v>

2584
01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:09.671
<v Speaker 2>when they find those places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you see her fainting at </v>

2585
01:54:09.671 --> 01:54:13.421
<v Speaker 2>that nine slash 11 thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're trying to walk her to the </v>

2586
01:54:13.421 --> 01:54:13.421
<v Speaker 2>car and she starts bad timing on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

2587
01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:16.430
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden drudge looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nostradamus in that,</v>

2588
01:54:16.431 --> 01:54:16.790
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

2589
01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

2590
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:22.900
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible to see that she's in such </v>

2591
01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.310
<v Speaker 2>poor health that she starts just falling</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2592
01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you though mean you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2593
01:54:26.251 --> 01:54:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you could do it because you're in good </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

2594
01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:32.861
<v Speaker 2>If I had tried to do what either one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those two people had done in terms of </v>

2595
01:54:32.861 --> 01:54:35.780
<v Speaker 2>what their schedule has been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would die 100 percent height and major</v>

2596
01:54:35.781 --> 01:54:37.820
<v Speaker 2>drinking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be drinking too much caffeine.</v>

2597
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been drinking too much alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be.</v>

2598
01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I'd take up smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I do,</v>

2599
01:54:41.211 --> 01:54:46.211
<v Speaker 2>but I mean what we require those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with this permanent campaign that </v>

2600
01:54:46.211 --> 01:54:49.280
<v Speaker 2>goes on forever and these are 70 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old people.</v>

2601
01:54:49.281 --> 01:54:51.770
<v Speaker 2>As we said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed they both haven't broken down</v>

2602
01:54:51.771 --> 01:54:53.840
<v Speaker 2>and if I'm trump I would look at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

2603
01:54:53.841 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 2>do I really want this?</v>

2604
01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:58.460
<v Speaker 2>If this is how hard the job will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be in Hawaii.</v>

2605
01:54:58.461 --> 01:54:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be.</v>

2606
01:54:59.690 --> 01:55:01.710
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all go gray.</v>

2607
01:55:01.711 --> 01:55:03.500
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know trump is great,</v>

2608
01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:04.120
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2609
01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.280
<v Speaker 2>but how much is a 70 year old guy going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to age when he looks at how old the </v>

2610
01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 2>presidents getting those jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think trump's going to sleep in.</v>

2611
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 2>He's going to hire people to do all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty work.</v>

2612
01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:15.380
<v Speaker 2>He was just going to just get on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and go,</v>

2613
01:55:15.381 --> 01:55:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a youtube channel who knows,</v>

2614
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a part of you that would love to</v>

2615
01:55:22.101 --> 01:55:24.110
<v Speaker 2>just have a view of what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2616
01:55:24.111 --> 01:55:27.050
<v Speaker 2>like a Gilligan's island episode where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a dream sequence.</v>

2617
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:29.860
<v Speaker 2>The coconut hits you on the head and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine what I would,</v>

2618
01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live through it,</v>

2619
01:55:31.311 --> 01:55:33.530
<v Speaker 2>but I'd love to see it for a minute to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what it would look at.</v>

2620
01:55:33.531 --> 01:55:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton will just be more of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

2621
01:55:35.181 --> 01:55:40.181
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're heading towards an iceberg here </v>

2622
01:55:40.181 --> 01:55:40.181
<v Speaker 2>and she's one of the people that set the</v>
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

2623
01:55:40.181 --> 01:55:41.690
<v Speaker 2>So that's my problem with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2624
01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 2>she's doubling down on what always had.</v>

2625
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Whereas trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the wild card.</v>

2626
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2627
01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of intelligent people that</v>

2628
01:55:49.861 --> 01:55:51.330
<v Speaker 4>support trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

2629
01:55:51.331 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of assholes that support </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>

2630
01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:56.430
<v Speaker 4>Lady that got punched in the face at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump rally.</v>

2631
01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:01.460
<v Speaker 4>Can you explain to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've talked about this in a couple </v>

2632
01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:04.130
<v Speaker 4>of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that I'm having a bad </v>

2633
01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:04.130
<v Speaker 4>track record myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you shouldn't listen to me at all,</v>

2634
01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:04.530
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on the racism thing,</v>

2635
01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:09.740
<v Speaker 4>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever want to put a number on </v>

2636
01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:12.231
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of the trump supporters </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall into that category that we see </v>

2637
01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:13.370
<v Speaker 4>twitter people trolling us on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2638
01:56:13.670 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 4>but I thought that was going the way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dodo.</v>

2639
01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.440
<v Speaker 4>I am more surprised by that than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else that the rise in overt </v>

2640
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't even want to say racism,</v>

2641
01:56:22.591 --> 01:56:24.730
<v Speaker 4>but just people who look at the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that,</v>

2642
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 4>that viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Lens.</v>

2643
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.720
<v Speaker 4>I thought we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2644
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:33.830
<v Speaker 4>not evolving but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I thought those people were </v>

2645
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.830
<v Speaker 4>dying out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought they were like,</v>

2646
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:36.980
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She bunkers and they were just going to </v>

2647
01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:38.811
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to see that recur is the biggest </v>

2648
01:56:38.811 --> 01:56:40.560
<v Speaker 4>surprise I've had in my adult lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when analyzing politics.</v>

2649
01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they absolutely still exist.</v>

2650
01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 4>The question is have they diminished in </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers?</v>

2651
01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:49.970
<v Speaker 4>I think they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're just dealing with social </v>

2652
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.970
<v Speaker 4>media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many voices.</v>

2653
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:51.450
<v Speaker 4>So many people have a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're dealing.</v>

2654
01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.480
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the ways that I've always</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to describe how many retarded </v>

2655
01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.111
<v Speaker 4>people that are on the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't mean people with down </v>

2656
01:57:00.111 --> 01:57:00.111
<v Speaker 4>syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

2657
01:57:00.111 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to not stop using that </v>
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>

2658
01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:05.751
<v Speaker 4>It's not a medical term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's doesn't mean people with the </v>

2659
01:57:05.751 --> 01:57:05.751
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost fucking moron.</v>

2660
01:57:05.751 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2661
01:57:06.331 --> 01:57:09.540
<v Speaker 4>If there's 300 million people in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

2662
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:13.470
<v Speaker 4>one out of 100 is going to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>idiot.</v>

2663
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:15.600
<v Speaker 4>At least 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

2664
01:57:16.930 --> 01:57:17.970
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really nice.</v>

2665
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Really Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 3 million fucking idiots just in </v>

2666
01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.170
<v Speaker 4>this country that is a fucking gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Minneapolis size city,</v>

2667
01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:28.740
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>morons,</v>

2668
01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:34.070
<v Speaker 4>and tweet a lot and they could just be </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist and sexist or just trying to get </v>

2669
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 4>a rise out of us or only have a 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>old kids.</v>

2670
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:37.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the other thing.</v>

2671
01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Some of these are kids who think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2672
01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 4>that most shocking thing I can say is </v>
<v Speaker 4>some racist term.</v>

2673
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:47.121
<v Speaker 4>I'm not supposed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course there's all the above because </v>

2674
01:57:47.121 --> 01:57:48.510
<v Speaker 4>young kids like I would have done when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was 17,</v>

2675
01:57:48.511 --> 01:57:52.680
<v Speaker 4>if you gave me a computer when I was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I knew I could tweet to Al Gore.</v>

2676
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably make the meanest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweet.</v>

2677
01:57:55.891 --> 01:57:57.250
<v Speaker 4>I would try to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2678
01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:58.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think there's,</v>

2679
01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:04.130
<v Speaker 4>there's so many voices out there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see racism attached to the </v>

2680
01:58:04.130 --> 01:58:07.881
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump campaign and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can't really say what </v>

2681
01:58:07.881 --> 01:58:12.351
<v Speaker 4>percentage of Donald Trump supporters or</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it more of a problem in the trump </v>

2682
01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:12.360
<v Speaker 4>campaign and the hillary campaign?</v>

2683
01:58:12.570 --> 01:58:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does the,</v>

2684
01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:16.620
<v Speaker 4>he does the fact that he won't take it </v>
<v Speaker 4>head on,</v>

2685
01:58:16.621 --> 01:58:17.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

2686
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I was gonna say you can see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reporters try to sort of frame the </v>

2687
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:24.300
<v Speaker 4>questions so that he has to either go </v>
<v Speaker 4>left or go right on this,</v>

2688
01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:24.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2689
01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:25.590
<v Speaker 4>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2690
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.230
<v Speaker 4>would you denounce the KKK and David </v>
<v Speaker 4>Duke support?</v>

2691
01:58:28.231 --> 01:58:33.231
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the KKK is or </v>

2692
01:58:33.231 --> 01:58:33.231
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he came up with some answer that.</v>

2693
01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Can you look that up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't know.</v>

2694
01:58:34.771 --> 01:58:35.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2695
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry.</v>

2696
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:39.300
<v Speaker 4>He should go with the really easy stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like slavery.</v>

2697
01:58:39.301 --> 01:58:40.410
<v Speaker 4>Good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald,</v>

2698
01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:41.340
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

2699
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.680
<v Speaker 3>just real easy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just give me your position on that.</v>

2700
01:58:44.681 --> 01:58:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's work from their civil war.</v>

2701
01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bad idea.</v>

2702
01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:49.450
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2703
01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had this moment outside of my </v>

2704
01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:56.740
<v Speaker 2>body where I thought we're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this stuff and you know,</v>

2705
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:59.310
<v Speaker 2>that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2706
01:58:59.311 --> 01:59:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you had brought this up earlier and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to point out we had talked about,</v>

2707
01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:03.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people growing up,</v>

2708
01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.650
<v Speaker 2>young people today and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go back,</v>

2709
01:59:07.651 --> 01:59:08.610
<v Speaker 2>in other words say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2710
01:59:08.611 --> 01:59:10.980
<v Speaker 2>this is all so far beyond where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should go back.</v>

2711
01:59:11.130 --> 01:59:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Or if they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the new normal to them.</v>

2712
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.160
<v Speaker 2>To them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even remember when Dan Carlin</v>

2713
01:59:17.161 --> 01:59:18.570
<v Speaker 2>talks about the laws of the fourth </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

2714
01:59:18.571 --> 01:59:19.340
<v Speaker 2>they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2715
01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:24.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember what you were </v>

2716
01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:24.920
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2717
01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:24.920
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be crazy to let people do that or</v>

2718
01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:24.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2719
01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:29.691
<v Speaker 2>you wonder if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if once you haven't had a freedom for a </v>

2720
01:59:29.691 --> 01:59:30.680
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it seem radical to go back to that?</v>

2721
01:59:30.690 --> 01:59:35.690
<v Speaker 2>There was a great quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use it all the time by a historian a </v>

2722
01:59:35.690 --> 01:59:37.941
<v Speaker 2>longtime ago named Charles Austin beard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said to be considered a dangerous</v>

2723
01:59:38.491 --> 01:59:41.790
<v Speaker 2>radical today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is go around spouting</v>

2724
01:59:41.791 --> 01:59:46.791
<v Speaker 2>the phrases of the founding fathers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll get you on the NSA watchlist </v>

2725
01:59:46.791 --> 01:59:47.760
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>

2726
01:59:48.570 --> 01:59:48.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2727
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:49.520
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2728
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:52.200
<v Speaker 2>if you take that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so smacking the mic.</v>

2729
01:59:52.201 --> 01:59:54.180
<v Speaker 2>But if you take that out and you try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze that,</v>

2730
01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.340
<v Speaker 2>what does that say about how far we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>

2731
01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionaries create your country and </v>

2732
02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:04.401
<v Speaker 2>then we very quickly lose that </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary ardor and we become much </v>

2733
02:00:04.401 --> 02:00:05.160
<v Speaker 2>more conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is natural I think.</v>

2734
02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:10.660
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd talked about life cycles of </v>

2735
02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:10.660
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we over the hill?</v>

2736
02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:15.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you make a case that the United </v>

2737
02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:15.380
<v Speaker 2>States concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really a utopian one,</v>

2738
02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:15.810
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can all be free.</v>

2739
02:00:15.811 --> 02:00:20.811
<v Speaker 2>We can all run the cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that something that is past its </v>

2740
02:00:20.811 --> 02:00:20.811
<v Speaker 2>prime?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sell by date.</v>

2741
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Well I think the the corrupt amongst us </v>
<v Speaker 3>have tried to whittle away at it like </v>

2742
02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:30.491
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the fourth </v>
<v Speaker 3>amendment or the second amendment or </v>

2743
02:00:30.491 --> 02:00:33.851
<v Speaker 3>even the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any the amendments were you look at the </v>

2744
02:00:33.851 --> 02:00:37.610
<v Speaker 3>freedoms that people were really worried</v>
<v Speaker 3>about losing and when something like the</v>

2745
02:00:37.610 --> 02:00:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Patriot Act or the Patriot Act gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>passed and you realize that they can </v>

2746
02:00:42.610 --> 02:00:46.241
<v Speaker 3>just sorta detain you and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to charge you with anything and </v>

2747
02:00:46.241 --> 02:00:48.020
<v Speaker 3>they can detain you indefinitely if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just decide.</v>

2748
02:00:48.021 --> 02:00:49.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to present you with any </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

2749
02:00:49.730 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to give you a trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to give you a court </v>

2750
02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2751
02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2752
02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:57.040
<v Speaker 3>well what are we operating under?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then if you have,</v>

2753
02:00:57.290 --> 02:01:02.290
<v Speaker 3>if you can make an act like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of dissolves the constitution </v>

2754
02:01:02.841 --> 02:01:07.010
<v Speaker 3>and the bill of rights for people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide are the bad guys.</v>

2755
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:12.020
<v Speaker 3>If you can just do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we don't really have the protection</v>

2756
02:01:12.021 --> 02:01:13.120
<v Speaker 3>of the constitution and the bill</v>

2757
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.480
<v Speaker 2>were talking about earlier the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption where you'd mentioned the </v>

2758
02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:22.061
<v Speaker 2>second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't the second amendment is in as </v>

2759
02:01:22.061 --> 02:01:22.130
<v Speaker 2>much trouble as the fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2760
02:01:22.131 --> 02:01:23.930
<v Speaker 2>an IRA?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's money,</v>

2761
02:01:23.931 --> 02:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some money on one.</v>

2762
02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.560
<v Speaker 2>There's an industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2763
02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.790
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and listen,</v>

2764
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're gonna,</v>

2765
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:36.430
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to to to create a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get a lot of money to defend an </v>

2766
02:01:36.711 --> 02:01:41.711
<v Speaker 2>amendment to the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if Americans argue what the second </v>

2767
02:01:41.711 --> 02:01:45.071
<v Speaker 2>amendment means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love the idea of money coming to </v>

2768
02:01:45.071 --> 02:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>legislators because that's what they pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to to protect those rights.</v>

2769
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:52.750
<v Speaker 2>My problem is that the amendments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are getting shafted are the ones that </v>

2770
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:53.900
<v Speaker 2>don't have a lot of money and often have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money on the other side.</v>

2771
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just bizarre that you could </v>

2772
02:01:58.990 --> 02:02:01.601
<v Speaker 2>get so much done with money and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our system of government and </v>

2773
02:02:01.601 --> 02:02:05.141
<v Speaker 2>it's slowly but surely crept its way </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the root system of it and just </v>

2774
02:02:05.141 --> 02:02:07.220
<v Speaker 2>entangled it and choked it down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural though.</v>

2775
02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2776
02:02:07.671 --> 02:02:12.671
<v Speaker 2>I think that that basically this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way it always is and we would have had </v>

2777
02:02:12.671 --> 02:02:16.751
<v Speaker 2>to have held it back with all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>force to keep it from doing it because </v>

2778
02:02:16.751 --> 02:02:17.550
<v Speaker 2>money has a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

2779
02:02:17.551 --> 02:02:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean we all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all are vulnerable.</v>

2780
02:02:21.051 --> 02:02:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Once you have enough money so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to be vulnerable.</v>

2781
02:02:23.541 --> 02:02:28.541
<v Speaker 2>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if you are just a person </v>

2782
02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 2>struggling to get by and somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer somebody offers you a lot of money</v>

2783
02:02:28.731 --> 02:02:31.640
<v Speaker 2>to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a heck of a challenge to have,</v>

2784
02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are my philosophical beliefs.</v>

2785
02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Here's food for my children or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That becomes very difficult and with </v>

2786
02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:43.390
<v Speaker 2>these legislators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the PD is that they all want to be </v>

2787
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.970
<v Speaker 2>reelected so much that they can let the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money sway them.</v>

2788
02:02:43.971 --> 02:02:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Though if they didn't care that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the jobs,</v>

2789
02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.510
<v Speaker 2>the money might not mean that much.</v>

2790
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:49.790
<v Speaker 2>That once you get elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said this is all I want,</v>

2791
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:52.470
<v Speaker 2>then you don't care what the money says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only care what the money.</v>

2792
02:02:52.471 --> 02:02:57.471
<v Speaker 2>He says if you want to get reelected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which argues for term limits and all </v>

2793
02:02:57.471 --> 02:02:57.471
<v Speaker 2>that stuff maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2794
02:02:57.471 --> 02:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2795
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:59.210
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2796
02:02:59.750 --> 02:03:04.750
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is daunting when you sit down and </v>

2797
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:09.371
<v Speaker 2>talk about it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I always come in here and bring </v>

2798
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:09.371
<v Speaker 2>you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2799
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I do whatever you want to have a guest </v>
<v Speaker 2>after me to cleanse your palate is what </v>

2800
02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:15.291
<v Speaker 2>he said about David Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Duke is a bad person who had </v>

2801
02:03:15.291 --> 02:03:15.800
<v Speaker 2>disavowed numerous occasions over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2802
02:03:15.801 --> 02:03:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Trumps had an MSL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the first time though.</v>

2803
02:03:17.871 --> 02:03:21.590
<v Speaker 2>This is after he got slammed for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing enough to disavow.</v>

2804
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:23.090
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the,</v>

2805
02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:24.740
<v Speaker 2>the follow up question in the fall.</v>

2806
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.600
<v Speaker 2>So the first time he said something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2807
02:03:26.601 --> 02:03:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to miss quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I recall him saying something like,</v>

2808
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about the KKK or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2809
02:03:31.641 --> 02:03:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And everybody lost their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

2810
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:35.360
<v Speaker 2>if you said to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2811
02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.600
<v Speaker 2>five percent of my support is from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who would like a guy like David </v>

2812
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to cut out five percent of</v>

2813
02:03:41.871 --> 02:03:42.710
<v Speaker 2>my support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2814
02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is surreal to me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

2815
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2816
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 2>if I've been caught off guard by </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

2817
02:03:48.081 --> 02:03:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I've been caught off guard by this and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't process it yet.</v>

2818
02:03:52.461 --> 02:03:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to fit Donald Trump and</v>

2819
02:03:56.090 --> 02:04:00.410
<v Speaker 2>that one segment of his supporters into </v>
<v Speaker 2>my worldview because I thought they were</v>

2820
02:04:00.411 --> 02:04:05.411
<v Speaker 2>a dying breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that could be </v>

2821
02:04:05.411 --> 02:04:07.510
<v Speaker 2>resurrected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a guy when I was a reporter </v>

2822
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:11.110
<v Speaker 2>during the Bosnian war and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Croat and he tried to make the case to </v>

2823
02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:13.670
<v Speaker 2>me and he very well might have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>right that a lot of those people in that</v>

2824
02:04:13.671 --> 02:04:16.970
<v Speaker 2>area where they have historic problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other and always have.</v>

2825
02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>We're getting along just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While economic things were okay when he </v>

2826
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:24.130
<v Speaker 2>said we were intermarrying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2827
02:04:24.170 --> 02:04:25.970
<v Speaker 2>serves could fall in love with Croats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2828
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 2>it was going okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he goes,</v>

2829
02:04:27.801 --> 02:04:32.480
<v Speaker 2>once everything hit the fan and times </v>
<v Speaker 2>became tough and the economics came into</v>

2830
02:04:32.481 --> 02:04:37.481
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those old feelings came back and I </v>

2831
02:04:37.481 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 2>thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that something that is applicable</v>

2832
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.670
<v Speaker 4>on this racism thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

2833
02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one could make a case that we </v>

2834
02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.890
<v Speaker 4>haven't been this unsettled in a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>long time in this country.</v>

2835
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:49.460
<v Speaker 4>Are we seeing A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

2836
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:54.500
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to factor how much that plays </v>
<v Speaker 4>a role versus how much the Internet and </v>

2837
02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:57.891
<v Speaker 4>the ability for these people to speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>out when before they would have had to </v>

2838
02:04:57.891 --> 02:04:58.560
<v Speaker 4>be xeroxing things and leaving them on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your car.</v>

2839
02:04:58.561 --> 02:05:00.510
<v Speaker 4>You know when you come out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grocery store,</v>

2840
02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:02.730
<v Speaker 4>did you ever get one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 4>come into the grocery store?</v>

2841
02:05:02.731 --> 02:05:05.250
<v Speaker 4>He has some racist track on your car </v>
<v Speaker 4>window or something.</v>

2842
02:05:05.251 --> 02:05:07.590
<v Speaker 4>You never got to raise this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've got ones for carwashes.</v>

2843
02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:10.250
<v Speaker 4>What about the tony allow you ever get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one that Tony Alamo ones.</v>

2844
02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:11.780
<v Speaker 4>He was famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Tonio Lama.</v>

2845
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000
<v Speaker 4>He ran his own religious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here is something that you used to have </v>

2846
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:17.000
<v Speaker 4>people twice a week.</v>

2847
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.750
<v Speaker 4>I'd have that on my car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the old days that's how somebody </v>

2848
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:22.170
<v Speaker 4>had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they have a broad class platform.</v>

2849
02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Are we just hearing from these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>more because they can speak to more </v>

2850
02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:27.570
<v Speaker 4>people while they also can find </v>
<v Speaker 4>likeminded group.</v>

2851
02:05:27.571 --> 02:05:32.571
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you couldn't find that many </v>

2852
02:05:32.571 --> 02:05:35.211
<v Speaker 4>likeminded groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you lived in a neighborhood full of </v>

2853
02:05:35.211 --> 02:05:35.550
<v Speaker 4>progressive people and you were like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really conservative person,</v>

2854
02:05:35.551 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 4>it'd be really kind of difficult for you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

2855
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:42.230
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to seek these people out and </v>

2856
02:05:42.230 --> 02:05:42.690
<v Speaker 4>now it's with a couple clicks of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouse and all of a sudden,</v>

2857
02:05:42.691 --> 02:05:47.691
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on some website or a bunch of </v>

2858
02:05:47.691 --> 02:05:47.691
<v Speaker 4>people who agree with you and wind each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other up.</v>

2859
02:05:47.691 --> 02:05:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Everybody winds up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2860
02:05:48.721 --> 02:05:50.860
<v Speaker 4>let's not pick sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happens on all sides.</v>

2861
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Get to go to the daily coast and places </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>

2862
02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wind people up and they also.</v>

2863
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:59.540
<v Speaker 4>They're apologists and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>honest about the faults of their.</v>

2864
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Like there was this thing about Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

2865
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:07.910
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was people were talking about how </v>

2866
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:09.090
<v Speaker 4>it's sexist that people are commenting </v>
<v Speaker 4>on her health and that if it was a,</v>

2867
02:06:09.091 --> 02:06:14.091
<v Speaker 4>a man that was running for president who</v>
<v Speaker 4>got week during nine slash 11 during,</v>

2868
02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:19.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after some sort of a service for the </v>

2869
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.250
<v Speaker 4>fallen troops that that would be totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptable.</v>

2870
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:24.231
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No history shows it because people </v>

2871
02:06:24.231 --> 02:06:24.231
<v Speaker 4>forget that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2872
02:06:24.231 --> 02:06:28.940
<v Speaker 4>George mcgovern had to drop his vice </v>
<v Speaker 4>presidential candidate because the guy </v>

2873
02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 4>who had been released that he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>visited a psychiatrist for some shock </v>

2874
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:33.450
<v Speaker 4>shock therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2875
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had on more than one occasion had </v>

2876
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:38.930
<v Speaker 4>electroshock therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2877
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Because he was a fucking loon and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

2878
02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he wasn't Joe Rogan.</v>

2879
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're just playing into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda,</v>

2880
02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:49.130
<v Speaker 4>get shocked to fix your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then a couple of years later </v>

2881
02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:53.340
<v Speaker 4>running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only one way to find out that's </v>

2882
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:53.340
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2883
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:53.980
<v Speaker 4>maybe getting shocked is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2884
02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the shark color was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hands of voters,</v>

2885
02:06:57.391 --> 02:06:58.890
<v Speaker 4>we can get something done in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

2886
02:06:59.350 --> 02:07:01.590
<v Speaker 4>One more time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The president makes a wrong move.</v>

2887
02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to have a shock button.</v>

2888
02:07:04.730 --> 02:07:06.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Bolton,</v>

2889
02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I'd love a shock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of the people that are</v>

2890
02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:13.821
<v Speaker 4>really excited about hillary becoming </v>
<v Speaker 4>president are excited because it would </v>

2891
02:07:13.821 --> 02:07:14.400
<v Speaker 4>be a first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time a woman.</v>

2892
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.440
<v Speaker 4>I would like that aspect of it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2893
02:07:16.441 --> 02:07:19.440
<v Speaker 4>and it would make a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>is make us feel like we're progressing,</v>

2894
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:23.820
<v Speaker 4>that we can find the best candidate in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that regardless of sex.</v>

2895
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:26.880
<v Speaker 4>The real question isn't that the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>question is,</v>

2896
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:28.770
<v Speaker 4>is that the best we can do?</v>

2897
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Because if that's the best woman we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got,</v>

2898
02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:33.600
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2899
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:38.990
<v Speaker 4>She's the most qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's also under to criminal </v>

2900
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:41.770
<v Speaker 4>investigation simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's also like,</v>

2901
02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a conspiracy theorist for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most part,</v>

2902
02:07:44.650 --> 02:07:47.410
<v Speaker 4>but how many people have died that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>crossed them?</v>

2903
02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen it?</v>

2904
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:50.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the number?</v>

2905
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:51.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll tell you.</v>

2906
02:07:51.871 --> 02:07:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's where I go.</v>

2907
02:07:53.381 --> 02:07:58.381
<v Speaker 4>I go to a much more concrete place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is look at who she's speaking to </v>

2908
02:07:58.381 --> 02:07:59.830
<v Speaker 4>and look at who she's raising money from</v>
<v Speaker 4>and look at what they released,</v>

2909
02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:01.690
<v Speaker 4>the transcripts and those banks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2910
02:08:01.691 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to me that she shouldn't have,</v>

2911
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.190
<v Speaker 4>she shouldn't have a choice in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2912
02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 4>How is it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She does,</v>

2913
02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:09.190
<v Speaker 4>but because she keeps it a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that encourage?</v>

2914
02:08:09.191 --> 02:08:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right hand hackings.</v>

2915
02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And so if you didn't keep that a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could legitimately say,</v>

2916
02:08:16.001 --> 02:08:17.440
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are certain things that the public</v>

2917
02:08:17.441 --> 02:08:20.500
<v Speaker 4>should know when you keep things from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the public that they should know.</v>

2918
02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:22.040
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the public goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2919
02:08:22.041 --> 02:08:23.480
<v Speaker 4>the heck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That ought to be elite.</v>

2920
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:26.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the trying to hold back</v>

2921
02:08:26.531 --> 02:08:30.310
<v Speaker 4>as many leaks as possible before </v>
<v Speaker 4>November just until it's too late.</v>

2922
02:08:30.311 --> 02:08:33.340
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to hold it back once she's in.</v>

2923
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:36.490
<v Speaker 4>She's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's so many leaks now.</v>

2924
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's getting so strange.</v>

2925
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:44.130
<v Speaker 4>When I quoted in the last program I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a Dana milbank column.</v>

2926
02:08:44.190 --> 02:08:49.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had talked about one of the recent </v>

2927
02:08:49.190 --> 02:08:49.190
<v Speaker 4>links that say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2928
02:08:49.190 --> 02:08:51.370
<v Speaker 4>don't get hassled by Russian hackers all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

2929
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:53.620
<v Speaker 4>or people that are mad that I could talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Russian hackers or what,</v>

2930
02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:55.120
<v Speaker 4>sorry dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know so,</v>

2931
02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:55.550
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2932
02:08:55.551 --> 02:09:00.551
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but milbank had said that these people </v>

2933
02:09:00.551 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 4>had had hacked the records and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>release them,</v>

2934
02:09:02.231 --> 02:09:07.231
<v Speaker 4>but they also had altered something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then released that version two and so </v>

2935
02:09:07.231 --> 02:09:11.581
<v Speaker 4>they trip themselves up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could compare these are the documents </v>

2936
02:09:11.581 --> 02:09:11.581
<v Speaker 4>they hacked.</v>

2937
02:09:11.581 --> 02:09:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Then these are the ones that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>released to the public and they had </v>

2938
02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:15.480
<v Speaker 4>altered something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

2939
02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:16.630
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they found that story out,</v>

2940
02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:20.170
<v Speaker 4>breathe a sigh of relief because now you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have an out and you see it already.</v>

2941
02:09:20.171 --> 02:09:21.770
<v Speaker 4>The DNC is going well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2942
02:09:21.771 --> 02:09:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Russian hackers are known to alter this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2943
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:28.710
<v Speaker 4>So the minute that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the greatest boon to all the </v>

2944
02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:31.681
<v Speaker 4>politicians in the world because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can say whatever that says is probably </v>

2945
02:09:31.681 --> 02:09:31.750
<v Speaker 4>altered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2946
02:09:31.751 --> 02:09:32.430
<v Speaker 4>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2947
02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:35.010
<v Speaker 4>it's the wonderful get out of jail free </v>
<v Speaker 4>card on the.</v>

2948
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:38.380
<v Speaker 4>Well that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's legitimate to.</v>

2949
02:09:38.381 --> 02:09:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Because if they really did that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a get out of jail free card.</v>

2950
02:09:41.261 --> 02:09:43.660
<v Speaker 4>So now the hacking is just muddied the </v>
<v Speaker 4>waters even more.</v>

2951
02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:46.510
<v Speaker 4>It certainly has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would actually probably support</v>

2952
02:09:46.511 --> 02:09:49.600
<v Speaker 4>a hack if I was running for president in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that in that sense,</v>

2953
02:09:49.601 --> 02:09:51.130
<v Speaker 4>because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2954
02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:56.160
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to trust evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>came from someone who got it through </v>

2955
02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:57.040
<v Speaker 4>illegal means and they are doing it.</v>

2956
02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Why would we trust that the hackers </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be the only ones who wouldn't </v>

2957
02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:03.970
<v Speaker 4>distort the emails?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you got here?</v>

2958
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you confirms leaked emails?</v>

2959
02:10:07.301 --> 02:10:12.301
<v Speaker 4>Are you see what he said in his emails?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my Quinton's out Dick and girls.</v>

2960
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:16.750
<v Speaker 4>He also talked about Hillary Clinton and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hubris and all those kinds of things,</v>

2961
02:10:16.751 --> 02:10:17.440
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2962
02:10:17.441 --> 02:10:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the impression she gives.</v>

2963
02:10:20.171 --> 02:10:23.110
<v Speaker 4>So it's interesting to hear that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who know and liker feel a little of that</v>

2964
02:10:23.111 --> 02:10:26.110
<v Speaker 4>too is also very suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she has already said,</v>

2965
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:30.610
<v Speaker 4>we have this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would rather not have to vote for her.</v>

2966
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Although she is a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I respect a seven year old person with a</v>

2967
02:10:34.251 --> 02:10:37.190
<v Speaker 4>long track record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbridled ambition,</v>

2968
02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 4>greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>non,</v>

2969
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:42.800
<v Speaker 4>not transformational with a husband </v>
<v Speaker 4>still dicking Bimbos at home.</v>

2970
02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.610
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2971
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:49.100
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dare he use the term Bimbos?</v>

2972
02:10:49.190 --> 02:10:52.700
<v Speaker 4>I am triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to use that term.</v>

2973
02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:55.200
<v Speaker 4>That's a derogatory term towards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never come out though.</v>

2974
02:10:55.201 --> 02:10:57.710
<v Speaker 4>So he's coming for a guys had retard 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes ago.</v>

2975
02:10:57.770 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

2976
02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get some blowback from this</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan.</v>

2977
02:11:02.241 --> 02:11:03.340
<v Speaker 4>You know that for real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2978
02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 4>Stop hanging out with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's probably bad for you.</v>

2979
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:07.730
<v Speaker 4>I know it is bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah.</v>

2980
02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:14.230
<v Speaker 4>How can a guy like Colin Powell or even </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton have all of this stuff </v>

2981
02:11:14.230 --> 02:11:18.371
<v Speaker 4>written in emails?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like are they that out of touch that </v>

2982
02:11:18.371 --> 02:11:19.640
<v Speaker 4>this stuff is being tracked or like they</v>
<v Speaker 4>should know that it's being tracked.</v>

2983
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:24.790
<v Speaker 4>I think they felt like they could get </v>
<v Speaker 4>away with a lot more than they can get </v>

2984
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:27.551
<v Speaker 4>away with and I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about people who grew up </v>

2985
02:11:27.551 --> 02:11:30.461
<v Speaker 4>and started behaving a certain way way </v>
<v Speaker 4>before there was this level of </v>

2986
02:11:30.461 --> 02:11:30.470
<v Speaker 4>transparency.</v>

2987
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:31.880
<v Speaker 4>You're thinking they should behave </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently.</v>

2988
02:11:31.881 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 4>That's not how these people are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're thinking now how can I not use </v>

2989
02:11:36.881 --> 02:11:39.761
<v Speaker 4>that email problem again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They change you behavior change the </v>

2990
02:11:39.761 --> 02:11:40.010
<v Speaker 4>behavior they want to change is using </v>
<v Speaker 4>email.</v>

2991
02:11:40.011 --> 02:11:45.011
<v Speaker 4>That's the behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just thinking that they sort of </v>

2992
02:11:45.011 --> 02:11:47.381
<v Speaker 4>adapted to the times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the political landscape back </v>

2993
02:11:47.381 --> 02:11:48.020
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the political landscape today is</v>

2994
02:11:48.021 --> 02:11:53.021
<v Speaker 4>just way different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to literally literally thank </v>

2995
02:11:53.021 --> 02:11:53.430
<v Speaker 4>everybody is watching everything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

2996
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:57.110
<v Speaker 4>We talked about Clinton and and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and women Kennedy.</v>

2997
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:59.630
<v Speaker 4>The press knew that Kennedy was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff,</v>

2998
02:11:59.631 --> 02:12:04.631
<v Speaker 4>but there was an unwritten gentleman's </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreement that you didn't talk about </v>

2999
02:12:04.631 --> 02:12:04.631
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevermind.</v>

3000
02:12:04.631 --> 02:12:06.540
<v Speaker 4>That he might've been having sex with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Sam Giancana,</v>

3001
02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.960
<v Speaker 4>his girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>judith exner at the same time,</v>

3002
02:12:08.961 --> 02:12:12.590
<v Speaker 4>and that there might be some problems </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that nowadays.</v>

3003
02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:13.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why to me,</v>

3004
02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:18.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say Bill Clinton was just </v>

3005
02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:20.440
<v Speaker 4>impeached over sex in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody who's either dumb enough or </v>

3006
02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.490
<v Speaker 4>whatever name you want to put in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he thinks he can get away with,</v>

3007
02:12:22.491 --> 02:12:24.680
<v Speaker 4>that is somebody I don't want with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand on the nuclear button.</v>

3008
02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:25.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

3009
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Anybody with half a brain knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3010
02:12:27.291 --> 02:12:32.291
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to get away with </v>

3011
02:12:32.291 --> 02:12:32.291
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you pull that one,</v>

3012
02:12:32.291 --> 02:12:32.291
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

3013
02:12:32.291 --> 02:12:34.730
<v Speaker 4>There's no way he was 100 percent going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get caught and did it anyway.</v>

3014
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:36.770
<v Speaker 4>That's not good judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3015
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:40.520
<v Speaker 4>that kind of guy who becomes president </v>
<v Speaker 4>is usually a deck.</v>

3016
02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:45.521
<v Speaker 4>Sullinger no domestic George.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the elder George Bush </v>

3017
02:12:45.521 --> 02:12:46.650
<v Speaker 4>falls into that category and maybe he </v>
<v Speaker 4>not prudent.</v>

3018
02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he didn't explain,</v>

3019
02:12:48.741 --> 02:12:51.110
<v Speaker 4>but maybe he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that explained his wife.</v>

3020
02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.060
<v Speaker 4>Like she's just hanging out and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3021
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go dixon.</v>

3022
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:59.110
<v Speaker 4>He was a fighter pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never knew a fighter pilot who wasn't </v>

3023
02:12:59.110 --> 02:12:59.110
<v Speaker 4>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3024
02:12:59.110 --> 02:12:59.110
<v Speaker 4>get around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3025
02:12:59.110 --> 02:13:00.020
<v Speaker 4>they're savages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Savage.</v>

3026
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:02.690
<v Speaker 4>You want them that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but living on the edge,</v>

3027
02:13:02.691 --> 02:13:05.150
<v Speaker 4>but those are going to get all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter pilots right in me.</v>

3028
02:13:05.151 --> 02:13:10.151
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a terrible show for good </v>

3029
02:13:10.151 --> 02:13:10.151
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those fighter pilots,</v>

3030
02:13:10.151 --> 02:13:12.740
<v Speaker 4>they're great men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a high incidence of swinger </v>

3031
02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:12.800
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that,</v>

3032
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:16.520
<v Speaker 4>was that the fifties and sixties or was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fighter pilot who was a um,</v>

3033
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:18.200
<v Speaker 4>there was a study done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3034
02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:23.440
<v Speaker 4>it was a conversation between this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a fighter pilots about the high </v>

3035
02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Speaker 4>incidences of swingers and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I think they were saying,</v>

3036
02:13:25.431 --> 02:13:30.431
<v Speaker 4>I forget where I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there were saying that what was </v>

3037
02:13:30.431 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>going on was that these guys were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>such</v>

3038
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.980
<v Speaker 3>an intense job where there's a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>likelihood of them dying and one of the </v>

3039
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:41.661
<v Speaker 3>ways to ensure that their loved one </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be looked after is if someone </v>

3040
02:13:41.661 --> 02:13:46.101
<v Speaker 3>loved them as much as they loved them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would literally be in these </v>

3041
02:13:46.101 --> 02:13:48.930
<v Speaker 3>fighter runs with these planes flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>into hostile territory.</v>

3042
02:13:48.931 --> 02:13:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Getting shot at thinking any day could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be my last day.</v>

3043
02:13:52.051 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 3>So this desperation of like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving behind a wife and a family.</v>

3044
02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 3>And they one way they alleviated that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the,</v>

3045
02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:05.070
<v Speaker 3>the idea was that they would wife swap </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it happened naturally.</v>

3046
02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:06.900
<v Speaker 3>You know who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Chris Ryan.</v>

3047
02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Chris Ryan there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining this light.</v>

3048
02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:10.260
<v Speaker 3>Chris Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3049
02:14:10.810 --> 02:14:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm now.</v>

3050
02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like reasonably sure.</v>

3051
02:14:15.150 --> 02:14:20.150
<v Speaker 3>But that kind of makes sense because </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're someone who's every day </v>

3052
02:14:22.290 --> 02:14:25.890
<v Speaker 3>world is life and death on a level that </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fighter pilot is.</v>

3053
02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the risk taker thing where you said </v>

3054
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:32.300
<v Speaker 3>these are people who live on the edge </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's there when you.</v>

3055
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:34.380
<v Speaker 3>You fly those planes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a risk taker.</v>

3056
02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:35.950
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3057
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:38.340
<v Speaker 3>a person who is willing to do risky </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior here.</v>

3058
02:14:38.490 --> 02:14:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking of the wife swapping as</v>
<v Speaker 3>much as,</v>

3059
02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:42.900
<v Speaker 3>as having a lot of girlfriends that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't even a wife,</v>

3060
02:14:42.901 --> 02:14:44.190
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>

3061
02:14:44.191 --> 02:14:45.570
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

3062
02:14:45.810 --> 02:14:49.110
<v Speaker 3>some of those personality traits are </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably what you want in those guys.</v>

3063
02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3064
02:14:49.711 --> 02:14:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I think with the way Chris was </v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining it to was that their bond and</v>

3065
02:14:53.401 --> 02:14:58.400
<v Speaker 3>their comradery between each other was </v>
<v Speaker 3>so powerful that it's sort of a,</v>

3066
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:02.250
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of the clips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jealousy in a way,</v>

3067
02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they counted on each other so </v>

3068
02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.060
<v Speaker 3>much and they were brothers in war and </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally life or death struggle.</v>

3069
02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:14.180
<v Speaker 3>So there a bond and a comradery that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of superseded everything and that </v>

3070
02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:19.640
<v Speaker 3>the idea of like they could swap wives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just love each other more.</v>

3071
02:15:20.610 --> 02:15:25.610
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go with the outcomes rather that </v>

3072
02:15:25.610 --> 02:15:25.610
<v Speaker 3>they're more like pro athletes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

3073
02:15:25.610 --> 02:15:27.720
<v Speaker 3>they're just wall or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just there.</v>

3074
02:15:27.721 --> 02:15:29.970
<v Speaker 3>There's this swagger you'd mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The swagger,</v>

3075
02:15:29.971 --> 02:15:31.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all part of the,</v>

3076
02:15:31.111 --> 02:15:36.111
<v Speaker 3>of what kind of keeps them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kind of guys that can be fighter </v>

3077
02:15:36.111 --> 02:15:36.111
<v Speaker 3>pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3078
02:15:36.111 --> 02:15:38.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'll come with the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a bunch of those things too,</v>

3079
02:15:39.230 --> 02:15:40.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest,</v>

3080
02:15:40.941 --> 02:15:42.560
<v Speaker 3>there were fighter pilots who never did </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

3081
02:15:42.561 --> 02:15:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given the get out of jail free pass,</v>

3082
02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:48.600
<v Speaker 3>that's my Dan Carlin get in the car </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to his podcast.</v>

3083
02:15:48.601 --> 02:15:51.540
<v Speaker 3>He's guys are assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>

3084
02:15:51.541 --> 02:15:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Why do you listen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighter pilots are swingers youth pizza.</v>

3085
02:15:56.150 --> 02:15:56.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what just happened?</v>

3086
02:15:56.971 --> 02:15:59.730
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of wives turned to their x </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter pilot husbands and says,</v>

3087
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:00.930
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't involve you.</v>

3088
02:16:00.931 --> 02:16:05.931
<v Speaker 3>Did it wife swap in a new reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife swap and fighter wife swap and </v>

3089
02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.880
<v Speaker 3>fighter pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3090
02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:11.880
<v Speaker 3>for those who have not seen all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appearances I've had on this.</v>

3091
02:16:11.890 --> 02:16:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Joe started off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3092
02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:16.290
<v Speaker 3>breaking me into being on the Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast with some,</v>

3093
02:16:16.450 --> 02:16:16.820
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3094
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:21.910
<v Speaker 3>some comments initially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I just flow with it and it's </v>

3095
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:23.080
<v Speaker 3>gonna get me killed eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not gonna do anything mad.</v>

3096
02:16:23.090 --> 02:16:25.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a conversation with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just like,</v>

3097
02:16:25.621 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 3>if you and I went out to dinner in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between bites of food,</v>

3098
02:16:28.321 --> 02:16:30.500
<v Speaker 3>we would have probably the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations about stuff.</v>

3099
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3100
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:37.110
<v Speaker 3>what do you like when you see what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reports are about the Clinton </v>

3101
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:41.281
<v Speaker 3>Foundation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't totally understand what's legal </v>

3102
02:16:41.281 --> 02:16:44.791
<v Speaker 3>and what's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I've seen anyone said </v>

3103
02:16:44.791 --> 02:16:46.240
<v Speaker 3>that anything they've done is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3104
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:50.890
<v Speaker 2>It skirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3105
02:16:50.930 --> 02:16:53.750
<v Speaker 2>It falls into that category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same category that,</v>

3106
02:16:54.110 --> 02:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the giving of ambassadorships to </v>

3107
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.570
<v Speaker 2>people who give money fall into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3108
02:16:59.810 --> 02:17:04.810
<v Speaker 2>the clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question that the Clinton </v>

3109
02:17:04.810 --> 02:17:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Foundation goes and does good work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question,</v>

3110
02:17:04.810 --> 02:17:08.030
<v Speaker 2>but how much does the fact that they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>good work and that your name is attached</v>

3111
02:17:08.031 --> 02:17:13.031
<v Speaker 2>to it ended up being something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps you for less charitable reasons,</v>

3112
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

3113
02:17:13.941 --> 02:17:18.941
<v Speaker 2>it makes you look good as a candidate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be somebody that you know,</v>

3114
02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:22.130
<v Speaker 2>helps vaccine people against polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3115
02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So all of that right there has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidiary effect that you could,</v>

3116
02:17:25.341 --> 02:17:26.690
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3117
02:17:26.691 --> 02:17:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're benefiting from this will now add</v>

3118
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can give money to the foundation.</v>

3119
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Then the foundation can pay Bill Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run the mean.</v>

3120
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:41.770
<v Speaker 2>It becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you gave money to the </v>

3121
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:43.811
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that mean you get special </v>

3122
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:43.811
<v Speaker 2>treatment?</v>

3123
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:43.811
<v Speaker 2>I can hear the Hillary Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters saying,</v>

3124
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:43.811
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen,</v>

3125
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's the reason that people put </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff in a blind trust when they become </v>

3126
02:17:48.111 --> 02:17:51.440
<v Speaker 2>president so that you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your money's doing.</v>

3127
02:17:51.441 --> 02:17:55.320
<v Speaker 2>So that you can't possibly be favoritism</v>
<v Speaker 2>toward one and,</v>

3128
02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and the Clintons have basically made it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound like they're not going to do that.</v>

3129
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said to you earlier,</v>

3130
02:18:01.251 --> 02:18:04.250
<v Speaker 2>if you know they're after you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thereafter the Clintons,</v>

3131
02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:09.400
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get leave as much room between </v>

3132
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you and any potential width of scandal </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you could,</v>

3133
02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they don't,</v>

3134
02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:16.670
<v Speaker 2>but they don't Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe they can't</v>

3135
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:18.740
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3136
02:18:19.370 --> 02:18:23.180
<v Speaker 3>how could they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably are so and all those other</v>

3137
02:18:23.181 --> 02:18:26.570
<v Speaker 3>people that have been a part of all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff for so long.</v>

3138
02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3139
02:18:27.501 --> 02:18:32.501
<v Speaker 2>you've done this and I've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we both been around some of these high </v>

3140
02:18:32.501 --> 02:18:34.961
<v Speaker 2>rollers before where you realize how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much they pick up the phone and talk to </v>

3141
02:18:34.961 --> 02:18:35.870
<v Speaker 2>other high rollers and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>interconnected network is.</v>

3142
02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:38.420
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically,</v>

3143
02:18:38.421 --> 02:18:43.421
<v Speaker 2>but you could easily see that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>networking can be used for nefarious </v>

3144
02:18:43.731 --> 02:18:45.560
<v Speaker 2>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good purposes or no purposes,</v>

3145
02:18:45.561 --> 02:18:47.780
<v Speaker 2>but they all have each other on speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>dial.</v>

3146
02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's natural.</v>

3147
02:18:49.530 --> 02:18:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does seem natural.</v>

3148
02:18:50.761 --> 02:18:52.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts of have,</v>

3149
02:18:52.410 --> 02:18:57.410
<v Speaker 3>we do have that is a little known fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you and I to podcasters who learned </v>

3150
02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:03.500
<v Speaker 3>about each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moonlight on you sometimes just </v>

3151
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:03.500
<v Speaker 3>moonlight on you as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

3152
02:19:05.430 --> 02:19:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people in the same business talk </v>

3153
02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:10.430
<v Speaker 3>to each other and become tight and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect like,</v>

3154
02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it affects,</v>

3155
02:19:11.670 --> 02:19:13.500
<v Speaker 3>it affects the way they do business for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3156
02:19:13.501 --> 02:19:18.501
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't even necessarily have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like some that really carefully </v>

3157
02:19:18.541 --> 02:19:22.770
<v Speaker 3>scripted agreement is almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>known thing.</v>

3158
02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think and you know what and and in </v>

3159
02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the era of hacks and all that,</v>

3160
02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the</v>

3161
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:30.280
<v Speaker 4>smarter way to comport yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3162
02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:32.920
<v Speaker 4>Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was a taper,</v>

3163
02:19:32.930 --> 02:19:35.510
<v Speaker 4>knew when he had to have an important </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion with somebody.</v>

3164
02:19:35.511 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to make sure it was safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went for a walk,</v>

3165
02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:43.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they went for a walk past the White </v>

3166
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:44.090
<v Speaker 4>House.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got in the weeds out there and then</v>

3167
02:19:44.091 --> 02:19:46.890
<v Speaker 4>they had the discussion and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>use the n word or whatever,</v>

3168
02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:49.550
<v Speaker 4>whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point clear.</v>

3169
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:54.560
<v Speaker 4>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but think about this in 10 years,</v>

3170
02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:59.740
<v Speaker 4>in 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is this email hack scandal have </v>

3171
02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:01.760
<v Speaker 4>going to change a protocol on how all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people do things?</v>

3172
02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you watch Colin Powell and everybody </v>

3173
02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:09.911
<v Speaker 4>watching what's unfolding right now are </v>
<v Speaker 4>determining that there are going to be </v>

3174
02:20:09.911 --> 02:20:10.580
<v Speaker 4>new ways we communicate and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be like that.</v>

3175
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two different hacks,</v>

3176
02:20:12.021 --> 02:20:17.021
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the DNC hack and then there's a </v>

3177
02:20:17.021 --> 02:20:17.021
<v Speaker 4>hillary server hack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3178
02:20:17.021 --> 02:20:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Aren't they different hacks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the DNC,</v>

3179
02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 4>ar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there'll be.</v>

3180
02:20:19.551 --> 02:20:20.690
<v Speaker 4>And from what I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told you,</v>

3181
02:20:20.691 --> 02:20:23.210
<v Speaker 4>I heard there was a republican national </v>
<v Speaker 4>committee hack too.</v>

3182
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:26.240
<v Speaker 4>I love the fact that they fired that </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

3183
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:27.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you found something?</v>

3184
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:29.420
<v Speaker 4>It's not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the guy that said it,</v>

3185
02:20:29.421 --> 02:20:31.160
<v Speaker 4>said he misspoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3186
02:20:31.330 --> 02:20:36.330
<v Speaker 4>that came out later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr Scott makes me more suspicious than </v>

3187
02:20:36.330 --> 02:20:36.330
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>

3188
02:20:36.330 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot Booker's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's hilarious that,</v>

3189
02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:43.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman who got outed in the DNC hacks</v>

3190
02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:48.880
<v Speaker 4>as being this woman who is conspiring to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like put down Bernie and help Hillary,</v>

3191
02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:52.910
<v Speaker 4>like that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had a step down.</v>

3192
02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:54.890
<v Speaker 4>It was immediately hired by the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 4>campaign.</v>

3193
02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:57.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's zero transparency.</v>

3194
02:20:57.261 --> 02:20:58.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so obvious.</v>

3195
02:20:58.761 --> 02:21:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it what it.</v>

3196
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:05.290
<v Speaker 4>And the corruption is both parties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have no options besides the bulk </v>

3197
02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:05.570
<v Speaker 4>part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is where,</v>

3198
02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:10.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we said on the common sense tool </v>

3199
02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:10.680
<v Speaker 4>for 11 years now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is your focal point of the problem.</v>

3200
02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:13.160
<v Speaker 4>We have a corruption problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both parties benefit from it.</v>

3201
02:21:13.161 --> 02:21:15.230
<v Speaker 4>They have no real interest in addressing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3202
02:21:15.231 --> 02:21:20.231
<v Speaker 4>The only time they're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting corruption is that they can </v>

3203
02:21:20.231 --> 02:21:22.931
<v Speaker 4>manage to fight the kind of corruption </v>
<v Speaker 4>that helps the other side without </v>

3204
02:21:22.931 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 4>impacting the ones that help them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Republicans always say that about</v>

3205
02:21:26.001 --> 02:21:31.001
<v Speaker 4>democratic campaign finance reform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it goes after Republican funders </v>

3206
02:21:31.001 --> 02:21:31.700
<v Speaker 4>but not democratic ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

3207
02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not holier than thou,</v>

3208
02:21:33.321 --> 02:21:36.380
<v Speaker 4>they're just trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>another way to game the system,</v>

3209
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.630
<v Speaker 4>utilizing reform as the tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3210
02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:44.700
<v Speaker 4>they have to do in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all complicit in similar sorts </v>

3211
02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:44.700
<v Speaker 4>of situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

3212
02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:48.320
<v Speaker 4>the thing that was so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I said not transparent,</v>

3213
02:21:48.321 --> 02:21:53.321
<v Speaker 4>all I met completely transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that was weird about how </v>

3214
02:21:53.321 --> 02:21:55.280
<v Speaker 4>transparent it was is that there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even a gap in time of this woman getting</v>

3215
02:21:55.281 --> 02:21:57.650
<v Speaker 4>fired and then getting an appearance </v>
<v Speaker 4>purposes.</v>

3216
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like instantaneous.</v>

3217
02:21:59.541 --> 02:22:00.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like we don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to do it.</v>

3218
02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3219
02:22:01.471 --> 02:22:02.960
<v Speaker 4>she helped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hooked me up.</v>

3220
02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:08.020
<v Speaker 4>She's my girl that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just like what you said about </v>

3221
02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3222
02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:12.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that she had said that the </v>

3223
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.801
<v Speaker 4>FBI director said this about her when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>had just said something kind of </v>

3224
02:22:14.801 --> 02:22:17.591
<v Speaker 4>complete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she knew that the five percent of </v>

3225
02:22:17.591 --> 02:22:17.591
<v Speaker 4>people that would realize that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>count.</v>

3226
02:22:17.591 --> 02:22:19.760
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The five percent of people who realize,</v>

3227
02:22:19.761 --> 02:22:21.610
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just hired that cast.</v>

3228
02:22:22.130 --> 02:22:27.130
<v Speaker 4>She's not after those pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another day and more news </v>

3229
02:22:27.130 --> 02:22:27.130
<v Speaker 4>stories and a plane goes down in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Singapore or something,</v>

3230
02:22:27.130 --> 02:22:32.121
<v Speaker 4>and then there's another news story and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some fucking nuclear tests in North </v>

3231
02:22:32.121 --> 02:22:32.121
<v Speaker 4>Korea and everybody's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gone.</v>

3232
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:37.160
<v Speaker 4>Three weeks later it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just so much going on that you </v>

3233
02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.000
<v Speaker 4>can't really maintain any story like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in the news.</v>

3234
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.280
<v Speaker 4>That's why the Glenn Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Edward Snowden,</v>

3235
02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:44.520
<v Speaker 4>the way that they approach that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>structured the way it was to come out in</v>

3236
02:22:44.521 --> 02:22:47.910
<v Speaker 4>chunks because they had said if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>release it all at once,</v>

3237
02:22:47.911 --> 02:22:49.830
<v Speaker 4>it'd be this huge story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it's done.</v>

3238
02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:55.160
<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you understand how the news cycle </v>

3239
02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:57.051
<v Speaker 4>works the way you just mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to release a nice chunk and </v>

3240
02:22:57.051 --> 02:23:00.321
<v Speaker 4>then wait until the headlines die down </v>
<v Speaker 4>again and we start moving and then </v>

3241
02:23:00.321 --> 02:23:01.080
<v Speaker 4>release another chunk and that's the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>these wiki leaks is doing that right now</v>

3242
02:23:01.081 --> 02:23:06.081
<v Speaker 4>with these hacks they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're releasing it in chunks because </v>

3243
02:23:06.081 --> 02:23:09.291
<v Speaker 4>as soon as the news cycle dies down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to take advantage of the next </v>

3244
02:23:09.291 --> 02:23:12.381
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wiki leaks thing is one of the most </v>

3245
02:23:12.381 --> 02:23:15.651
<v Speaker 4>bizarre scenarios where you have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that if you asked the United States </v>

3246
02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 4>or just the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what percentage of people support </v>

3247
02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 4>with Julian assange dead?</v>

3248
02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:25.250
<v Speaker 4>What surprised what percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people support letting people understand</v>

3249
02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:28.860
<v Speaker 4>what is really going on behind the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenes be pretty overwhelming.</v>

3250
02:23:28.861 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 4>I would guarantee you be in the high </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies.</v>

3251
02:23:30.690 --> 02:23:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Some people are blindly patriotic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would just want their government to</v>

3252
02:23:34.441 --> 02:23:36.450
<v Speaker 4>just have carte blanche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few of those,</v>

3253
02:23:36.570 --> 02:23:38.310
<v Speaker 4>but I think most people would support </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

3254
02:23:38.311 --> 02:23:43.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what the fuck's going on </v>

3255
02:23:43.311 --> 02:23:45.050
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is trapped in an embassy in </v>

3256
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:46.050
<v Speaker 4>London.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't go anywhere.</v>

3257
02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:48.690
<v Speaker 4>Ecuadorian embassy or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3258
02:23:48.691 --> 02:23:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it Ecuador?</v>

3259
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:55.710
<v Speaker 4>But he's trapped in this embassy can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave and been in this house for your </v>

3260
02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:58.040
<v Speaker 4>potential rape charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3261
02:23:58.170 --> 02:24:00.520
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a rape charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supplies,</v>

3262
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:02.730
<v Speaker 4>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hanging over your head.</v>

3263
02:24:02.731 --> 02:24:03.460
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and,</v>

3264
02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:06.800
<v Speaker 4>and he can't leave to go answer the </v>
<v Speaker 4>charges because they'll grab them.</v>

3265
02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

3266
02:24:07.391 --> 02:24:11.700
<v Speaker 4>they'll grab him on completely unrelated</v>
<v Speaker 4>purposes or unrelated charges.</v>

3267
02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:14.490
<v Speaker 4>It has nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to hold him there.</v>

3268
02:24:14.530 --> 02:24:19.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really think that they'd be chasing </v>

3269
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:19.530
<v Speaker 4>him for this long because he had sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>without a condom.</v>

3270
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:20.490
<v Speaker 4>All spooning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3271
02:24:20.491 --> 02:24:21.510
<v Speaker 4>we all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

3272
02:24:21.511 --> 02:24:26.511
<v Speaker 4>Swedish court to rule on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Julian assan facing extradition of </v>

3273
02:24:26.511 --> 02:24:29.781
<v Speaker 4>Sweden over sexual assault charges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wiki leaks foundation has been </v>

3274
02:24:29.781 --> 02:24:32.931
<v Speaker 4>confirmed to a confined to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ecuadorian embassy in London for more </v>

3275
02:24:32.931 --> 02:24:35.210
<v Speaker 4>than four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

3276
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:38.930
<v Speaker 4>The Ecuadorians to to hold onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That so crazy.</v>

3277
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:42.570
<v Speaker 4>He's been in this house for four years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's what they have to do.</v>

3278
02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:44.700
<v Speaker 4>If they want to keep playing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight and narrow,</v>

3279
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:49.910
<v Speaker 4>they have to get ahold of some some leak</v>
<v Speaker 4>documents from the other side because </v>

3280
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:53.661
<v Speaker 4>otherwise it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you only get the leaked </v>

3281
02:24:53.661 --> 02:24:57.221
<v Speaker 4>documents from one side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that does impact the election and that </v>

3282
02:24:57.221 --> 02:24:57.221
<v Speaker 4>calls into question the motives of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaker.</v>

3283
02:24:57.510 --> 02:25:02.510
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're saying I release information </v>

3284
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.510
<v Speaker 4>right then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can be above the fray.</v>

3285
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:07.550
<v Speaker 4>If you say like a lot of journalists </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand how to do what you omit and </v>

3286
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:09.420
<v Speaker 4>don't release has as much value as what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

3287
02:25:09.450 --> 02:25:14.450
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if the only leaks you're getting are </v>

3288
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:14.450
<v Speaker 4>from the Democrats and the Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't being leaked,</v>

3289
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:17.400
<v Speaker 4>then that's influencing the election </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know as well as I do,</v>

3290
02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:22.580
<v Speaker 4>the other side has crap that that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just as shocking and upsetting and </v>

3291
02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 4>corrupt as the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's see that too.</v>

3292
02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

3293
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:28.320
<v Speaker 2>let's see the two and let's see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump does when he finds out that,</v>

3294
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:31.240
<v Speaker 2>but all talking shit about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3295
02:25:31.241 --> 02:25:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I am ashamed to say that there's a part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of me that says,</v>

3296
02:25:34.271 --> 02:25:39.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see that I don't want to be that </v>

3297
02:25:39.271 --> 02:25:42.321
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I read somebody online said the </v>

3298
02:25:42.321 --> 02:25:44.581
<v Speaker 2>other day that there's people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to vote for him just for the </v>

3299
02:25:44.581 --> 02:25:47.011
<v Speaker 2>entertainment value because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be bored for the next four </v>

3300
02:25:47.011 --> 02:25:47.011
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>

3301
02:25:47.011 --> 02:25:51.630
<v Speaker 2>that's when the country's really jumped </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shark when we're voting for </v>

3302
02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:51.630
<v Speaker 2>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't care what they'll do.</v>

3303
02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:52.330
<v Speaker 2>They're both bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want the most entertaining.</v>

3304
02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:54.970
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people feel that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

3305
02:25:55.150 --> 02:26:00.150
<v Speaker 2>They're also thinking that what you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at as a president is really just a </v>

3306
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:02.650
<v Speaker 2>figurehead and the military industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>job reading that book right now,</v>

3307
02:26:02.651 --> 02:26:03.550
<v Speaker 2>American coup.</v>

3308
02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:05.620
<v Speaker 2>So mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3309
02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:08.830
<v Speaker 2>if you look at what Obama promised and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at what he actually did,</v>

3310
02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:14.840
<v Speaker 2>very different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why people forget the George W dot Bush </v>

3311
02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:18.700
<v Speaker 2>actually ran on a more humble foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

3312
02:26:18.701 --> 02:26:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to have people.</v>

3313
02:26:21.761 --> 02:26:26.761
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people Americans want a more humble </v>

3314
02:26:26.761 --> 02:26:26.761
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could there be any,</v>

3315
02:26:26.761 --> 02:26:31.510
<v Speaker 2>any dichotomy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worse than a more humble for polly and </v>

3316
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.510
<v Speaker 2>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3317
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.510
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3318
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:35.140
<v Speaker 2>so we attacked Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make any sense,</v>

3319
02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.550
<v Speaker 2>and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3320
02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:41.551
<v Speaker 2>we're fucking kicking someone's ass all </v>
<v Speaker 2>right enough to shut up and wave that </v>

3321
02:26:41.551 --> 02:26:42.640
<v Speaker 2>flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you this.</v>

3322
02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who tells me that they support </v>
<v Speaker 2>the troops again but are willing to send</v>

3323
02:26:46.331 --> 02:26:49.840
<v Speaker 2>them willy nilly anywhere at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

3324
02:26:49.841 --> 02:26:54.841
<v Speaker 2>supporting the troops means you value </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives and their families and the </v>

3325
02:26:54.841 --> 02:26:58.471
<v Speaker 2>fact that many of these guys and women </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have had to go back and back and </v>

3326
02:26:58.471 --> 02:26:58.900
<v Speaker 2>back and their lives have been on hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all and they suffer.</v>

3327
02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many stories have we read about what</v>

3328
02:27:00.671 --> 02:27:05.671
<v Speaker 2>these people deal with everyday?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to the va and so let's say you want </v>

3329
02:27:05.671 --> 02:27:07.300
<v Speaker 2>to support the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed the VA,</v>

3330
02:27:07.330 --> 02:27:12.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do the things that matter to the troops </v>

3331
02:27:12.330 --> 02:27:12.400
<v Speaker 2>and then don't send them into harm's way</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless it really,</v>

3332
02:27:12.401 --> 02:27:14.590
<v Speaker 2>really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's supporting the troops.</v>

3333
02:27:14.591 --> 02:27:19.591
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the problem is we don't know </v>

3334
02:27:19.591 --> 02:27:23.670
<v Speaker 2>what is going on when we hear that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>troops need to invade some certain area.</v>

3335
02:27:24.490 --> 02:27:26.290
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it's legit or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legit.</v>

3336
02:27:26.291 --> 02:27:28.300
<v Speaker 2>We don't know who the people are that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are making the decisions.</v>

3337
02:27:28.301 --> 02:27:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately classify it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classified.</v>

3338
02:27:30.701 --> 02:27:32.720
<v Speaker 2>And we also don't think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3339
02:27:32.770 --> 02:27:37.770
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some Intel that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not sharing that might sway our opinion </v>

3340
02:27:37.770 --> 02:27:41.671
<v Speaker 2>one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that seemed like we were </v>

3341
02:27:41.671 --> 02:27:41.671
<v Speaker 2>talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3342
02:27:41.671 --> 02:27:44.870
<v Speaker 2>the Gulf of Tonkin resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last commonsense show with the Gulf </v>

3343
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:45.280
<v Speaker 2>of Tonkin resolution.</v>

3344
02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:48.460
<v Speaker 2>There were parts of it very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of it that were not released until</v>

3345
02:27:48.461 --> 02:27:51.150
<v Speaker 2>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2005 if it,</v>

3346
02:27:51.151 --> 02:27:54.880
<v Speaker 2>if you found out within a month that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin,</v>

3347
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:56.930
<v Speaker 2>which for those who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of the,</v>

3348
02:27:57.130 --> 02:28:00.910
<v Speaker 2>the excuse for why we were able to ramp </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the Vietnam war,</v>

3349
02:28:00.911 --> 02:28:02.320
<v Speaker 2>which killed a ton of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3350
02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:05.830
<v Speaker 2>If you had known within a month in real </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3351
02:28:05.831 --> 02:28:09.250
<v Speaker 2>basically that didn't happen the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they said it happened.</v>

3352
02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:12.550
<v Speaker 2>That's time enough to impact the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision making.</v>

3353
02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:14.860
<v Speaker 2>They classified it so that by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out,</v>

3354
02:28:14.861 --> 02:28:16.930
<v Speaker 2>everyone's dead and it's in a history </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

3355
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:19.450
<v Speaker 2>you have no ability to impact the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision making.</v>

3356
02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.800
<v Speaker 2>That's where classification kills us</v>

3357
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.320
<v Speaker 4>because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the electrode say to heck with this,</v>

3358
02:28:24.321 --> 02:28:26.990
<v Speaker 4>we've got to go out in the streets or we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to have a protest online.</v>

3359
02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:29.300
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>

3360
02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:33.650
<v Speaker 4>And that was one of the more ironic </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about Kennedy's assassination was</v>

3361
02:28:33.651 --> 02:28:37.080
<v Speaker 4>that they lock the files up for what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

3362
02:28:37.081 --> 02:28:41.150
<v Speaker 4>when did the full files on the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>assassination or allowed to be released,</v>

3363
02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:46.420
<v Speaker 4>but they essentially made it so that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one could investigate it for far longer </v>

3364
02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 4>than anyone's going to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think it was like 2010.</v>

3365
02:28:49.191 --> 02:28:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Then it prompts suspicion right there </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not it's desert.</v>

3366
02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:53.830
<v Speaker 4>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

3367
02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:58.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did come up with reasons because I </v>

3368
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.870
<v Speaker 4>felt the same way and I had to figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a cause.</v>

3369
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would explain it?</v>

3370
02:28:59.091 --> 02:29:04.091
<v Speaker 4>That was rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's what I came up with and I'm </v>

3371
02:29:04.091 --> 02:29:04.091
<v Speaker 4>hardly the only person who realized </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

3372
02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:09.160
<v Speaker 4>You remember Oswald had ties to Cuba and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he defected to the Soviet Union and then</v>

3373
02:29:09.261 --> 02:29:10.820
<v Speaker 4>come home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3374
02:29:10.821 --> 02:29:13.910
<v Speaker 4>So if your average joe or Jane and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know much about what's going on,</v>

3375
02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:18.911
<v Speaker 4>but you find out a Cuban defector,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cuban supporting Soviet Union defect,</v>

3376
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:21.740
<v Speaker 4>you're killed the president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that maybe that might.</v>

3377
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:23.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you see how that,</v>

3378
02:29:23.961 --> 02:29:28.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were reading the guns of August </v>

3379
02:29:28.961 --> 02:29:29.870
<v Speaker 4>on how World War One started and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it wouldn't have taken,</v>

3380
02:29:29.871 --> 02:29:34.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that was an assassination to write </v>

3381
02:29:34.871 --> 02:29:37.001
<v Speaker 4>in an open top vehicle by somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Serbians were behind that in the way </v>

3382
02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:39.410
<v Speaker 4>that the people whose archduke was </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>

3383
02:29:39.530 --> 02:29:40.090
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I mean,</v>

3384
02:29:40.170 --> 02:29:43.700
<v Speaker 4>if Americans thought that the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 4>Union killed their young president,</v>

3385
02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:47.420
<v Speaker 4>that they all loved with his wife right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and the two little children,</v>

3386
02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:49.400
<v Speaker 4>what would the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3387
02:29:49.401 --> 02:29:52.580
<v Speaker 4>this is not even a year after the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 4>missile crisis,</v>

3388
02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:58.120
<v Speaker 4>how much might that have impacted the </v>
<v Speaker 4>president's ability to keep us out of a </v>

3389
02:29:58.120 --> 02:29:58.130
<v Speaker 4>war or not?</v>

3390
02:29:58.130 --> 02:30:03.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see if somebody said that you </v>

3391
02:30:03.130 --> 02:30:05.321
<v Speaker 4>might have a very good reason for hiding</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that Oswald had really close </v>

3392
02:30:05.321 --> 02:30:05.330
<v Speaker 4>ties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3393
02:30:05.331 --> 02:30:10.331
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to find out a rationale </v>
<v Speaker 4>that made sense to me and that would be </v>

3394
02:30:10.331 --> 02:30:14.531
<v Speaker 4>a rationale that made sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you have to classify it </v>

3395
02:30:14.531 --> 02:30:14.960
<v Speaker 4>for a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they basically did.</v>

3396
02:30:15.610 --> 02:30:17.630
<v Speaker 4>What does the year next year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>October 26th,</v>

3397
02:30:17.631 --> 02:30:22.631
<v Speaker 4>2017 shit when it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Redactions will be all over the place.</v>

3398
02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you'll have if and,</v>

3399
02:30:25.761 --> 02:30:28.190
<v Speaker 4>but or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

3400
02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:33.640
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have leaked some stuff or </v>

3401
02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:36.041
<v Speaker 4>release some stuff through the Freedom </v>
<v Speaker 4>Information Act that people would </v>

3402
02:30:36.041 --> 02:30:38.891
<v Speaker 4>consider incredibly offensive and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>found out about it like 1962 northwoods </v>

3403
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 4>operation northwoods where they designed</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tax on Guantanamo Bay.</v>

3404
02:30:45.471 --> 02:30:48.170
<v Speaker 4>They were going to arm Cuban friendlies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and attack one tottenham obey,</v>

3405
02:30:48.171 --> 02:30:49.130
<v Speaker 4>potentially killing.</v>

3406
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:54.130
<v Speaker 4>Who knows how many soldiers they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to blow up a drone jetliner and </v>

3407
02:30:54.130 --> 02:30:57.650
<v Speaker 4>blame it on the Cubans all if you look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the stuff that the CIA was doing.</v>

3408
02:30:57.651 --> 02:31:00.200
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's stupid to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't do the similar things now.</v>

3409
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:02.720
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy stuff.</v>

3410
02:31:03.660 --> 02:31:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Kills a stuff that is so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing,</v>

3411
02:31:06.291 --> 02:31:11.291
<v Speaker 4>stuff that is so opposed to the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 4>fifties highschool mythology of America </v>

3412
02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:14.840
<v Speaker 4>that it's hard to reconcile the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those people will say,</v>

3413
02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:16.790
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the real world.</v>

3414
02:31:16.820 --> 02:31:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3415
02:31:17.751 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 4>we were trying to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had hydrogen</v>

3416
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.500
<v Speaker 2>bombs aimed at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all that stuff is true,</v>

3417
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:25.400
<v Speaker 2>but how do you reconcile it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3418
02:31:25.570 --> 02:31:26.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

3419
02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:29.740
<v Speaker 3>that was a giant issue with Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3420
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and secrecy itself was a giant issue </v>

3421
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:37.111
<v Speaker 3>with Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so ironic that they sealed his </v>

3422
02:31:37.111 --> 02:31:39.391
<v Speaker 3>death up for 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember that very famous speech </v>

3423
02:31:39.391 --> 02:31:39.790
<v Speaker 3>that he had were about secrecy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3424
02:31:39.850 --> 02:31:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About transparency being important.</v>

3425
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Or my favorite line from Kennedy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>always the one where he says,</v>

3426
02:31:44.431 --> 02:31:47.490
<v Speaker 2>those who make peaceful change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3427
02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:48.930
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make violent change.</v>

3428
02:31:48.931 --> 02:31:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3429
02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:52.770
<v Speaker 2>those are the kinds of things where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder about us now will you say,</v>

3430
02:31:52.771 --> 02:31:55.230
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to have our system evolve in</v>

3431
02:31:55.231 --> 02:31:58.920
<v Speaker 2>ways that make it better are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent really bad things from happening</v>

3432
02:31:58.921 --> 02:32:00.120
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't,</v>

3433
02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:04.440
<v Speaker 2>if we can't get it together now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just follow the current trends outward.</v>

3434
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.050
<v Speaker 2>If nothing changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the 20,</v>

3435
02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:12.051
<v Speaker 2>20 election gonna look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you a Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone </v>

3436
02:32:12.051 --> 02:32:12.660
<v Speaker 2>type of guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am now.</v>

3437
02:32:12.661 --> 02:32:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I changed my mind on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>

3438
02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3439
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Who got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3440
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:22.640
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what always upsets me about </v>

3441
02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:22.640
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them,</v>

3442
02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:25.050
<v Speaker 2>but I wish they wouldn't leave stuff out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of there,</v>

3443
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:28.820
<v Speaker 2>out of their stories that disprove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looked bad.</v>

3444
02:32:28.850 --> 02:32:29.940
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody does that.</v>

3445
02:32:29.941 --> 02:32:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody likes to say,</v>

3446
02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:32.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you the things that,</v>

3447
02:32:32.770 --> 02:32:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that backup my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with Oswald,</v>

3448
02:32:35.281 --> 02:32:36.600
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of books that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3449
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Vince Bull Yossi had one.</v>

3450
02:32:38.841 --> 02:32:43.841
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerald Posner had another where they </v>

3451
02:32:43.841 --> 02:32:46.041
<v Speaker 2>included stuff that was not in all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy books that I read and I've </v>

3452
02:32:46.041 --> 02:32:46.980
<v Speaker 2>read a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

3453
02:32:46.981 --> 02:32:48.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

3454
02:32:48.270 --> 02:32:49.470
<v Speaker 2>why the hell didn't you put that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

3455
02:32:49.471 --> 02:32:54.471
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm mad at you and I don't trust you</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much stuff can be the fact that </v>

3456
02:32:54.471 --> 02:32:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Oswald took a shot at a US general </v>
<v Speaker 2>before he took a shot at Kennedy.</v>

3457
02:32:56.820 --> 02:33:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you figured out that he needed to do </v>

3458
02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:01.820
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh God,</v>

3459
02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to say who was the general two to</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

3460
02:33:03.001 --> 02:33:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I would have remembered his name go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to look up Lee Harvey Oswald.</v>

3461
02:33:06.090 --> 02:33:11.090
<v Speaker 2>He took a shot at the general and missed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with the same rifle I believe,</v>

3462
02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:16.610
<v Speaker 2>and it was posner and bull Yossi that </v>
<v Speaker 2>both pointed that out and when you turn </v>

3463
02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:16.610
<v Speaker 2>around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3464
02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:18.300
<v Speaker 2>if the guy was really taking a shot at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the US general,</v>

3465
02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>now that changes my overall view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Oswald's</v>

3466
02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:26.180
<v Speaker 3>earlier attempt to assassinate General </v>
<v Speaker 3>Walker</v>

3467
02:33:27.150 --> 02:33:29.710
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you hear that again,</v>

3468
02:33:29.740 --> 02:33:34.740
<v Speaker 2>now that might not be anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why'd you leave some of that out of </v>

3469
02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:34.740
<v Speaker 2>my conspiracy book?</v>

3470
02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:35.270
<v Speaker 3>That's important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3471
02:33:35.271 --> 02:33:40.271
<v Speaker 3>as an another thing about the Oswald </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that always bugged me was that </v>

3472
02:33:40.271 --> 02:33:42.680
<v Speaker 3>they said that the scope wasn't cited in</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

3473
02:33:42.850 --> 02:33:44.740
<v Speaker 3>The man lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no rifle.</v>

3474
02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:49.980
<v Speaker 3>How could he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could he get off that shot when the </v>

3475
02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:50.090
<v Speaker 3>scope wasn't even cited improperly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

3476
02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:51.910
<v Speaker 3>how do you know it's not cited </v>
<v Speaker 3>improperly?</v>

3477
02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:57.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not cited improperly because right </v>

3478
02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:57.020
<v Speaker 3>after they found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shot with it.</v>

3479
02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:58.850
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take for they shot with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3480
02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Do you know anything about scopes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something about scopes.</v>

3481
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000
<v Speaker 3>You fucking drop your rifle in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and that thing gets off the </v>

3482
02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:07.000
<v Speaker 3>caliber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uncalibrated.</v>

3483
02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.500
<v Speaker 3>It happens easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could bang your rifle against a log </v>

3484
02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:15.851
<v Speaker 3>or a rock or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doubt he was putting it down and </v>

3485
02:34:15.851 --> 02:34:15.990
<v Speaker 3>carefully after shooting the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

3486
02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck was handling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was so much</v>

3487
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:19.930
<v Speaker 4>shenanigans involved in handling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right way,</v>

3488
02:34:19.931 --> 02:34:24.931
<v Speaker 4>so that argument I reject because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they said that the gun wasn't cited in </v>

3489
02:34:25.121 --> 02:34:25.840
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3490
02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:27.670
<v Speaker 4>that does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

3491
02:34:27.671 --> 02:34:32.671
<v Speaker 4>You have no idea what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it was cited in when he pulled the </v>

3492
02:34:32.671 --> 02:34:32.671
<v Speaker 4>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

3493
02:34:32.671 --> 02:34:34.210
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy to throw off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy had pissed off a lot of a lot of</v>

3494
02:34:34.211 --> 02:34:37.630
<v Speaker 4>people and so when you talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy and having motive,</v>

3495
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 4>there were a lot of people that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>motive.</v>

3496
02:34:39.610 --> 02:34:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I always hate it when they know the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Oliver Stone movie drove me crazy </v>

3497
02:34:44.610 --> 02:34:45.460
<v Speaker 4>because in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie he did on JFK,</v>

3498
02:34:45.610 --> 02:34:50.610
<v Speaker 4>he took every conspiracy theory out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and throw them all in which </v>

3499
02:34:50.610 --> 02:34:54.811

<v Speaker 4>No good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3504
02:35:02.290 --> 02:35:07.180
<v Speaker 4>They do that in these movies that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be about real history.</v>

3505
02:35:07.210 --> 02:35:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did it with the doors and then when </v>

02:35:12.210 --> 02:35:12.210
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was called.</v>

3507
02:35:12.210 --> 02:35:12.820
<v Speaker 4>He was called on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His answer was this wasn't a movie about</v>

3508
02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:17.880
<v Speaker 4>the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In reality was a movie about what I </v>

3509
02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:17.880
<v Speaker 4>thought about the doors when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting in Vietnam,</v>

3510
02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.350
<v Speaker 4>listening to their music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got The dude say that at the beginning </v>

3511
02:35:22.350 --> 02:35:22.350
<v Speaker 4>of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put up this.</v>

3512
02:35:22.350 --> 02:35:26.030
<v Speaker 4>This is a fictionalized version of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought when I was in such a the great</v>

3513
02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:26.980
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

02:35:27.350 --> 02:35:30.530
<v Speaker 4>they alexander the great film to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just going to add this movie.</v>

3515
02:35:30.531 --> 02:35:32.170
<v Speaker 4>The snowden movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got coming out this week.</v>

3516
02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:37.120
<v Speaker 4>Oliver Stone didn't get funding for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Stoughton in the US in Germany.</v>

3517
02:35:37.121 --> 02:35:39.520
<v Speaker 4>He found both financial support and </v>
<v Speaker 4>filming locations.</v>

3518
02:35:39.521 --> 02:35:44.521
<v Speaker 4>First political thriller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's released as low key as a US </v>

3519
02:35:44.521 --> 02:35:48.151
<v Speaker 4>trying to keep it under wraps is the US </v>
<v Speaker 4>like visit the US operates as one giant.</v>

3520
02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:50.190
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3521
02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:55.320
<v Speaker 4>The press is keeping it down because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want everybody to talk about </v>

3522
02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:55.320
<v Speaker 4>the snowden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

3523
02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:57.460
<v Speaker 4>if they thought it would make $150,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million dollars,</v>

3524
02:35:57.461 --> 02:35:59.560
<v Speaker 4>the studios,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd be pushing it left right and center</v>

3525
02:35:59.561 --> 02:36:02.170
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd love a hit of any kind regardless</v>

3526
02:36:02.171 --> 02:36:07.171
<v Speaker 4>of what it said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were we just talking about before </v>

3527
02:36:07.171 --> 02:36:07.870
<v Speaker 4>you brought that up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A JFK.</v>

3528
02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:10.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm oliver stone stuff into those </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>

3529
02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So No,</v>

3530
02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:12.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those uh,</v>

3531
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:17.370
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to know what other things led </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to believe that a Lee Harvey Oswald </v>

3532
02:36:17.370 --> 02:36:19.030
<v Speaker 4>acted alone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3533
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean originally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3534
02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:23.380
<v Speaker 4>when you follow the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you see it's not just the fact that,</v>

3535
02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:28.500
<v Speaker 4>that it probably happened a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when you follow the conspiracy </v>

3536
02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:28.500
<v Speaker 4>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize,</v>

3537
02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:29.830
<v Speaker 4>you know what they're bringing to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>equation.</v>

3538
02:36:29.831 --> 02:36:33.330
<v Speaker 4>How much do I believe the David for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cuban idea?</v>

3539
02:36:33.330 --> 02:36:35.680
<v Speaker 4>How much do I believe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after going through it,</v>

3540
02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:37.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go read like book Yossi his book,</v>

3541
02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:40.300
<v Speaker 4>he was the guy who wrote helter skelter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He prosecuted Manson,</v>

3542
02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:43.240
<v Speaker 4>he was a guy I liked a lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

3543
02:36:43.241 --> 02:36:45.910
<v Speaker 4>he wrote a book where he did it like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecutor.</v>

3544
02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:48.760
<v Speaker 4>So here's how I would have prosecuted </v>
<v Speaker 4>Oswald.</v>

3545
02:36:49.150 --> 02:36:51.970
<v Speaker 4>And when he lines it up the way he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sit there and go,</v>

3546
02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:54.370
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not an I know bull.</v>

3547
02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:59.371
<v Speaker 4>You'll see he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a guy that would have loved to </v>

3548
02:36:59.371 --> 02:36:59.371
<v Speaker 4>have written that it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would have loved to have said Kennedy</v>

3549
02:36:59.371 --> 02:37:01.730
<v Speaker 4>was assassinated by a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he did.</v>

3550
02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Then he ran down the list and you sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and go,</v>

3551
02:37:03.341 --> 02:37:08.341
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was at the trial and I was on the </v>

3552
02:37:08.341 --> 02:37:08.530
<v Speaker 4>jury and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the preponderance of evidence?</v>

3553
02:37:08.531 --> 02:37:10.300
<v Speaker 4>And did the prosecutor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3554
02:37:10.450 --> 02:37:15.450
<v Speaker 4>prove his case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have had to have set after </v>

3555
02:37:15.450 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 4>reading [inaudible] book that had less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really had a vested</v>

3556
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:21.190
<v Speaker 3>interest in believing the conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory that he had done a damn good job </v>

3557
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:25.270
<v Speaker 3>of making his case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my problem with it and this is </v>

3558
02:37:25.270 --> 02:37:27.140
<v Speaker 3>one that for whatever reason I don't see</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up very often.</v>

3559
02:37:27.890 --> 02:37:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have to be mutually </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusive.</v>

3560
02:37:29.811 --> 02:37:34.811
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Oswald was innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Oswald very well as the might </v>

3561
02:37:34.811 --> 02:37:39.370
<v Speaker 3>have shot at the at the present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's highly likely they set </v>

3562
02:37:39.370 --> 02:37:43.691
<v Speaker 3>up more than one shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a possibility that </v>

3563
02:37:43.691 --> 02:37:47.200
<v Speaker 3>gunfire echoing from that building could</v>
<v Speaker 3>make people think that it was coming </v>

3564
02:37:47.661 --> 02:37:52.661
<v Speaker 3>from the grassy knoll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many people that said </v>

3565
02:37:52.661 --> 02:37:55.751
<v Speaker 3>that gunfire was coming from the grassy </v>
<v Speaker 3>knoll that you have to wonder and you </v>

3566
02:37:55.751 --> 02:37:58.490
<v Speaker 3>look at the shots that hit Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the one in his neck.</v>

3567
02:37:58.491 --> 02:38:00.740
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the more interesting books that I</v>

3568
02:38:00.741 --> 02:38:03.980
<v Speaker 3>read about it was a case case closed.</v>

3569
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:05.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm best evidence by David.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lifted.</v>

3570
02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Lifted was the one that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he say that they put something in</v>

3571
02:38:09.171 --> 02:38:12.290
<v Speaker 3>the autopsy and Kennedy's head like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3572
02:38:12.310 --> 02:38:13.160
<v Speaker 3>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3573
02:38:13.170 --> 02:38:18.170
<v Speaker 3>was it or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the part that blew me away </v>

3574
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.170
<v Speaker 3>because when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3575
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.410
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have the Kennedy autopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3576
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:23.950
<v Speaker 3>And then to eventually release those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was shocking and put it in the </v>

3577
02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:23.950
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3578
02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3579
02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:26.660
<v Speaker 3>they also changed between Bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maryland,</v>

3580
02:38:26.661 --> 02:38:29.630
<v Speaker 3>and Dallas in that flight from Dallas to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bethesda,</v>

3581
02:38:29.631 --> 02:38:33.020
<v Speaker 3>they changed the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what the impact was.</v>

3582
02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:36.890
<v Speaker 3>They were calling it a bullet hole in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his neck in Dallas.</v>

3583
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:41.750
<v Speaker 3>And then when it got to Bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they refer to it as a tracheotomy whole.</v>

3584
02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Here's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was hit from the front end,</v>

3585
02:38:44.811 --> 02:38:49.811
<v Speaker 3>from the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's entirely possible that Oswald </v>

3586
02:38:49.811 --> 02:38:51.260
<v Speaker 3>also was involved and that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people involved.</v>

3587
02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:55.310
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to assassinate the president,</v>

3588
02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:58.340
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have a conspiracy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinate the president,</v>

3589
02:38:58.341 --> 02:39:03.341
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna use a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't they use someone like </v>

3590
02:39:03.341 --> 02:39:06.071
<v Speaker 3>Oswald?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't they use some crazy fuck </v>

3591
02:39:06.071 --> 02:39:07.700
<v Speaker 3>who emigrates to Russia and comes back </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a Russian wife and he's involved in</v>

3592
02:39:07.701 --> 02:39:11.090
<v Speaker 3>communist propaganda and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other crazy,</v>

3593
02:39:11.091 --> 02:39:12.440
<v Speaker 3>unsavory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty shoots.</v>

3594
02:39:12.441 --> 02:39:13.700
<v Speaker 3>It generals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3595
02:39:13.730 --> 02:39:14.930
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3596
02:39:14.931 --> 02:39:17.510
<v Speaker 3>A guy you would use and he might've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved to.</v>

3597
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:19.560
<v Speaker 3>It might have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>

3598
02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:24.720
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another it always the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The debate is always a mutually </v>

3599
02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:27.761
<v Speaker 3>exclusive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either Oswald acted alone or the CIA </v>

3600
02:39:27.761 --> 02:39:29.060
<v Speaker 3>killed Kennedy or the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck with the Cubans,</v>

3601
02:39:29.061 --> 02:39:31.690
<v Speaker 3>the mob and they blamed it on Oswald.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3602
02:39:31.691 --> 02:39:33.590
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could totally be.</v>

3603
02:39:33.591 --> 02:39:36.440
<v Speaker 3>He was a part of it all and that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was more than one shooter.</v>

3604
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:39.170
<v Speaker 3>That seems to me to be the most likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3605
02:39:41.390 --> 02:39:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly possible when Jack Ruby </v>
<v Speaker 3>runs up to him and shoots him in front </v>

3606
02:39:46.390 --> 02:39:49.781
<v Speaker 3>of all those cops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those cops were walking them out there </v>

3607
02:39:49.781 --> 02:39:49.820
<v Speaker 3>and there was assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're holding onto his arm.</v>

3608
02:39:49.821 --> 02:39:52.040
<v Speaker 3>We've got them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got the guy who shot the president</v>

3609
02:39:52.310 --> 02:39:53.810
<v Speaker 3>out in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of everybody.</v>

3610
02:39:53.811 --> 02:39:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Who was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy with a gun.</v>

3611
02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

3612
02:39:56.390 --> 02:40:01.390
<v Speaker 3>The guy who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was my mentor when I first started </v>

3613
02:40:01.390 --> 02:40:03.770
<v Speaker 3>in news was a local guy here that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows new guide him,</v>

3614
02:40:03.771 --> 02:40:08.771
<v Speaker 3>John Babcock and babcock was a Texas guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>originally and he was in the motorcade </v>

3615
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:13.750
<v Speaker 3>in the very last car because they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>press writing and the so far,</v>

3616
02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3617
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:16.200
<v Speaker 2>he was in the motorcade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they went.</v>

3618
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:21.230
<v Speaker 2>He was at Parkland when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was announced at Kennedy was </v>

3619
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.480
<v Speaker 2>dead and then he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me the story.</v>

3620
02:40:21.481 --> 02:40:23.600
<v Speaker 2>He had good stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had good Manson stories too.</v>

3621
02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:29.060
<v Speaker 2>He was in the room with ruby before they</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought Oswald out before ruby killed </v>

3622
02:40:30.271 --> 02:40:32.430
<v Speaker 2>him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing here today?</v>

3623
02:40:32.431 --> 02:40:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Jack and Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had a conversation beforehand.</v>

3624
02:40:37.530 --> 02:40:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall what John Thought in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of conspiracy or not conspiracy,</v>

3625
02:40:42.661 --> 02:40:47.661
<v Speaker 2>but I remember that that was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seminal moment in his career because he </v>

3626
02:40:47.661 --> 02:40:50.751
<v Speaker 2>was broadcasting live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on the radio while it was all </v>

3627
02:40:50.751 --> 02:40:53.181
<v Speaker 2>going on and he was there at the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also had the most awesome Manson </v>

3628
02:40:53.181 --> 02:40:57.981
<v Speaker 2>stuff because I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The station I worked at KBC was big in </v>

3629
02:40:57.981 --> 02:40:58.680
<v Speaker 2>the Manson investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones that actually found the</v>

3630
02:40:58.681 --> 02:41:03.681
<v Speaker 2>bloody clothes a year later on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hillside while they were filming a </v>

3631
02:41:03.681 --> 02:41:06.951
<v Speaker 2>recreation and that's how the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes got found and he would go and </v>

3632
02:41:07.111 --> 02:41:10.920
<v Speaker 2>speak to Manson all the time through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manson was not convicted yet,</v>

3633
02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:15.921
<v Speaker 2>so he's on trial and awaiting trial and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had Manson became friends and up on </v>

3634
02:41:15.921 --> 02:41:18.390
<v Speaker 2>his wall he had a photo of Charles </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manson within Pencil,</v>

3635
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.890
<v Speaker 2>a note and I still remember what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

3636
02:41:19.890 --> 02:41:21.960
<v Speaker 2>It said to the trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come early,</v>

3637
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:23.970
<v Speaker 2>stay late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be quite a show.</v>

3638
02:41:24.390 --> 02:41:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that,</v>

3639
02:41:26.011 --> 02:41:29.130
<v Speaker 2>writing that Manson data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at it and it was weird.</v>

3640
02:41:29.131 --> 02:41:31.290
<v Speaker 2>You could see that the pencil was </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken,</v>

3641
02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:33.090
<v Speaker 2>like he would snap the point off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pencil,</v>

3642
02:41:33.091 --> 02:41:34.650
<v Speaker 2>every couple of words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3643
02:41:34.651 --> 02:41:36.690
<v Speaker 2>do you know why the point of the pencil </v>
<v Speaker 2>snapped?</v>

3644
02:41:36.691 --> 02:41:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3645
02:41:37.081 --> 02:41:38.030
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

3646
02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:43.040
<v Speaker 2>The guy had no education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was pretty smart and he used to </v>

3647
02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:46.290
<v Speaker 2>get so frustrated at his inability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express himself that break the pencil.</v>

3648
02:41:46.530 --> 02:41:49.830
<v Speaker 2>So then once he was convicted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember he was sent to death row.</v>

3649
02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:55.100
<v Speaker 2>John said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped paying attention to him </v>

3650
02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:55.100
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on death row.</v>

3651
02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:58.341
<v Speaker 2>I'm moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So manson started sending him messages </v>

3652
02:41:58.341 --> 02:41:58.341
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you come and visit me anymore?</v>

3653
02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:01.500
<v Speaker 2>And so finally John went and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manson said,</v>

3654
02:42:01.501 --> 02:42:03.110
<v Speaker 2>so why don't you come and visit me </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>

3655
02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:03.750
<v Speaker 2>And John said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3656
02:42:03.751 --> 02:42:04.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie,</v>

3657
02:42:04.591 --> 02:42:05.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to the.</v>

3658
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:08.100
<v Speaker 2>And Manson says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't think I can,</v>

3659
02:42:08.130 --> 02:42:08.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think I'm.</v>

3660
02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3661
02:42:09.630 --> 02:42:11.250
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back in a week.</v>

3662
02:42:11.251 --> 02:42:16.251
<v Speaker 2>And so John says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I come back in a week and all Manson </v>

3663
02:42:16.251 --> 02:42:18.711
<v Speaker 2>did was slide under the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cocktail Napkin type thing and on</v>

3664
02:42:18.901 --> 02:42:23.460
<v Speaker 2>it was drawn the layout of John's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

3665
02:42:23.461 --> 02:42:28.461
<v Speaker 2>I went home and I bought three shotguns </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I put them in loaded in various </v>

3666
02:42:28.461 --> 02:42:28.830
<v Speaker 2>parts of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3667
02:42:28.831 --> 02:42:33.831
<v Speaker 2>they're still there to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically wouldn't that scare the </v>

3668
02:42:33.831 --> 02:42:34.260
<v Speaker 2>hell out of you that have somebody draw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

3669
02:42:34.290 --> 02:42:39.290
<v Speaker 2>he'd sent somebody to John's house to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>look around and then tell them what it </v>

3670
02:42:39.290 --> 02:42:41.790
<v Speaker 2>looked like and then sending the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktail that African.</v>

3671
02:42:42.390 --> 02:42:43.950
<v Speaker 2>He had so many good stories that old.</v>

3672
02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:48.980
<v Speaker 2>He was old fashioned news guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was in the Kennedy thing and we </v>

3673
02:42:48.980 --> 02:42:53.211
<v Speaker 2>used to talk about that all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I wish I could remember 50 year old </v>

3674
02:42:53.211 --> 02:42:53.730
<v Speaker 2>brain bus speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What John had told me about his thinking</v>

3675
02:42:53.731 --> 02:42:54.990
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

3676
02:42:54.991 --> 02:42:59.991
<v Speaker 2>I guess my attitude is I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 2>disinclined to believe conspiracy </v>

3677
02:42:59.991 --> 02:43:03.411
<v Speaker 2>theories and less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The preponderance of evidence convinces </v>

3678
02:43:03.411 --> 02:43:03.411
<v Speaker 2>me otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we talked about when I read it,</v>

3679
02:43:03.411 --> 02:43:07.510
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an absolute false flag that was </v>

3680
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:09.630
<v Speaker 2>perpetrated on the American public </v>
<v Speaker 2>resulting in us going to war,</v>

3681
02:43:09.631 --> 02:43:11.260
<v Speaker 2>ramping up the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing.</v>

3682
02:43:11.290 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how many people,</v>

3683
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:17.100
<v Speaker 4>but everybody that the people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>government don't have to sweat the Kent.</v>

3684
02:43:17.101 --> 02:43:22.101
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the people around Kennedy were </v>

3685
02:43:22.101 --> 02:43:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy's people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so whether you're talking about the </v>

3686
02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:24.520
<v Speaker 4>defense secretary or a lot of the whiz </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

3687
02:43:24.521 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 4>they were called when Kennedy brought in</v>
<v Speaker 4>these new people from private industry.</v>

3688
02:43:27.461 --> 02:43:31.030
<v Speaker 4>They were his people and they stayed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Johnson administration.</v>

3689
02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:33.880
<v Speaker 4>Those people would have had to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3690
02:43:33.881 --> 02:43:38.881
<v Speaker 4>if they had thought that their boss who </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought them into government had been </v>

3691
02:43:38.881 --> 02:43:39.960
<v Speaker 4>killed by Johnson or by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3692
02:43:39.961 --> 02:43:40.410
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3693
02:43:40.411 --> 02:43:42.880
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to believe what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they know?</v>

3694
02:43:43.300 --> 02:43:44.500
<v Speaker 4>How would you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3695
02:43:44.501 --> 02:43:47.800
<v Speaker 4>If you're all in an office and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>working with president gets shot,</v>

3696
02:43:47.890 --> 02:43:52.890
<v Speaker 4>you think you're going to get more </v>
<v Speaker 4>information than the average person on </v>

3697
02:43:52.890 --> 02:43:52.890
<v Speaker 4>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're probably not.</v>

3698
02:43:52.930 --> 02:43:57.930
<v Speaker 4>You're probably going to have to read </v>
<v Speaker 4>the news reports just like everybody </v>

3699
02:43:57.930 --> 02:43:57.930
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

3700
02:43:57.930 --> 02:43:57.930
<v Speaker 4>You're going to see Oswald paraded out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3701
02:43:57.930 --> 02:43:58.900
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See Jack Ruby,</v>

3702
02:43:58.901 --> 02:44:03.901
<v Speaker 4>shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have people in your </v>

3703
02:44:03.901 --> 02:44:05.761
<v Speaker 4>organization tell you that they shot the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who shot the president and you're </v>

3704
02:44:05.761 --> 02:44:09.001
<v Speaker 4>going to believe it until you see this </v>
<v Speaker 4>approved or film until you watching the </v>

3705
02:44:09.001 --> 02:44:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Geraldo Rivera show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Dick Gregory brings on the Zapruder </v>

3706
02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:14.020
<v Speaker 4>film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it like 10 years later?</v>

3707
02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:15.970
<v Speaker 4>And I remember this wasn't like 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>later.</v>

3708
02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:21.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what year did it wasn't like they </v>

3709
02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:23.880
<v Speaker 4>assassinated him in 63 and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 4>he made it on the Dick Gregory show </v>

3710
02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:25.720
<v Speaker 4>until the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3711
02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:28.960
<v Speaker 4>it was late seventies to I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the Geraldo Rivera show.</v>

3712
02:44:29.290 --> 02:44:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Was it then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question either if it wasn't </v>

3713
02:44:34.290 --> 02:44:34.290
<v Speaker 4>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look at all the different people that</v>

3714
02:44:34.290 --> 02:44:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Oliver Stone could throw into a film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3715
02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:39.040
<v Speaker 4>Which the Mafia or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not the government,</v>

3716
02:44:39.041 --> 02:44:41.740
<v Speaker 4>then the government has no reason at all</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cover it up.</v>

3717
02:44:41.890 --> 02:44:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3718
02:44:42.361 --> 02:44:47.361
<v Speaker 4>If the mafia does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert F Kennedy is going after the </v>

3719
02:44:47.361 --> 02:44:47.470
<v Speaker 4>mafia all the time anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just gives him one more reason to go.</v>

3720
02:44:47.650 --> 02:44:51.190
<v Speaker 4>So the only way this becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy that stays secret and,</v>

3721
02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:53.580
<v Speaker 4>and involves the government not </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigating it,</v>

3722
02:44:53.581 --> 02:44:58.581
<v Speaker 4>is if the government is in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the only conspiracy theory </v>

3723
02:44:58.581 --> 02:45:01.060
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense on why the government </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't pursue the conspiracy theory.</v>

3724
02:45:01.210 --> 02:45:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if the government is in on it,</v>

3725
02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:06.880
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people have to be in on it?</v>

3726
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.960
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

3727
02:45:07.961 --> 02:45:09.920
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the narrative that they can find,</v>

3728
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:11.850
<v Speaker 4>they didn't compartmentalize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was standard.</v>

3729
02:45:11.851 --> 02:45:16.851
<v Speaker 4>I do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is compartmentalized and </v>

3730
02:45:16.851 --> 02:45:16.851
<v Speaker 4>there's a need to know basis and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3731
02:45:16.851 --> 02:45:21.541
<v Speaker 4>unless you're some dude in a movie who </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to get to the bottom of it and he </v>

3732
02:45:21.541 --> 02:45:24.771
<v Speaker 4>was sneaking into the building in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of the Warren Commission report </v>

3733
02:45:24.771 --> 02:45:24.771
<v Speaker 4>and the magic bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff is,</v>

3734
02:45:24.771 --> 02:45:29.201
<v Speaker 4>is part of the cover up if you buy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory while the Warren Commission </v>

3735
02:45:29.201 --> 02:45:33.721
<v Speaker 4>report in and of itself is what lyft and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uses and a reason to go in and start </v>

3736
02:45:34.661 --> 02:45:36.370
<v Speaker 4>investigating the Kennedy assassination.</v>

3737
02:45:36.410 --> 02:45:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I told it was a good reason to have </v>

3738
02:45:41.410 --> 02:45:43.171
<v Speaker 4>covered it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you believe that the American people </v>

3739
02:45:43.171 --> 02:45:45.571
<v Speaker 4>would draw a natural conclusion that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet agent killed our president and </v>

3740
02:45:45.671 --> 02:45:46.270
<v Speaker 4>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3741
02:45:46.271 --> 02:45:48.700
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy had been trying to assassinate </v>
<v Speaker 4>Castro to.</v>

3742
02:45:48.701 --> 02:45:52.500
<v Speaker 4>So there were reasons for a Cuban group </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people to take.</v>

3743
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:54.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of enemies.</v>

3744
02:45:54.731 --> 02:45:57.460
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of enemies also in </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

3745
02:45:57.461 --> 02:46:02.461
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to get rid of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to do a lot of stuff that </v>

3746
02:46:02.461 --> 02:46:06.331
<v Speaker 4>people didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the speech that he gave about </v>

3747
02:46:06.331 --> 02:46:08.731
<v Speaker 4>transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about secret secrets and secret </v>

3748
02:46:08.731 --> 02:46:10.250
<v Speaker 4>societies being a damaging part of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

3749
02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean that was all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all not good if you want to stay </v>

3750
02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:15.780
<v Speaker 4>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3751
02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:17.780
<v Speaker 4>and I want to make it clear when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to these kinds of theories,</v>

3752
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I try to have an open mind and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3753
02:46:20.041 --> 02:46:20.900
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3754
02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:25.960
<v Speaker 4>try to look at every angle and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that these things are not </v>

3755
02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:25.960
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

3756
02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:28.990
<v Speaker 4>You had asked me if I had a view and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to have one view and now I have </v>

3757
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:28.990
<v Speaker 4>another view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3758
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:33.880
<v Speaker 4>if evidence came out tomorrow that said </v>
<v Speaker 4>that made it look like it was a </v>

3759
02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:35.150
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy or I would be perfectly happy</v>
<v Speaker 4>to switch again.</v>

3760
02:46:35.151 --> 02:46:35.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try,</v>

3761
02:46:35.810 --> 02:46:38.510
<v Speaker 4>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be flexible on these things.</v>

3762
02:46:38.511 --> 02:46:41.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a vested interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you say those things,</v>

3763
02:46:41.241 --> 02:46:41.900
<v Speaker 4>I kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3764
02:46:41.901 --> 02:46:42.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see that.</v>

3765
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:45.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not what I believe lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can see that.</v>

3766
02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really believe anything when it </v>

3767
02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:50.520
<v Speaker 4>comes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes the Kennedy assassination,</v>

3768
02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:54.701
<v Speaker 4>other than some fuckery was a foot well </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the story when the conspiracy </v>

3769
02:46:55.161 --> 02:46:58.040
<v Speaker 4>theorists who write these books and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>an industry as you well know,</v>

3770
02:46:58.190 --> 02:47:03.190
<v Speaker 4>I get angry when they don't include </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that might disprove what they </v>

3771
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.230
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want me to believe you?</v>

3772
02:47:03.230 --> 02:47:05.310
<v Speaker 4>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to lay it all right,</v>

3773
02:47:05.810 --> 02:47:10.810
<v Speaker 4>and so I became suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once those books started coming forward </v>

3774
02:47:10.810 --> 02:47:10.810
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3775
02:47:10.810 --> 02:47:11.660
<v Speaker 4>look what they left out here and look </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they left out here.</v>

3776
02:47:11.661 --> 02:47:12.350
<v Speaker 4>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3777
02:47:12.351 --> 02:47:14.360
<v Speaker 4>well now you never told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3778
02:47:14.361 --> 02:47:18.120
<v Speaker 4>there's some tightly grooved paths when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to discussing that scarcity.</v>

3779
02:47:18.170 --> 02:47:23.170
<v Speaker 4>That's why I've always found it so weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one mentions or very rarely is </v>

3780
02:47:23.170 --> 02:47:24.290
<v Speaker 4>it mentioned that Oswald might've been a</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it.</v>

3781
02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:29.590
<v Speaker 4>The idea that he got off those three </v>
<v Speaker 4>shots because they determined that it </v>

3782
02:47:29.590 --> 02:47:31.190
<v Speaker 4>was three shots based on people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>reporting and you know,</v>

3783
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:36.550
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you believe that he got off those </v>

3784
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.650
<v Speaker 4>three shots in a shorter amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you see Jesse Ventura trying to</v>

3785
02:47:36.651 --> 02:47:39.560
<v Speaker 4>recreate it and say it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one dropped all.</v>

3786
02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone can do that.</v>

3787
02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:42.190
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there,</v>

3788
02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:47.200
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting off three shots in six seconds </v>

3789
02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:47.200
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3790
02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:51.440
<v Speaker 4>and if I recall Oswald was a marksman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3791
02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:55.340
<v Speaker 4>it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably was okay with a rifle.</v>

3792
02:47:55.430 --> 02:47:57.560
<v Speaker 4>But if you're leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the reality,</v>

3793
02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:02.680
<v Speaker 4>you're leaning on a window sill and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a scope with the bolt action.</v>

3794
02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:08.410
<v Speaker 4>Ancient rifleman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you really wanted to kill the </v>

3795
02:48:08.410 --> 02:48:08.570
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mail order man,</v>

3796
02:48:08.571 --> 02:48:13.571
<v Speaker 4>liquor carcanos rifle is not what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would achieve that shooting that far of </v>

3797
02:48:13.571 --> 02:48:13.571
<v Speaker 4>a shot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3798
02:48:13.571 --> 02:48:13.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3799
02:48:13.851 --> 02:48:14.840
<v Speaker 4>how many yards was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3800
02:48:14.850 --> 02:48:17.460
<v Speaker 4>and plus after the first one you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>spray Kinda,</v>

3801
02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:19.160
<v Speaker 4>you just pull the trigger a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

3802
02:48:19.161 --> 02:48:22.100
<v Speaker 4>But if someone else was involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where it gets even weirder.</v>

3803
02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Like he shooting down someone shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the front.</v>

3804
02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:28.070
<v Speaker 4>That seems like what they would do if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to kill somebody.</v>

3805
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:30.080
<v Speaker 4>If it's a conspiracy theory </v>
<v Speaker 4>triangulation,</v>

3806
02:48:30.470 --> 02:48:34.520
<v Speaker 4>although let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that becomes a lot harder to hide later.</v>

3807
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:36.410
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're worried about exposure,</v>

3808
02:48:36.411 --> 02:48:40.940
<v Speaker 4>because exposure would would show the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tentacles and well then you want to make</v>

3809
02:48:40.941 --> 02:48:43.040
<v Speaker 4>it as cut and dried and simple as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

3810
02:48:43.041 --> 02:48:47.540
<v Speaker 4>You start triangulating on a president </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know you don't know as you well</v>

3811
02:48:47.541 --> 02:48:49.850
<v Speaker 4>know what those bullets are going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3812
02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:53.000
<v Speaker 4>I think you open yourself up to massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

3813
02:48:53.001 --> 02:48:56.000
<v Speaker 4>If those bullets go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if in other words,</v>

3814
02:48:56.270 --> 02:49:01.270
<v Speaker 4>if something had gone another way and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have been impossible to deny that </v>

3815
02:49:01.270 --> 02:49:04.841
<v Speaker 4>there was another shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does that change the whole </v>

3816
02:49:04.841 --> 02:49:07.121
<v Speaker 4>investigation but actually did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was part of the investigation </v>

3817
02:49:07.121 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 4>itself leading to the magic bullet</v>

3818
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:12.550
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The magic bullet theory was was the well</v>

3819
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.040
<v Speaker 3>was created because a guy was walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>under the underpass and the Kerbstone </v>

3820
02:49:18.810 --> 02:49:21.540
<v Speaker 3>got hit by a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was hitting her head with a ricochet.</v>

3821
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:24.390
<v Speaker 3>So because he was hit with a ricochet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found the spot with a bullet.</v>

3822
02:49:24.391 --> 02:49:26.940
<v Speaker 3>It hit and they had accounted for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>

3823
02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:29.250
<v Speaker 3>So then they had the head shot that </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed Kennedy,</v>

3824
02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:32.820
<v Speaker 3>and then they had this neck thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they had this other bullet.</v>

3825
02:49:32.970 --> 02:49:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And then they started like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out,</v>

3826
02:49:35.251 --> 02:49:39.600
<v Speaker 3>well how many bullets are involved here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how does colony connolly rather have</v>

3827
02:49:39.601 --> 02:49:41.760
<v Speaker 3>a bullet lodged in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his leg,</v>

3828
02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:43.740
<v Speaker 3>like how does this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or how did he get shot?</v>

3829
02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 3>And a bullet that shattered his bone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>went through his leg also went through </v>

3830
02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what we're saying?</v>

3831
02:49:48.930 --> 02:49:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Like what are we saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had to come up with that one </v>

3832
02:49:53.930 --> 02:49:57.591
<v Speaker 3>bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing all that damage specifically </v>

3833
02:49:57.591 --> 02:49:57.591
<v Speaker 3>because somebody got hit with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>spray.</v>

3834
02:49:57.870 --> 02:50:00.020
<v Speaker 3>That's mean that that did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was okay.</v>

3835
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Part of the investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a part c and this is the part </v>

3836
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:05.070
<v Speaker 2>where it's kind of hard if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3837
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:06.880
<v Speaker 2>if you want there to be anything cut and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dried.</v>

3838
02:50:07.570 --> 02:50:12.570
<v Speaker 2>If you're the Warren Commission report </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing this not that long </v>

3839
02:50:12.570 --> 02:50:15.481
<v Speaker 2>after Kennedy's assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to allow for the idea </v>

3840
02:50:15.481 --> 02:50:16.450
<v Speaker 2>that there are going to be unknowables </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3841
02:50:16.451 --> 02:50:20.560
<v Speaker 2>And especially ballistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ballistics or crazy write bullets,</v>

3842
02:50:20.561 --> 02:50:24.070
<v Speaker 2>tumble bullets and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fire 900 bullets.</v>

3843
02:50:24.071 --> 02:50:26.350
<v Speaker 2>It's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are going to be deformed,</v>

3844
02:50:26.351 --> 02:50:31.351
<v Speaker 2>but some of them might not be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're never going to look like </v>

3845
02:50:31.351 --> 02:50:32.320
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pristine bullet is bullshit.</v>

3846
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:36.220
<v Speaker 3>That's the most bullshit aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire investigations.</v>

3847
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:38.510
<v Speaker 3>That's silly bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that a t shirt,</v>

3848
02:50:38.540 --> 02:50:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy assassination or how it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have had to travel through</v>

3849
02:50:42.510 --> 02:50:45.630
<v Speaker 2>body to surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullets can do that.</v>

3850
02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Can hit bones and you'd ricochet and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>tumble</v>

3851
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:53.230
<v Speaker 3>and this is not totally accurate to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This gets exaggerated like the entry </v>

3852
02:50:53.230 --> 02:50:57.170
<v Speaker 3>point and the exit point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is when bullets hit bone,</v>

3853
02:50:57.550 --> 02:51:02.330
<v Speaker 3>they bend and they changed shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When bullets don't hit bone,</v>

3854
02:51:02.331 --> 02:51:07.331
<v Speaker 3>when you shoot bullets into ballistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>gel or when you shoot them into water </v>

3855
02:51:07.331 --> 02:51:08.640
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't form that bullet.</v>

3856
02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Looked like a bullet that was shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>through something soft.</v>

3857
02:51:11.001 --> 02:51:16.001
<v Speaker 3>Look at it there so it doesn't look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a bullet looks like when it hits </v>

3858
02:51:16.001 --> 02:51:20.120
<v Speaker 3>bone and that that hit bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shattered connolly's wrist,</v>

3859
02:51:20.121 --> 02:51:25.121
<v Speaker 3>that same bullet and they apparently </v>
<v Speaker 3>just found it on his Gurney in the </v>

3860
02:51:25.121 --> 02:51:29.531
<v Speaker 3>hospital and we're supposed to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a bullet that went through </v>

3861
02:51:29.531 --> 02:51:32.501
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy and connally and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never talked to a single actual </v>

3862
02:51:32.571 --> 02:51:37.571
<v Speaker 3>ballistics expert or firearms </v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasts that believes that.</v>

3863
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.650
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3864
02:51:38.651 --> 02:51:40.900
<v Speaker 2>this is where she had I known I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming here.</v>

3865
02:51:40.901 --> 02:51:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I would have brought both those books </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be.</v>

3866
02:51:42.341 --> 02:51:47.341
<v Speaker 2>Could've looked up how the POC and </v>
<v Speaker 2>posing or explain the magic bullet </v>

3867
02:51:47.341 --> 02:51:47.890
<v Speaker 2>because they the path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

3868
02:51:47.940 --> 02:51:52.940
<v Speaker 3>can be explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think bullets hit things that people </v>

3869
02:51:52.940 --> 02:51:56.310
<v Speaker 3>have had bullets ricochet around inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's skull and come out there.</v>

3870
02:51:56.311 --> 02:51:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you shoot them in the face of weird</v>

3871
02:51:59.101 --> 02:52:04.101
<v Speaker 3>things happen with bullets when they hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>bones and they ricochet and they move </v>

3872
02:52:04.101 --> 02:52:04.440
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the path of the bullet.</v>

3873
02:52:04.441 --> 02:52:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Seems crazy but possible.</v>

3874
02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:09.820
<v Speaker 1>What's weird is that they think that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullet.</v>

3875
02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:12.580
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they just said,</v>

3876
02:52:12.581 --> 02:52:14.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a bullet that we found and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3877
02:52:14.621 --> 02:52:19.621
<v Speaker 1>he had another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe something hit something </v>

3878
02:52:19.621 --> 02:52:19.621
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3879
02:52:19.621 --> 02:52:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but saying that that went really points </v>

3880
02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:23.220
<v Speaker 1>to the conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3881
02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:23.220
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

3882
02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:27.460
<v Speaker 1>it points to people being full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they conveniently founded </v>

3883
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:27.460
<v Speaker 1>on the Gurney way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3884
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

3885
02:52:28.530 --> 02:52:29.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3886
02:52:29.410 --> 02:52:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm saying is outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>razor.</v>

3887
02:52:31.390 --> 02:52:33.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have to convince me </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

3888
02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm also that the Warren Commission </v>
<v Speaker 1>report might've had all sorts of </v>

3889
02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:42.781
<v Speaker 1>domestic and foreign policy reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what it did and just imagine if </v>

3890
02:52:42.781 --> 02:52:45.370
<v Speaker 1>you're the CIA in 1962 and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3891
02:52:45.371 --> 02:52:50.371
<v Speaker 1>you're getting together with all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cronies and you've been responsible for </v>

3892
02:52:50.371 --> 02:52:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Jack and people all over the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got this guy and he's going to </v>

3893
02:52:53.610 --> 02:52:54.480
<v Speaker 1>disband your entire organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3894
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:57.490
<v Speaker 1>and then you're talking to some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are upset at them because of</v>

3895
02:52:57.491 --> 02:53:02.491
<v Speaker 1>the Bay of pigs and he talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other people that are upset about </v>

3896
02:53:02.491 --> 02:53:03.460
<v Speaker 1>them because of this and have that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that he's trying to</v>

3897
02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:05.020
<v Speaker 1>do that people don't agree with.</v>

3898
02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3899
02:53:05.951 --> 02:53:10.951
<v Speaker 1>there's a simple solution to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you bring in that Lee Harvey </v>

3900
02:53:10.951 --> 02:53:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Oswald character and you get that ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>

3901
02:53:12.011 --> 02:53:14.740
<v Speaker 1>You setup a bunch of different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really good at rifles.</v>

3902
02:53:16.330 --> 02:53:18.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally possible.</v>

3903
02:53:18.071 --> 02:53:18.950
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

3904
02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:19.300
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3905
02:53:19.350 --> 02:53:22.450
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible branch.</v>

3906
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:25.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't bank on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's also possible.</v>

3907
02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing that always bugged me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the router film.</v>

3908
02:53:29.050 --> 02:53:32.890
<v Speaker 1>When you watch his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head does go back into the left.</v>

3909
02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:37.920
<v Speaker 1>But the spray from the bullet in my eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like it's going forward.</v>

3910
02:53:39.610 --> 02:53:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he was hit from behind an exit </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound.</v>

3911
02:53:42.221 --> 02:53:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it seems like a little bit of it.</v>

3912
02:53:44.831 --> 02:53:49.831
<v Speaker 1>But then sometimes when you hit someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could hit things and just the </v>

3913
02:53:49.831 --> 02:53:51.730
<v Speaker 1>impact of the bullet causes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverberation.</v>

3914
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And also if you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of executions online.</v>

3915
02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And I'm ashamed to say I've seen some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them all.</v>

3916
02:53:59.910 --> 02:54:01.380
<v Speaker 1>If there's a new one tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3917
02:54:01.690 --> 02:54:02.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

3918
02:54:02.171 --> 02:54:06.010
<v Speaker 1>But the one thing you notice is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are probabilities.</v>

3919
02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:08.650
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason Kennedy's arms went up</v>

3920
02:54:08.651 --> 02:54:13.651
<v Speaker 1>like this when he was shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was because it hit a kind of a nerve </v>

3921
02:54:13.651 --> 02:54:13.651
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

3922
02:54:13.651 --> 02:54:15.280
<v Speaker 1>things happen when you start striking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerves and,</v>

3923
02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:18.010
<v Speaker 1>or unpredictable or it could have hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>him in the neck.</v>

3924
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:19.750
<v Speaker 1>What did hit him in the neck or behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder.</v>

3925
02:54:19.930 --> 02:54:22.050
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that caused the arms to Jasper.</v>

3926
02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Watch this real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the seat.</v>

3927
02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:25.880
<v Speaker 1>When you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3928
02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an exit wound to me.</v>

3929
02:54:28.390 --> 02:54:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It kind of sprays for he his bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head goes,</v>

3930
02:54:31.941 --> 02:54:36.941
<v Speaker 1>but nowhere to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that could easily have been because </v>

3931
02:54:36.941 --> 02:54:37.250
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3932
02:54:37.270 --> 02:54:40.780
<v Speaker 1>just the nerve reaction like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm saying is that it's,</v>

3933
02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:43.430
<v Speaker 1>although it does go back into the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg,</v>

3934
02:54:43.431 --> 02:54:44.230
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3935
02:54:44.231 --> 02:54:45.380
<v Speaker 1>but that's predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3936
02:54:45.390 --> 02:54:45.960
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3937
02:54:46.030 --> 02:54:51.030
<v Speaker 1>there's executions of a Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalists killing Chinese communist </v>

3938
02:54:51.070 --> 02:54:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and you watch them and they'll do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again.</v>

3939
02:54:53.741 --> 02:54:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time things go the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think they should.</v>

3940
02:54:56.381 --> 02:54:59.350
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bodies are weird.</v>

3941
02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:02.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a delay when it goes back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

3942
02:55:02.830 --> 02:55:04.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a delay that almost</v>

3943
02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:06.840
<v Speaker 4>seems to indicate that maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3944
02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:12.630
<v Speaker 4>a nerve reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see that the arm is going up </v>

3945
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:13.250
<v Speaker 4>because the bullet goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but watch the bullet hits,</v>

3946
02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:14.390
<v Speaker 4>can't believe or watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

3947
02:55:14.420 --> 02:55:18.560
<v Speaker 4>the bullet hits and then there's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>back into the left.</v>

3948
02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:21.430
<v Speaker 4>That could be from the impact of the gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>

3949
02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:25.460
<v Speaker 4>Remember the car is also moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is making you,</v>

3950
02:55:25.490 --> 02:55:26.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3951
02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:27.680
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell.</v>

3952
02:55:27.681 --> 02:55:29.930
<v Speaker 4>And then here's another thing to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>into consideration.</v>

3953
02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:33.380
<v Speaker 4>It's entirely possible that he was hit </v>
<v Speaker 4>with two bullets in the head at the same</v>

3954
02:55:33.381 --> 02:55:35.360
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a possibility.</v>

3955
02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:40.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to deny it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm also going to say the reason </v>

3956
02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:40.400
<v Speaker 4>that it would be interesting to know the</v>
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>

3957
02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:44.681
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody could come down from the </v>

3958
02:55:44.681 --> 02:55:44.681
<v Speaker 4>extra terrestrials to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3959
02:55:44.681 --> 02:55:47.621
<v Speaker 4>this is what really is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it would tell you a lot about </v>

3960
02:55:47.621 --> 02:55:47.621
<v Speaker 4>subsequent history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3961
02:55:47.621 --> 02:55:48.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that sense,</v>

3962
02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:53.560
<v Speaker 4>the problem with it though is if you buy</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the conspiracy theory as it's </v>

3963
02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.581
<v Speaker 4>normally told,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that basically takes you down this </v>

3964
02:55:57.581 --> 02:55:57.581
<v Speaker 4>road that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3965
02:55:57.581 --> 02:56:01.871
<v Speaker 4>there was a coo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president was killed by the </v>

3966
02:56:01.871 --> 02:56:04.511
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that all subsequent history </v>

3967
02:56:04.511 --> 02:56:04.820
<v Speaker 4>from that point on then takes a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3968
02:56:04.821 --> 02:56:05.170
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3969
02:56:05.210 --> 02:56:07.580
<v Speaker 4>they say with time travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you change something and you go off on a</v>

3970
02:56:07.581 --> 02:56:12.581
<v Speaker 4>totally different course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All history goes on a totally different </v>

3971
02:56:12.581 --> 02:56:12.800
<v Speaker 4>course if that's what really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

3972
02:56:12.801 --> 02:56:14.930
<v Speaker 4>everything must be looked through a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different lens.</v>

3973
02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:19.400
<v Speaker 4>If I was to believe as I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that was done by the government,</v>

3974
02:56:19.401 --> 02:56:21.530
<v Speaker 4>then my whole common sense show would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different.</v>

3975
02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:26.560
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't mean don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to look at everything from a </v>

3976
02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:26.900
<v Speaker 4>different lens when you find something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like operation northwoods,</v>

3977
02:56:26.930 --> 02:56:31.930
<v Speaker 4>when you find the northwoods documents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that it's signed by the Joint </v>

3978
02:56:31.930 --> 02:56:32.180
<v Speaker 4>Chiefs of staff that this was a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>plan.</v>

3979
02:56:32.180 --> 02:56:35.360
<v Speaker 4>They were thinking about implementing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Kennedy put the boycott on it.</v>

3980
02:56:35.450 --> 02:56:37.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they did,</v>

3981
02:56:37.431 --> 02:56:42.431
<v Speaker 4>some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean operation northwoods is not that </v>

3982
02:56:42.431 --> 02:56:43.100
<v Speaker 4>far from things they did in other </v>
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>

3983
02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:45.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3984
02:56:45.450 --> 02:56:47.060
<v Speaker 4>and wasn't Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

3985
02:56:47.061 --> 02:56:49.610
<v Speaker 4>but we're trying to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that with Iran.</v>

3986
02:56:49.820 --> 02:56:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't there a similar thing that was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the table for a false flag to try to get</v>

3987
02:56:54.261 --> 02:56:56.840
<v Speaker 4>us into Iran before the end of the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration?</v>

3988
02:56:57.130 --> 02:56:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Was there something that was being </v>
<v Speaker 4>reported?</v>

3989
02:56:58.930 --> 02:57:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that was on infowars.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember that.</v>

3990
02:57:01.270 --> 02:57:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Can you find that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find that.</v>

3991
02:57:03.450 --> 02:57:07.820
<v Speaker 4>But false flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ran a Rumsfeld or Cheney,</v>

3992
02:57:07.940 --> 02:57:12.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem that all those people have </v>

3993
02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:15.371
<v Speaker 4>is if they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always try to give people the benefit </v>

3994
02:57:15.371 --> 02:57:17.771
<v Speaker 4>of the doubt and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you came to me with secret </v>

3995
02:57:17.771 --> 02:57:17.771
<v Speaker 4>information and says blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3996
02:57:17.771 --> 02:57:18.530
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the country needs to do this now and you</v>

3997
02:57:18.531 --> 02:57:23.531
<v Speaker 4>say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could never get the American </v>

3998
02:57:23.531 --> 02:57:23.531
<v Speaker 4>people to go along with that.</v>

3999
02:57:23.531 --> 02:57:25.820
<v Speaker 4>So if they knew what I knew they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they won't.</v>

4000
02:57:25.821 --> 02:57:27.590
<v Speaker 4>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>

4001
02:57:27.700 --> 02:57:28.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

4002
02:57:28.020 --> 02:57:33.020
<v Speaker 4>you start to try to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of just automatically going to </v>

4003
02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:33.020
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4004
02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:33.020
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4005
02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:37.660
<v Speaker 4>could there be a logical reason that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would accept and understand that would </v>

4006
02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:41.510
<v Speaker 4>explain the same sequence of events?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I always try to do that.</v>

4007
02:57:41.511 --> 02:57:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say that as somebody who clearly knows</v>

4008
02:57:44.361 --> 02:57:49.361
<v Speaker 4>the CIA's record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's been one of my interests </v>

4009
02:57:49.361 --> 02:57:49.361
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stuff that they do,</v>

4010
02:57:49.361 --> 02:57:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of any natural limitations</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

4011
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of anything with the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have said no,</v>

4012
02:57:54.831 --> 02:57:56.990
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do that if the president </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted us to.</v>

4013
02:57:57.860 --> 02:57:59.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't think many people know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

4014
02:57:59.931 --> 02:58:03.240
<v Speaker 4>in the Nixon administration there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about killing Jack Anderson,</v>

4015
02:58:03.241 --> 02:58:08.241
<v Speaker 4>the investigative reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was g dot Gordon Liddy who had </v>

4016
02:58:08.251 --> 02:58:10.230
<v Speaker 4>offered to run him down with a car.</v>

4017
02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:15.620
<v Speaker 4>So when you talk about that and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are people around the president who are </v>

4018
02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:18.000
<v Speaker 4>willing to consider the option will then</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to say,</v>

4019
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan,</v>

4020
02:58:18.781 --> 02:58:23.781
<v Speaker 4>you have to open up your mind to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility that these things can </v>

4021
02:58:23.781 --> 02:58:23.781
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as I said,</v>

4022
02:58:23.781 --> 02:58:25.920
<v Speaker 4>my opinion for years was that it did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm so,</v>

4023
02:58:25.921 --> 02:58:30.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm not not open to the idea to propose </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

4024
02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:35.780
<v Speaker 4>to provoke war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheney considered proposal to dress up </v>

4025
02:58:35.780 --> 02:58:38.331
<v Speaker 4>navy seals as Iranians and shooted them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real source of this.</v>

4026
02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:43.590
<v Speaker 4>Got To be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it after he knows how to Seymour</v>

4027
02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Hersh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4028
02:58:44.071 --> 02:58:49.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seymour's getting a Pulitzer prize </v>

4029
02:58:49.071 --> 02:58:49.071
<v Speaker 4>winning journalist for the New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York Seymour.</v>

4030
02:58:49.071 --> 02:58:50.820
<v Speaker 4>Seymour Hersh is the one who broke </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>

4031
02:58:50.821 --> 02:58:53.580
<v Speaker 4>I think he broke me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eli massacre and things like that.</v>

4032
02:58:54.550 --> 02:58:59.550
<v Speaker 4>As I said earlier though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheney is really a nefarious character </v>

4033
02:58:59.550 --> 02:58:59.680
<v Speaker 4>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4034
02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:02.470
<v Speaker 4>if you weigh him next to the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4035
02:59:02.500 --> 02:59:04.320
<v Speaker 4>the idea of fair play and the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

4036
02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:09.620
<v Speaker 4>He didn't believe any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a doggy dog world and whatever you </v>

4037
02:59:09.620 --> 02:59:13.520
<v Speaker 4>and I considered an American values is </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketing and you reacted to.</v>

4038
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:14.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4039
02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:17.670
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's real politic as they can.</v>

4040
02:59:17.940 --> 02:59:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a weird character because he's</v>

4041
02:59:20.880 --> 02:59:25.880
<v Speaker 4>almost biblical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when he had that heart implant and </v>

4042
02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:28.440
<v Speaker 4>his body wasn't giving off a pulse </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore and the heart was just,</v>

4043
02:59:28.470 --> 02:59:30.900
<v Speaker 4>this artificial heart was just circling </v>
<v Speaker 4>the blood,</v>

4044
02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:32.850
<v Speaker 4>like he literally was alive without a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulse.</v>

4045
02:59:32.880 --> 02:59:35.390
<v Speaker 4>How do you listen to the Bible anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The WHO listens to him.</v>

4046
02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:37.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean Fox News people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ugh.</v>

4047
02:59:37.710 --> 02:59:38.410
<v Speaker 4>What is weird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4048
02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:41.430
<v Speaker 4>While he wants to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why wouldn't you want to fade back?</v>

4049
02:59:41.431 --> 02:59:46.431
<v Speaker 4>He still wants to influence the process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you talking about the guy with the </v>

4050
02:59:46.431 --> 02:59:46.431
<v Speaker 4>Rolodex?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4051
02:59:46.431 --> 02:59:48.810
<v Speaker 4>He must clearly enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shots and people in his Rolodex.</v>

4052
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:51.840
<v Speaker 4>I bet bird seed wasn't incidentally </v>
<v Speaker 4>shuttered.</v>

4053
02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:53.850
<v Speaker 4>Shot face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do a joke about it.</v>

4054
02:59:53.851 --> 02:59:58.851
<v Speaker 4>That's how you know you were gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shoot your friend in the face and </v>

4055
02:59:58.851 --> 02:59:58.851
<v Speaker 4>your friend apologizes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

4056
02:59:58.851 --> 02:59:59.340
<v Speaker 4>That guy got on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4057
02:59:59.341 --> 03:00:01.440
<v Speaker 4>I looked like a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sorry.</v>

4058
03:00:01.800 --> 03:00:03.960
<v Speaker 4>I was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was totally sober.</v>

4059
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:06.240
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

4060
03:00:06.250 --> 03:00:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just did three fucking hours.</v>

4061
