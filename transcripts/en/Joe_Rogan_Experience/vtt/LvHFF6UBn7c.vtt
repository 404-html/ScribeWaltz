<v Speaker 1>I heard those stomping and like this.</v>

121
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:53.621
<v Speaker 1>There's no arguing,</v>

122
00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>but she just puts her hands up.</v>

123
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Got To pick her up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>got to put youtube on.</v>

125
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I got to sit there with a one,</v>

126
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.201
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

127
00:02:59.201 --> 00:02:59.591
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

128
00:02:59.591 --> 00:02:59.891
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

129
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.260
<v Speaker 1>five you know,</v>

130
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>and then she again,</v>

131
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:02.501
<v Speaker 1>Daddy.</v>

132
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

133
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>well the the problem people asking you to do things too is that you kind of do</v>

134
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>this shit for yourself.</v>

135
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

136
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.051
<v Speaker 1>The way to do it is not to go through other people and ask people to pick you up</v>

137
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.954
<v Speaker 1>and help you.</v>

138
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>

139
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

140
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.051
<v Speaker 1>And pay.</v>

141
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks they're gonna figure out some fucking choke shortcut cause they</v>

142
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>know you or they know this guy or that guy this.</v>

143
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no shortcuts in creating something.</v>

144
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Just figure it out.</v>

145
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

146
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I love stand up because there's one part of me,</v>

147
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't need anybody on these.</v>

148
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>A notebook right here.</v>

149
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.760
<v Speaker 1>This is my tools for stand up at a person will go,</v>

150
00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:41.900

<v Speaker 1>You know me,</v>

152
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

153
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

154
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>we talked about having a band that somebody came on hand and said that it was</v>

155
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>the toughest thing in the world for a band to stay together.</v>

156
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>You got four people personalities.</v>

157
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>You know you get these people that come to you now and I was breaking it down</v>

158
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>from another planet.</v>

159
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.011
<v Speaker 1>They don't say,</v>

160
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:57.461
<v Speaker 1>hey Joe,</v>

161

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.100

00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get $8 million and then you go,</v>

167
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:02.801
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

168
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 1>when you get it,</v>

169
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>

170
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the script.</v>

171
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Something you're interested in,</v>

172
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

173
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.233
<v Speaker 1>three days,</v>

174
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you do get a call on the yield and they say,</v>

175
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

176
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>we're making a movie,</v>

177
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

178
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get $2 million.</v>

179
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>We've got $200,000 so instead of you getting 10,000 a week,</v>

180
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a hundred a day and that's going to be a hit.</v>

181
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make it happen.</v>

182
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Nine out of 10 they run out of money for marketing and editing and the whole</v>

183
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.031
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

184
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>So your movie ends up in Youtube.</v>

185
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a legit schedule.</v>

186
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So you have to work Saturdays and fucking Sundays.</v>

187
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>You know those people that are involved in those low rent movies,</v>

188
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>they're a fucking nightmare and it's their dream.</v>

189
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:37.601
<v Speaker 1>And I get,</v>

190
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:38.434
<v Speaker 1>it's your dream,</v>

191
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but don't include me in this fucking thing because you want me to do everything</v>

192
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>cheap on my end,</v>

193
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>all the hours.</v>

194
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's your fucking dream.</v>

195
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>If it's that much of your dream,</v>

196
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>and do me a favor,</v>

197
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>forget the 200 gs.</v>

198
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>We got another 300 gs and make this fucking work.</v>

199
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:53.711
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

201
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>you can find other actors out there that will do it for cheap.</v>

202
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are out there that just want to act sort of like a comic</v>

203
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>would go to an open mic night.</v>

204
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>There's certain actors that just want to do something to put it on a real go</v>

205
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.001
<v Speaker 1>find them.</v>

206
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talented people out there that are not working as far as acting</v>

207
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

208
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fucking people that can do it.</v>

209
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of times people,</v>

210
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.513
<v Speaker 1>it's just the,</v>

211
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I just have a problem with people like asking you to help them do it.</v>

212
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it from comics all the time too.</v>

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Just looking for a break.</v>

214
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.740
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about and you're saying you're not,</v>

215
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get a break from another comic.</v>

216
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>The way you get breaks is by going on stage and being funny.</v>

217
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Like go to an open mic night.</v>

231
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.570

232
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Like a comic coming along.</v>

233
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make you funnier.</v>

234
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the people that do that,</v>

235
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>they always have a distorted perception of how good they are already.</v>

00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm a funny comic.</v>

295
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's going to say,</v>

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>are you going up tonight because we all want to watch it.</v>

297
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I love to laugh.</v>

298
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.971
<v Speaker 1>You're funny.</v>

299
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:15.804
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

300
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.401
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

301
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here hanging out.</v>

302
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>You hate that fucking funny.</v>

303
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>If he's not on the list,</v>

304
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you ain't that fucking fun or they don't know about you yet.</v>

305
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a possibility that there's certain people that go to the Improv,</v>

306
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.501
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

307
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:28.071
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell you,</v>

308
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:28.341
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>

309
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:29.091
<v Speaker 1>you've got a network.</v>

310
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:29.661
<v Speaker 1>What network?</v>

311
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Your network on stage.</v>

312
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have work on stage when they laughed when I walk off.</v>

313
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.693
<v Speaker 1>That's networking.</v>

314
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.661
<v Speaker 1>Not only dad.</v>

315
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>When you're a comic,</v>

316
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of like a fruit or a vegetable.</v>

317
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:39.581
<v Speaker 1>In that year,</v>

318
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you're growing and then you get to one day you going to be ripe and when you're</v>

319
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:42.831
<v Speaker 1>going to be ripe,</v>

320
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>everyone's gonna know about it and people find out about you.</v>

321
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>If people found out about everybody,</v>

322
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>they found out about you,</v>

323
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>they found out about Hinchcliffe.</v>

324
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>They find out about everybody.</v>

325
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You hear about Dunkin.</v>

326
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't happen to know what's happening in China right now.</v>

327
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.853
<v Speaker 1>What's happening in China?</v>

328
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I was packing them in.</v>

329
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

330
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.561
<v Speaker 1>Every night.</v>

331
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:57.951
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

332
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe there's white people in UFC fans</v>

333
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 1>coming from money out.</v>

334
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:04.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

335
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>They're not big rooms.</v>

336
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>There were 120 seat,</v>

337
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:07.921
<v Speaker 1>a hundred seat.</v>

338
00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>This is like coffee shops,</v>

339
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.883
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

340
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>But where on the Internet,</v>

341
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>this shit is worldwide.</v>

342
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.233
<v Speaker 1>It's worldwide.</v>

343
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>He can't believe it.</v>

344
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>That there's fucking people walking around here going,</v>

345
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>we came to see you from Macau.</v>

346
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it took people so long to figure it out.</v>

347
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Or he's a fucking genius.</v>

348
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a great comic.</v>

349
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:23.391
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

350
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

351
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing that people have misled.</v>

352
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.900
<v Speaker 1>They think there's shortcuts.</v>

353
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>When we got here,</v>

354
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>what was the shortcut?</v>

355
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>If you get on the tonight show,</v>

356
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.713
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

357
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

358
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>How many people have gone to the tonight show and not great success?</v>

359
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.041
<v Speaker 1>No one cares.</v>

360
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:38.500
<v Speaker 1>A lot of pee all now it doesn't.</v>

361
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

362
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but back in the day it meant something big.</v>

363
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

364
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Steven Wright days,</v>

365
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.510

00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>a technical get up in Jujitsu.</v>

369
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I could finally do it after a year of practicing and hotel rooms.</v>

370
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Five a day I would do on my right side of the family.</v>

371
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

372
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:54.560

373
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:54.960

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.521
<v Speaker 1>You do know him.</v>

375
00:08:55.521 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Retarded half where people know that I'm a little stupid.</v>

377
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

378
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being bad at something.</v>

379
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And since we got the comedy work ethic,</v>

380
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I know that you could turn it anything his wife into something if you just keep</v>

396
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.190

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but at least I know this going in because because of the lesson I got from</v>

435
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>comedy that it don't matter though.</v>

436
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.463
<v Speaker 1>Just keep showing up.</v>

437
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

438
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but nobody last him dog.</v>

439
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.123
<v Speaker 1>Keep showing him.</v>

440
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Some people you tell them stay home.</v>

441
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Some people just don't want man.</v>

442
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 1>For some people it's like me.</v>

443
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.420
<v Speaker 1>When we did comedy,</v>

444
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 1>there was eight people who had a chance.</v>

445
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>That was another six who were funny,</v>

446
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>but they had day jobs because they were married or had children.</v>

447
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Then you had two people did it as a hobby that every once in a great while they</v>

448
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 1>drove to a Gig and then you got three people that just had mental health issues.</v>

449
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

451
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>He's always showed up every week and they were nice enough,</v>

452
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 1>but you knew there was something wrong there and for them it was the way this is</v>

453
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:21.661
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

454
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.494
<v Speaker 1>what Jujitsu,</v>

455
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for them.</v>

456
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 1>They're not looking to be on NBC.</v>

457
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>All they want to do is one time in their life.</v>

458
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Make somebody laugh.</v>

459
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.230
<v Speaker 1>How special is that?</v>

460
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

461
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go down there and you miss those guys.</v>

462
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I miss those guys from my scenes and see how even here and that way there's</v>

463
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 1>people that you see them and they were a pleasure to talk to because they don't</v>

464
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.754
<v Speaker 1>want an agent.</v>

465
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be on movies that just having fun.</v>

466
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.620
<v Speaker 1>They work at universal city in the daytime as the hope,</v>

467
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

468
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.310
<v Speaker 1>It's very few of those that I respect that man are,</v>

469
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:55.841
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

470
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>there's very few of those.</v>

471
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Most of those guys have dreams that just never manifested themselves,</v>

472
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them never material.</v>

473
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I met a lot of guys that bro,</v>

474
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 1>they were proud of their job.</v>

475
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>They just start somewhere and their life,</v>

476
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I take a be a standup and they just didn't want to die without trying it.</v>

477
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

478
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.760
<v Speaker 1>And then they did it and it become addicted.</v>

479
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 1>How many people go to Jujitsu?</v>

480
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:16.590
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a daily standup.</v>

481
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Definitely becomes addictive.</v>

482
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.793
<v Speaker 1>It becomes,</v>

483
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.030
<v Speaker 1>it becomes addicting and it's like addicts where you see those guys are</v>

484
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:22.841
<v Speaker 1>scrambling outside.</v>

485
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>The can't wait to get on stage and like even guys who are bad,</v>

488
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers at 20 minutes.</v>

496
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

497
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.560
<v Speaker 1>You know how it works.</v>

498
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.513
<v Speaker 1>This is what you do.</v>

499
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>You're on a non paid,</v>

500
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.590

<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

503
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 1>If there's anybody fucking crazy is that people should know this.</v>

504
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:53.224
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

505
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you were on a TV show and you will not pay regular,</v>

506
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 1>which by law if you on a TV show,</v>

507
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to go in there and bump bitches.</v>

508
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.871
<v Speaker 1>Give him the bell.</v>

509
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

510
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

511
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:03.071
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

512
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I showed up every night,</v>

513
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.450
<v Speaker 1>every night I was there every night.</v>

514
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Biggest lesson I learned about this whole thing from you.</v>

515
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It was newsradio on Fridays.</v>

516
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 1>You got there at 11 in the morning,</v>

517
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:12.154
<v Speaker 1>wardrobe,</v>

518
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>stupidity,</v>

519
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.133
<v Speaker 1>laughter,</v>

520
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.801
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

521
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 1>and then at eight o'clock you shoot,</v>

522
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd be strolling in there with fucking 1130 bro.</v>

523
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I respect you for that.</v>

524
00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>So this day that meant more to me and you didn't need it.</v>

525
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's $15 it's not like you had 19 kids.</v>

526
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 1>He needed the 15 fucking dollars.</v>

527
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you the truth being passed as a paid regular,</v>

528
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>the comic store meant more to me.</v>

529
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Getting on a TV show up.</v>

530
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

531
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>When I was on a TV show,</v>

532
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>when I was on news radio,</v>

533
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I love about you coming to visit me,</v>

537
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't belong here because I was,</v>

538
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.360
