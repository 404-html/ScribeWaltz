00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches for,</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:03.961
<v Speaker 1>but even if we did,</v>

3
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>it's worth repeating.</v>

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I talked about an article,</v>

5
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>an article that was done by some colleagues of mine,</v>

6
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:09.601
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them well,</v>

7
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:09.951
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>

8
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>some academics where they looked at the,</v>

9
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>political affiliation of professors at top,</v>

11
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it was California in schools,</v>

12
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>whether they identified it or whether they actually had democratic affiliation</v>

13
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.514
<v Speaker 1>or Republican.</v>

14
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And as you might imagine,</v>

15
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>it was extraordinarily skewed towards Democrats,</v>

16
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but then depending on the field of study,</v>

17
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.311
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

18
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>in sociology and in the humanities and in women's studies,</v>

19
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:36.721
<v Speaker 1>women with a y,</v>

20
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

21
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>please don't write women with an e.</v>

22
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>That would be sexist at even,</v>

23
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

24
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>the women's oftentimes and women's studies,</v>

25
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.194
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

26
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>they think that to have men as part of the word women is itself a form of</v>

27
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:51.631
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

28
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>So they've altered the spelling to with men.</v>

29
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

30
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>

31
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.161
<v Speaker 1>So you see,</v>

32
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:01.161
<v Speaker 1>I know your audience already has the price of admission covered with that story,</v>

33
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's still the word women,</v>

34
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:04.591
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

36
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>so the same word,</v>

37
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to change the letters?</v>

38
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>So in sociology,</v>

39
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.433
<v Speaker 1>do you train,</v>

40
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>change the word trigger because it sounds like the n word or a right,</v>

41
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you're getting triggered.</v>

42
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm triggered,</v>

43
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:19.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm triggered.</v>

44
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking triggered.</v>

46
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.291
<v Speaker 1>If I was black,</v>

47
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I'd be super triggered,</v>

48
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you notice some of my tweets now,</v>

49
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>whenever I tweet anything,</v>

50
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I put a trigger warning trigger warning.</v>

51
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not become part of the vernacular to make it sit there vertical.</v>

52
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>It's too close to the n word.</v>

53
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Way Too close.</v>

54
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.303
<v Speaker 1>I am triggered.</v>

55
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.233
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

56
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>to to finish the point about that study 44 to one,</v>

57
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>the ratio in sociology.</v>

58
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if you are a student doing an Undergrad in sociology,</v>

59
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very good thing to have.</v>

61
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of the professors that you will ever come across be of one particular</v>

62
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.444
<v Speaker 1>persuasion.</v>

63
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.691
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

64
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>some people would write to me and say,</v>

65
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.903
<v Speaker 1>but what do you mean?</v>

66
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>The Democrats have everything,</v>

67
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:58.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>They have truth on their side and the Republicans are a bunch of hacks.</v>

69
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Now when it comes to evolution evolution,</v>

70
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

71
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

73
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

74
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>if on average republicans are more likely to deny evolution than that point is</v>

75
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:10.554
<v Speaker 1>well taken,</v>

76
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to issues,</v>

77
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>is the death penalty,</v>

78
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.643
<v Speaker 1>right or wrong?</v>

79
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>What's kind of fiscal policy should you have?</v>

80
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>What type of foreign policy should you have?</v>

81
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>This is not a one plus one scientific equation,</v>

82
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>so you should be exposed to multiple viewpoints,</v>

83
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>but of course you shouldn't be because you should only interact with people who</v>

84
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 1>are similar to you will that,</v>

85
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>that is a problem with a lot of people that go to college,</v>

86
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.021
<v Speaker 1>graduate,</v>

87
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>get their phd,</v>

88
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>get their doctorate,</v>

89
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and then start teaching and never enter the real world,</v>

90
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 1>They stay in this sort of insulated world of academia and then they espouse</v>

92
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>these same ideas.</v>

93
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>They promote these same idea.</v>

94
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>They promote the same way of thinking as if this is the real world because this</v>

95
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>is the only world they know.</v>

96
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

97
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So my friend,</v>

98
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.461
<v Speaker 1>luther reigns,</v>

100
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.294
<v Speaker 1>he ended up,</v>

101
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.390
<v Speaker 1>he had a massive stroke and now he's actually for somehow.</v>

102
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

103
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>when you have withdrawals from painkillers,</v>

104
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>it feels like you're going to die.</v>

105
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And so when he had the stroke,</v>

106
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.161
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

107
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>get his mother here,</v>

108
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>he's not gonna make it through this.</v>

109
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And we can pump them full on full of enough drugs for him to get through this.</v>

110
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna.</v>

111
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>He's probably not going to make it.</v>

112
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Somehow miraculously the part of the,</v>

113
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.684
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>the brain that is like 30 percent of his brain got killed during the stroke.</v>

115
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Part of the brain that got killed was the part that was responsible for feeling</v>

116
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:32.974
<v Speaker 1>withdrawals.</v>

117
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>So somehow he fucking dodged a bullet.</v>

118
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.670
<v Speaker 1>We called the bulletproof bad boy.</v>

119
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm somehow he bullet,</v>

120
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.893
<v Speaker 1>he's alive.</v>

121
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>He has no more hangovers.</v>

122
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>He's completely sober and he goes around and talks to kids and churches and</v>

123
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.111
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

124
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing great work.</v>

125
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>So he lost 30 percent of his brain.</v>

126
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>But somehow he's still a cognitive.</v>

128
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.011
<v Speaker 1>He's still,</v>

129
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:55.054
<v Speaker 1>he's still there.</v>

131
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>He's jacked.</v>

132
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.123
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

134
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>So he's on steroids.</v>

135
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

136
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.950
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking Christ.</v>

137
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Might be to be on something.</v>

138
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>So he's off the pain pills on steroids and helping out kids.</v>

140
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.034
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

142
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck out of a world we live in.</v>

143
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I love that one day we were eating with them,</v>

144
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.840
<v Speaker 1>that we're grabbing a burger or something and he's,</v>

146
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>he's got this fanny pack on.</v>

147
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He's like pulling stuff out.</v>

148
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to find his money,</v>

149
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.401

00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:21.491

<v Speaker 1>And he's like moving in slow motion.</v>

154
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking drooling.</v>

155
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:26.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

156
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>this guy's amazing.</v>

157
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>What is going on with this guy?</v>

158
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>He's putting all these like different bottles of pills,</v>

159
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>like on the table,</v>

160
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:37.921
<v Speaker 1>he's got like Viagra and a bunch of other shit and carries a bottle with him.</v>

161
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:38.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>And then he put like his fanny pack.</v>

163
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Well there's Bob tools,</v>

164
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>the many bottles and then he puts down like a little bag,</v>

165
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>like a clear bag of something and he's like,</v>

166
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>he looks at it and he grabs money clip and he puts his money on the table and it</v>

167
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>looks at the clear baggies like,</v>

168
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:52.774
<v Speaker 1>whoops.</v>

169
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.703
<v Speaker 1>And he puts that back,</v>

170
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that was.</v>

171
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.953
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

172
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't okay for him to put on the table.</v>

173
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Everything else was fine for some reason.</v>

174
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

175
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.483
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

176
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>big old stack of cash.</v>

177
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.650
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

178
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

179
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:08.681
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

180
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:08.891
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

181
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>what if you get your pills mixed up like you're just running a ton of fucking</v>

182
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Viagra and shit like that,</v>

183
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>but we have to be weird that when,</v>

184
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>when people are taking these powerful mind altering substances which can have</v>

185
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>these wonderful things as you and I have experienced,</v>

186
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>we got to be aware that there are people who are not as stable as they think</v>

187
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

188
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>People who have deep seeded shit going on and they don't know what's buried</v>

189
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>that's going to come flying out people or don't understand that yet.</v>

190
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to jump jump from the first floor,</v>

191
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>not the fifth floor,</v>

192
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>so we got to make sure because the jump from the first floor,</v>

193
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.691
<v Speaker 1>the ground floor,</v>

194
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.141
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

195
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:41.711
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

196
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

197
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 1>but that it's going to be so key because I mean,</v>

198
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

199
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>just to shift away from the sales for a second,</v>

200
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues we're working on big time is trying to reduce the number of</v>

201
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>people dying from overdoses involving either heroin or pharmaceutical opiates.</v>

202
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>For the last couple of years,</v>

203
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>more people have died of an accidental overdose involving heroin or other</v>

204
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals.</v>

205
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>They had a car accident is the number one cause of accidental death in America</v>

206
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.614
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

207
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

208
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely crazy stuff.</v>

209
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

210
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.591
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

211
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>when we say overdoses suggests you took too much.</v>

212
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Most of what our overdose is actually or drug combinations.</v>

213
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>They're typically doing this.</v>

214
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Opiate,</v>

215
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.151
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical,</v>

216
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.541
<v Speaker 1>opiate,</v>

217
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.211
<v Speaker 1>oxy Kodo,</v>

218
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and whatever it might be might be prescribed to you with booze or with Benzos,</v>

219
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>valium type trucks.</v>

220
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

221
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So what we're trying to do is to put out there the notion that don't care if you</v>

222
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:28.611
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

223
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Opiates,</v>

224
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>don't combine it with booze.</v>

225
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Don't combine it with tranquilizers.</v>

226
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a miracle drug called the locks up and we're trying to make that stuff</v>

227
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>as widely available.</v>

228
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:37.671
<v Speaker 1>Reverses the.</v>

229
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like an antidote for an overdose.</v>

230
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Make it available.</v>

231
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>We're passing nine slash 11 good Samaritan laws.</v>

232
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>So if people are around and a buddy there's overdoses,</v>

233
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>they don't just flip out.</v>

234
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They call nine slash 11 right away.</v>

235
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>The way it was a heart attack.</v>

236
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.401
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

237
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's true with the psychedelics and marijuana,</v>

238
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>but even with the drugs that we see as less elevated in a way with that huge</v>

239
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>numbers of people are using life,</v>

240
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.764
<v Speaker 1>the opiates.</v>

241
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really important that we become more and more of a society that understands</v>

242
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the notion that we need to make it safer to use these drugs.</v>

243
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.861
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

244
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>We got to keep people from getting hurt the way that people get hurt.</v>
