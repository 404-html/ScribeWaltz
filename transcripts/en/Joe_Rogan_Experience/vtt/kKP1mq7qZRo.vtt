<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Remember growing pains my own before Kirk Cameron became one of the most awesome</v>

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>lovers.</v>

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is it banana shaped the way it is?</v>

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I never told you to explain that shit.</v>

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.011
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

7
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:16.011
<v Speaker 2>I actually was on a plane with Kirk Cameron recently and he was just sitting</v>

8
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 2>there looking so sad and depressed and I,</v>

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 2>cause it was one of those things where uh,</v>

10
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting for somebody else to put like their luggage up so I was just</v>

11
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 2>standing right next to him and he's just sitting there like looking at his</v>

12
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:28.501
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

13
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 2>like looking past his phone,</v>

14
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 2>not even looking what's on the screen and he just sat there and then like some</v>

15
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 2>woman came up to him and he just looked up and went like did those are like</v>

16
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 2>little smile but it was so weird being</v>

17
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>to wouldn't,</v>

18
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine every day the guy is fighting off the gay with every fiber of</v>

19
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:46.084
<v Speaker 1>his being.</v>

20
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>He is just clenching his teeth and finding out if you really want to save Kirk</v>

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Cameron,</v>

22
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.791
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

23
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>If you're a big gay guy,</v>

24
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>sit in his lap and pull your cock out and he'll just,</v>

25
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>he'll suck on it like a baby to its mother's breasts.</v>

26
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Banana peel on that first security.</v>

27
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing.</v>

28
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 1>He's just fighting off the gay tooth and nail and claw and Fang.</v>

29
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>So funny to me how the not people who are most outspoken against homosexuality</v>

30
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.123
<v Speaker 1>gaze.</v>

31
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.851
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

32
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>He's so obviously gay.</v>

33
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't get any obviously gayer than Kirk.</v>

34
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Cameron not does anything wrong with being obviously either.</v>

35
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the guy to be happy,</v>

36
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>she just come out of the closet.</v>

37
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>All of them just come out.</v>

38
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the Tom Cruise?</v>

<v Speaker 1>medal bigger than the Olympic medal?</v>

327
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 1>the worst circumstances like black beards,</v>

00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I want mold into that.</v>

333
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:00.430

334
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

335
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.330

336
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 1>The flights?</v>

337
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.753
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

338
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you're Tom Cruise screensaver cooked in all your photos of the half naked said.</v>

339
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:06.811
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

340
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:07.411

341
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.244
<v Speaker 1>Back up a second.</v>

342
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Think about this real quick.</v>

343
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Look at him with Val Kilmer.</v>

344
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

345
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll think about what he looks like,</v>

346
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 1>which is the fucking same.</v>

347
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.770
<v Speaker 1>He's showing him the house,</v>

348
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 1>put inside them in this photo.</v>

349
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 1>What Val Kilmer looks like.</v>

350
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.213
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

351
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting you to the elbow.</v>

352
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.103
<v Speaker 1>I iceman.</v>

353
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Val Kilmer.</v>

354
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Val Kilmer has continued to age whereas Tom Cruise had,</v>

355
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>he got to a certain point and then just stopped because he's been eating from a</v>

356
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 1>human liver restaurant and you don't know about it yet.</v>

357
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.040
<v Speaker 1>The Petri dish.</v>

358
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Human Liver restaurant.</v>

359
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

360
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 1>He goes into the cryo freezer especially picks his organs as in love with</v>

361
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Katie's back in the day.</v>

362
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

363
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>what is he thinking about their cock?</v>

364
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.931
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's thinking about.</v>

365
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Cock is thinking about cost there.</v>

366
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.923
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

367
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

368
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 1>that seasons he's ready for it.</v>

369
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Actually only for cock.</v>

370
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I actually want to say on the record that I don't think he's gay and he doesn't</v>

371
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.680
<v Speaker 1>want like that because in my name is Brian Ryko over in my use,</v>

<v Speaker 1>even if he doesn't want cock,</v>

376
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.700
