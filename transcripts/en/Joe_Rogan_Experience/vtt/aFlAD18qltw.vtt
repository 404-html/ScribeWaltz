1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.990
Well you go through all three of those?
No.
Okay.
Well no one other ones for you.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.940
Oh okay,
good.
Good.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.340
Cause all that gas based gone through three cow alive

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.250
is figuring out how much I think these are 270 milligrams of caffeine.

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:21.530
If you drank three of these Jamie,
that would kill you right there.
Cool.
Yeah.
No,

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.870
it wouldn't kill Ya.
Fuck you up.
I thought you walked in with three copies.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.950
I was like,
God Damn Rogan.
You're going to die like straight up.
Tie Up to a show.

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.760
What is for you?
Hopefully we won't need both.
Wow.
I Dunno.

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.060
I've drank both of them before the show,
which is like 500 plus milligrams.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.670
I'm addicted to coffee though,
man.
I will just drink it when I'm,

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.700
I don't even need a high,
I'll just drink it.
I love the smell of it.

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.580
It's so good in the morning,
man.
It's the best.

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.230
I love it with cream.
I love it.
Black.
I Love Espresso.

14
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:53.700
I love it all.
See I got rid of drinking the whole coffee.

15
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:57.720
I'm now an espresso drinker.
Really?
Two shots in the morning.
A double shot,

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.790
a double shot,
and then like a couple hours later,

17
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:02.970
another day I'll do like eight double shots throughout the day because to me

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.800
that's better than drinking one coffee.
Yes,
but it's not.
It's not.
It's actually,

19
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:12.690
apparently espresso has less caffeine in it then coffee does.

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.720
Even though it seems like it has a lot.
It does it,

21
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
but you have to drink more acidic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's like shit,

22
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.320
but it's definitely an acquired taste.
I enjoy it,

23
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.830
but it's one of the rare things I drank to is that big and I'm holding my finger

24
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:29.040
up like two inches inches.
Yeah,
it's that.

25
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.270
It's two inches and it'll take me 10 15 minutes.
Drink it for an espresso.
Yeah.

26
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:36.870
It should be like a s a slow.
My God.
Why are you drinking so slow?
I like it.

27
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:40.270
I like to say grow like the gentleman pinkies out.

28
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.040
There's only one way to do it with these fat neanderthals.

29
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.870
If you're holding that little tiny though,

30
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.140
you can't get your whole hand in there like a mega man drinking an espresso.

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.050
Right.
It's not like a beer Stein that of,
oh,
a rhino horn.

32
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.250
It's a tiny little thing.
You can not look tough drink.

33
00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.820
I'm an expert but I drink mine.

34
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.120
I'm like three seconds till you just pound them and then I'll go to the gym.

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.080
Well I do that too.
One time I uh,
I drank five,

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.580
I have an espresso espresso maker and I put five capsules in there and filled a

37
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:16.500
mug up with it.
Like a coffee mug
and I ran four miles.

38
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.840
No,
it wasn't as fucking animal through the hills.

39
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.290
Like I was being chased by wolves.
Just Holly,

40
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.840
fuck am I chasing you?
I was like,
why did I drink so much?

41
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
So what is the espresso at?
What does it say there Jamie?
Okay.
Coffee brewed.
See,

42
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:36.420
but then it all is all depends on the company because Starbucks is extremely

43
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.170
caffeinated.
Yeah.
See Starbucks is way up the chart.
Look at it there.

44
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.320
Starbucks tall is closing in on 200 and it looks like about two 70 somewhere in

45
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:51.090
the range of 270 milligrams caffeine.
But that's a coffee.

46
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:55.860
That's not coffee.
It would be better to go to Starbucks and get a tall coffee,

47
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.260
but there's an espresso.
See how low it is?
It's below a hundred yeah,

48
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.440
so that's why I'm drinking so many.
So when I drank five,
I guess,

49
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.440
I think I had fun.
I paid 500 milligrams,

50
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.240
which is basically less than drinking two of these things.
Yeah.

51
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.620
These Caveman Nitros.
These are the shit.
Yeah.
I live off these goddamn things.

52
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.500
They're responsible for half my productivity.
Basically.

53
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.220
I'm too chicken shit to go on Adderall.
So I just,

54
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.610
I just drink this stuff all day.

55
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.120
He's good move,
good move.
I,
there's nothing wrong with coffee,
man.

56
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.820
I'm scared of Adderall.
But people will admit they're alert,

57
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.940
they're addicted to coffee and everyone's like,
God,
me too.
If you go,
dude,

58
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:38.190
I am so addicted to Adderall.
They're like,
okay Joe,
not calling you,

59
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.070
are you?
You're going to think I'm lame.
But till five years ago,

60
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.750
I didn't even know what Adderall,
it was good.
No,
I think you're smart.

61
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.990
I like all my friends in Houston.
They do it and I asked my friend,

62
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.520
like I texted him and I go,
hey man,
what you got?
What's your Auntie?
And he goes,

63
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:55.810
yeah,
we got Adderall.
I was like,

64
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.600
what are you know your address to go to your house?

65
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.350
Like literally he thought it was talking about Adderall and then he splayed to

66
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.530
me like when you're in a club and you want to stay up and you want to stay like

67
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.460
energized,
you take Adderall.
And I was like,
oh,
okay.
But I,

68
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.570
I don't drink so I can stay up until three,
four o'clock in the morning,
be fine.

69
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.980
What's fascinating about Adderall is what they've essentially done is taken an

70
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:22.981
amphetamine and made it so that if you prescribe it for a condition,

71
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.130
right?
Like they give it to people who have add is one of them,

72
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:28.270
write whatever the fuck that means.

73
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.140
And it's very debatable whether or not you have it or don't have,

74
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:36.280
everybody has a upon,
I have it for sure.
If it's real,
if it's real,
I haven't,

75
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.760
but they give you Adderall.
Yeah,
just fucking speed.

76
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.780
And because it's a medication that you give to somebody who has supposedly has a

77
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:46.900
condition.
And by the way,
I'm not diagnosing you.
If you're out there,

78
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:49.120
you're getting frustrated with me right now.
Just listen to me.

79
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.120
It's fucking speed.
Maybe you need speed.

80
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.040
Maybe you're that person that needs speed.

81
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.560
Maybe you do need it legitimately as a medication,

82
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.690
but there's off fuck gloated he pulled at her just doing speed.

83
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:04.570
So by somebody giving you speed,
it's supposed to slow you down.

84
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.990
So you want to have add.
Is that the reason they say legit?

85
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:12.430
If you have the legit add look,
I am not doubting that.

86
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.520
Some people have what a hundred buck I have worse than I have it.
Yeah,

87
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.290
there's a spectrum right,
with everything.

88
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.620
But for some people when they take Adderall or similar type of substances,

89
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.640
it actually lets them focus and they can,
they can actually be on track.

90
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:32.050
So by speeding it up somehow it focuses edit.
I think it's,

91
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:35.560
I think the idea is that it's proof that their system is wired wrong,

92
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.190
which is why when you give them that speed,
they can send her out and mellow out.

93
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.050
My,
uh,
my friend's a doctor and I was talking to him and I used to,

94
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.870
you know,
just popped by to say what's up.
And he goes,
hey man,

95
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.790
just to let you know,
the more you go to a doctor,
the faster you'll die.
And I go,

96
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:56.530
what?
Yeah.
He's like,
I just want to let know.
Yeah.
He says,
the more you go to us,

97
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.040
you come to us,
the faster

98
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.270
<v 1>you'll die.
I was like,
what are you talking about?</v>

99
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.950
Because a lot of doctors are crooked and they'll give you something for what you

100
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:07.130
think you got.
And then after that wears off,
they have to give you some mouse.

101
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.160
So now you just keep filling yourself with stuff to fix.

102
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.790
The other thing that was wrong,
and he goes,
some,

103
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.830
some doctors are not good people.
And he goes,

104
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.040
the more people go to doctors the fast day.
Dot.
Put it in point.

105
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.940
My Mom beat breast cancer twice.
Right.
And my dad's never been to the doctor.

106
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.150
He's 75 years old.
Never been to the doctor wants cause he's like,

107
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.580
well soon as you go to the doctor they tell you something wrong,
you die,

108
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.210
you know literally.
But if you have cancer you should go to a fucking,

109
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.190
he didn't have cancer.
My mom did.
Right.

110
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.230
But if he had cancer he should go to a fucking,

111
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.140
but I don't think he would go even if he has.
Yeah,
he's just,

112
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:41.780
my mom beat it twice and she's still here?
Yes she is.

113
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.970
In the second time she beat it.
She didn't even tell me she had it.

114
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.890
It doesn't your dad want to beat it if he gets it.
This kind of dude was like,

115
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.000
Hey,
I've been through a lot.
I'm fine.
Like he's,
he hates going to the doctor.

116
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.430
They'll only time you went to the doctor.
He had a back problem and that's it.

117
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.650
That's old score.
What have you met?
A good doctor.
Like a doctor that he likes.

118
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:05.030
Like a guy who plays golf with or some shit like my dad.
My Dad is not social.

119
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.920
It's not.
No,
no,
no.
I'm totally weird.
You're so social.
I,
I'm totally opposite.

120
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.850
Like my dad's story is crazy.
Like he,
you know,
he went through segregation.

121
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:18.200
He got a phd in nuclear physics.
Oh yeah.
My Dad's a genius,

122
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.380
but shit,
by out there talking shit on,
just tell it,
judge,

123
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.480
I'm a failure,
but you're not because you're a success at it.

124
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:29.210
So he's got to go all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He knows.

125
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.850
He's the one that told me to drop out of college.
Really?
Yeah.

126
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.710
I played football for these many.
Say it though.

127
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.110
He said you need to drop out of college.
You're not smart.
Like not

128
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.480
Michael.
You need to drop out of college and chase your dream.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

129
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:47.780
He was like,
my dad's whole thing is I got a phd in nuclear physics.

130
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.000
I know what wanting to be in school is,

131
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.080
and you don't want to be in school and you,
you got a personality,
go do that.

132
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:58.850
But you're dumb.
Like,
oh.
He would say that.
My parents were not supportive.

133
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.080
They were just not support.
Like my mom wanted me to be a doctor,

134
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.250
but she knew I wasn't bright enough to be a doctor.
So like my dad said,

135
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:08.420
you've got to drop out.
I see.

136
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.970
I don't think you're not bright enough to be a doctor.

137
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.040
I think you're not interested in being a doctor.

138
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.450
See Cause I see how you pursue stand up and show business.
You're,

139
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:19.010
you're a bright,
ambitious guy.

140
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.910
Still want to be operating on people that are on anesthesia.

141
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:27.620
It's fucking headlamps on and shit and rubber gloves covered with blood kit

142
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:30.890
though.
I don't,
fuck,
I don't want nobody dying on me.
That would be the worst.

143
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:34.580
Having somebody die while you're working on them and then you got to go tell

144
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:39.170
their friends,
hey man,
sorry.
My bad.
You know.
Ah,
the pressure of those people.

145
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.130
Jamie was he,
he was telling me yesterday about the guy who's the EMT who sees,

146
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.270
tell me,
tell me what you told me.

147
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.740
<v 2>He's a,
he said he was listening to the podcast we did with Louis J.</v>

148
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.220
Gomez about people getting head injuries.
Uh,
and he has been doing,

149
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:52.930
I believe for like 15 years or so.

150
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:55.710
Like it doesn't do it every single day because you don't every single day,

151
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.010
but on a

152
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.740
<v 3>three day basis or so,
every day he works,</v>

153
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.740
he sees at least one person dead from a head injury,

154
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.410
whether it's an elderly person,
they slipped on ice,

155
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.030
something people fall and hit their heads.
Oh yeah.
That's why.
Please folks,

156
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.670
if you're listening to me and you want to punch somebody in,
knocked them out,

157
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:15.780
please don't do it.
Just go to a gym,
get your frustrations out.

158
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:16.710
Don't fight on the street.

159
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:21.120
You could kill somebody or you can get killed even accidentally.

160
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.900
Even if you really don't hate the guy that much,
you punched him in the face.

161
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.630
They go unconscious,
their head hits the ground.
People die all the time.
In mean.

162
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.850
I've told the story about when Kevin James used to work as a bouncer in Long

163
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.210
Island,
a guy that he was working with punched the guy and killed them.
Really?

164
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.860
Yeah.
Kevin.
Kevin wasn't there,

165
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:42.090
but he knew the guy and the guy accidentally killed a drunk guy,
junk.

166
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.330
I was coming at him.
He punched him.
I guess I'm,
I don't know the whole story,

167
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.760
but that shit happens all the time.

168
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.220
I've seen guys and it's not about the punch though.

169
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:54.030
It's about when they hit their head getting hit by the world.

170
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.300
Think about that thing of the world just drop on your head.

171
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.800
That's what it's like.
Your body mass bouncing off a completely,

172
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.090
especially concrete.
There's no gift.
So your head just cook clock.

173
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.800
It sounds horrible.

174
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.550
Why listen to someone's head bounced off concrete is one of the scariest fucking

175
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:13.380
sounds.
Oh,
it's horrible.

176
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.230
Even if you do it to somebody and you wanted to hurt them,

177
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.130
when you hear their head bounced off concrete,
you're like,
oh shit.

178
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.770
Like that's not as simple as like you punched them,

179
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.650
you punched them and then you know whatever.

180
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:28.890
They weigh 190 pounds with all the mass of grass,

181
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.060
all their mass and gravity pulling them towards the ground with nothing slowing

182
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:33.810
it down.

183
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.280
But meat and head bang bone I shoulder.

184
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.780
<v 1>That reminds me when I was 10 years old,
I was sitting on the curb,</v>

185
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.140
and this is the first time I saw death in real life from a head injury.

186
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.560
I was sitting with my friend on the curb and a guy was driving a motorcycle and

187
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:52.190
he was speeding up and down the street and right on iris would,
and Houston,

188
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:56.390
Texas,
he's flying down a car,
pulls out and he hits it.

189
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.800
Back then they didn't wear helmets,

190
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.480
so he literally flew up in the air and landed about 20 feet from us.

191
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.410
His head hit first and exploded like a watermelon.

192
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.940
And this is like,
I was 10 years old watching this.
So the next morning,
you know,

193
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.730
the police come,
my parents get me to tell me,
don't look at it.

194
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.610
I go out there the next day,

195
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:20.150
it's just blessed stains everywhere and his wife is picking up his hair that's

196
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.240
stuck to the concrete.
And I remember it so vividly.

197
00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:27.650
I was next door neighbor was Eric and we were sitting on the curb watching this

198
00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:32.000
lady pick up her husband's hair that was stuck in,

199
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.020
and that's the first time I ever saw death.
And it was,

200
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and it was a gnarly death too.
It was like that facing death stuff.

201
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.990
Like it was bad.
It was bad.
They never rode a motorcycle because of that.

202
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.333
Yeah.
There's,

203
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.930
there's not a lot of reasons to ride a motorcycle other than it's awesome.
Yeah.

204
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.970
Just fuck fucking,

205
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.510
I took a motorcycle safety classes and then two of my friends,
uh,

206
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:02.660
wiped out.
One of them got hit by a car and one of them fell,
uh,

207
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.840
going around a corner and fucked his shoulder up.
I,
uh,
I,

208
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.770
after that accident,
probably about six years later,
you know,

209
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.110
in three wheelers with big,
yeah.
And my friend,
same friend that was on the curb,

210
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:18.970
we were f three Whelan and,
and where I grew up there as bunch of ditches.

211
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.530
So we're going and he thought he could go down in the ditch and come up the

212
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:27.460
other side,
but I think he forgot that it's flat on the bottom of real ditches.

213
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.350
So literally we're going and we hit the bottom and I flew up in literally half

214
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.310
my face was like just wrecked.
I was in the hospital and,

215
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.890
and we didn't have helmets and cause we're young and dumb and just wanted to

216
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.920
like stupid,
stupid,
stupid please.

217
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.450
Elysian like when you let boys just wander around,
it's never good.

218
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.680
It's never did dumb shit that they do that they think is okay,
let's try this.

219
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.530
Hey take those fireworks and stick them in this tree.

220
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.980
This old rotted don't tree,
let's blew up.

221
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.900
And the problem is I think,
I think today parents,

222
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:08.950
at least we know more,
I feel we tell,
but like our parents,

223
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.950
at least my parents,
they didn't really give me guidance.
You know,

224
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:15.010
they were kind of like,
hey,
figure it out on your own mind to yeah.

225
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:17.260
And that was that generation though.
They,
yeah,

226
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.760
like my parents is the parents that didn't tell you they loved me till I was 29

227
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.480
and I forced him to go.
Wow.
That's different.
Yeah.

228
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:27.190
My parents taught me to love her all the time.

229
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.790
My parents were hippies.
Oh my stepdad are hippies.
I don't know.

230
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.250
Maybe it was in a good way.
In a good way.
It really nice people.
Yeah.

231
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.990
Yeah man that they didn't tell me Shit though.
Like what to do something.

232
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.530
Why your grades so bad and like,
oh what the fuck do I do?

233
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.200
Tell him it's on someone's toes that they've learnt man.

234
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.160
You know like when you have like if you have a full time job and the wife has a

235
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:56.380
full time job and you're raising children,
man,

236
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.000
how much time does that really leave?

237
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.110
I mean I don't get home until six seven like when do you get out of work at five

238
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.840
by the time you get home the kids have been home from school for three hours

239
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.880
already exhausted.
They just want to eat and go to sleep.

240
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.090
Like you're not learning anything about each other for like five days a week.

241
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.200
Well,
I,
that's my,

242
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.160
my mom worked for my dad so I got to see my mom a lot.

243
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.010
But it was a type of relationship where when I was growing up,
my mom's Asian,

244
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.180
my dad's black,
I guess there wasn't that,
hey,
we love you.

245
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.210
I mean I knew they loved me,
but they didn't ever say that's it.

246
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.390
And the only reason they said it is because I was dating a girl at the time and

247
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.730
they use the I love you think all the time.

248
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:36.850
And I thought that was very strange because I've never heard people just say it

249
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.360
all the,
Hey,
I love you.
I love you,
I love you.
So I called my dad and I was like,

250
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.320
Hey,
I love you.
And he goes,
any hung up?
Like literally he got like kind of like,

251
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.170
he was just like,
okay,
you know,
it was like,
all right,
cool.

252
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:51.800
And then he hung up and then now after I got married and have a kid,
now we say,

253
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.160
I love

254
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 0>you all the time.
You know,
so,
cause I don't want my son to grow up with no,</v>

255
00:14:55.881 --> 00:15:00.320
I love yous.
Yeah.
It's just this is different time for them,
man.

256
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:04.790
It was a different time.
It's a foolish insecurity because if you say you love,

257
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.350
you say I love you to someone.
Um,

258
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.360
either they love you back and it feels great or they don't and you don't hang

259
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:15.290
out with them anymore.
I to say I love you to somebody.

260
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.380
Like I reserve it for people that I love and usually they love you too.

261
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.030
Yes.
You're,
there's something wrong with your wiring.
This,

262
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.040
you're looking at it wrong,
you know?
Yeah.
I know that's never happened to me,
Joe.

263
00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:29.390
Where I told somebody I loved them and they said nothing back.

264
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.280
It can happen due dude's clam up sometimes.
Tell friend you love them.
Hey,

265
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:39.170
I love you man.
They go,
yikes.
This is not for me wearing,

266
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.980
this is too weird,
man.
I grew up in Nebraska,

267
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.910
but I think it's also a young dude thing too.
When you're young,
you're macho.

268
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:49.760
You don't want to say I love you too.
Another dude now sure.
When you get older,

269
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:53.210
like actually if you live in,
in Nebraska.
I'm just kidding.
Nebraska.

270
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.300
Don't get uptight.
Somebody sent me a box in Nebraska tee shirts.

271
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.140
Cornhusker once like,
listen son,
I ain't wearing that.

272
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.790
My,
my wife's father is from Nebraska.
Is He?
Yeah.
Well there you go.
Yeah,

273
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.880
that's a good time.
It's good to spot as any oil spots.
It used to suck.

274
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:14.150
They don't suck as much anymore.
Now.
I mean the Internet really,
I mean,

275
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:17.360
what's there to do in Nebraska?
Let's be serious.
Like pheasant hunt,

276
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.630
I think it's a good pheasant hunting spot.
Okay.
They've got the corn huskers,

277
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.800
they got corn.
If you just want to be alone,
start,
start a cult.

278
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.200
I think it's a good spot.
Start out.
Great.
Yeah.

279
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.320
If you want to start a cult though,
you got to live in an attractive climate.

280
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.080
You know?
I think that's why,
uh,

281
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.620
that's why that place in Arizona that everybody goes to Scottsdale.
No,
no,
no.

282
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.630
The other one sit down on that one.

283
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.580
That's the one where all the cult leaders go down.

284
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.940
How do you explain Waco then?
That's the armpit of Texas.
Let's split.
It isn't,

285
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.620
he gets a Dallas pretty quick from Waco recruit.

286
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.600
You got Dallas for grouse ranch out in Waco.
Go check out a cowboys game.

287
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.750
Come back after recruit bar.
Yeah.
Nah,
I couldn't.

288
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.260
This whole coping thing,
I don't get it.
So don't as a weird one.
Right?

289
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:05.450
Because it's all like crystals and healers.

290
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:09.260
It's all people look at it be spiritual that they've given up on on traditional

291
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:13.250
religion,
but they seem to need that sort of vibe and so they,

292
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:17.530
they get into like spiritual stuff and channelers and he learns.

293
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:20.250
Have you got of that stuff?
I knew it all day long.
All right.

294
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:26.040
Oh one all about channeling,
bro.
That's my thing.

295
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.790
I mean it channeling.
Yeah,
right.
I mean,
no,
no.

296
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.170
I think we,
I really do believe,
and I've,

297
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.060
I've been believing this more and more lately though,

298
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.470
that our understanding of what our memory is is a very limited,

299
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.050
and that the reason why people are scared of things,

300
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.000
some things is probably because there's some sort of genetic memory of someone

301
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:48.890
that they knew.
Like,
I bet your

302
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.250
<v 3>will have somehow or another that knowledge of that motorcycle accident and that</v>

303
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:01.170
fee.
There's,
I think shit like that goes through DNA do.
Yeah,
I do.

304
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.550
I think that's why kids are scared of monsters.
You know why his kids?

305
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:08.070
Scared of monsters?
Why aren't they scared of bullets or fires or you know,

306
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:09.600
like why?
Why aren't they're screaming?
They're,

307
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:13.230
they're scared of something that I was scared of growing up.
No,

308
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:16.440
there's animals used to eat people.
Yeah.
That's what I think.

309
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.290
I think monster's represent like Jaguars and shit.

310
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.480
Like you're going through the John and tried to get some water and you get

311
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:24.480
jacked.
That's our ancestors.
All of our ancestors,

312
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:29.340
every single human being on this planet came from Africa.
All of us.

313
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:33.210
100% of us.
Everyone.
Absolutely.
Jen,
black,
white.

314
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.040
All of us got eaten.
All of our ancestors in our DNA.
It's wired.

315
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.330
This cats out there.
What are you afraid of?
Monsters in the dark.

316
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.380
Those are cats,
man.
We got jacked by cats like all the time.

317
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.730
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's why everybody's scared of things under the bed.

318
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.780
What's in the closet?
They're hiding their cats.
Big Cats looking to get you.

319
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.120
I don't know about that.

320
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.750
This was very scary for a moment,
but I don't believe in that.

321
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:09.060
But why do you think that animals have instincts,
right?

322
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:11.070
Like here's a perfect example.
We have instincts,
right?

323
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:14.040
But what kind of instincts?
Animals have weird instincts.

324
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:15.630
Like they all sniff each other's assholes.

325
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.170
They all piss on spots where other animals did.
They don't.
Nobody had to teach.

326
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:21.030
My dog had to do that.
My dog,

327
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:24.120
I got him when he was six weeks old and I've had him for two and a half years.

328
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:27.300
That motherfucker will sniff something and he sees somebody peed on it.

329
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:31.470
He pees on it.
But he learned that from his,
he didn't learn that from nobody.
No.

330
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.920
He learned that from his dog.
People.
What's it like when you came over here?

331
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:39.420
He didn't know Jack Shit.
So he says,
no,

332
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.470
I think it's in his DNA.
Okay.
Yeah,
I get that.
But what is the DNA like?

333
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.690
Doesn't your DNA carries some traces of information onto your own children?

334
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.550
Like what I notice in my children,

335
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.450
they share certain weird traits that I have that I don't like,

336
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:59.250
like a obsessive compulsive traits that I don't think they see because I don't

337
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:03.300
really bring that home.
Like especially like the workout stuff and like some,

338
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.750
some things that I really get kind of psychotic about martial arts stuff.

339
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.710
My middle daughter has that in a crazy way and I'm like,

340
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.670
Oh okay this is me.
If I was a girl.
Okay.
Like if I was a little girl,
this is me.

341
00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:18.210
Like what is it?
So is this my memory that's in her or is it,

342
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:22.670
do I have like some weird obsessive Jean I,
which is it?

343
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.000
It is the DNA because I see my son,
he's only two,
he just turned two.

344
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.210
But he makes facial expressions and looks like he does certain looks that I do

345
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.080
and,
and my wife goes,
he's acting like you right now.

346
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:41.040
You think he's acting like you cause he sees you act like that or is he acting

347
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:44.760
like,
cause he knows in his head that that's how he's wired like that.

348
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.130
Because when I watched it,
he doesn't like a lot of this

349
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.860
<v 0>stuff.
He does.
I don't eat,
I don't even do,</v>

350
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.880
he just does like my mom or come over and she'll wash them.
She go,
he knows.

351
00:20:55.881 --> 00:20:59.350
He's just like you when you were this age and it's so weird.
Yeah,

352
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.620
it's in the DNA.
It's in something,
right.
Whatever it is.

353
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.140
Whether it's in cellular memory,
DNA,

354
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:09.700
some sort of genetic information gets passed on,
but the parents,

355
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.720
the child,
you could say that about athletics though.
Like if you get too,

356
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.330
that's a little different though,
but it's in the DNA.
Yeah,
it isn't the DNA,

357
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.590
but it's not an ethereal thing like a thought.
You know what I mean?

358
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.180
Like so like here's one of 50 of phobia or Arachnophobia,

359
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.510
fear of snakes or spiders.
Those.
Have you ever seen anybody who has that?
Well,

360
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:32.740
you are on fear factor with me.
Oh my God.
That was the worst.
He'd say you were.

361
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.270
You made it out,
Bro.
Laces.
No.

362
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.680
Do you remember in one episode?

363
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.510
One I was the pilot episode of fear billing episode.

364
00:21:41.511 --> 00:21:45.550
And that's where I met you for the first six.
Can you believe 16 what?

365
00:21:45.551 --> 00:21:47.630
2001 yeah.
What does that,

366
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.800
it's 1819 years ago we met because that was,

367
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.290
that was right after nine 11 yes.
Yeah,
right after it.

368
00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:57.670
And they flew us down and the first time I met you,

369
00:21:57.671 --> 00:22:02.020
it was that saddle ranch and you're like,
welcome this dude.
Oh Man.

370
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.750
Okay.
This is later.
This is later.

371
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.800
Way later when we did the new season of it in like 2011 yeah.

372
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:11.040
You tried to get me to eat that spider.
Yeah,

373
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:15.430
that's when I was acting like a spad bro.
Dude.
Dude,
that's not a normal thing.

374
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.220
And you just chomped it like a chance.
So this whole scene,

375
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:22.300
I'm acting like a little bee.
Oh,
answers.
Little,
little fearful.

376
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.610
You had each sheeps eyebrow eyeball stone,
which had to eat,
dude.

377
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.700
Now those were disgusting.
Did you eat,
eat it?

378
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.440
Because I felt bad for you guys.
That was before I had hardened.

379
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.900
I'd been hardened to the world.
Cause you guys were episode one,

380
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:38.860
season one and it didn't seem right for me that you guys would have to eat these

381
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:41.770
things and I didn't need it.
So I said,
if you guys eat it,
I'll eat it too.

382
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.330
But they didn't show it like they wouldn't show it on television that I ate it

383
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.950
because they didn't,
they,
they didn't want it to look too easy.
Yeah.
So weird.

384
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:52.931
Oh my God.

385
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:57.100
I remember biting down into it and it kind of like burst and then that retina,

386
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.050
then you had to just shop too.
Yeah.

387
00:22:59.051 --> 00:23:02.560
You had to chew on that rent and we had to eat three of them.
They weren't good.

388
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.540
No,
they were horrible.
But you know,
it was surprisingly mild.
I ate a roach.

389
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.620
I'm not,
not bragging too much,
just a roach.
If not,
it doesn't taste like much.

390
00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:15.610
Like why don't you eat a roach?
Is that part of the show?

391
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.900
It was a celebrity fear factor.

392
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.290
There was a young lady who was scared to eat a roach and uh,

393
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.080
she was going to get eliminated from the show.
And so I said,
listen,

394
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:33.850
I'll make you a deal.
I'll,
if you do it,
I'll do it.
And she's like,
you will.

395
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.140
I go,
yeah,
I will.
And she wouldn't do it.
So she made a deal like,

396
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.040
like three worms.
She decided I'll eat three warm,

397
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.970
like we'd negotiated into three moms.
And so then I ate a row.

398
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.500
I remember when I was on that show,

399
00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:48.170
the question they would ask you in the survey is,
what's your fear of dying?

400
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.940
And I wrote down dying on the water because that would be my biggest fear is

401
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:54.050
dying underwater.

402
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.790
And so our last stunt was when they dumped us on a water and my friends still

403
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:02.540
send me screenshots of that because that's when I had long hair and I put a

404
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.780
bunch of gel in it and they dumped me under the tank.

405
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.020
And literally it looked like a squid shoot.
You,

406
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.210
if you could Google it,
Google Michael,
yo a fear of fat.
And it's,

407
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.690
my friends will just screenshot that and they still play that to this day.

408
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:21.340
They still play that episode of fear factor.
All of them,
they play him on.
Um,

409
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.590
different like tru TV or something like that.
One of those I remember shows,

410
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.040
I remember when we were talking,
I'll go,

411
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.150
cause you were what show were you on at that time?
Radio.
You were on news radio.

412
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.380
That was a couple of years earlier.
Hey you are look at that.
What happened?
Yeah.

413
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.110
And okay so that's the Shipibo Michael Yo

414
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.120
cheap cibo so at the Ed at the end I go to Joe and I go,

415
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.650
hey man,
I can't do the last dot.
Look at that.
I can't.

416
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:56.420
Okay so this is you talking to me.
Cause Joe goes,
Joe goes,
hey,

417
00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:59.090
I go Joe,
I'm not going to be able to make it through this whole stunt.

418
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.070
I can't hold my breath for that long.
And you go,

419
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.810
oh just make it look great for the camera.
So when I,

420
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.410
I was going to try to talk you into it,

421
00:25:09.411 --> 00:25:11.900
but I wasn't good enough at it then I did.

422
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:13.670
I had to figure out how to talk people into it.

423
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:16.790
Cause I know there's some people that would just psyching themselves out yet in

424
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:18.410
the smoker one our episode,

425
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.890
the guy that we thought that it was going to lose no oxygen.
Yeah,

426
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.940
it's fucking system.

427
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.080
He's used to having no oxygen and that's when they cast it fear factor off of

428
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:33.270
personality and then it just became a hot fast.
Like if you're a sexy,

429
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.510
it was also um,
you know,

430
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.540
they kept ramping up the difficulty of stuff like the last season scared the

431
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:44.630
shit out of me when they were launching a car through a moving train and an

432
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:48.870
explosion happens when the car,
it looks like what you're going to kill somebody.

433
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.470
And when I came up to your,
uh,

434
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.100
I think it was the last season y'all were doing something with a donkey Dong

435
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.360
touchy come canceled.
Yes,
yes.

436
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.560
I remember showing up.
It just is coming here.
You know,

437
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.460
like what was so crazy,

438
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.470
everybody was going to quit when I showed up that day and they brought the paper

439
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.570
into my trailer and he told me what it was going to be.

440
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:17.980
I don't think I knew about that one before.
Some of them I had known about,

441
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.730
knew about before,
but I don't think I knew about that one.
Oh,

442
00:26:20.731 --> 00:26:23.570
I think when they brought that in I had no idea.
And I was like,

443
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:25.970
you can't do this.
I'm like,
no one's gonna do it.
First of all,

444
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:26.804
they're all going to quit.

445
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.550
But what was hilarious is I'm sitting there next to you watching them drink this

446
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:33.950
up.
We're just lacking.

447
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.810
How about an intern had a drink it an intern had drinking.

448
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:41.540
I think they only got like $100 what for what?

449
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.000
It was like part of the is that they would have to test it when,

450
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.750
when they would like say here's some fear factor info.

451
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.640
So like say if you had to eat like a kidneys,
right?
How many,

452
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.570
how many kidneys can someone eat in a minute?
You know,
like how much,

453
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.860
how much meat can you actually like consistent gusting,
dried meat,

454
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:06.510
can you consume?
And so what we had was certain interns,

455
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.300
they would volunteer for it and they would get like an extra hundred and

456
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:11.420
something dollars.
And I would always give him money to I,

457
00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:14.100
it was giving me a couple hundred bucks on top of it,
but they would,

458
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.910
they would eat whatever the fuck it was and they would determine,
all right,

459
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.980
well Mike usually can put it down like,
like,
like no one.

460
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.460
And if he could only get through three and then some other producers would come

461
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.200
and go,
fuck this.
We're being pussies.

462
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:32.280
Making me for like for you guys are crazy.

463
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.780
And this was like the debate.

464
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:37.620
The debate on the set would be like how much blood they drink one gallon,

465
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.710
one gallon of blood.
Like they never drank blood,
but you know what I'm saying?

466
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:42.900
Like how many horse Dicks,
they never had a horse dick,

467
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:46.800
but they did eat like [inaudible] and elk,
Dick's and dear Dick.

468
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.770
But the donkey come was the worse.
Oh yeah.

469
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:52.290
And I even remember at the shoot you were like,
yeah,

470
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:55.560
I think the show's over after this.
Like they didn't air it.

471
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.440
I think they didn't get an error occurred in other countries though.
Oh,
did it?

472
00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:00.270
Really?
Yeah.
So he could get it like,

473
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.750
and I think it's like Dutch and so it's like you hear,

474
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.990
you hear us talk in English but then they have Dutch subtitles.
Yeah.
That,

475
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.260
that was,
that was such so stupid.
It's so,

476
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.460
are you surprised how stupid people are to go?
No,

477
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.270
because I think people were like,
look,
it's an experience.

478
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.060
I'm here for the experience.
I'm going to have some fun.
This is crazy.

479
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.150
But when you get to donkey come yet,
you're kind of being rude.
Yeah.
Those folks,

480
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.260
you know,
you got a donkey.
This donkey,
the donkey come is like,

481
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.200
can advantage of their need for fame in a weird way.
No,
you are.

482
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.600
But Hey,
they want to give it,
that's the game.

483
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.110
And I remember you showing it to me first and it was in this large,

484
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.850
a glass container and they,
and it wasn't a little,
they had to drink.
No,
no,
no.

485
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:46.510
It was,
I have to drink a lot.
Yeah.

486
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.090
It was like the aforementioned Rhino Horn beer mug.

487
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.910
Fucking large chuck.
Yeah.
No,

488
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.860
it's even more offensive on donkeys are,
they're not fertile.
Look at it.

489
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:05.790
There it is.
Oh,
that's it.
Yes.
So that come is useless.

490
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.640
It's not just come,
but imagine it's like it's,

491
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.540
it's come that could never even be babies.
Okay.
To Mail Shit.

492
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.350
But I remember when y'all used to do stuff,
this is disgusting.

493
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.040
I remember I used to do stunts.
It was actually a delicate,

494
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.600
like people in other countries actually ate it sometimes.
Sometimes.
Yeah.

495
00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:28.260
Like balloon.
So that's not,
that's just being done.
That's just being me.
Okay.

496
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:32.040
That's no other country is doing that just for fun to keep up on that whole,
uh,

497
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.320
this,
in other countries,
this is considered a delicacy.
Yeah.

498
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.030
He gave up on them long time ago.
Yeah.
You had to push the envelope on that.

499
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:44.031
Now one of the things that made things gross smell wise was actually really

500
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:47.170
expensive cheese.
They would go to this,
uh,

501
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:50.980
expensive was if a former Marjorie,
what do they call them?

502
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.620
One of the call one of those cheese places.
Yeah.

503
00:29:52.621 --> 00:29:57.300
That's like Italian for chief Tomas if for Moseri for machine,

504
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.060
isn't it French too?
Something like that.
Sure.
I'm proud.
Yeah.
Jamie's my,

505
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.500
that's my translation.
They both come from that.
I'm dumb.
I'm dumb.

506
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:10.420
So there you go.
But anyway,
this cheese that we would use was disgusting.

507
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.040
It smelled so bad.

508
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:15.850
But apparently it taste really good if you're into that kind of cheese.

509
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120
Like Bordain was really into stinky cheese.

510
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.240
Like he would talk to me about it like with passion like that,
just the,

511
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.690
the fucking stinkier the better like disgusting,

512
00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:29.050
smelly cheese and the taste is fantastic.
I'd be like,
wow.

513
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:34.090
I would think that the smell with what turned you off.
Absolutely.
I don't know.

514
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:38.800
It's like one of those things where I guess you catch like the right vibe.

515
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.970
Like you go in with the right attitude.
There is no editor.
If it stinks,

516
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.450
fuck that dude [inaudible] cheese.

517
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.850
And they would squeegee it off into a blender,

518
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.360
blend it up with the other stuff,
like worms and shit.

519
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:55.990
It would make the worms tastes horrific or smell horrific.
Oh,

520
00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:58.450
so you were just messing with their smell sense.

521
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:00.930
So it can make it seem like it was worse than the room.

522
00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:03.460
I can get worse because it smelled worse.

523
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.530
So it was making more like smell it,
but

524
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.500
people would just start retching
it was,

525
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.500
it's a ridiculous fucking thing.
It's a ridiculous thing.

526
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.680
Like to the show was really silly.
No,
but I,

527
00:31:18.681 --> 00:31:22.900
I love that these people wanted to be famous too,
Bro.

528
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:27.940
But I wasn't,
but none of them ended up.
But I knew I was different.

529
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.320
That was different too because how it happened.
I was in Austin,

530
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:35.890
Texas and there was an ad in the paper that goes,
hey,

531
00:31:35.891 --> 00:31:39.490
have you ever done anything adventurous?
And I was like,
no,
let me go in for this.

532
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:43.330
Cathy.
I was a radio DJ out there and um,
at this radio station.

533
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:47.380
So I go in and then Mikey,
uh,
they called them the chimp.

534
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.300
He was the casting person.
And literally two weeks later,
three weeks later,

535
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.820
I'm in Hollywood shooting this thing.
And then I meet you.

536
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:57.640
And then I remember going up to you,
cause I was in awe.

537
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:00.390
It was the first time in a Hollywood,
I'll go and I knew you from news,
right?

538
00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:02.980
And I was like,
how do you do it?
And you got to just fucking be yourself.

539
00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:05.410
You can be successful.
And that's what you're doing right now.

540
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:07.260
Just fucking being yourself.
This is what you're doing too.

541
00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.980
We're where we're trying.
We tried this and I did listen,

542
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.110
let ridiculous piece of advice.
Just be yourself.

543
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.370
Do whatever you do.
Don't improve

544
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.030
right now forever.
Good luck.
Just be yourself.
That's all you need,
Bro.
That's it.

545
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.420
Just believe in your dreams and make a vision board.

546
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.410
I was just trying to get me out of the space.
Oh,
just be you.
All right.

547
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:35.710
But that is the right advice.
Especially if you want to be an entertainer.

548
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.800
If you can figure out how to be yourself as long as yourself is actually

549
00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:41.940
something interesting and if it's not working yourself.
Yeah.

550
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.560
And then you even said that about acting.
He's like,
I remember specifically say,

551
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.550
Oh,
act is not hard.
It's just you yourself and you play that emotion.

552
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.810
And I was like,
oh,
that sounds easy.

553
00:32:51.811 --> 00:32:56.480
You like if the ace in comparison to stand up in some ways,

554
00:32:56.481 --> 00:33:00.100
but this is not like a disrespect,
like the kind of shit that like Daniel,

555
00:33:00.101 --> 00:33:04.520
late Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo Dicaprio.
Yeah.
When they,

556
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.840
when they get into a fucking roll and you're like God damn that guy just own

557
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:11.810
that shit.
Like they get into what I'm talking about is like sitcoms,

558
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.720
Sitcom acting.
Yeah.
Sitcom Act.
And they were hiring you to be at that time 100%.

559
00:33:16.721 --> 00:33:17.490
So it was a,

560
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:22.040
a slightly dumbed down version of me who was into slightly more conspiracy

561
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.890
theories,
didn't me when I was on news radio.
That's how it was.

562
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.941
It was basically me,

563
00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:29.360
like they wrote a lot of that conspiracy shit in after I'd talked to them about

564
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:34.230
like JFK and fucking,
you know,
Ufo shows and stuff.
You believe in Ufos.

565
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.540
Oh yeah.
Oh my God.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
See I believe in,

566
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:43.100
there's other other life forms out there,
but I don't think they're coming here.

567
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:48.010
They might think they might.
Well why not think it,
but just,
here's,

568
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.710
here's one thing.

569
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.820
I do believe most people are full of shit when it comes to like most of their

570
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:54.470
stories,
like it's,

571
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:59.450
it's hard to find a person that could just tell you what happened based on what

572
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:00.410
they really remember.

573
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.390
People want to jazz things up and they will want to add salt and pepper.

574
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.960
They just sex with me.
They don't,

575
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.630
they don't necessarily tell you the truth.

576
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:16.520
They tell you what they think is going to be an engaging story that kind of

577
00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:18.230
represents the truth.
Maybe.

578
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:21.350
Especially when it's a weird thing like you saw something in the sky.

579
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.000
What did you really see?
How long did you look at it for?
How many seconds was it?

580
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.313
Well,
I mean,

581
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.150
here's the problem I have with Ufo and I believe there are Ufo shows,

582
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:33.380
but I don't think they're coming here.

583
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.660
What that means that would you say that because that means their tech,

584
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.310
first of all,
if they're coming here,

585
00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:40.830
that means their technology is far way more advanced than ours.
Right?

586
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.420
So why would they care if people saw them?
They would show up.

587
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:47.780
If I was an alien and I was that far ahead of us,

588
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.020
I would lay in that bitch right in the middle of time square and be like,

589
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:54.530
what we are here?
Why would you do that?
But why would I,

590
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:58.550
why am I helping in fields where nobody can see us?

591
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.050
Are you aware of how we treat uncontacted tribes?
He,

592
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.300
yes,
to a point to point,

593
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.390
but what I'm saying is if you're that far advanced,

594
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:11.410
they know if they're coming here,
they know they're,

595
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.950
they're way smarter than that because they've traveled here and we don't even

596
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:20.270
know other from far distances.
We can't even imagine and they're here.

597
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:21.350
They don't have to hide.

598
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:25.370
It's just like they do it because they have to hide or do you think maybe they

599
00:35:25.371 --> 00:35:28.310
do it because we can't handle it because we can't handle it?

600
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.550
Why would they care if we could handle it or not?
Because here's the problem.

601
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:36.930
When ever any civilization has ever encountered a civilization superior

602
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.380
<v 3>to them,
the results have always been catastrophic.
Every single time.</v>

603
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.770
Every time Europeans have invaded North America.

604
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:49.800
Every time the Spanish visited the Mexicans,

605
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.840
every time that this has happened,
it's been a disaster.
And this is human beings.

606
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.650
If there was something that came down here from another planet was so

607
00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:02.670
unbelievably sophisticated that they could travel through vast distances in

608
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:04.920
space and had insurmountable,

609
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.950
impossible technology that we would look to it for all of our answers.

610
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.970
It would become our new daddy.

611
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.100
It would completely disrupt all of our governments.

612
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:15.570
It would disrupt all of our religions.

613
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:20.190
It would disrupt every single belief system we have and people would fall apart.

614
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.120
They wouldn't know what to do.
Psychologically,
it would be devastating.
Look,

615
00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:26.910
I'm not a doctor,
but I'm not a sack.
I psychologist,

616
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.050
but I know most people would not be able to handle it.
I understand that,

617
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:33.120
but why would they care?
Because that's my whole point.

618
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:34.260
Because why would they care about,

619
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:37.290
cause it would be affecting our culture and they wouldn't care.

620
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.320
But why wouldn't they care?
Well,
why would they care?
We care about animals,
Bro.

621
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:42.600
There's a reasonable,
we have wildlife protection agencies.

622
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.350
We have that because we care about animals and animals don't even know were a

623
00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:49.770
thing.
If you're a deer living in the forest,
you're two years old.

624
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.270
You might not have ever even seen a person.

625
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:52.500
You don't even know what the fuck we are,

626
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.420
but we're trying to keep those deer alive.

627
00:36:54.421 --> 00:36:57.300
We spend billions of dollars every year protecting them.

628
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.700
We do that because we care about wildlife.

629
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.830
If we cared about a rare monkey that we found in Indonesia,
in the forest,

630
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:05.670
I'm strange monkey.

631
00:37:05.671 --> 00:37:09.750
We would do whatever we could to make sure that that monkeys populations
thrived.

632
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.560
If there was a way to help them.
I mean,
that's one of the reasons why zoos exist.

633
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:16.310
They take rare animals,
they try to breed them in captivity,

634
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.080
but we're also sharing the same earth.

635
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.310
Well then maybe they look at the universe that way and maybe look at,
okay,

636
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.050
nuclear civilizations like our civilization,

637
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.180
I mean our civilizations a very dangerous one because we're a bunch of semi

638
00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:34.280
hairless monkeys with nuclear weapons.
I mean,
we're fucking nuts,
bro.
Oh yeah.

639
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.520
We're obsessed with sex,

640
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:39.450
with jack off to our phones where we're taking pills to keep our dick hard.

641
00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:42.880
We're all on speed mean we all have ab.

642
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.320
These are we're at and we lie.
We lie about shit.

643
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:48.840
We lie about things that people did to us.

644
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.180
We pretend people think did worse things.

645
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.260
We pretend that we didn't do things to people.
We lie about stealing,

646
00:37:55.261 --> 00:37:58.830
we lie about money,
we lie about all kinds of things.
I mean people are so,

647
00:37:58.831 --> 00:37:59.940
so you're thinking,

648
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.900
you're thinking aliens are thinking about all that before they come down.

649
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.660
Of course they would.
Why wouldn't I?
Why wouldn't,

650
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.140
I guess I'm coming from a human point of view where we don't give a shit about

651
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:13.080
anything and there's a thing that's not true.
We do give a shit about things.

652
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:14.850
That's why when you go to the Galapagos Islands,

653
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.530
you're not allowed to take your shoes,

654
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.070
but you walked around Los Angeles and walk around the Galapagos Island because

655
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:24.210
people have done that and they've gotten seeds from their shoes stuck in the

656
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:25.860
sand over there and the ground over there.

657
00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:28.050
And then new plants grow that are invasive species.

658
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.630
They were worried about ecosystems that we really are.
That's why I humans,

659
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.010
that's where we're worried about invasive species.
When new

660
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.260
<v 0>species get introduced to new ecosystems,</v>

661
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:41.590
it's like we were just talking about this yesterday,
a everglades,

662
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.780
my people are doing whatever the fuck they can to get the pythons and the

663
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:47.614
African hoons.

664
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:52.120
These assholes have released pythons and there's a real fucking redneck Jurassic

665
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:55.120
park going on in the middle of Florida.
Yeah.
You know,
we care.

666
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.210
I lived in Miami man,
and at the time I lived in Miami.

667
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.220
Talk about like you did radio out there,
right?
Yeah.

668
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.190
Why 100 miles after fear factor after fear factors.

669
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.120
It lay into me that big gig after it was after I was off for your back there.

670
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.800
Well,
radio was radio back though.
Oh yeah,
it's real.
It was,
it was like huge man.

671
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.310
Uh,

672
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:17.310
but I remember they had these lakes and if you go back like 10 years ago and

673
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:18.514
look up Florida,

674
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.000
people were just jogging around lakes getting snatched by alligators,

675
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:26.470
like just alligators did not give a damn that it would just snatch and people

676
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.750
and I was like,
why are people jogging?
Like

677
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.100
really?
I like stopped jogging.
Well definitely don't jog near the water.
No.

678
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.120
And that's the thing.

679
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.350
I believe like eight people within six months got snatched.

680
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:45.970
Just jogging my real oh,
100%.
Probably about eight to 10 years ago.

681
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.900
Just jogging.
I didn't know that,
that there was that many deaths ever from Alec.

682
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.310
Oh yeah.
They were getting snatched.

683
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.320
One of my favorite ones was a guy who was running from the cops near Miami and

684
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:01.150
uh,
he was in a stolen car,
parked his car on a bridge,

685
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.060
jumped off the bridge and landed on an alligator.

686
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.470
Alligator jacked him in front of the cops and they were just sitting there
going,

687
00:40:09.471 --> 00:40:12.580
oh,
well there you go.
Guilty.

688
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.630
Imagine jumps off the bridge,
splash.

689
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.400
[inaudible] that would be this.
Oh my God,

690
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.060
Dude.
Oh,
that guy didn't even notice.
No last minute.
No,
that's what I'm saying.

691
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.180
Like that happens in Florida at that time.
That is so crazy.

692
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:31.570
That is such a big thing that eats deer and shit.
Look at,

693
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:35.800
it opens its mouth on him.
Let me,
it tries to get away from people.
Well,

694
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:40.420
what's interesting to do,
didn't even speed up like I'm just going off.

695
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.313
Probably really tired.

696
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:46.960
He was an for a while to fuck these things,
man.
Fuck these things.

697
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.710
But the craziest thing is when we were showing it yesterday that pythons eat

698
00:40:50.711 --> 00:40:55.630
them alligators,
whole Jude one,

699
00:40:55.631 --> 00:41:00.280
python eight this fucking big ass alligator and it blew its body apart.

700
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.850
Apparently another aligator came along while it had it in its body and tried to

701
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:04.750
eat the python.

702
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.520
And so then it was like this disaster of a python with an alligator inside of it

703
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:11.610
with no head.
Oh yeah man.

704
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.110
But the whole thing was that this python at eight the alligator,

705
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:14.741
and then once they eat it,

706
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:17.680
they can't move because they got a fucking 900 pound alligator.

707
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:20.380
But she loved that Shit.
I can't take it out.
I know you do.

708
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.390
You do have a problem with,
um,
I just,
I get some animals eating other animals.

709
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:28.360
Like I think it's important to recognize that we're,
we're,

710
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.860
we're very insulated from what the fuck is going on by cities and that in houses

711
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:33.980
and

712
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.600
<v 3>cities and even towns,
even if you have a town,</v>

713
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:39.230
it's rare that a fucking wild Predator makes its way into your town.
But man,

714
00:41:39.231 --> 00:41:42.620
that's the whole rest of the world.
That's the whole world,
including the ocean.

715
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.910
Everywhere is all just predators and prey.
Predators and prey.
Predators and prey.

716
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.640
We figured out a way to insult,
but,
but in insulation,

717
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:51.980
the problem is when we're isolated from it,

718
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:56.930
we neglected as an aspect of nature.
We,
we put it in some weird boggling,

719
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.890
oh my God,
this is weird.
No,
that's not weird.
That's normal.
That's normal life.

720
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.680
Normal life is big things.
Eating little things and you don't respect it.
Got It.

721
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.980
Really don't respect it when you don't see it.
Like,

722
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:11.360
my parents want to go to Africa on a safari.
I'm like,
man,
you can have that.
Yeah,

723
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:15.050
I would go if I got one of them like Jurassic Park mobiles that they have with

724
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:19.000
the tall
roll around on the face.

725
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.340
We can you see that you see these people who are just in regular jeeps,

726
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.470
jeeps where alliance just walking around.
I was like,
how dumb are you?

727
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.350
And most of the time nothing happens.
No most,
most of it.

728
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:35.060
But it could be one or two times where if you're in it until years ago,

729
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:36.830
a woman who worked on game of Thrones,

730
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.750
she was there on vacation and she got pulled out of her fucking cuss.
Right?

731
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.130
She rolled down the window to take a picture and the cat came and snatched her

732
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:46.400
out of the car.
But don't you think people kind of like that deserve it?

733
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.280
Like people that roll down windows and not safer?

734
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.370
Like that's like people jumping in the pit at the zoo the other day.

735
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.750
Well the a Selfie,
the roll down the windows thing I think is really just,

736
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.290
it's what we're talking about that you're not around it enough so you don't

737
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:03.050
understand what it is.
But do you have to be around it to know it?
Hey,

738
00:43:03.051 --> 00:43:05.040
these are wild animals and things.

739
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.760
They can get away with shit if they've never had anything happen to them.

740
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.820
Like if they've never been punched.
Oh,
this is,
this is a cheetah.

741
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.590
Cheetah's are actually not.

742
00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.980
They're actually very curious and then not dangerous to people.

743
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:20.210
So this dude has no idea this thing is in his backseat.
No,
he's filming it.
Oh,

744
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.580
he's filming it.
That's why he's not moving.
I think so man.

745
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.450
I think the move is don't move.
You don't want to scare them.

746
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.160
You definitely don't want to go,
hey man,
I'm fucked.
Fuck you.

747
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.790
Don't want to do that and have a fucking rip your face off.

748
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.720
They don't have flaws.
They don't have claws like a cat does.

749
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:41.570
They're more like a dog.
Yeah.
You know,
there are a weird animal.

750
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.100
They're like a weird cat dog thing.
You know,
there's super,
super fast.

751
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.290
Like I've never seen one run in real life,

752
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:51.080
but apparently people who I know that I've seen it say,

753
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:55.100
you can't believe how fast it is.
You know,
one thing that blew me away,

754
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:56.030
I was reading about it,

755
00:43:56.031 --> 00:44:00.350
that hippopotamuses kill more people a year than all the animals combined.

756
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.300
All of them all love them.
Yeah.
All of them.

757
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.590
And it's just like people just like don't respect hippopotamus is,

758
00:44:05.591 --> 00:44:10.070
and they're fast and they're strong and they'll rip you apart.

759
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.910
They're like a giant pig.
Yeah.

760
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:16.970
During the pig family cousin to a pig or some shit.
And they're vegetarians.
Yeah.

761
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.130
Like they're just killing people.
Estimated 500 people per year.
And that guy,

762
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:26.270
they killed 500 a year.
They're aggressive and they're very sharp teeth.

763
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.740
And not only that man,
people think there's a 750 kilograms.
What?

764
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.070
What is that dude

765
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.900
<v 0>pizza that in pounds.
That's more than 5,000 pounds.
Yeah,
2.2 times that.
So.</v>

766
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.300
Oh my God,
that's,
that's,
well,

767
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:42.180
people don't respect because they think they're slow to,
so when they see them,

768
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.300
I think they run like 24 25 miles per hour.

769
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:49.230
Wear like a a hundred a person that runs a hundred yard dash in the Olympics,

770
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.050
I think average around like 29 to 30 miles per hour.

771
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.080
No hippos.
Oh,
19 miles.
So that's still fast.
Yeah.
You're barely getting away.

772
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.160
Well that's me.
I probably can't run 90 miles an hour.
I know I could.

773
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.440
I'll probably get eaten.
Fuck.
Can you imagine?

774
00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:06.750
You're like 20 yards away from this thing and you're like,
ah,

775
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:09.680
it's not going to be,
and then it just runs up on you.
Well,
they save you.

776
00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:12.390
You ever get chased by an alligator too?
The thing is to Juke them,

777
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:17.240
go left and go right.
I know that pictures terrifying me.

778
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.440
Scares the shit out of me.
That scares the shit out of me.
I mean,

779
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:24.330
look at that guy.
He's,
he's,
he's,

780
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:29.110
he's launching himself in the air trying to get away from,
look at that.

781
00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.240
Yeah.
They chase after boats in the water.
They swim fast.
Yeah.

782
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:36.930
They're trying to fuck you up,
man.
That tried to fuck you.
500 people a year,
dude.

783
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.390
Hippos husband sees hippo bite out wife's heart whites.

784
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.380
Oh my God.
Oh my God,
he mad.

785
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:49.080
You wife falls into the water and that you see the hippo rip open the rib cage.

786
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.050
Ah,
I would be a hippo punisher.

787
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.100
I would go back to Africa every year and kill it.
Every one,
every one of them.

788
00:45:56.101 --> 00:45:59.700
I'd be responsible for hippo extinction.
They'd be like,
you can't do that.

789
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:03.480
I'm like,
but I'm going to
stop me.

790
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.640
I'm killing all the hippos.
Why not?

791
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.890
I'm killing all the snakes for if everybody and anyone knew got killed the first

792
00:46:10.891 --> 00:46:13.560
day that something gets killed by a fucking python in Florida.

793
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:14.850
When a human gets jacked,

794
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.120
we should send in the marines just as go through the fucking swamp and killed

795
00:46:20.121 --> 00:46:22.050
them all.
Just like they're the enemy.

796
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.820
You just get a giant line of human beings go through and kill those fucking

797
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:31.680
serpents.
They're in the Bible.
Okay.
During the Bible,
snakes elite,

798
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:36.390
your baby,
they will go through them all.
I mean,

799
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:40.380
are those get cocky with monsters living in your fucking neighborhood?

800
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:43.230
Is there any purpose of them though?
Yeah,
they kill rats,

801
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.220
but the problem is in that area,
it's not established for them.

802
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:50.850
So there was this rich ecosystem of mammals and reptiles talking about

803
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:51.684
everglades right now.

804
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.770
It used to be there was some snakes like cotton mouth and stuff like that and

805
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:57.000
there was alligators,

806
00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:01.080
but then there was like marsh hairs and raccoons and skunks.

807
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:05.490
God,
they're all gone.
This is gone.
There's nothing left.

808
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:10.850
There's just anacondas then pythons and Nile crocodiles.

809
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.440
Now if this guy,
that's another one eating a fucking,
well,

810
00:47:13.441 --> 00:47:15.570
let me ask you this alligator and be honest with me.
If,

811
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.400
if that guy got eaten like a guy that actually tracks it was reptiles.

812
00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:24.030
Do you feel sorry for like if you putting yourself in harm's way?
Yeah,

813
00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:28.380
because I want that guy to be out there to kill those goddamn monsters.

814
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.060
If you ever look into an eye of a snake and you go,
oh,

815
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:34.450
this thing doesn't give a fuck about anybody.
It's like it doesn't.

816
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.320
I was watching this video of a crab and it's a crowd,

817
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.780
a mother crab to sitting there eating its babies.

818
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:45.460
It had like thousands of babies all around it that had just hatched like a

819
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.860
couple of weeks ago and it's just sitting there eating it's babies and I'm like,

820
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:49.830
yeah,
yeah,
fuck you.
No,

821
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.350
you're going in the boiling water and I'm going to crack you open.

822
00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.010
I heard him scream when they go into a cream.
Oh yeah.

823
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.390
I don't think they're really screaming.

824
00:47:58.391 --> 00:48:02.940
I think it's probably air escaping their body.
Look at this.
Can you look at her?

825
00:48:02.941 --> 00:48:05.890
She's eating her kids.
This is crazy.
I was,

826
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.670
I was at a friend's house and they caught crabs and they were throwing it and I

827
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:13.240
think they scream,
man.
I think it's like,
no,
I really didn't have vocal cords.

828
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.770
This is a,
what does,
this is video Jamie for people to just listen.

829
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.430
It says a monster.
Red Crab eats babies.
The dark side of nature.
Yeah,

830
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.240
she's an asshole.
They scream,
they make a noise.

831
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:29.530
When you put them in a hot boiling pot of water,
what is the bottom of her?

832
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.900
She's just got a charcoal briquette stuck under her.

833
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:37.120
Doesn't that look so like one of them,
when a baby's hand from the Gaelic Games,

834
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:41.500
they come right back out.
So gross.
She's such an asshole.

835
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.840
She was sitting there eating their kids like that.

836
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:47.210
Anybody would give a fuck about crabs.
Oh well I,

837
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.820
it's not going to want them to go extinct,

838
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:54.090
but that's one animal that we in our house kill ourselves and no one has a

839
00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:55.931
problem with it.

840
00:48:55.931 --> 00:48:58.570
It's like if they brought home a rabbit and you gotta to throw it in the water,

841
00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:01.430
like fatal attraction.
If like that was the only way to keep,

842
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.600
nobody would eat ram.
No,
no,
no,
no.
And we throw them in like a lie,

843
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.010
a lie.
I'm telling you,

844
00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:10.960
they're in the water that most of the time,

845
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.530
most people don't even bother taking off the lobsters.
Lobsters,

846
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:16.480
we do not give a shit about apps.
You

847
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.730
get in there,
get in here.
You fucking bug

848
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.760
was crazy is uh,
the whole,
this whole animal kingdom thing.

849
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:31.120
But one thing that scares me that you were doing when I walked in his playing

850
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:34.210
these fucking shooter games to that game is a real problem.

851
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:37.640
Jamie and I have been going to war for the last what,

852
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.360
two months and this died like two months ago.
Yeah.

853
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:46.780
Maybe I'm in full blown addiction mode now.
What is the threat like?
Aye.

854
00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.890
Aye.
What's the thrill?
Yes.
Do you see us?
We're all sweating and adrenaline.

855
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.500
You guys know about great ass time.
I walked in,

856
00:49:53.501 --> 00:49:55.740
it looked like I just finished working out.
It was like crazy.

857
00:49:55.741 --> 00:49:59.140
Amy and I were going to war.
We go to war.
We talk a lot of shit too.
We go to war.

858
00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:05.500
I tried.
It's fun.
It's fun.
We kills me.

859
00:50:05.501 --> 00:50:09.100
Talk Shit to me.
It's rough.
You're like,
God damn it.
He got me fuckers.

860
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:12.310
Is that a game where people can go online and play with you to,
no,

861
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:16.300
we don't have people.
We jump on line.
This is the game.
This is it.

862
00:50:16.301 --> 00:50:19.120
This is the game.
Yeah,
dude,
it is a fun ass fucking game.

863
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:23.080
It's called quake champions and people right now listening and going,

864
00:50:23.081 --> 00:50:27.020
God damn it.
He's talking about it that way again.
But me and Jamie had been,
um,

865
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.410
and and Jeff are there.
Employee had been playing this.
Fucking,

866
00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:34.310
see this isn't bad because they're like characters.

867
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:38.990
Like I was playing one where it's like human beings and when you shoot somebody,

868
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.180
like I got scared when you get scared to go into the next room because you're

869
00:50:43.181 --> 00:50:47.630
really that nervous,
like it's freaks me out.
These shooter games,
a too realistic,

870
00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:50.030
I grew up with frogger dude.
This is like,

871
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.920
you're always in like some sort of a castle and the people that you're shooting

872
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:56.750
against,
they don't look anything like a person.

873
00:50:56.751 --> 00:50:58.400
They look like some kind of a cartoon character.

874
00:50:58.401 --> 00:51:00.590
But the graphics are sensational.

875
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.710
But more importantly like the game play is very precise.
And um,

876
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.470
you,
you have to have like real hand eye coordination and skills.

877
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.280
Like you learn things like tactics,
you learn how to move around maps,

878
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.700
you learn how to control resources.
Controlling resources is giant.

879
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:21.140
Like that thing that guy just picked up that's like 175 health and you want to

880
00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:23.060
get all the armor that you possibly can.

881
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:26.510
Then you also want to be like clever about weapons choices cause you're always

882
00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:30.250
engaging at different distances.
Different kinds of fights you like.

883
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:34.130
Sometimes you're stuck in like a car door and sometimes you know you're,

884
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:37.400
you're in an area where they can't shoot you,

885
00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:40.190
but you can shoot them if you use the right weapon.
Man,

886
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.040
you need to bring it back to old school.
A,
that one red button that I ran,

887
00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.810
that one red button did everything on the joystick.

888
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.530
You never killed a guy with a rail gun.
Once you kill a guy with a real gun,

889
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:55.970
you'll understand.
I don't want to kill a guy with a real person.
Yeah,

890
00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.410
he's laughing while you do it.

891
00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:03.280
If he jumps at me and I shoot him in there with a rail gun,
we both laugh.

892
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:08.090
Like he shot me in the face the other day with a rocket and I was like,
dude,

893
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:12.020
in the Mug,
I was like in the Mug,
like right in my face and I exploded.

894
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:16.610
Like my whole spring just becomes a big red splatter.
I'm like,
fuck,
it's fun.

895
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.450
I can't handle it,
man.
It's too much for me.
I'm a Wa the older I get,

896
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:24.830
I'm just a puss man.
I need to man.
Up.
I used to be so aggressive.
Big Dude,

897
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:27.920
you're strong.
That's why nobody messes with me.
Oh,
so they leave you alone.

898
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:32.210
That's mostly because of it.
No,
it's like,
it's like,
um,
like you,

899
00:52:32.211 --> 00:52:35.210
you like fight and all that stuff.
Like I can't even,

900
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.740
like if somebody punched me in the face today,
I don't know.
How would react?
Like,

901
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.460
I don't know.
I used to be a bouncer at clubs.
I played college football.

902
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.520
Like I was a tough dude.
Now African apart to can to get you to the gym.
No,

903
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.980
no,
no,
no.
I'm in shape.
But I mean like a fight gym.
No.
No.

904
00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:55.580
Why no notified a little bit?
No,
not to fight people.

905
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.360
Well why do you so you don't worry about it?
I never worry about it.
Okay,

906
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:00.171
well then don't worry about it.

907
00:53:00.171 --> 00:53:04.850
Cause I'm at home at eight 30 sleeping by nine night.
Stand up.
I know.

908
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:07.730
I saw you at the Improv the other night.
Nobody's gonna jump on stage.

909
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.350
I'm talking about family.
Amen.

910
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.860
You never know people crazy cause anyone to dude jumped up on the WWF and a

911
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:18.080
attached to who did he attacked?
He attacked bread hiring.
It's like speech.

912
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:22.550
That's crazy.
But it's gotta be like,
how old is he now?
A stroke survivor.

913
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.190
So fucked up.
And the guy tackled him.
Jesus.
But Joe,

914
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.850
<v 3>seriously,
you think anybody's gonna jump on stage when you were on you?</v>

915
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.590
Some dude could easily,
you would fucking kill them.
No,

916
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.410
there's a lot of people that can kill me.

917
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.440
You don't get confused that I know a lot of us here all the time.

918
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.480
I get that.
But like I,
I,

919
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.940
I just don't see me doing stand up talking about family and love and a dude

920
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:49.470
because I hate family and love.
I'm a jump up now that it's not rational.
Right?

921
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:51.870
A rational person wouldn't do that,

922
00:53:51.871 --> 00:53:54.360
but you're not worried about rational people anyway.
Okay.
So,

923
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:57.810
so say I started to go to a fight gym.
Like where would I start at?

924
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.770
Like what would I do?
I would say you should try Jujitsu cause it's fun,

925
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.210
it's really good exercise and you'll learn some stuff.
You learn how to do it.

926
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.990
It's a technique based art.
Whereas like say if,
um,

927
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.510
if you like,
there's,
there's guys that I will uh,

928
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.080
do Jujitsu spa and we call rolling.
Okay.

929
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.450
There's guys that I will roll with that are weaker than me,

930
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.380
smaller than me and tapped me every time I wrote with them and I'm a black belt.

931
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.420
Okay.
That's reality.
Like if there's,

932
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.870
there's guys out there that 150 pounds that I could roll with that I know will

933
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:31.470
tap me virtually every time we roll because their technique is sharper.

934
00:54:31.471 --> 00:54:34.980
They train more often than I am.
They're more focused.
They're more in the groove.

935
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.860
But I also heard you say one of your podcasts,

936
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:40.770
you've got to watch out who you train with because they might just try to hurt

937
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:42.360
you.
That's true.
I need,
I need,

938
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:45.690
you got to go to a good school with good ethics because a good school with good

939
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:47.340
ethics.
They get rid of those guys.
Did you know,

940
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.110
do you know when in studio city I'll do it.
Sure.
I'll get you,
I'll do it.

941
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.990
I want to learn.
There's a good spot,
just a little further than that and Tarzana.

942
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.920
Okay.
Machado's where I got my black belt.
So John Jacques Machado.

943
00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:00.720
I trained there sometimes and um,

944
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.260
he used to have a place in Malibu but closed down because of the fires.
Um,

945
00:55:04.261 --> 00:55:07.140
but they um,
they have an outstanding gym.

946
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:10.050
It's like one of the best in the country and it's in that area,

947
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:12.890
like as far as teaching top notch like,

948
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.500
but there's a lot of really good Jujitsu schools now.

949
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.250
It's not like I'm like when I started in 96,

950
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.140
it was hard to find a good gym.

951
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:25.440
There was only like five of them in all of California.
Right.

952
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.450
Or because it was just starting out.

953
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:31.920
It's like 93 is when Jujitsu sort of emerged in the public consciousness because

954
00:55:31.921 --> 00:55:34.890
of the UFC.
And then there's the gym started like popping up,
popping up.

955
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:36.780
But I was really lucky.
There was like Hixon Gracie's,

956
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:40.470
which is where I took my first class and then Carlson Gracie's,

957
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:42.750
I thought they were like the same and the other one was closer.

958
00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:45.420
So I just switched to Carlson's.
I didn't know shit.
You know,
it was a white belt,

959
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:49.020
but,
and then there was a Machado's and then like a couple other places.

960
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:53.190
How long does it take you to get to a black belt?
Like for you?
Some guy,

961
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:55.620
it took me a long time.
I was a brown belt for eight years,

962
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.050
but it was just because I wasn't training as much as I should have.
Like they,

963
00:55:59.051 --> 00:56:02.700
you don't,
they don't give them away.
Like you have to be a real black belt.

964
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:03.340
But there's,

965
00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.320
who decides what is somebody just watched instructors and you do know,

966
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:12.180
everyone knows.
It's like,
like,
you know when a guy is fucking killing,
like,

967
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:16.950
like he,
let's take like Theo Vaughan for example,
like Theo,
I love him.

968
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.930
He hit a groove sometime ago,
whether it's two years ago or whatever it was.

969
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.520
And I remember being in the of the store and I was like,
dude,

970
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:29.500
this motherfucker's on fire.
He started hitting that groove.
That where,

971
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:32.590
where you go and sit down,
you want to watch is set,
you know.

972
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.250
And I think when that happens in Jujitsu,
it's the same kind of thing.

973
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:40.450
Guys started talking about like,
dude,
Mike has been tapping everybody good.

974
00:56:40.451 --> 00:56:43.660
He's just his,
his Jujitsu so sharp and you're like,
man,

975
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:44.494
I'm gonna Watch them roll.

976
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.740
And then you watch her Molly like dude that pass the guard pass and then got to

977
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:51.280
start asking like how often you train and I'm going five days a week now.
Really?

978
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:51.510
Yeah.

979
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:56.510
I'm taking two privates pluck and then you know like this guy is on the quest

980
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.970
and you'll see a guy go from white belt to black belt in three years but they

981
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:05.740
have to be super exceptional,
like really unusual athletes.

982
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.530
Unusual mindset,
unusual discipline.

983
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.570
It can happen most of the time like oh a garden variety estimate is like 10

984
00:57:13.571 --> 00:57:17.350
years is realistic.
White belt to black belt for a regular person.

985
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.340
If you really train hard and you really dedicate yourself but freaks can get

986
00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:22.690
there quicker.
Like Bj Penn,

987
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.540
he wanted the moon Dealz which is the world championships.

988
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:29.050
After three years of training,
three years of training,
he was a black belt one.

989
00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:32.320
The world child be doing that to Bj's a special guy though.

990
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.660
He's also got legs that are like arms.

991
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.010
He has leg dexterity like no one on the planet.
I got a chicken legs.

992
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.010
That's actually good.
Is it really?
Yeah.

993
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:46.750
You could cinch up triangles on people with chicken legs.
Yeah,
for real.

994
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.910
And Darcy up people everywhere.

995
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:53.650
They would just think about it in terms of leverage guys with the longer limbs,

996
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:57.820
like a hydra.
Gracie is a perfect example.
He's a really tall long guy.

997
00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.830
So when the best Jujitsu players ever,

998
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.480
they can do things with those limbs that a shorter person can't do.

999
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.600
In terms of like leverage from joints and stuff like this.

1000
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.420
Like there's advantages to every frame.

1001
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:12.710
Like there's a guy like who some are Paul Horez,

1002
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.720
the famous like tank of a guide five seven 200 plus pounds and just rips guy's

1003
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:23.641
legs apart and he uses this like short style to dive in on people's legs and get

1004
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:26.800
them in a heel hooks and bars and rip their legs.

1005
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:31.890
He's terrifying and that that style heavily favors being built like a little

1006
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.180
tank.
Whereas like that long like you are,
you're a tall long guy,

1007
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:41.980
you would have like good Darce chokes,
good rear nakeds good.

1008
00:58:41.981 --> 00:58:44.590
All good arm bars,
good triangles.

1009
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.200
You would have lengthened leverage with that length.

1010
00:58:47.201 --> 00:58:51.490
Especially with triangles cause long legged guys they can like sometimes a guy

1011
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:53.140
like me with short legs like I'll,

1012
00:58:53.141 --> 00:58:57.550
I'll get my legs crossed and I have to adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by

1013
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:00.910
triangle.
Whereas you might be able to just close it up right there.

1014
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:05.080
So you'll have like more opportunities for triangles because of the length of

1015
00:59:05.081 --> 00:59:08.950
your limbs.
Have you,
would you have ever been at a point in your,

1016
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.950
in your career when you were doing Jujitsu,
where you,

1017
00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.120
how would you have been in the UFC?
Like at your prime?

1018
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:21.070
Like I have no idea.
I have no idea.
I would have had to have gotten way better.

1019
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.710
Like when I was fighting I was just kickboxing.
Yeah,
that was kickboxing.

1020
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:27.320
And first of all,
first it was taekwondo and then went to kickboxing.

1021
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:32.120
And by the time the UFC came around like on the ground,
I was useless.
Okay.

1022
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.900
As a straight white belt,
I would get ripped apart every day.

1023
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:38.690
I would go to the gym and if I,
if I tapped anybody,

1024
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:42.890
like if it was like a week went by and I tapped one guy be like,
Woo,

1025
00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:47.660
I fucking tapped the guy buddy.
There wasn't that many people doing it,
you know.

1026
00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:50.450
So I was going with like,
there was a couple of white belts may be,

1027
00:59:50.451 --> 00:59:53.270
and then there was like blue belt and purple belts and Brown belts and those

1028
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:54.550
guys would always tap me.
God.

1029
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.220
And so that's just how went for a long time when you're,
you know,

1030
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:01.870
unless you're some kind of freak like some big ass football player or something

1031
01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:06.080
like super athlete,
you're probably not going to be behold these guys off there.

1032
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.480
They're going to,
they're going to choke you.
And that was it.
True.

1033
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:12.200
You're going to a fight Wesley snipes.
That was way later though,
way later.

1034
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:15.590
That was a brown belt by then and I'd been doing a lot.
I'm for Jude beaten him.

1035
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:17.330
I don't know,

1036
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.380
cause we never did ever deserve real martial artist that was a real martial
arts.

1037
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:22.700
But he doesn't know Jujitsu.

1038
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:26.510
The thing that must've been exciting though for super excited because I was

1039
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:30.470
thinking like I knew that he was a real legitimate martial artists.

1040
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:33.380
Like you throw his kicks and punches and it looks really good.

1041
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.240
Like he really does know his shit,

1042
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.890
but I also know he never fought and there's a big difference between throwing

1043
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:43.100
kicks and I haven't fought in a long time,

1044
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.970
but I probably fought a hundred times.
So like I,
I've been,

1045
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.610
I've felt that nerves,
I know what that's like.

1046
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:53.550
It'll be crazy as fuck to do it again.
That's what I was thinking.
I May,

1047
01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:57.080
it'll probably scare the shit out of me,
but I think I know what to do.

1048
01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.010
I think I know how to like get in there and start fainting started giving some

1049
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:04.300
movement and see how he reacts.
And then the worst case scenarios,

1050
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.970
like I'm like in a scramble,
I'm going to strangle this guy.
Like if this,

1051
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:13.060
if this comes to a scramble because the average person really doesn't know how

1052
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:19.070
helpless they are until the Jujitsu black belt grabs a hold of you and then you

1053
01:01:19.071 --> 01:01:22.430
just go,
oh shit.
Like I'm helpless.

1054
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.360
Because in a fight you really think like you might be able to punch a guy.

1055
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.450
Like maybe if he's friend me and he's swinging at me and I'm swinging at him,

1056
01:01:29.451 --> 01:01:33.210
maybe I hit him first.
You really think that,
but this don't swing in.

1057
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.870
It's at Jujitsu fight.
If,
if,

1058
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.380
if you guys get into some sort of a tussle and that guy grabs you and trips you

1059
01:01:39.381 --> 01:01:40.214
in,
boom,

1060
01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.890
and he's on the ground with his hand on your jacket and knee on your chest,

1061
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.060
you're a dead man.
You're a dead man because there's no lucky shot.

1062
01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:52.760
A jujitsu black belt is just going to close the distance like that evil fucking

1063
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:57.761
crab and he's just going to see your fucking neck and there's no way you're

1064
01:01:58.191 --> 01:02:00.560
going to avoid it and there's no way you're going to survive it.

1065
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.430
You're just not going to.
That's why you don't fight people like you can't fight.

1066
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.790
You can't fight random people on the streets like when you're young.

1067
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:10.240
That was the thing that you could go to bars.
Like I,

1068
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:14.990
I had some friends that like to throw down when I was younger and I wouldn't do

1069
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:16.330
it.
I was watching but good for you.

1070
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.890
Now it's kind of like you got to watch everybody.

1071
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.100
You don't know what kind of training

1072
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.700
<v 0>they're doing.
Like everybody is so educated on and it's so big right now.</v>

1073
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.350
Well some guy fought off a guy in the subway there was attacking with a knife

1074
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:31.710
with some moves that he learned watching the UFC never even trained before.

1075
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.500
He just knew what to do.
Yeah,

1076
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.770
he like knew what to do because he'd seen guys like get the mount and drop

1077
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:41.580
ground and pound.
He'd like knew what to do based on watching it.
Yeah.

1078
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.220
I think is good.
Like when you mentioned,

1079
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:48.570
I think it's good just to learn so you would feel better about yourself in case

1080
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:52.950
danger comes.
Yeah.
You want to be the person that gets to make the decision.

1081
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:54.150
Here's the thing,
right?

1082
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:57.450
If you don't know how to fight and there's some drunk asshole who does know how

1083
01:02:57.451 --> 01:02:58.290
to fight either,

1084
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:00.990
but he might come over and punch you in the face and soccer punch you and he

1085
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:03.420
could hurt you or knock you out in front of your woman.

1086
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.100
You want to be the one who gets to decide.
Yeah.

1087
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.890
If I'm in a situation and some guy and he's like reasonably close to my size and

1088
01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:13.290
he's being an asshole and he's drunk and he gets aggressive with me,

1089
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:17.710
I can decide what to do with him.
Like I can,
it gets,

1090
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.570
I don't want to hurt anybody,
but I'm not gonna let you hurt me.
Yeah,

1091
01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:25.260
and you get to decide like you don't want a hug.
You've ever had.

1092
01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:30.150
We've all seen these seven 11 fucking parking lot fights on youtube or some

1093
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.830
asshole in both of them.
Don't know how to fight,

1094
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:33.720
but one guy might fuck that guy up.

1095
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:36.900
You might kick them in the face while he's down.
You don't want to be that guy.

1096
01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:38.690
Like you don't want to be in that situation.

1097
01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:41.460
It definitely walk away whenever you can.
Always.

1098
01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:45.120
We are so opposite because I've only been in one fight in my life.

1099
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.190
It was in ninth grade playing basketball.
It was against a dude named Matama.

1100
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.220
Like I'll never his name as Matama Drake.

1101
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.520
And I threw one punch and I hit him right in the face and he looks at me and

1102
01:03:58.561 --> 01:03:59.760
goes,
what's up?
And I was,

1103
01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.610
<v 4>no,
we're good.
Oh my God.
You</v>

1104
01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:14.380
<v 0>get away with it.
Oh yeah.
We'd started playing bass.
Thank God.
Like that was it.</v>

1105
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.190
Like literally I hit him as hard as I could.
Okay.

1106
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.320
I could take a shot and it was just like,
what's up?
I was like,
nothing.

1107
01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:25.360
Nothing is up.
So that's the only thing I hit you back.
No.
Wow.
No,

1108
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:29.180
cause I,
uh,
then I started,
you know,
Oh,
you okay.
It's your ball.
Yeah.
That's,
yeah.

1109
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.190
I get it,
man.
Not Try to get you back.
I mean,
and then I,
I was,

1110
01:04:33.191 --> 01:04:37.950
there was a club in Houston named power tools that I used to the gay bar.
No,
no,

1111
01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.970
no,
no.
It wasn't a be right.
Yeah.
It sounds like one that was hardcore gay bars.

1112
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.740
Houston,
the gay bar was called riches at the time,

1113
01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.420
but I worked at power tools and I was a bouncer so that's when I was like 250

1114
01:04:49.421 --> 01:04:53.260
pounds,
you know?
Uh,
you are a lot bigger when I met you.
Oh yeah.

1115
01:04:53.261 --> 01:04:56.830
Cause I played college football for Arkansas,
so I played outside linebacker.

1116
01:04:56.831 --> 01:05:01.030
So I was just stop lifting weights or do you still with a little bit?
No,

1117
01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.640
I'm all cardio now because you know like trainers,

1118
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.460
any trainer I work with since I got a big frame and I'm like what puts some said

1119
01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:10.960
Nah,
I want to stay lean.
Right.
You know,
but it's good for old age too,
man.

1120
01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:15.070
You don't want to have back problems.
I'm 44 years old now.
Yeah,
I'm a crazy dude.

1121
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:16.480
Two time flies.

1122
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.960
51 see what 55 zero in is so scary when you read stories about people just

1123
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:27.210
dropping dead like around her age.
Luke Perry.
That's what I'm saying.

1124
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.990
Mainly my age.
Well they said what?

1125
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.820
What is the danger zone is like 45 to 55 with heart failure.

1126
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:37.720
It's like cray and ah man did I beat my body up.

1127
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.870
I'm running that bitch until the fucking wheels fall off.

1128
01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:46.720
I'm always getting stem cell shots and fucking running hills and lift and
weight.

1129
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.140
I still live heavyweights retarded.
Yeah.
Why don't you should say that word?

1130
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.570
I said it again.
Trying to get that rid of that word out of my vocabulary.

1131
01:05:53.571 --> 01:05:56.140
It just comes out sometimes.
Why?
Why are you still lifting weights?

1132
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.170
Like heavy like that?
Like what is this it do for you?
Well,

1133
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:01.560
it does a bunch of things.
First of all,
if you want to train Jujitsu,

1134
01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:05.470
it's very good to be strong and makes a big difference.
First of all,
for defense,

1135
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.340
especially for defense,
you know like for offense for sure too.

1136
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.460
But really you want to be able to defend.
You don't like defending it.

1137
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:16.230
You have to be strong.
But also you just like be in bigger.
It helps.
Yeah,

1138
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:19.030
I like it.
Yeah.
I like being able to pick up things.

1139
01:06:19.031 --> 01:06:22.030
I like the physical ability of being true.
I liked being in shape too,

1140
01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.220
like being on the run for long distances.

1141
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.500
I like knowing that I can go rounds on the bag,

1142
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.180
like I'll do five hard rounds on the,
so you can run on,
my knees are messed up.

1143
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:32.960
I can't like get on a treadmill and raw.

1144
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:36.250
I can do like I've done the stem and the knee and it's helped out a lot,

1145
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.730
but I'm still that dude that's on,
I'm like on the super fortunate.

1146
01:06:39.731 --> 01:06:42.880
I'm super fortunate about my knee injuries.
I've had knee injuries,
but um,

1147
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.743
my meniscus,

1148
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.200
I only had one meniscus scope on my left knee and it wasn't terrible.

1149
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.790
Like I was back to full 100% function after that.
And my right knee,
it didn't.

1150
01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.520
I have a little baby tear that I've got some stem cell shot into,

1151
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:57.820
but I had both of them reconstructed.
Their ACL were replaced,

1152
01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.410
but I'm no problems.
They work,
they work,
right.
Yeah.
See,
I just need to,

1153
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:07.380
I listened to you and I,
it's like you always taking something and I'm like,
Oh,

1154
01:07:07.381 --> 01:07:11.080
I've got to find out what that is and now I just want to get in better shape.

1155
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.350
I'm in shape,
but I,
it's when you get older it's just like tough.
It is just,

1156
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:19.480
he is writing it down like you have to do it.
Like do you,

1157
01:07:19.481 --> 01:07:23.530
do you keep a daily scan?
Oh Shit.
You have to do it.
No,
I just wake up and go.

1158
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.420
I do have,
I wake up,

1159
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:29.140
I work out like a cardio workout and then I do infrared sauna,

1160
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:31.270
which has changed my life.
Changed Your Life,
right?

1161
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.290
Every morning I infrared sauna for now.
It's the best.

1162
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.960
You sweat all that shit out.
You're like,
you feel great.

1163
01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:42.961
Your skin glistens like I think it's actually like changed the game for me.

1164
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:47.380
I have more energy now.
Everything's better.
It's so good for your body.

1165
01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:52.381
They did a study that showed a 40% decrease in more cow mortality amongst all

1166
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:54.970
causes.
Heart attack,
stroke,
cancer,

1167
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:58.900
40% decrease with people that were doing the sauna four times a week.
Well,

1168
01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:02.800
I will tell you this because the whole thing is everybody wants to feel young

1169
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:05.680
and when you were young,
the thing you did most was sweat.

1170
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:10.240
And I feel like when I sweat it just,
it's a,
it feels,
I don't know,

1171
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.960
I just feel good sweating because it reminds me when I played sports,

1172
01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:16.430
it reminds me even though I'm not doing on the,
you know,

1173
01:08:16.431 --> 01:08:19.190
I sweat a little on the treadmill,
but when I do that infrared,

1174
01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.950
it makes me feel great.
I think it's,

1175
01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:24.110
there's a bunch of shit going on with his dad for sure.

1176
01:08:24.111 --> 01:08:25.840
Like it's good to feel good,
like you're sweating,

1177
01:08:25.841 --> 01:08:27.680
but there's heat shock proteins.

1178
01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:30.320
Your body actually produces anti inflammatory properties.

1179
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:31.520
It's really good for you.

1180
01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.230
It's really good for joint aches and all kinds of like this.

1181
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.800
I used to think of the song as being nonsense.
Like what do you,

1182
01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:39.020
what do you fucking lying in a sauna for?
Like what are you doing there?

1183
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:42.800
Just getting hot scorecard.
What kind of a sauna do you do though?

1184
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.260
I do a regular song.
Okay.
Super Hot.

1185
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:49.210
Regular Sauna telling you you need to try the infrared.
It's,
yeah,
I mean,

1186
01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.310
but look,
it's all just about getting your body,
Huh?
Yeah.

1187
01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.080
Like it's good to try to infrared.
I'm sure.
I'm sure it works great.

1188
01:08:54.081 --> 01:08:58.060
But this study,
the 40% decrease in mortality,
that was with a regular stone saw.

1189
01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:01.490
Okay.
Yeah.
That's why I got a regular sauna cause a doctor,

1190
01:09:01.491 --> 01:09:05.220
Rhonda Patrick told me that um,
the studies that have been done,

1191
01:09:05.221 --> 01:09:08.000
they've all been done with a regular sauna and she said there might be some

1192
01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:11.450
benefit for infrared sauna it,
but I don't know what's published.

1193
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.000
What does it see if there's a benefit,
see if this,

1194
01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:16.850
they could say what's the benefit to infrared cooking my organs?

1195
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:18.530
I don't even know it.
No,
I don't think so.

1196
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:22.670
I think it's great for just feel amazing after that's supposedly what happens,

1197
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:22.781
right.

1198
01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:26.000
It like gets deeper in your tissue or that it's supposed to go deeper inside.

1199
01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.800
I remember us texting back and forth,
I was like,

1200
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:32.570
you gotta like if you do the infrared sauna for like a week,
it's a game changer.

1201
01:09:32.571 --> 01:09:36.470
It's just fun is too.
So I don't know.
I would like you to try regular sauna to,

1202
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:41.500
how hot does the infrared yet a like 140 140 minutes in the air though too.

1203
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:44.240
It's a difference.
It's not,
it doesn't heat the air.

1204
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.540
Like you walk in and it feels,
it doesn't feel like it's that,

1205
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:51.980
but that's just weird.
That's your microwave shit,
none of that,
man.

1206
01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:55.500
It's like hot pockets.
He ain't turn them into a hot pocket again.

1207
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.390
That's what I'm saying.
I probably burning up all my organs right now,

1208
01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:00.560
but I don't know.
I love it.

1209
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.710
I liked coming in and feeling that super heat or you go in there and you're
like,

1210
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:08.450
oh,
it feels so good.
I love it.
Do you fuck with cold?

1211
01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:09.870
Do you ever do like cry or anything like that?

1212
01:10:09.871 --> 01:10:14.210
I tried that once and it was right after the infrared sauna there like try to

1213
01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:17.330
call.
It's just,
I don't know,
man.
It wasn't my thing.

1214
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.760
What do you mean it wasn't my thing?
I didn't like how so?

1215
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.450
Like it was fucking freezing.
No,
I wasn't not your thing.

1216
01:10:23.451 --> 01:10:27.680
It's just I don't want to,
I wouldn't do it.
I don't know.
No,
I love heat,

1217
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:31.670
but the cold thing is like,
Nah,
I'm good.
I'm good on that.
Understand.

1218
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:36.290
You know you love it.
I love it.
I do it too.
I love both of them.

1219
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:38.480
Do you go back to back?
That's what they say you should do.

1220
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.230
I have not gone back to back,
but I've gone and done both of them in a day.

1221
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.780
I like,
I like hot yoga too.
I like hot yoga and then doing the Cryo,

1222
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.760
which they say you shouldn't do because it'll give you a heart attack.
Oh,

1223
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:52.420
doing it hot cold.
Who?
Pussy?
Yeah.

1224
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.370
Who's doing being a man was getting a goddamn heart attack deaf up.

1225
01:10:55.550 --> 01:11:00.380
Who's getting a heart attack from?
Not Us,
not us.
He used to do hot yoga.

1226
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.590
I need to get back into,
I just got to get flexible man.
It's just,

1227
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:07.490
that's the tough thing about getting old and you know,
flexibility,
flexibility.

1228
01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:08.810
Because what they say most,

1229
01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.270
most older people die on the toilet because they can't get up.
You know,
they,

1230
01:11:13.271 --> 01:11:14.010
they have some problem

1231
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.550
<v 1>and they can't get up from wherever they are.
Is that real?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

1232
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:21.750
That's a crazy way to go.
Just on the toilet.
You always imagine like Elvis,

1233
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:27.030
like as you dined,
he'd be like,
Cam,
we know.
I just don't want to die.

1234
01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:31.440
Stupid.
Some stupid like you'll be reading,
uh,
in New York City.

1235
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:34.600
Some guys just walking and something falls on him,
you know,
fraud.
Oh,

1236
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:38.730
were a person.
How about that suicidal person lands on your fucking head?

1237
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.660
I was at Adidas and uh,
the flagship in New York,
Adidas,

1238
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.900
and like five minutes before I got there,
you know,

1239
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:49.290
a person just jumped off and killed themselves right outside the store.

1240
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:52.840
Like out of residents.
Chase.
Yeah.

1241
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.320
It says that's one of the craziest ways to go.

1242
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.730
Like the feeling of regret you must have when you feel the air under your feet

1243
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:04.470
and you're falling.
You can't do nothing.
That's a wrap,
dude.
He made the decision.

1244
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:09.420
You pulled the trigger.
Here comes the great beyond bang.

1245
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.880
What goes through your mind when you're going down like that?

1246
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.160
Like,
and it's your choice.
You know what I mean?

1247
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:21.660
Probably filled with unbelievable terror.
Unbelievable tear.

1248
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.670
Even though it's your choice.
There happened.

1249
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.560
People that have survived jumps into the ocean,

1250
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:30.120
they've jumped off the golden gate bridge all the time.
I mean,

1251
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:33.930
it's like one of the number one suicide spots in the u s but some of them make

1252
01:12:33.931 --> 01:12:36.930
it,
they survive.
That would suck.
Yeah.
Or like,

1253
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.380
if you really wanted to die and you didn't die,
maybe not.

1254
01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:43.380
Maybe you got a new lease on life,
he hit the water and you're like,

1255
01:12:43.381 --> 01:12:48.360
what am I alive?
Fuck.
I never could get myself to that place.

1256
01:12:48.361 --> 01:12:52.020
Like,
I,
I like my life too much right now.
Yeah.
Well,

1257
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:54.840
you're happy and that's an awesome thing.
But you know,

1258
01:12:54.841 --> 01:12:59.430
when we're talking about spectrums,
there's clearly a spectrum of that.

1259
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.700
You know,
and some people I think habit horrifically,

1260
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.390
they just have what a forever,
whatever reason,
chemical inbounds,

1261
01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:10.560
life experiences that are awful,
PTSD,
whatever the formula is,

1262
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.070
they have it to the point where it's almost unbearable.
Every day.
100%,

1263
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:18.860
a hundred percent.
Like my dad,
you know,
he was,
he,
he,
he,
uh,

1264
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.460
served our country in the army and it didn't seem to affect him at all.
But,

1265
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:27.990
uh,
you know,
he has friends that it's affected.
I have friends that have served,

1266
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.640
they're affected by it.
And what was that movie?
It was about being Ghazi.

1267
01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.580
Um,
I forgot John Krasinski did it,

1268
01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:38.820
but I had to interview the real guys that pulled off.

1269
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:43.850
Got The people out of Benghazi in the normal world is so boring to them.

1270
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.960
Like literally they got excited when they talked about,

1271
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:51.330
you know how it feels that bullets whizzing by your head,

1272
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:55.290
you knowing you shooting at people,
like literally the real world is so,

1273
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.230
and that's why they keep going back because that's the only way they can get

1274
01:13:58.231 --> 01:14:02.670
that adrenaline rush,
which is,
you know,
to me I'm like,
that's crazy.

1275
01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:06.780
But to them,
that's where they get their high and that's,
that's a life to them.

1276
01:14:06.781 --> 01:14:07.620
That's how they're living.

1277
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.230
And I interviewed the three or four soldiers that went out there and save these

1278
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:12.064
people.
And

1279
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.830
<v 0>you saw that look in their eye,
you know what I mean?</v>

1280
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:18.190
It was like they would go back now if they could.

1281
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:23.380
And they hated hearing how one of their own lost their lives up there.

1282
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:26.520
You know,
where they were like,
I could've done something about that.

1283
01:14:26.521 --> 01:14:27.970
And that's what they talked about is like,

1284
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.250
why we always want to go back is every time we hear one of our,
um,

1285
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:35.620
one of our fallen soldiers,
they,
they fail.
We could have saved them.

1286
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:39.790
And two of them were snipers and the other two were on the ground and they were

1287
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:42.900
like,
man,
it's just,
it's just real life is,

1288
01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.530
is very tame for us.
You know,
it's almost a,

1289
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.100
I'm putting what now I'm paraphrasing,

1290
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:53.101
but I would say they think it's a bore just living our normal lives and unless

1291
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:56.290
they're fighting for our country and saving people's lives,

1292
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:58.510
like everything else is just boring.
Yeah.
I mean,

1293
01:14:58.511 --> 01:15:00.940
you're talking about literally life being turned up to 10.

1294
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:04.240
There's nothing else that compares to it on the planet or other than being a

1295
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:07.320
police officer.
Can you in a shoot out or,

1296
01:15:07.321 --> 01:15:12.321
or just just imagine like a police officer walking up to a car that's freaky

1297
01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:18.460
enough.
You don't know what's inside the box.
You're playing roulette.

1298
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.880
You don't know what's inside that car.
You know?
Like,
look,

1299
01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.160
there are some bad police out there,

1300
01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:29.080
but as just put yourself in that spot where you're a cop getting out your car,

1301
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:33.790
walking to a car with tinted windows,
knocking on the window,

1302
01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:35.440
you don't know what you're going to,

1303
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:38.410
you don't know if it's a barrel of a shotgun.
You don't have no idea.

1304
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:39.330
You have no idea.

1305
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:43.810
People have to realize that that tension they carry with them all day.

1306
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.040
They might have 20 of those interactions.
Absolutely all day and,
and,

1307
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:51.160
and a couple of could've been really bad for you.
And if you have,

1308
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:55.000
he gives him any bullshit or don't appreciate or respect that they're

1309
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:56.710
immediately going to go,
oh,
okay.
Yeah,

1310
01:15:57.070 --> 01:16:00.250
he fucking asshole and you're the enemy now.
And it's horrible.

1311
01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:05.050
It's horrible that we give a person the kind of power that police officers have

1312
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:05.741
when they abuse it,

1313
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:10.741
but it's also horrible that we create this relationship between fellow citizens

1314
01:16:11.051 --> 01:16:15.610
of pro cop is just a citizen.
It's just one of us where we are the enemy.

1315
01:16:15.611 --> 01:16:18.580
If we're not following the book,
especially when the book is stupid,

1316
01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:20.650
like it's pot laws or something dumb like that.

1317
01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:24.970
Or you're catching guys getting jerked off like Jesus Christ.
You know,

1318
01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:28.300
I've been pulled over a couple of times and I got to say,
you know,
most of them,

1319
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:29.680
like my dad,
you know,

1320
01:16:29.681 --> 01:16:32.100
they say a a black thing to do when you have a black father,

1321
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:36.160
they tell you very early on when a cop pulls you over,
hands out,
let them see it.

1322
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.410
You know,
it's taught to us when we're,

1323
01:16:38.411 --> 01:16:41.740
when we're born and raised and especially where I grew up.
So,
you know,

1324
01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:45.610
I even been profiled and you know,
like I'm half black,
you know,

1325
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:47.410
you don't know what I really am.
A lot of people,

1326
01:16:47.411 --> 01:16:50.680
but I've been profiled so I know when I see,

1327
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:54.070
when I hear the stories and I've been in cars with my friends that are dark

1328
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:58.600
skinned black and they've been pulled over and it's a thing where you're upset

1329
01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:02.590
because you feel like you're being profiled.
But man,
once that cop walks over,

1330
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.400
you need to show all due respect because they,

1331
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:09.950
they control that game.
Now it's 100% their gang.

1332
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.010
<v 3>Once they pull up to your window,
you're in their cart.</v>

1333
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:18.070
We all should think that they are entirely necessary for a civilized aside,

1334
01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.370
100% and if you want to be able to call the police,
if some shit is going down,

1335
01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:24.170
you should appreciate them when they're there.

1336
01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:27.460
And you know this does not discount all the bad cops.
Yeah,

1337
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:30.020
absolutely not discount all the things that we've all seen,

1338
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:32.500
the shootings were unjustified punches or unjustified.

1339
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:37.490
This is what we have to keep though perspective because there's so many

1340
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:38.330
interactions.

1341
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:43.400
There's so many cops out there that are dealing with PTSD all day long because

1342
01:17:43.401 --> 01:17:45.860
for a decade or two decades of their life,

1343
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.990
they have been dealing with crime and violence all day long,
every day.

1344
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.110
And they dress like the enemy.
They're not just a cop,

1345
01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:57.260
they're a cop west of where a cop outfit.
So everywhere you go,

1346
01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:00.860
like when you weren't playing quake and you playing team,
it goes quick.

1347
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:05.780
Dude has a special flag over his head.
You know,
that's a target.
If you see,

1348
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:10.070
if you see cops,
they're like bad guys.
See cops as the enemy.

1349
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:11.780
You're being paid to be the enemy.

1350
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:15.650
Even if you've never had an interaction of you're a bad guy and that's a cop.

1351
01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.610
That's the enemy.
And that is a crazy,
but it's interesting to ask people to be,

1352
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.390
but even for people that don't have interactions with cops a lot,

1353
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.950
they still considered the enemy.
Sure.
Cause if they pull you over for speeding,

1354
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.050
like I,
it's gone through my mind.
It's like nobody's on the road right now.

1355
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.370
Why are you pulling me over for speeding?
I'm not hurting anybody.

1356
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.780
It's just a waste of time.

1357
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.480
Well you're trying to write a ticket because they have to write a certain number

1358
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:39.560
and that's,

1359
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.040
and that's when I think it goes over the top where it's like come on now.

1360
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.710
I was talking to a cop about that.
I said,
okay,
now let me ask you this.

1361
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:49.070
What if everybody agreed to never speed?

1362
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:54.430
Like we made up like a six month agreement in this country where we would never

1363
01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:58.700
speed and no one speed it and there was no more traffic violations in terms of

1364
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:01.250
speeding tickets,
what the fuck would happen.
And he was like,

1365
01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:04.010
people would just get laid off left and right.
They would just quietly,
yeah,

1366
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:04.940
he was just,
they were like,

1367
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:07.520
I think they would just slash so the police department,

1368
01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:10.670
they put quotas on you cause you're a glorified revenue collector.

1369
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.130
I mean that's what those guys,
you think that's a problem though.

1370
01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.600
Like when you're officially people over and I think that it all looks like

1371
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.540
problems with the police and people start from the core.

1372
01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:24.500
And that's a major problem if you have to pull over people,

1373
01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:28.460
even if you're a cop and go,
eh,
they're not really doing anything bad.

1374
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:33.140
But I have to meet my quota of tickets that starts from a very negative place.

1375
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:37.010
Terrible,
terrible place to place.
Terrible place in,
terrible place for,

1376
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.060
for both parties.

1377
01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.600
Terrible place for the cop to bury his head in the sand and realize he's writing

1378
01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:43.520
someone a ticket for no reason.
You know,

1379
01:19:43.521 --> 01:19:46.040
like you catch someone that speed limit 65 they're sick,

1380
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:50.460
they're going 69 you pull them over like kit the fuck really,
how to,

1381
01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:53.540
you can't even pay attention.
Like there's no way,

1382
01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:56.070
unless I'm not looking at the road like it,

1383
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.960
unless I have cruise control or I'm not looking at the road all,

1384
01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:02.180
I might get to 60 9:00 AM I back up to 65 again,

1385
01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:04.610
even if I'm trying to go the speed limit,

1386
01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:07.890
but I know people that have been pulled over four miles over 100% yet,

1387
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.450
<v 1>but as a driver of that car going four miles over,
you're pissed.
Yeah.</v>

1388
01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.140
Like automatically.
Yeah.
You just got jacked in your mind.

1389
01:20:16.141 --> 01:20:19.620
You're protecting and we all know he's writing a ticket just to write a ticket.

1390
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.560
It's probably the 27th or 28th of the month.
Yep.

1391
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.600
And they got to meet their quota and he just put like,

1392
01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:26.940
that's where they are driving to Vegas is the worst.

1393
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:30.120
They set up traps and especially close to the end of the month.
You know,

1394
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:32.700
if you're driving to Vegas,
go to speed limit because we're waiting for you.

1395
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:36.660
I got pulled over by plane.
Oh,
have you seen this?
Go into Vegas.

1396
01:20:36.661 --> 01:20:39.090
They have planes that now radar you.
They don't even,

1397
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.920
and then they send out cop cars.

1398
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:44.310
So to put you on the radar as you and then a cop car pulls you over lay.
Yes.

1399
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.660
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that was the last time we went to Vegas.

1400
01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:53.340
I went with my wife and son and we got pulled like a cop car came out of

1401
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:57.150
nowhere.
And my wife,
here's the difference.

1402
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.590
You know the,
this shows the,
my wife is white from Wyoming.
Right.

1403
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.810
And this is the big difference.
That's real white.

1404
01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:07.740
That that's what it's like pilgrim.
That's like Casper the friendly ghost white.

1405
01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.040
That's like cowboy white.
Right.
My own hands loosen literally.

1406
01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.830
Right.
Cowboys up there.
Wyoming cowboys.
Yeah.
Did you,

1407
01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.820
your wife grew up on a ranch?
No.
Shit.
No,
no,
no.
I think they've cities.
Yeah,
they,

1408
01:21:20.821 --> 01:21:23.190
she's grew up in Gillette,
Gillette,
Wyoming.

1409
01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:28.020
The fuck is that Gillette Wyoming people.
They're 80 I think 3000 no,

1410
01:21:28.021 --> 01:21:32.160
seriously.
They're like the Brady bunch.
I'm married into the Brady plan.
Like,

1411
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:35.700
seriously,
they're real life,
right?
It's like,
good morning,
Michael.
How are you?

1412
01:21:35.701 --> 01:21:38.160
Like they are those peats kind of cool.
No,
it's great.

1413
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:41.070
So a cop pulls us over for this Vegas Strip,

1414
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:42.990
and this is the difference in cultures we have.

1415
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:46.470
And this is why I tried to tell my wife when the cop came over his name,

1416
01:21:46.471 --> 01:21:51.360
let's say officer Andrew,
he comes over,
I'm very polite.
I said,
yes sir,

1417
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.070
you got it.
No problem.
I was speeding.
No problem.
My wife and the cop goes,

1418
01:21:56.071 --> 01:21:59.710
we pulled you over by a plane.
So it gives me a ticket.
I'm like,
hey officer,

1419
01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:01.620
I have a great day.
It's like,
you too,
sir.

1420
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:04.620
My wife is in the backseat when my son rolls down the window,

1421
01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:07.560
when he's walking away and goes,
excuse me,
uh,

1422
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:10.350
how do you know it was this black SUV?

1423
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:15.330
I see lots of black SUV.
It's passing us and it's from a plane.

1424
01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:18.210
Are you serious?
And I'm like,
I'm about to die.

1425
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:22.680
The cop turns back around like comes to my side of the window and says,

1426
01:22:22.681 --> 01:22:24.800
excuse me Ma'am and eh,

1427
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:29.460
but just a privilege to be able to talk to a cop like that cause she has no
idea.

1428
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.450
She has no idea.
That's the real white privilege.
That's the real one.

1429
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:38.010
And I'm like,
and I'm like telling him to tell me about,
I'm telling the cop,

1430
01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:42.180
I'm saying,
hey baby,
it's okay.
I was speeding.
Do you can have this onstage?
No,

1431
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:46.680
you fucking shit dude.
That's hilarious.
And I'm like,

1432
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.700
you should for sure talk about the of stage.
It's,
it's just,

1433
01:22:50.701 --> 01:22:54.120
it scared me because I was scared because she's the cop comes back around.

1434
01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:57.930
Write that down right now.
Okay.
Keep that pad.
Write it down.
Write it down.

1435
01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:02.770
You must talk about this on stage.
Wife,
top wall.

1436
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.490
That shit life.
Kathleen privilege.
Plain

1437
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:10.960
<v 3>radar black.
Yes.
A Wyoming cowboy.</v>

1438
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:15.550
White people.
Okay.
We've got a whole suite.
We've got stang too.

1439
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.130
So shoehorns horseshoe.

1440
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:24.520
He comes back over and he's trying to explain to my wife about a plane and she's

1441
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:28.900
given this cop attitude.
Oh No.
Oh No.
Well,

1442
01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:33.750
we drive off,
I go,
baby,
you cannot do that.
Like you almost killed me.

1443
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:37.090
She was like,
stop being ridiculous.
I'm like,
no,
no,
you really know.

1444
01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:41.500
You really could have got me killed.
You'd never,
never,
no wrong guy.
Wrong place,

1445
01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:46.000
wrong time,
wrong history,
wrong background,
wrong state of mind that he's in.

1446
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:50.170
What if he didn't like a black dude married to a white woman?
For sure.
Yeah.
Like,

1447
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:54.010
and she didn't get that.
But now she gets that because we have a son.

1448
01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:54.971
You know what I mean?

1449
01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:59.830
So I think once you have a multi ethnic son now she's like,
oh,

1450
01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:03.400
I'm all about marijuana.
I'm all about,
she doesn't like,

1451
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:06.260
she's all about the ethnic cartoons and not the white.

1452
01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:11.470
She's trying,
she's trying,
she's got a good mindset.
She's trying to,

1453
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:12.580
in a family's trying,

1454
01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.640
you know sucks that anybody has to ever worry about getting accidentally shot by

1455
01:24:17.711 --> 01:24:18.544
a cop.

1456
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:23.290
And the problem I think is not going to go away until the problem of crime goes

1457
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.120
away.
And that's not going to happen either.

1458
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:28.750
So like what do we do to make life safer for everybody?

1459
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:32.200
That's a real good fucking question.
Well,
I think awareness for sure.

1460
01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:33.940
Like people being aware of all these videos.

1461
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:37.450
That's one thing that I think that black black lives matter did that people

1462
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:41.770
don't want to accept,
but it's really important as it became a national thought.

1463
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.380
Yes.
It's not just another story in the news.

1464
01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:49.381
It's a national thought like this is a movement to try to eradicate this and all

1465
01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:53.980
the times where you've seen guys plant guns on people after they've shot.

1466
01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.960
I'm like the OCC videos.
Yeah.

1467
01:24:55.961 --> 01:25:00.910
You see videos of black people with no guns getting shot and then here's the

1468
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:04.090
problem.
They go to court and then the cops are innocent.

1469
01:25:04.091 --> 01:25:07.220
You see the one where the guy throws the gun down on the ground or was it,

1470
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:09.220
was it a taser?
What did he throw down on the ground?

1471
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.580
There was like he shot him and then as he's coming down to the body,

1472
01:25:12.581 --> 01:25:16.390
he dropped something on the ground when I was growing up,
at least,

1473
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:17.410
I don't know when it changed,

1474
01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:19.720
but cops were supposed to shoot and not to kill you,

1475
01:25:19.721 --> 01:25:23.770
but to handicap you like shoot you in the leg,
shoot you in the arm.

1476
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:25.360
She tests are not that good a shot.

1477
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:28.600
There's a lot of cops that are just not good at shooting guns.

1478
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:31.660
I mean there's a lot of that are military trains that are very professional and

1479
01:25:31.661 --> 01:25:34.570
very serious who are,
but it's like,
look,

1480
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.800
I watched a video the other day of a guy getting in an altercation as off duty

1481
01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:42.880
cop got into an altercation with this guy and he tried to pull his gun out.

1482
01:25:42.881 --> 01:25:45.190
The guy grabbed him,
grabbed his risk.

1483
01:25:45.191 --> 01:25:49.060
I did not know how to fight at all and probably only knew how to like shoot

1484
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:53.050
people.
He gets taken down.
The Guy,
obviously new Jujitsu took,
took them down,

1485
01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:55.030
mounted him,
took the gun from him,

1486
01:25:55.031 --> 01:25:59.500
threw the gun away and beat the fuck out of him from the Mount Pounding Hawk eye

1487
01:25:59.501 --> 01:26:02.680
turns his back,
he gets his back,
he's beating the shit out of them.

1488
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:03.740
It's horrific because

1489
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.040
<v 0>this cop thought he was safe and pulled his gun.</v>

1490
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:10.190
But this isn't like one example of was just because someone's a cop doesn't mean

1491
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:14.080
they're a well trained,
prepared because there are those out there for sure.

1492
01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:17.940
But there were also some slops like I've seen some guys that are there a cop.

1493
01:26:17.941 --> 01:26:22.190
I'm like,
Bro,
you can't run a block.
Fuck are you a cop?

1494
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.421
Yeah.
You know,

1495
01:26:23.421 --> 01:26:26.930
like this is a ridiculous position for you to put yourself in and anybody else.

1496
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:30.830
You're trying to protect your handicapped by Gluttony,
you know?
But,

1497
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.550
but at the same time,
we do need them.
We need need,
need the cops.

1498
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.250
We need them to be more respected and appreciated.

1499
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.070
They're not very respected and appreciated by a lot of people.

1500
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:44.210
I think that's a huge miss service.
What I hate about this conversation,

1501
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:46.880
whatever side they're on,
what the cops are going to pull,

1502
01:26:46.881 --> 01:26:49.820
whatever they want because we've talked negative or not negative.

1503
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:54.680
We said some things about,
and I hate how we're in such a polar place where,
Oh,

1504
01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:57.800
you're either for him or against it and that's like with everything and that's

1505
01:26:57.801 --> 01:26:58.251
what I hate.

1506
01:26:58.251 --> 01:27:02.090
You can't have a conversation anymore and that's where we're at right now.

1507
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:06.620
It's like you can't say anything wrong with cops because then you don't support

1508
01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.460
the cops.
If you support the cops,

1509
01:27:08.461 --> 01:27:10.550
then you'll get attacked by the other side going,

1510
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:13.610
oh well they kill innocent people.
I know.

1511
01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.330
And someone can take your clip of anything that you've said today without

1512
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:21.050
further elaboration,
because most of what you said,
you further elaborate.

1513
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:21.740
Absolutely.

1514
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.940
They could take that one snippet and just put a little clip up somewhere.

1515
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:28.730
Michael Yo said this,
or worse yet quoted.
This is what he said about cops.

1516
01:27:28.731 --> 01:27:31.700
People look,
fuck him.
I thought he was pro cop like this.

1517
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:34.050
Well that's the world we live in today.
Yeah,

1518
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:38.240
this is the world we live in and that's why it's so horrible,
man.
Well,
it isn't.

1519
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:41.300
It's not.
It is like that.
That part is horrible,

1520
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:43.370
but it's the best time to be alive ever.

1521
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:47.060
The best time to be alive in terms of our ability to understand our effect on

1522
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:47.660
each other,

1523
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.900
the best time to be alive in terms of our ability to access information,

1524
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:54.560
the best time for for if something is going on,

1525
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:58.610
you will alert people that this thing like a crime is taking 100% we could

1526
01:27:58.611 --> 01:28:03.200
spread the news of it so quick.
We just have to,
we were just not used to so much.

1527
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:05.990
We're not used to so much that we have to deal with all day and we're not

1528
01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:10.750
designed for so much and it happened in 35 years.
You know,
like,

1529
01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:14.570
like just think about like our parents,
right.
When we were growing up,

1530
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.020
the TV was black and white and then it went color and that was the big thing for

1531
01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:22.880
them.
For us there were no cell phones or Internet.
Yeah.
And then in our,

1532
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.770
in like the last 35 years I'll,

1533
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:28.610
I don't think you'll ever see a technology boom like in this last 35 years.

1534
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:33.790
So many advancements happen so quick and that's why we today can't react to him

1535
01:28:35.601 --> 01:28:37.370
fast enough.
We don't know like,

1536
01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.300
like now parents are doing like parents that are our age are doing the same

1537
01:28:41.301 --> 01:28:42.260
things the kids are doing.

1538
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:46.940
Where my dad never cared about playing a tare or doing anything.

1539
01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:50.990
He had totally different interests where now the kids that are coming up since

1540
01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:52.250
this boom is so fast,

1541
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.690
we're still learning new technology and now our kids are learning it with us and

1542
01:28:56.691 --> 01:28:57.680
there's no separation.

1543
01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.250
I I agree and I think it's definitely like untreaded territory,
but I disagree

1544
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:06.390
<v 3>that that will never see a boom in technology like we've already seen.</v>

1545
01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:09.120
I think we're,
we haven't even scratched the surface really.
Yeah.

1546
01:29:09.121 --> 01:29:10.500
We haven't even scratched when you have,

1547
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:15.501
but I guess I'm saying things that change the world like there was no internet

1548
01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:17.670
Joe do now.

1549
01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:22.671
There isn't that Elon Musk is working on called neuro link and I don't know

1550
01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:26.490
exactly how this works because he wouldn't exactly explain it,

1551
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:31.910
but the concept is about increasing the bandwidth between human brain activity

1552
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.280
and information somehow or another to get information quicker to you and have

1553
01:29:38.401 --> 01:29:41.880
you access it in a quicker manner.
I don't know what the fuck that means.

1554
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:45.360
It's something you wear on your head.
Some dude just tried it.
Jamie.

1555
01:29:45.361 --> 01:29:48.120
There's an article that just,
I just found it.
I'm looking at her.
Yeah.

1556
01:29:48.121 --> 01:29:53.121
Some dude just said I might or might not have tried Elon Musk's neuro link,

1557
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:56.190
like he's kind of like bound by silence,

1558
01:29:56.191 --> 01:30:00.900
but there is a real possibility that think about what,

1559
01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:05.850
here's,
here's how to look at it.
Think about why fi right Wifi is in this room.

1560
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:07.260
We use it.
You can access,

1561
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:10.530
you could shut your phone off and turn your Wifi on and you'd be able to access

1562
01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:13.140
all the information on the Internet,
but where's that coming from?
Where is that?

1563
01:30:13.230 --> 01:30:15.270
It's in the air in the sky.
It's all around us.

1564
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:20.820
If you can wear something that picks up on that in the same,

1565
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:25.080
what picks up on Wifi in the same way it picks up on cellular signals,

1566
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:27.690
whether it's four g or five G,
which is coming out soon,

1567
01:30:27.691 --> 01:30:30.000
which is supposed to be an unstoppable and changeable.

1568
01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.360
If that can feed information directly to your brain through something that you

1569
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:38.580
were just,
the way they do these,

1570
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:43.110
you know they have these electrodes they put on your head and they send magnetic

1571
01:30:43.111 --> 01:30:46.920
pulses.
Different parts of the brain helps people with traumatic brain injuries,

1572
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.900
helps people with depression.

1573
01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.750
They've been able to do this by taking these little things and they stick them

1574
01:30:51.751 --> 01:30:55.140
to your head and they,
they'd send this pulsating magnet in there.

1575
01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:59.880
They can already affect the brain with external stimulation.

1576
01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:01.500
They already know how to do that.

1577
01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:04.830
If they can figure out how to do that in a much more sophisticated way.

1578
01:31:04.831 --> 01:31:09.831
We are on the edge of becoming cyborgs and it's not far away.

1579
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.410
We're talking about within the next decade,
maybe two decades.

1580
01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:18.860
There's Gunna be something that changes a person and makes you like if you are a

1581
01:31:19.051 --> 01:31:23.080
person with a limited education and no phone,
think about how,

1582
01:31:23.081 --> 01:31:28.081
but then think about how little access to the knowledge base you had.

1583
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.280
Now,
if you're a person with the limited access to information and education,

1584
01:31:32.281 --> 01:31:36.270
but you have a phone and that phone is online,
you have everything,

1585
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.340
so that changes everything.

1586
01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:41.850
This person now can access all the knowledge.
I mean,

1587
01:31:41.851 --> 01:31:45.750
it's not perfect if you Google things.
Some of the things are bullshit.
Yeah,

1588
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.910
some articles are dumb.
They don't make sense,

1589
01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:53.150
but you have the possibility of finding all the information is now in the

1590
01:31:53.461 --> 01:31:55.880
future.
I think that as going,

1591
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:59.460
that's going to be escalated and it's going to be escalated exponentially.

1592
01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:03.910
There's going to be some new leaps in technology that happen that guys like you

1593
01:32:03.911 --> 01:32:06.340
and I that don't work in the field.
We're not.
We're going to go see it.

1594
01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:10.210
Common is people who are working on these things right now and they're competing

1595
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:13.240
with people in China and Russia and all over the world that are also working on

1596
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:16.270
these technologies and they're going to get through and they're going to make

1597
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:19.710
something and that's something he's going to change reality as we know it,

1598
01:32:19.711 --> 01:32:23.440
and it's probably right around the corner the same way cell phones and the

1599
01:32:23.441 --> 01:32:26.140
Internet changed our reality as compared to our parents.

1600
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.590
This is going to change it,
but the neuro thing is it I,

1601
01:32:30.591 --> 01:32:34.280
I get that your brain gets it right away,
but I don't know how it works,
but,

1602
01:32:34.281 --> 01:32:35.770
but let's say your brain gets it.

1603
01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:39.160
You put this machine on like this and then it sends it straight to your brain.

1604
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:40.780
What's the difference of that?

1605
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:43.720
Besides quicker than you being on the computer and looking up,

1606
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:46.420
you're still getting the same,
so I don't think that's the case,

1607
01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:48.820
but you're getting the same information.
I think that's how it works.

1608
01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.380
What does this guy say?
This is a April fools joke.
It's an April fool's joke.

1609
01:32:52.381 --> 01:32:55.570
Yeah.
Oh,
what is the title of the Article?

1610
01:32:56.850 --> 01:33:00.850
Let me try a neuro link of the time,
but oh,
really funny.
But let's say,

1611
01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:01.960
and I know you don't know about,

1612
01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:06.010
but let's say you put it on a device in all the information goes through your

1613
01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:09.490
brain,
you're still getting the same information.
Maybe not.

1614
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:12.530
What have you ever seen someone use an Exoskeleton,
you know,
next to nothing.

1615
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:16.150
And what does that exoskeleton is like suit that you put on that's like,

1616
01:33:16.151 --> 01:33:19.720
say if you work in a factory,
it allow you to pick up much heavier things.

1617
01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.930
Like remember the movie aliens,
Sigourney Weaver,
she's fucking up that thing.

1618
01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:24.070
She's inside that robot.

1619
01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:31.960
That's like a giant robotic exoskeleton.

1620
01:33:31.961 --> 01:33:34.960
This is an exoskeleton that they use for people that are paralyzed.

1621
01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.390
It helps them walk.
Okay.
Um,

1622
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:41.560
they also are developing exoskeletons.
Oh,
that's a chair,
Huh?

1623
01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:46.360
That's pretty dope.
Was extra legs.
Oh,
that's pretty dope.
Um,

1624
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:50.950
there's things that help people like that Gout,
right there is not a big person,

1625
01:33:50.951 --> 01:33:55.000
but she can work in a factory and you can carry things that are much heavier

1626
01:33:55.001 --> 01:33:56.880
than what you would ordinarily be able to carry it.
Okay.

1627
01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:00.910
Now they think that as technology moves and improves,

1628
01:34:00.911 --> 01:34:03.550
they're going to get to the point where they develop,

1629
01:34:03.551 --> 01:34:06.820
which essentially like an iron man suit.
That's like an exoskeleton.

1630
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.610
You know the iron man suit,
like when he wears that,
he's invisible.
He can fly,

1631
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:16.910
he can smash things and pick things up and throw things that's going that that

1632
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:20.260
is entirely possible,
that this is going to be our future,

1633
01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.830
that there's going to be suits that we wear that make us impervious.
Look at,

1634
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:24.540
this guy's got one,

1635
01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:28.330
lets them fly around and he's got rockets that come out of his,

1636
01:34:28.331 --> 01:34:32.290
he thinks the government,
whatever approved that for us to get and have a chance.

1637
01:34:32.690 --> 01:34:34.840
It's not whether or not they improve,
approve it.

1638
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:37.940
It doesn't have anything to do with them.
It has to do with the technologist.

1639
01:34:37.941 --> 01:34:39.210
It has to do with the scientists.

1640
01:34:39.211 --> 01:34:41.980
That has to do with the geniuses that are creating these tow these things

1641
01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.370
because they're going to come in waves and these fucking dummies that don't even

1642
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:46.810
understand what Facebook is.
Yeah.

1643
01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.980
These are the same guys are going to stop these people from putting out ironman

1644
01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:53.420
suits.
They're not going to tell them until it's way too late,
too late.

1645
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:54.430
There were,
they're already the one,

1646
01:34:54.431 --> 01:34:57.560
they tell them they're going to make them for sale and they're not going to give

1647
01:34:57.561 --> 01:34:59.810
them the option as to whether or not they're regulate them.

1648
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:00.710
They're just going to get,

1649
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:02.660
they're going to make them for people and then you're gonna have to figure out

1650
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:04.010
the laws once people have them.

1651
01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.340
And then once grandma has one and all of a sudden grandma's playing tennis again

1652
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:10.340
and you tell me grandma can't play tennis because some bad guys want to use an

1653
01:35:10.341 --> 01:35:14.270
Exoskeleton to rob a bank because that shit's gone.
All of it's coming.

1654
01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.150
Bulletproof exoskeleton.
I still,

1655
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:22.180
everything that you've said so far still to me is not bigger than not have an

1656
01:35:22.581 --> 01:35:25.730
internet well being or the attended door,

1657
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.680
but we don't know if that tech not like the thing that you can like talk into

1658
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:32.720
your phone and you could say,
Hey Siri,

1659
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:37.580
when was the constitution formulated?
You know,
Hey Siri,

1660
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:40.490
what was the first draft of the Declaration of independence written on?

1661
01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.310
You can do,
you can ask those questions.
Is Serial Angeles questions.

1662
01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.900
Google search will answer those questions for you.
But what if you just know it?

1663
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:53.150
What if that thought interfaces with your brain in a way where it describes

1664
01:35:53.151 --> 01:35:58.151
things maybe in symbols or direct feed of information through some unfathomable

1665
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:02.420
technology that literally just permeates language.

1666
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:05.750
It's just gets through all that.
If I speak to Jews,
you information,

1667
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:07.100
should I speak to you in a different language,

1668
01:36:07.101 --> 01:36:09.830
it would automatically translated things like that.
That's,

1669
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:12.730
well they already could do that.
You know they have these Google earbuds.
Yeah.

1670
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:15.770
This pixel buds.
I think they're called real.
If that worked,

1671
01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:19.450
would they just get rid of school or at school and be to tell you how to work it

1672
01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:22.790
needs scholars because you would need to know whether or not this,

1673
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.620
this stuff is accurate.

1674
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:28.900
You would need women and men who are educated in this and that's,

1675
01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:31.540
this is one of the reasons why the scientific method so important.

1676
01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.810
One of the reasons why when people shit on like ridiculous things like um,

1677
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:39.740
like grievance studies and a lot of the things that are overcoming universities

1678
01:36:39.741 --> 01:36:40.461
these days,
what you're,
you're,

1679
01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:44.210
you're taking away with your preposterous social justice ideology.

1680
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:47.330
You're taking away from the real pursuit of knowledge and information because

1681
01:36:47.331 --> 01:36:49.220
you want it to match up with your ideology.

1682
01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:54.440
This is a dangerous time to fuck with information because people already pooling

1683
01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:57.320
up in these little echo chambers where they,
you know,

1684
01:36:57.321 --> 01:37:02.200
whether it's a message boards or Twitter groups that you're in and,
and they,

1685
01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:05.450
they feed off of each other and agree on each other with each other all the
time.

1686
01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:08.030
Yeah,
that'd be really careful with information these days.
And also,

1687
01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:08.630
you know what,

1688
01:37:08.630 --> 01:37:12.110
they have to keep scholars to keep the real information because it's just like

1689
01:37:12.111 --> 01:37:15.620
that a one show,
I forgot what it's called,
black something black box,
black,

1690
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:18.440
black mirror.
Like they can change reality.

1691
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:23.270
Like literally like if you don't have scholars to oversee this stuff,

1692
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:26.450
that can be like,
oh,
you know what?
Slavery never happened or this never happened.

1693
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.970
And it would go away because the people born today will never know.

1694
01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:34.190
There's people that to this day will deny the Armenian genocide.

1695
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.870
There's people to this day that denied that or this is a real thing.
Yeah.

1696
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:41.270
There are certain human beings it denied that the w w what's it going to be like

1697
01:37:41.271 --> 01:37:44.150
a hundred years from now?
I mean,
how many of those people will exist then?

1698
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:49.100
There's a lot of those circumstances in life where you have to be really careful

1699
01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:53.570
about what information is,
what's process like we had.
We have to,

1700
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.190
you have to be 100% if you're saying

1701
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:59.850
<v 1>something that is a historical record and you can't fuck with it at all,</v>

1702
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:02.330
but they are now,
but the,
everybody has a history.

1703
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:04.710
That's the reasons why all religions are different.
Right?

1704
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.410
Because everybody has their own little version of history.
I mean,

1705
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:11.790
this is one of the reasons why many different religions have stories of Jesus,

1706
01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:16.110
but they very,
they're very,
yeah.
Yeah.
He's telling the truth.
Well,
I,
I mean it's,

1707
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:17.910
it's thing where,
where,

1708
01:38:17.911 --> 01:38:22.911
what's scary to me about this world today is that misinformation is out there

1709
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:27.630
all the time and people believe it and people just,
people don't read anymore.

1710
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:31.830
They just listened to the bullet point and screamed that out.
Like literally,

1711
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.600
and I don't want to get political or anything,
but,

1712
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:37.980
but I remember when everybody was saying Obama is going to raise taxes and they

1713
01:38:37.981 --> 01:38:41.790
were interviewing people that didn't even make $30,000 say,
oh,

1714
01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:44.930
he's going to raise my taxes.
It's like,
Nah,
he's not even talking about you,

1715
01:38:44.931 --> 01:38:48.000
but you're yelling at a bullet point.
If you would have read the article,

1716
01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:51.330
you would have read,
you are fine.
That's the thing people are in today.

1717
01:38:51.331 --> 01:38:53.730
We want to yell out bullet points.
If Fox News,

1718
01:38:53.731 --> 01:38:56.520
if you watch that and they say this,
you're just yelling at that,

1719
01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:59.430
but you never read.
Like if CNN is your thing,

1720
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.780
you're just yelling what they're saying but you don't read like me,
I watch both.

1721
01:39:03.781 --> 01:39:08.100
I actually read both articles.
I could talk politics all day.
Like,
I think,

1722
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.740
I think there are good things that Republicans do.

1723
01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:13.290
I think there's good things that,
uh,
Democrats,

1724
01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:17.640
I think Democrats right now are in a state where there they fight amongst each

1725
01:39:17.641 --> 01:39:21.390
other.
They're going to crush each other before the election even comes.

1726
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:24.120
It's like Obama set.
It's a circle and fire squad.

1727
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:27.150
They're shooting at each other and,
and here's the thing,

1728
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.230
the good thing about the republican's bad or good,
however you take it,

1729
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.330
if one of them says,
let's go.
They go with Democrats.

1730
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:40.440
It's Ah,
let's talk about it.
I mean,
it's more intelligent way to do it,

1731
01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:42.900
but they don't have each other's back,
I feel as much.

1732
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.560
And that's why their messaging is always off.
That's why Donald Trump,

1733
01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:50.670
Donald Trump could have never been a democrat.
Like if Donald Trump said,

1734
01:39:50.671 --> 01:39:53.910
I want to run for president and been a Democrat,
they theirs,
theirs,

1735
01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:57.960
they would mesh well the Republican's,
it works because,
oh,

1736
01:39:57.961 --> 01:40:01.500
we just want to stay in charge and whatever he says we're going to roll with,

1737
01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:05.160
you know,
George Bush a weapons about let's go,
you know,

1738
01:40:05.161 --> 01:40:08.460
it's just a hundred percent behind it.
Where I think they think that is,

1739
01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:13.170
I want us,
you know,
when I grew up,
I,

1740
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:17.490
I voted for Bush after nine 11.
Right.
Cause I'm from Texas,
you know,

1741
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:20.610
and I think it's the odd a lot.
Uh,
I had a lot of shit

1742
01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:27.210
that,
oh,
we want to pay back in.
It's,
I don't want to say good old boys,

1743
01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:30.880
but it's like,
Hey Rah,
Rah,
let's go.
Yeah.
That's the whole thing.
It's,

1744
01:40:30.881 --> 01:40:34.320
it's more than you remember when the flags are on everybody's car.
Oh yeah.

1745
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:38.790
Oh yeah.
And it was like we were all behind it too.
That was the weirdest.

1746
01:40:38.791 --> 01:40:41.950
I remember I was driving somewhere and uh,

1747
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:47.030
I made a turn on the street near my house and it was a one or two days after

1748
01:40:47.551 --> 01:40:52.551
nine 11 and I never saw more flags on cars in my life.

1749
01:40:53.471 --> 01:40:55.570
It was like the world changed.
Oh.

1750
01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:59.690
Like everybody had a flag on their car and everybody cared about each other and

1751
01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.770
they send that in.

1752
01:41:00.771 --> 01:41:05.380
That's the thing that's sad about the world today is I tell,

1753
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:09.670
I tell everybody,
and I'm not a politician,
but I will say this,

1754
01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:13.090
when you have two different teams that are rivals,
build,

1755
01:41:13.091 --> 01:41:17.530
never come to the same conclusion unless there's tragedy [inaudible] right?

1756
01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:21.080
When that was one of the things that Reagan said once when we was talking about,

1757
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.230
they were meeting with Gorbachev and he said,

1758
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:27.700
I often wonder how we would put our differences aside if we were faced with an

1759
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:29.860
alien threat from another world.
Oh,

1760
01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:33.580
we totally would like the idea that this global conflict that we think about in

1761
01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:35.140
terms of Russia versus United States.

1762
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:38.980
But if there was some fucking aliens coming down here,
war,
a world style,

1763
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:42.400
it would be independence day.
Everybody would join forces everybody.

1764
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:44.170
Cause now you have a common enemy.

1765
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:49.000
And I also believe the way that our country's being run right now,
you know,

1766
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:52.420
Trump is good at making an enemy that he survives off an enemy.

1767
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:56.110
This person's a enemy right now.
Everybody attack.
Now this person's an enemy.

1768
01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:58.420
Everybody attack them.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong,

1769
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.750
I'm just saying that's the way it is.
Yeah.
He just fucks with people.

1770
01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.930
Apparently there's some dude that's his head of secret security or secret

1771
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:08.000
service that he calls dumbo cause dude has big ears.

1772
01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:13.090
He replaced him.
How he fired him.
Dude.
He is.

1773
01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:18.370
He's a fucking wild man and he's probably on speed.
That's what I think.

1774
01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:22.450
But it's crazy man.
Like I'm just watching this and he's hilarious.

1775
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:26.830
If it wasn't the fact that you think that like the moral fiber of our country's

1776
01:42:26.831 --> 01:42:30.760
deteriorating.
Is this the guy who does have big ears big and as massive beers?

1777
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:34.850
Wow.
Well,
well but,

1778
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:38.170
but I know a lot of people have big ears that I like dearly,
but don't you?

1779
01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:42.850
But don't you believe this show,
let's be honest,
if America,

1780
01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.270
like the whole country could look in the mirror when Donald Trump was elected,

1781
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.540
it's a reflection of America.
When he got,
when he got voted,

1782
01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:53.470
it's a reflection of a percentage of us.
No,
no,
no,
no.
But egotistical,

1783
01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:57.200
it's a can of some upside.

1784
01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.150
I don't want to generalize like in terms of like say that's America.
I'm would,

1785
01:43:01.151 --> 01:43:04.600
I would for a joke.
Yeah,
but I mean if you were being serious,

1786
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.760
but I am being serious.
Mobile Den,

1787
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:10.630
why we're there is why was there the women's march where millions of women,

1788
01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:15.130
let me tell you,
let me tell you why.
Because I think Donald Trump,
here's a,

1789
01:43:15.131 --> 01:43:18.520
here's what,
when everybody was depressed down,
Trump was president.
I go,

1790
01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:21.430
you got to look at the positives.
If Hillary was elected,

1791
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:23.980
those women would have never got together to march.

1792
01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:28.330
Donald Trump has brought more people together against him.
More group.

1793
01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:29.261
We were marching.

1794
01:43:29.261 --> 01:43:33.550
Americans were marching for Muslims after Donald Trump became president.

1795
01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:38.700
The positivity that Donald Trump has created with the opposition and the

1796
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:42.910
togetherness.
You had a million women march because Donald Trump was president.

1797
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:46.210
You have people marching for the Muslims.
But because Donald Trump was president,

1798
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:49.660
he's brought for the first time.
I feel like they,

1799
01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.220
the side that opposes Donald Trump,
they're more

1800
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:57.020
<v 0>together than ever.
And even though we say it's ripped the country apart,</v>

1801
01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:59.780
you know,
because you know there's some problems in this country,

1802
01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.260
but it has brought a bunch of people together and I don't think if Hillary was

1803
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:05.840
president,
you wouldn't have had the women march.

1804
01:44:05.841 --> 01:44:07.700
You wouldn't have had the Marshfield Muslims.

1805
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:11.290
You wouldn't have people back in immigrants.
She's just start executing men's.

1806
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.870
She would do,

1807
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:15.800
she'd take them out in the middle of town squares or shooting them first with

1808
01:44:15.801 --> 01:44:19.400
bill.
Bill would be the first one had him on television.

1809
01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.500
Well that was the whole thing.
Like
public execution.

1810
01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:28.740
Yeah.
Just like I ran are just like our allies in Iran.
But yeah,

1811
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.560
but don't,
but don't you think as I ran,
do public executions?
Is it Syria?

1812
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:38.630
Syria does.
Right,
but don't you think like when Hillary didn't stand up to build,

1813
01:44:38.631 --> 01:44:39.560
that's where she lost everybody.

1814
01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.610
It started way before the election because women wanted her to stand up to him

1815
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.500
back then.
He don't know what she did or didn't write it.

1816
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:49.700
We'll just go what she did publicly and publicly.
Why would she do that?

1817
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:53.600
It seems like it's crazy to do.
Like why?
Why are you,
you're,

1818
01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:57.790
you're a dignified person.
You're going to publicly,
well not trash and,

1819
01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:59.090
but you don't have to stand next to him.

1820
01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:04.010
Even Melania Trump bounces on Trump in a,
she's
like,

1821
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.490
she's like,
no,
Killary without bill didn't exist.

1822
01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:12.940
I think that guy was a Dick Slang in bucking ear and he made his way into the

1823
01:45:13.410 --> 01:45:16.820
motherfucking White House and she rode that wave.

1824
01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:21.770
There was a Giant v 12 sucking gasoline,

1825
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:25.130
like it was going on style blowing,
a big wake behind it.

1826
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.420
And she was hanging on to that fucking wakeboard line.
Jesus,

1827
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:35.390
she wasn't Gut Natta Arkansas,
she wasn't getting in the White House.

1828
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:39.380
She wasn't a secretary of state settled down with that nonsense.

1829
01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:41.750
So it's kind of like,
hey,
you know what you got yourself into,

1830
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:44.680
is that what you're saying?
Well,
there's that and there's also,
she's always liar.

1831
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:50.120
Yeah.
Like,
and maybe it's she's a liar because she's a politician,

1832
01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:55.121
but when just you compare what was public like her knowledge of what went wrong

1833
01:45:56.871 --> 01:46:01.490
with the email servers and all that jazz and many other instances too that just

1834
01:46:01.491 --> 01:46:06.491
one we'll talk about and what Komi said when call me was examining the evidence

1835
01:46:06.831 --> 01:46:09.440
and what what they did wrong and what she said they did wrong.

1836
01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.620
They're very different.
They're very different things,
very different things.

1837
01:46:12.621 --> 01:46:14.420
And this is politics,
right?

1838
01:46:14.630 --> 01:46:18.380
If your base hears you say something that isn't true but you say it with

1839
01:46:18.381 --> 01:46:20.840
confidence,
even though the evidence doesn't support it,

1840
01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:25.580
that argument takes place and it blurs the gray area in the middle between guilt

1841
01:46:25.581 --> 01:46:29.960
and innocence.
Do you,
do you think when,
when uh,
somebody gets elected president,

1842
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:34.430
they have a meeting with Elac and then they say these are the things you can go

1843
01:46:34.431 --> 01:46:39.260
after and these are the things you can't because if you go after this we can't

1844
01:46:39.261 --> 01:46:40.100
protect you from it.

1845
01:46:40.130 --> 01:46:42.800
I really believe those conversations happen in the White House.

1846
01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:46.010
Like do you think they,
they say they can't protect yourself?

1847
01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:49.680
I think like I mean after the Jews.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1848
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.770
I'm saying like there's certain organizations like the Rockefellers,

1849
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.510
there's certainly from the Roth child there,

1850
01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.640
certain organizations you talk about the CFR,
no,

1851
01:46:59.641 --> 01:47:01.830
I'm going to say it doesn't let a Bohemian Grove,

1852
01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.540
I just think there's a list of corporations,

1853
01:47:06.541 --> 01:47:09.750
big corporations that run America that they say you can't go after.

1854
01:47:09.751 --> 01:47:11.850
Because a lot of presidents go in there and saying,

1855
01:47:11.851 --> 01:47:13.160
I'm going to do this against this car.

1856
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:16.860
I'm not going to even say the corporation cause I want to live in.

1857
01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:21.300
I feel that secret service really caused these people in the presidents and go,

1858
01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:24.000
Hey,
this is who you can't go after.
Here's who you can't.

1859
01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:26.970
And if you do go after those,
you kind of on your own.

1860
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:29.600
Cause we won't be able to save because they're too powerful.
Well,

1861
01:47:29.601 --> 01:47:34.601
I believe in that giant corporations that have incredible influence on

1862
01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:40.320
politicians because they still reach and spend so much money to keep them in

1863
01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:44.700
power and get them into power and help contribute to the campaigns and then they

1864
01:47:44.701 --> 01:47:48.150
scratch each other's backs.
If the president were to go in and say,

1865
01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.620
I'm going to get rid of all lobbyists,

1866
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:53.340
that president would not make it through his term.
Um,

1867
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:58.320
well it's hard to say that.
No,
it's not.
No,
there's too much money,
Joe.
I mean,

1868
01:47:58.321 --> 01:48:00.240
I don't want too much money.
It's too much money.

1869
01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.310
If I'm gonna agree with you in this day and age,

1870
01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:05.100
it's hard to say that because you'd have to get everybody on board with killing

1871
01:48:05.101 --> 01:48:08.100
a president.
I think they definitely did it with Kennedy.
Oh,
you mean,

1872
01:48:08.101 --> 01:48:10.640
I think if 100% you know,
I was talking to,
uh,
you know,

1873
01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:12.840
do you have to get everybody to Bowers?
No,

1874
01:48:12.841 --> 01:48:15.570
but do you have to get everybody on board?
Yeah.
I mean it just takes,

1875
01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:18.450
get everybody on board or knows about it because otherwise people are going to

1876
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:21.030
tell if you,
if you go and kill the fucking president,

1877
01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:24.000
you have to get a lot of people on board as what we're,

1878
01:48:24.001 --> 01:48:26.550
we're probably going to get raided by the secret service right now.

1879
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.150
But I'm saying if you want to kill president,
it's not like it used to be.

1880
01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:34.730
I think it used to be less consequential.
Not that it was always,

1881
01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:38.280
I mean like John Wilkes booth days,
right?
Yeah.
Easier to kill the president and

1882
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:44.550
then Kennedy ways year to kill a president in 1963 then it has killed president

1883
01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:47.760
2019 could you still do it?
Yeah,
but you're probably going to get caught.

1884
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:51.570
Like you would probably get caught.
It let you would have to have,

1885
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.800
I mean it would have to be all,

1886
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:57.950
you'd have to have a tiny small circle of fucking sociopaths and psychopaths and

1887
01:48:58.291 --> 01:48:59.580
they all agree to keep it hush.

1888
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:02.850
To me it's just one person calling another person saying do this,

1889
01:49:02.851 --> 01:49:06.640
pay him off and then you can get caught.
But one look.

1890
01:49:06.670 --> 01:49:10.350
But you have secret service.
You have a military protecting them.

1891
01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.390
It's different because you'd have to,

1892
01:49:12.391 --> 01:49:17.391
it's a lot of layers to get past all that you know and someone won't have to

1893
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:22.020
make a mistake and mapping like that was one of the things I said about Dealey

1894
01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.400
Plaza and they rolled Kennedy through there.

1895
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.400
Like what fucking security person would ever agree to let someone roll through

1896
01:49:28.901 --> 01:49:31.920
with the convertible with bill the bill down.
Yeah,

1897
01:49:31.921 --> 01:49:33.870
and then also you have to take that long,

1898
01:49:33.871 --> 01:49:38.260
slow turn where you know it's not you just drive by going 50 miles an hour.

1899
01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.910
You've got to get your gun out and shoot them quick.
No,
the guy was driving slow.

1900
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:45.810
It's ridiculous.
It's like you're asking for someone to get assassinated,

1901
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:47.560
but I just,
I just really like,

1902
01:49:47.561 --> 01:49:50.110
there are rules like that will never ever know about,

1903
01:49:50.111 --> 01:49:53.200
but once you get in there they're like,
hey,
here's what you need to know.

1904
01:49:53.201 --> 01:49:55.300
Here's what you need to know not to go against.

1905
01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.700
I would think that if anybody's going to tell us that it's Trump,

1906
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:02.140
I think the best thing that could ever happen is that Trump gets out of his

1907
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:05.370
terms in the White House and just starts talking.
It's start,

1908
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:08.050
it starts writing books.
Tell us everything.
Yeah.

1909
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:09.490
You want to be the king of the world,
right.

1910
01:50:09.491 --> 01:50:14.050
A fucking a huge book on exactly what it's like the day you become the

1911
01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:16.330
president.
That would be insane.
How,

1912
01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.850
how do you think he's going to be treated once it gets out though?

1913
01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:23.320
They'll love him.
You think so?
They love Bush.
People hated Bush.

1914
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:28.270
They called Bush a war criminal.
Now he's an adorable grandpa.
Paints.
No,

1915
01:50:28.271 --> 01:50:30.160
it's true.
It's true.
It's true.
Look,
man,

1916
01:50:30.161 --> 01:50:33.100
what a whatever people be hating Obama when he was in office,

1917
01:50:33.101 --> 01:50:35.050
they're going to love him within a few years.
I mean,

1918
01:50:35.051 --> 01:50:39.720
most people that were supporters of Obama,
they love him now.
I mean,

1919
01:50:39.730 --> 01:50:43.340
he's like,
uh,
yeah,
I,

1920
01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.560
I mean,
I don't know.
I think they're going to,

1921
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:50.050
I think a certain percentage of the population loves Trump right now,
period.

1922
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:54.520
And you know,
they have reasons to back it up in terms of like the economy,

1923
01:50:54.521 --> 01:50:56.470
what they think is happening with job creation,

1924
01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:00.190
all these different things that he's doing that may or may not have devastating

1925
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:03.230
implications depending on who you talk to.
That's an expert.
And I'm not one.
Yeah,

1926
01:51:03.231 --> 01:51:06.880
me neither.
But there's obviously,
and then also people say,
wow,

1927
01:51:06.881 --> 01:51:09.550
this was a trend that was actually going on during the Obama administration.

1928
01:51:09.551 --> 01:51:13.270
He's just riding the wave.
Maybe I'm too stupid.
I don't understand that stuff,

1929
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:15.730
but I'm saying in terms of numbers,

1930
01:51:15.731 --> 01:51:18.610
it's not like the country is completely imploding right now.
I mean,

1931
01:51:18.611 --> 01:51:20.500
maybe some people buy some people's metric.

1932
01:51:20.501 --> 01:51:24.850
It's not doing as well as he would like to pretend it is probably.
But my thing,

1933
01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:28.810
it doesn't even matter.
Like when they say the stocks are up and all that,
it's,

1934
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:30.850
it's what matters is your personal life.

1935
01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:33.250
Are you in a better place because he's president.

1936
01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.490
But for some people that are not right.

1937
01:51:36.491 --> 01:51:40.660
Some people like if you get rounded up by ice,
no you're not.
Yeah,
you're not,

1938
01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:42.280
you know,
I mean,
that's horrible.

1939
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:47.290
This is the worst time ever for perception of us in terms of like the way we

1940
01:51:47.291 --> 01:51:48.700
handle immigrants.
Well,
you know,

1941
01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:53.620
you know the bad part about immigrants,
it's all bad.
But you know,

1942
01:51:53.621 --> 01:51:58.360
the problem is they've,
they've dealt with this problem.
Why for the last 30,

1943
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:01.900
40 years.
I mean,
and if they make nicer facilities,

1944
01:52:01.901 --> 01:52:06.160
let's say they know they're coming so they don't have enough judges.
The,

1945
01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:09.820
the facilities were horrible.
So let's say they make nicer facilities.

1946
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:13.900
Then the government thinks the whole thinking of the government is,

1947
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:17.440
if we do that,
then that's going to encourage more to come because now it's nice.

1948
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:20.230
Yeah.
They're like,
Bro,
you get over there.
I see a shower.

1949
01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.980
They have delicious food.
They have a taco stand.

1950
01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:29.080
It was fucking party over that Brown Margarita is he partied with the guards.

1951
01:52:29.081 --> 01:52:31.780
Once you get to know them,
they're good guys and that's the thing.

1952
01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:35.190
It's like what do you do?
What do you do?
Like I think,

1953
01:52:35.191 --> 01:52:40.191
I think this is a problem that will take generations to fix and really there is

1954
01:52:41.861 --> 01:52:46.310
a problem.
The only way it's really going to get fixed really is two ways.
One,

1955
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.210
<v 3>you got to make drugs legal and two,
you got to prop up all these countries,</v>

1956
01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.090
all these countries that are third world countries where these people are

1957
01:52:53.091 --> 01:52:55.580
fleeing because they don't have any possibility.

1958
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:57.900
There's no hope for them wherever they are.

1959
01:52:57.901 --> 01:53:01.670
If they're an incredibly poor countries,
there's no future there.
They don't,

1960
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.830
they don't have the resources.
They don't have anything to do.

1961
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:09.010
So the only way you can keep people happy on a global scale as you've got to

1962
01:53:10.221 --> 01:53:12.870
figure out like we have the highest of the highest,
right?
Yeah.

1963
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:17.540
Like wealthy people in the industrialized Western world,
right.
And the lows,

1964
01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:21.800
the lows are people that lived in there that are living in these places that are

1965
01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:26.720
disease ridden,
poverty stricken,
horrible.
With no future you got,

1966
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:31.130
we've got to figure out a way to bring everybody to a comfortable middle all

1967
01:53:31.131 --> 01:53:35.960
over the world so that there's no extreme poverty in any location anywhere.

1968
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:40.490
We want to eradicate diseases.
Okay.
For sure we do.
Right?
We all do.

1969
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:43.220
Don't we want to eradicate the problem?

1970
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:46.940
The Dis ease of poverty is a dis ease.

1971
01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:51.380
It's a terrible feeling to be poor and scrounging for food in a crime ridden

1972
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:52.214
environment.

1973
01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:56.840
And the only way to fix that is put attention on those areas and use money to

1974
01:53:56.841 --> 01:53:59.570
try to raise it up.
They're not going to raise up on their own.
They never have.

1975
01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:04.540
They never and never will.
Yeah.
I just think globally if,
if,

1976
01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:08.330
if people ever could get their shit together and this is what I hope this is my,

1977
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.640
if I had like a pipe dream of technology,

1978
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:16.190
that technology gets us to a place where we can read each other's minds.

1979
01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:20.480
And I think this is a possible,
and I think once we can read each other's minds,

1980
01:54:20.481 --> 01:54:23.510
we can understand that we're not that dissimilar.
There were,

1981
01:54:23.511 --> 01:54:27.560
were not nearly as far apart as we think we are and that most of our problems

1982
01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:28.394
that we have,

1983
01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:33.730
our problems of ego and problems of ideology and problems of ethics and morals

1984
01:54:35.091 --> 01:54:35.310
and,

1985
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:40.310
and truth and lies and that reading each other's minds will sort a lot of that

1986
01:54:40.641 --> 01:54:43.670
out.
And then we're going to figure out a way to,

1987
01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:47.420
I don't want to say like for redistribution of wealth,

1988
01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:49.010
I don't think you should just give people things.

1989
01:54:49.011 --> 01:54:52.400
Where I think you should do is try to figure out a way to rebuild communities

1990
01:54:52.401 --> 01:54:54.710
and give people opportunities to live better lives.

1991
01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:56.810
And we have to do that global I think.

1992
01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.980
But I think the problem with today is presented to cause I listened to both

1993
01:55:00.981 --> 01:55:02.540
sides.
When you travel as a comic,

1994
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:05.900
you'll people just come up to you and tell you their views on just random
things.

1995
01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:07.790
So you're from both sides.
One side is like,

1996
01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:10.520
I don't want to just give out stuff for free.
You know,
I,

1997
01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:13.910
why should I give them stuff?
I worked hard for mine and the other,

1998
01:55:13.911 --> 01:55:15.250
you got other people that go,
well,

1999
01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:19.220
we need to help everyone out because we are the world type of situation.

2000
01:55:19.221 --> 01:55:23.570
You know both,
right?
It's confusing.
There are 100% both right,

2001
01:55:23.571 --> 01:55:27.860
but you don't want to give people stuff,
but you don't want to just,

2002
01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:32.300
you got lucky.
You got lucky as fuck.
You're born in America.
I mean,

2003
01:55:32.301 --> 01:55:35.210
you're from Texas.
I'm from Boston,
dude.
We're,

2004
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:38.360
we're from like the industrialized Western World in the,

2005
01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:41.750
the pinnacle of civilization in terms of like opportunity.

2006
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:44.130
There's never been a place like we're the luckiest

2007
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.080
<v 1>fucking people that are a for the planet.</v>

2008
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:49.850
Anybody who doesn't acknowledge that you gotta be crazy,
man.
I was.

2009
01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:53.340
I became friends with this lady at a restaurant and me and my wife and son would

2010
01:55:53.341 --> 01:55:57.420
always go in there and we got really close and she was just talking about like,

2011
01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.410
you know,
our family's from Ecuador and her kids,

2012
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:03.060
she can't afford her kids to be over here.

2013
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:06.510
So she's sitting in a school over there and she keeps sending money over there.

2014
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.010
But like it's riddled with gangs,
nothing but gangs out there.

2015
01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.650
And if they find out you're an America sending money back,

2016
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:18.150
the hold your family hostage,
you know what I mean?
And it's,
and that's real.

2017
01:56:18.151 --> 01:56:21.240
People don't believe that.
They think they owe.
That's not,
it's real.

2018
01:56:21.241 --> 01:56:25.890
Like this lady we've known for over like eight years and she tells these stories

2019
01:56:25.891 --> 01:56:29.310
about like her sending her money and she has a person out there that,

2020
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:31.140
that basically,
you know,

2021
01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:34.830
lives in a little house and keeps everything secret because if it comes out that

2022
01:56:34.831 --> 01:56:36.750
she sending money to him,
Bill,

2023
01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:41.140
they'll hold that family hostage and I'll have to keep yours off and shit.
Yeah.

2024
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:44.910
Like it's bad,
it's bad.
And we're living here,
you know,

2025
01:56:44.911 --> 01:56:48.750
we're lucky we're doing this podcast,
but there are people struggling.

2026
01:56:48.751 --> 01:56:53.040
And when I hear people go,
ah,
you know,
that's their problem.
Nah,
that's,

2027
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.240
that's terrible.
The worlds,
you're a,
you're an awful human being.

2028
01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.640
Perspective sucks for sure.

2029
01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:03.270
It's terrible and it's going on all over the world and it's creating this and I

2030
01:57:03.271 --> 01:57:07.260
feel that,
you know,
we're creating this me,
me,
me situation.

2031
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:10.950
But I also think we need to also have conversations about it.
I did a,

2032
01:57:10.951 --> 01:57:14.970
I did a show in Kansas City and I always talk about when I do stand up,

2033
01:57:14.971 --> 01:57:16.560
I don't talk politics.
So you know,

2034
01:57:16.561 --> 01:57:19.680
you do the local press and things and there were people that come out to my

2035
01:57:19.681 --> 01:57:23.100
shows and Trump hats,
like literally wearing Trump hats,

2036
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:27.690
sat front row and did that to fuck with you?
I don't know.

2037
01:57:27.691 --> 01:57:30.510
But I thought we did also,
I don't care what they probably did,

2038
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:35.020
they probably did cause cause after the show literally and when I say Trump

2039
01:57:35.021 --> 01:57:39.000
supporters,
like they look,
I mean like the big Husky Guy,
hey,

2040
01:57:39.001 --> 01:57:41.550
how are you doing it?
Like that type of thing.
And they go,
we hurt.

2041
01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:46.230
Our wife said you weren't going to talk politics so we won't see.
You know,

2042
01:57:46.231 --> 01:57:49.590
and,
and then she goes,
he's right.
You didn't,
you know,
and Oh,

2043
01:57:50.170 --> 01:57:52.770
when they wanted to see we we're going to sit up front where I Trump,

2044
01:57:52.771 --> 01:57:57.570
pat support our leader case you crack any funnies about his aren't scanners

2045
01:57:57.571 --> 01:58:00.210
fucked up.
Hey.
And I didn't,
I did it because that's not my comedy.

2046
01:58:00.211 --> 01:58:01.430
But they bought all,

2047
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:05.480
basically they bought tons of merch because I didn't do it and they all said

2048
01:58:05.490 --> 01:58:06.720
said something that was important.

2049
01:58:07.110 --> 01:58:11.190
And I think this is important to know when you try to make a point to somebody,

2050
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:14.160
when you start off yelling at them,
it's never going to go well.

2051
01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.570
If you can explain it to him through your eyes and not yell,

2052
01:58:18.571 --> 01:58:21.960
have a conversation.
Because I talk a lot about like,
you know,

2053
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.680
I talk a lot about growing up in an all white neighborhood in the racist things

2054
01:58:25.681 --> 01:58:30.510
that I encountered and I didn't yell at them and I didn't say I hate white

2055
01:58:30.511 --> 01:58:34.710
people.
I just told my point of view.
And they actually were open in,

2056
01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:37.770
they actually respond.
I understand now.
You know,

2057
01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:42.040
nobody's ever explained it to us like that and I think it's conversation

2058
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.810
<v 0>not because we watch TV.
It's all about you suck.
You suck.
Well,</v>

2059
01:58:46.811 --> 01:58:51.520
let me tell you why.
You got to start from a place,
put it like this.

2060
01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:55.780
I don't know if you've heard of this green deal where they want to take 70% of

2061
01:58:55.781 --> 01:58:59.530
anyone that makes over $10 million,
70% of their income.
That's hilarious.

2062
01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:03.940
That's hilarious.
It's the dumbest thing ever.
AOC,
right?

2063
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.200
Yeah.
It's the dumbest thing ever.
I mean,
I wasn't calling her.
No,
no,
no.

2064
01:59:08.410 --> 01:59:12.760
I like her,
but hey,
good luck.
Pitch as expression.
Yes.

2065
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:16.390
I like her too.
I like it.
But I will agree with her that,
but I like her.

2066
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:19.810
But what I'm saying is my friend was like,
oh,
you know,
if the Democrats win,

2067
01:59:19.811 --> 01:59:22.900
that's going to get passed because we hate rich people.
And I go,

2068
01:59:22.901 --> 01:59:24.550
that's the problem.
We're starting at hate.

2069
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:28.240
The reason why you think it's going to pass because you think people hate rich

2070
01:59:28.241 --> 01:59:32.920
people see it and that's,
you got to have a conversation.
First of all,

2071
01:59:32.921 --> 01:59:36.980
you've got incompetent use of funds.
Like where does the money go?

2072
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.110
Oh our tax that if you tax the rich that all of a sudden all the problems will

2073
01:59:41.111 --> 01:59:43.420
stop existing is so silly.

2074
01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.970
You still have been competent people that are distributing the money,

2075
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:51.010
they're just create more jobs.
There'll be more red tape and more in debt.

2076
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:51.730
Yeah.

2077
01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:56.730
Well we got to do is figure out a real plan for engineering our civilization

2078
01:59:58.091 --> 01:59:58.690
better.

2079
01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:02.710
That's what people have to do and they should be like real discussion from like

2080
02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:07.000
real experts,
biologists,
historians,

2081
02:00:07.150 --> 02:00:09.190
people who really understand he was a psychologist.

2082
02:00:09.191 --> 02:00:13.210
People really understand human beings really understand what's wrong with our

2083
02:00:13.211 --> 02:00:17.400
society today and we have an open discussion,
but you know that never got that.

2084
02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.500
But that can never happen.
Of course it can,
but no,
no,
no.

2085
02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:23.840
Right now because of the government.
Because here's the thing,
what do you mean?

2086
02:00:23.841 --> 02:00:27.520
And that can happen.
It's just we have to look at it in terms of a real priority.

2087
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:32.410
But no,
it goes by,
it goes by the whoever party's in charge of their priorities.

2088
02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:36.340
It's not like my problem is to make it a priority for the nation.

2089
02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:40.840
That's what I'm saying.
But impossible.
But until you have a person,

2090
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:44.290
I believe everything can be fixed.
This is a simple fix.

2091
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:49.000
If you just elect a person that takes some republican values and some democratic

2092
02:00:49.001 --> 02:00:52.090
values,
the thing is right now in politics,
you have to be one or the other.

2093
02:00:52.450 --> 02:00:55.450
Like if I,
if a person came in and go,
you know what?

2094
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:59.620
I like these Republican ideas.
I liked these democratic ideas,
less role.

2095
02:00:59.621 --> 02:01:03.210
I'm a be down the middle and less role with Polk called being a centrist.
Yeah,

2096
02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:07.360
that exists.
But in these to win it.
But that can happen.

2097
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:11.380
It can happen.
All of it.
But until that happens,
but until that happens,

2098
02:01:11.381 --> 02:01:15.070
what does that mean though?
Does it every four years we figured out what happens.

2099
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:16.720
Right?
And before Trump won,

2100
02:01:16.721 --> 02:01:20.660
we never thought a reality show fucking guy could win.
But that guy won.
Yeah.

2101
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:25.090
And you go,
okay,
well now we know that happens.
All of this stuff can happen.

2102
02:01:25.091 --> 02:01:26.920
This is not like,
we're not asking for alchemy.

2103
02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:29.710
We're not trying to turn lead into gold.
We're trying to figure out a way,

2104
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:34.770
but you're going against the system that then is is there's a new system.

2105
02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:39.650
The new system is the system of public opinion,
which is readily accessible.

2106
02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:40.250
Absolutely.

2107
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:41.660
<v 3>And that's never happened before.</v>

2108
02:01:41.690 --> 02:01:46.250
There's never been a time where everyone had a say in one way,
shape or form.

2109
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:50.240
Whether it's through commenting through Instagram or Twitter or social media.

2110
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:54.140
That's one of the reasons why upholding the freedom of speech and these things

2111
02:01:54.141 --> 02:01:56.860
is so important.
Even if people were saying things you don't agree with,

2112
02:01:57.410 --> 02:02:00.830
the only way this all gets sorted out as we get to figure out a way to express

2113
02:02:00.831 --> 02:02:03.140
ourselves and there's going to be arguments back and forth,

2114
02:02:03.141 --> 02:02:08.030
but what you gotta do is someone's got to put forth an educated plan,

2115
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.830
like a plan that's based on science and reason and a plan that you can debate

2116
02:02:12.831 --> 02:02:14.510
against opposers of that plan.

2117
02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:18.020
But when you have people that don't believe in science,
a lot of how do you,

2118
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:22.850
how do you slowly but surely got to edge.
It's going to take generations.

2119
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:24.470
This is what I'm saying.
It's like the,
the,

2120
02:02:24.471 --> 02:02:28.710
the momentum of our stubbornness and our,
our,
our past and the,

2121
02:02:28.711 --> 02:02:31.340
the sort of the systems that we find ourselves stuck in,

2122
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:35.280
systems of behavior and thinking,
culture,
all that stuff is,

2123
02:02:35.290 --> 02:02:38.990
he's going to take a long time.
We sort the wheat from the chaff.

2124
02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.990
We've got to figure out what's good and what's bad and we're doing it.

2125
02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:42.651
We're doing it.

2126
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:45.560
But it was doing it actively and it's frustrating because you're like,

2127
02:02:45.561 --> 02:02:48.410
God dammit,
this is the worst time.
We still have all these problems.

2128
02:02:48.411 --> 02:02:50.390
We still have cops shooting people.
We still have crime.

2129
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:54.110
We still have Wall Street theft.
We still have all this stuff.
Yeah,

2130
02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:55.460
but you know what?
I liked him.

2131
02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:59.480
But you know what I like is we know about it now where it's not hitting like 20

2132
02:02:59.481 --> 02:03:01.850
years ago.
Like you heard him,

2133
02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:05.390
let's go 30 years ago you heard Nwa make that sound.

2134
02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:08.630
F The police and they're talking about the same things that are happening today,

2135
02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:11.090
except you would hear the song and go,
oh,
that's a great song.

2136
02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:15.310
That's not Rodney King.
Rodney King.
You watched him get the fuck beat out of him.

2137
02:03:15.330 --> 02:03:19.190
Yeah,
on TV.
And here's the thing about the Rodney king thing.

2138
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:23.180
That guy apparently was like,
we had done a bunch of crazy shit,
right?

2139
02:03:23.181 --> 02:03:26.180
He'd gotten a car chase with the cops.

2140
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:29.540
Beat the fuck out of somebody before that.
There was a lot going on.

2141
02:03:29.690 --> 02:03:33.680
You just got to see the end of it while this guy,
was he,
what was he on?

2142
02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:37.460
Was he on a drug and I think he was on PCP.

2143
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.400
PCP apparently makes you look super humans strong.

2144
02:03:40.401 --> 02:03:43.190
I had a buddy of mine who got his finger bitten off while he's on PCP.

2145
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:47.060
Said he didn't even know it.
Bitten off by who?
A street fight.
Yeah.

2146
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:50.570
It's like he didn't even realize this fit cause he was,
he was on PCP.

2147
02:03:50.571 --> 02:03:55.490
Do you realize how many bit his finger off
then he went to?

2148
02:03:55.491 --> 02:04:00.440
Yeah,
he had,
uh,
he had,
uh,
his toe removed and his toe,

2149
02:04:00.441 --> 02:04:04.970
uh,
put onto his finger where it's finger used to be.
Was it a thumb?
No,

2150
02:04:04.971 --> 02:04:09.350
this is pinky fingers up his um,
trigger finger.
So on one of his,

2151
02:04:09.351 --> 02:04:12.620
any had it curved so he could always throw right hooks.

2152
02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.140
So is when you'd shake his hand.
He's a,

2153
02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:19.070
he would give you like this weird handshake while he would shake your hand,

2154
02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:22.010
but there was always one finger that wouldn't just try to tickle the middle.

2155
02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:24.020
It didn't move good because they,

2156
02:04:24.090 --> 02:04:27.770
it was really as toe that they replaced as a finger with a toe.

2157
02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:31.490
That must have looked weird.
It was weird.
It was real weird.
Yeah.

2158
02:04:31.491 --> 02:04:35.450
But that's PCP son living at PCP life.

2159
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:40.950
Fucking crazy people in Boston,
man.
He was a boxing coach.
Ah,
yeah.

2160
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:44.640
I don't know ma'am.
It's just we need to get to a better place.
Yeah,

2161
02:04:44.641 --> 02:04:49.380
we're getting to a better place.
But I think it's a long,
slow process.

2162
02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:52.920
I think we are in the,
I mean there's people that say you like,
hey to,

2163
02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:57.300
to minimize the suffering that people feel right now is just for you to say that

2164
02:04:57.301 --> 02:05:01.380
is outrageous and it's just a hallmark of your delusional perspective.

2165
02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:05.590
That's not true.
This is not denying the awful things of the world.

2166
02:05:05.591 --> 02:05:06.840
The awful things of the world exist.

2167
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:11.010
But if you tried to look at this as a mathematical equation,
if you look above,

2168
02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:12.990
he would say,
well,
there's a lot of problems here.

2169
02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:14.910
There's a lot of competing factors.

2170
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:17.850
There's environmental factors like what are they doing to the world?

2171
02:05:18.150 --> 02:05:20.700
What are they doing at the ocean?
What are they doing to the air?
Oh Jesus,

2172
02:05:20.701 --> 02:05:24.210
everything is warming up and people are fighting over what's causing it.

2173
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:26.280
Like they're not even paying tent.
This is madness,

2174
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:30.660
but look how much knowledge there is.
Look how much discussion there is.

2175
02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:35.310
Movements are moving and growing and people are,
even when they're misinformed,

2176
02:05:35.490 --> 02:05:39.150
it's still,
there's activity.
There's all this stuff going on.
Even when you know,

2177
02:05:39.151 --> 02:05:41.880
someone says,
Hey,
we're going to tax everybody that makes more than $10 million,

2178
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:46.710
70% like bitch amp tax and shit.
Stop.
Just stop,
stop,
stop,
stop,

2179
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:49.500
stop.
Just because someone works really hard,
you can't take all of it.
Look,

2180
02:05:49.530 --> 02:05:54.120
stop people from stealing money,
stop people.
But if you,
if people say,
well,

2181
02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:59.040
we want equality of outcome.
Okay,
as soon as we get equality of effort,

2182
02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:04.050
talk to me as soon as we can.
Cause some people don't hustle,

2183
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.230
they just don't.
And I don't know why.
Maybe it's the way they were raised.

2184
02:06:07.231 --> 02:06:09.350
Maybe they have poor nutrition,
maybe they have a hook worm.

2185
02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.560
I don't know what the fuck it is.

2186
02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:14.720
But don't say that everybody's supposed to hit the right spot and everyone's

2187
02:06:14.730 --> 02:06:17.400
going to get to this spot.
And then after that spot we're going to divvy,

2188
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:18.390
divvy up all the money.

2189
02:06:18.391 --> 02:06:20.580
So nobody ever makes more than a hundred thousand dollars a year in the world's

2190
02:06:20.581 --> 02:06:21.840
a better place.
Bitch.

2191
02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:24.450
That doesn't make the world better than those that makes lazy people happy.

2192
02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:29.160
That some fucking juggernaut like Mark Cuban or one of these billionaire

2193
02:06:29.161 --> 02:06:33.540
characters is like hustling constantly and gathering up massive resources.
Yeah,

2194
02:06:33.541 --> 02:06:36.210
he's playing the game of monopoly but he's playing a 24 hours a day,

2195
02:06:36.211 --> 02:06:38.910
seven days a week.
That's his option.
He can do that.

2196
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.150
You can't stop people from doing that.
Well you can stop them.

2197
02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:47.300
It's from doing in just things with that money and maybe you can do is like help

2198
02:06:47.431 --> 02:06:52.260
someone like lean towards the like a Bill Gates type situation where he does so

2199
02:06:52.261 --> 02:06:56.590
much good and so much charitable work and it helps out so many people that you

2200
02:06:56.591 --> 02:06:59.880
go,
oh well maybe it's not a bad thing for a guy like that to have all that money

2201
02:07:00.210 --> 02:07:02.720
because you don't have to think of him as just mister money bags.

2202
02:07:02.730 --> 02:07:05.670
Like maybe you can think of him as he does have access to all this money,

2203
02:07:05.671 --> 02:07:10.500
but he's also this incredible resource for hope and change and prosperity for

2204
02:07:10.501 --> 02:07:12.090
some folks I think.
I think like,

2205
02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:17.780
I think people wouldn't mind giving money to something that they see being

2206
02:07:18.841 --> 02:07:21.210
built.
Like if there's work into it,

2207
02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:25.760
people hate the idea of just giving money and not seeing something from it.
Sure.

2208
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:26.890
You know,
but when you've guilty,

2209
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:29.820
even it's the people that don't know what the fuck to do with it and they just

2210
02:07:29.821 --> 02:07:33.030
going to find a use for it because that's what bureaucracy is.

2211
02:07:33.850 --> 02:07:35.660
I don't know man.
No,
no.

2212
02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:40.300
<v 0>I don't know Joe.
We just,
I don't know either,</v>

2213
02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:44.170
but I do know that it's fashionable to say it sucks.

2214
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:48.550
It's fashionable to say everything sucks.
Well it's,
it's easy to say that,

2215
02:07:48.551 --> 02:07:49.630
but like you said,

2216
02:07:49.631 --> 02:07:54.631
but I really think it starts with if the government is not on the same page and

2217
02:07:54.911 --> 02:07:57.010
they're always fighting,
you can't,

2218
02:07:57.011 --> 02:08:00.370
you can't move forward that all this great stuff you're saying can't move

2219
02:08:00.371 --> 02:08:03.190
forward because it starts from the top Joe.
That's true.

2220
02:08:03.191 --> 02:08:04.210
But it starts from the top.

2221
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.880
What's interesting is one of the things that's cool about the government

2222
02:08:06.881 --> 02:08:08.080
fighting as you get to see that,

2223
02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:10.960
like even the president can't do the things that he wants.
Yes.

2224
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:15.460
He has to consult with people and they have to agree on something and it has to

2225
02:08:15.461 --> 02:08:17.680
be reasonable and you have to present it to the American people.

2226
02:08:17.681 --> 02:08:19.630
And so the people have to represent their constituents.

2227
02:08:19.630 --> 02:08:22.930
And so you're seeing this really fascinating thing because you've never had a

2228
02:08:22.931 --> 02:08:24.610
guy like Trump in office before.

2229
02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:28.490
So you see him say he's going to do things and then you see the rest of the

2230
02:08:28.491 --> 02:08:33.280
[inaudible] the fuck you are the fuck you are.
And then you watch this stalemate,

2231
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:34.031
you watch this,

2232
02:08:34.031 --> 02:08:37.330
this go down and you watch these people being forced to negotiate.

2233
02:08:37.331 --> 02:08:40.120
And the way Trump was forced to talk about Nancy Pelosi,

2234
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:43.540
cause she has so much power,
you know,
and you know he got to color our cut.

2235
02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:46.840
Oh yeah.
He left to call her at all,
which like to fuck out of it.

2236
02:08:46.841 --> 02:08:50.080
He has to pay their respect because he's stuck now.
Golf claps right in his face.

2237
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:54.880
She's like,
it gives enough man.
I,
it's so fun.

2238
02:08:55.150 --> 02:08:58.270
It's so fun to watch right now.
It is a fun time man.

2239
02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:01.000
And what social media being so big.
How do you,

2240
02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:04.270
how do you deal with people like the haters?
Because there's so many people,

2241
02:09:04.271 --> 02:09:08.530
as I call them,
thumb thugs,
but how do you deal there?
Hating in the dark.

2242
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:11.380
I don't know what they're doing.
You don't read all those comments too?

2243
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:13.690
I don't read shit anymore,
man.
A very,

2244
02:09:13.691 --> 02:09:18.490
very rarely go into mentioned it.
And if I do,
it's usually a mistake.

2245
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:23.260
I would just,
I just do my best.
I'll do my best.
I post and I go,

2246
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:27.190
I post and ghost.
You don't even look at people's feeds,
do?
No.

2247
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.880
I look at some people's feeds and Instagram when I'm bored,
you know,
I'm,
I'll,

2248
02:09:30.881 --> 02:09:33.490
I'll read some things,
you know,
I want to look at some cool pictures.

2249
02:09:33.491 --> 02:09:35.950
I'll watch some inspirational shit.
I like going to the rocks,

2250
02:09:36.130 --> 02:09:38.980
seeing him lifting weights,
pumped up.
I want to go to the gym.
Let me do that.

2251
02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:42.010
The Rock is a bit,
let me tell you it Fletcher,

2252
02:09:42.070 --> 02:09:44.110
I interviewed the Rock the first time I met him.

2253
02:09:44.111 --> 02:09:47.680
I was like 11 years ago during the game plan and we just hit it off,

2254
02:09:47.681 --> 02:09:51.010
right game playing the game plan.
That's where he played a quarterback.

2255
02:09:51.050 --> 02:09:53.800
He was a lot thinner.
His,
his first breakout movie,

2256
02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:58.740
he did Scorpion and then the game plan.
And after that interview,
uh,

2257
02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:01.950
he took some time and just talk to me.
He wasn't the rock then,
I mean sweet.

2258
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:04.840
And then over the years,
every time I interviewed him,

2259
02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:07.420
he would pull me aside and go,
are you going into my acting coach?

2260
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:10.090
Are you doing this?
Are you doing that?
Is there anything I can help you with?

2261
02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:11.810
And I'm like,
why?
Like,

2262
02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:16.270
and then he got bigger and bigger and the last time I saw him,
same thing,
Yo,

2263
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:19.540
are you doing,
are you going to the acting coach?
Are you working on your goals?

2264
02:10:19.541 --> 02:10:23.560
Or you're improving like literally his Instagram,
but in real life and um,

2265
02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:25.330
and it's,
and he'll never know this,

2266
02:10:25.331 --> 02:10:29.500
but it's a thing that's for me just average Schmo Michael Yo,

2267
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:33.980
to take the time out.
Every time I interview them to ask me if I'm achieving

2268
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.670
<v 1>my goals,
if I'm moving forward in life,
giving me positive things,</v>

2269
02:10:37.671 --> 02:10:41.330
positive thoughts to take that time like five minutes after every interview and

2270
02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:43.250
this dude is booked nonstop,

2271
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:48.550
but to actually take time and it's just so inspirational in to see him be the

2272
02:10:49.191 --> 02:10:52.460
biggest movie star in the world.
And he knows everybody's name.

2273
02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:54.570
He's very respected.
I don't know if he has an earpiece,

2274
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:58.420
but like it's like he's like the president when he was,

2275
02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.970
he knows everybody's name.
He could be president.
He,

2276
02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:04.550
oh hundred percent hundred percent a hundred percent it could be present or he

2277
02:11:04.551 --> 02:11:06.200
can free form.
I would too,

2278
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:10.880
because he believes he's just a hard also comes from humble beginnings.
Yes.

2279
02:11:11.070 --> 02:11:13.820
I mean he's in Hawaii right now and he's filming on his Instagram.

2280
02:11:13.821 --> 02:11:16.490
He's talking about all the neighborhoods that he goes back to to check to see

2281
02:11:16.491 --> 02:11:20.210
where he was worse from when he was poor and starving.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2282
02:11:20.211 --> 02:11:25.100
He really is from humble beginnings.
I mean,
he,
he had only like,
you know,

2283
02:11:25.101 --> 02:11:29.210
it's the story like $5 left in his account and then he got discovered and

2284
02:11:29.211 --> 02:11:32.420
wrestling.
And I knew him in Miami when he was doing WWU.

2285
02:11:32.421 --> 02:11:34.370
I interviewed him a couple times over there and,

2286
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:37.490
and he played for the University of Miami,
my favorite college football team.

2287
02:11:37.491 --> 02:11:40.310
So it's a thing where,
you know,
the history of 11 years,

2288
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:45.311
but for him that big to take time to motivate me separately.

2289
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:49.100
And you know,
I know if he sees me out,
he knows my name,

2290
02:11:49.101 --> 02:11:51.890
but it's not like I'm texting her,
I'm not like Kevin Hart with them.

2291
02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:55.910
And just to be a random dude that he takes time out every time he sees me to

2292
02:11:55.911 --> 02:11:59.870
make sure I'm hitting my goals and moving forward with my career and not bad.

2293
02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:04.430
And then offering,
hey,
if you ever need anything,
get in touch with me.
You know,

2294
02:12:04.431 --> 02:12:08.450
I would never take him up on that.
But it's a thing where I'm no body,

2295
02:12:08.630 --> 02:12:12.370
he's the rock.
And to be that inspiration,
I mean it,

2296
02:12:12.371 --> 02:12:15.230
it just does so much man.
Like it.

2297
02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:20.620
Little things that big celebrities do or somebody that really inspires you,

2298
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:25.130
like they don't know how much that means.
Like just that little time he spins,

2299
02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:29.270
it needs some lows.
I think he does know.
I think he's a genuine leader.
He is,

2300
02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:29.551
you know,

2301
02:12:29.551 --> 02:12:34.370
it's 100% that's why so many people like him because what he says is it's

2302
02:12:34.371 --> 02:12:38.030
authentic.
Like it's really who he is.
There is nothing fake about that man.

2303
02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.430
And you don't have to be fake and stuff to be successful.

2304
02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:43.100
And if you want to work as hard as that guy,
you can be successful.

2305
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:47.780
I I asked one day,
I was like,
do you just take a bunch of pictures at the gym?

2306
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:51.350
Like Dan just posts throughout the day because you don't always get that beg for

2307
02:12:51.351 --> 02:12:56.090
taking pictures.
No Man,
that guy's picking heavy shit up.
That's too big.

2308
02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:00.030
But you know what?
I left.
That's just too big,
Joe.
It's not too big for it.

2309
02:13:00.650 --> 02:13:04.740
He's an action star Dude and he's the first action started at looks like an egg.

2310
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:08.770
Like I would want him to save my life and real life.
What does he like?
Six,

2311
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:13.130
seven or some shit like that.
He's a giant.
He's a little bit taller than me.

2312
02:13:13.131 --> 02:13:17.870
I'm so used to these giant is built like a fucking like legitimate superhero.

2313
02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:22.400
Like will Smith was my guy.
But I left Willsmith for the rock.
No,
no,
no,

2314
02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:27.800
no,
no,
no.
But like,
like I had to do what you gotta do,
but burning,

2315
02:13:27.801 --> 02:13:29.650
building a burning building.
Who's going to save you?

2316
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:31.940
Who's going to save you will spend,
might save you two

2317
02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:38.610
<v 0>aliens coming at you,
uh,
independence day.
Did you not see,</v>

2318
02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:42.150
will Smith Save the world?
Doug,
my look,
I love will Smith.

2319
02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:46.800
An earthquake.
An earthquake.
Well,

2320
02:13:46.801 --> 02:13:50.720
if you want someone to hold one hand on the top of a building,
thank you.

2321
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:54.090
And then hold your wrist with another and know that he's got you.

2322
02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.880
According to the movie poster.
That's the rock.
See,

2323
02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:59.820
I never saw will Smith holding the top of the building.

2324
02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:04.620
His shooting by the hand will Smith can shoot a gun.
He kept those,
those zombies.

2325
02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:09.330
He did.
I am legend.
Oh Man.
What a great mother fucking movie.
Oh my goodness.

2326
02:14:09.331 --> 02:14:14.040
Freight.
Fuck God.
Yeah.
By Will Smith and the rock need to make a movie together.

2327
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.960
They now have no amaze me,

2328
02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.740
the biggest movie in the history of the knowing history.

2329
02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:22.500
And they bow out Tom Cruise get 'em all together.

2330
02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:26.700
Tom Cruise will Smith and the Ravi every interview.
Tom Cruise.
Uh,
no,

2331
02:14:26.701 --> 02:14:30.210
but only with my brain.
When I'm in my sensory deprivation tank,

2332
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:34.860
he reaches out to me.
Does he really?
He makes a mind meld and he puts on his,
uh,

2333
02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:39.840
Scientology earbuds and he,
uh,
astral traveling today.
It's amazing.

2334
02:14:39.841 --> 02:14:41.880
Interview Time Cruise.
What's amazing about it?

2335
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.610
It's because you hear so many different stories.

2336
02:14:44.670 --> 02:14:47.330
Do you wake up with your pants off?
No,
I didn't.
I wouldn't know.
Not,
not,

2337
02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:50.600
not that time.
What am I,
he said Matteis mate.

2338
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:54.690
But he doesn't break eye contact with you.
That's what I like.
No,
he just like,

2339
02:14:54.691 --> 02:14:59.600
hey,
hey,
what's up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what he'll do is I get nervous.
No,
I'm not.

2340
02:14:59.650 --> 02:15:01.050
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
But that's what he's doing.

2341
02:15:01.051 --> 02:15:05.490
He's making you nervous or he's just wants you to know.
He's like,
he's locked in,

2342
02:15:05.550 --> 02:15:08.760
right?
Like he will not break eye contact.
Like if you look over it,
he'll be like,

2343
02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.090
probably makes it harder for you to ask fucked up questions to know what he
does.

2344
02:15:12.091 --> 02:15:15.290
And I tell all my friends
what he does.

2345
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.320
I tell all my friends when you interviewed Tom Cruise,
he will take,

2346
02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:22.770
ask him a question.
He'll try to make it three minutes long so he doesn't have,

2347
02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:25.200
you can't ask him.
That made me,
so you've got to learn,

2348
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:28.410
you've got to build a relationship with them.
So then you can ask him a punch.

2349
02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:30.630
See,
I've interviewed them so many times.
I'll walk it.

2350
02:15:30.631 --> 02:15:32.520
I remember one time I walked in the room and say,
Hey Tom,

2351
02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:35.640
I've got five minutes so we're going to have to answer these questions.

2352
02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.120
So I got to that point.
But he,
he's a great inner nice guy.

2353
02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:42.750
Did you ever get the Scientology?
No.
Never part of the deal.

2354
02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.240
You can't ask him about that.
Well I,

2355
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:49.080
I heard a part of Scientology is for you to walk out the room saying how great

2356
02:15:49.081 --> 02:15:52.800
they are.
And I just did since I just did it.
Right.
Yeah.

2357
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:55.350
So maybe it did.
It's just,

2358
02:15:55.351 --> 02:15:59.850
well that's just a philosophy on like how to influence people.
Right.

2359
02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:01.620
Positively influenced people.

2360
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:05.250
You want those people really thinking the best of you.
Well,
good strategy.

2361
02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.360
Well everybody was like,
oh,

2362
02:16:06.361 --> 02:16:10.290
he's crazy as this is that every time I interviewed he's great.
I love,

2363
02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:14.280
I mean I love Tom Cruise.
Some of my favorite people are crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2364
02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:17.640
Tell me someone's crazy.
That doesn't shake me.
I'm not like,
okay,

2365
02:16:17.641 --> 02:16:21.810
well I talked to them.
They're crazy.
My favorite people are all crazy.

2366
02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:25.320
Like literally crazy.
My favorite people.

2367
02:16:26.070 --> 02:16:29.010
So for someone tells me that someone's crazy.
I'm like,
okay,
what else you,

2368
02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:30.290
what's crazy?

2369
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:34.880
<v 1>Not Scary to me.
Like will Smith is awesome.
It's got to be crazy.
Will Smith.
Sure.</v>

2370
02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:39.850
No,
no going on too nice.
Too Nice.
Too Smart.
No,

2371
02:16:39.851 --> 02:16:44.350
you can ask here.
Is He?
No.
Is he a scientologist?
I have no idea.

2372
02:16:45.010 --> 02:16:48.610
The problem is when the problematic,
the problem I had,

2373
02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:51.700
the problem I have would be in the entertainment before there.

2374
02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:55.750
They give you questions to ask and you have to ask them or literally it could be

2375
02:16:55.751 --> 02:16:58.660
your job.
So they flowed out like a bunch of real dumb ones.

2376
02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.320
Did they give you any room to like,
oh yeah,
you could do whatever you want,

2377
02:17:02.321 --> 02:17:04.750
but there'll be like,
hey,
you got to ask this question.

2378
02:17:04.751 --> 02:17:07.810
And it's like if somebody just got divorced and you gotta be like,
Hey,

2379
02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.720
what happened to a divorce?
And it sucks.
And you had asked women that.
Yeah,

2380
02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.310
that's why I stopped doing it,
man.
I couldn't one time.
Uh,
what's her name?
Uh,

2381
02:17:18.450 --> 02:17:21.270
and uh,
God,
what's her name?
Uh,
shoot.

2382
02:17:21.271 --> 02:17:24.760
She was in devil's wear Prada now Meryl Streep,
but,

2383
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:27.310
and Anne Hathaway.

2384
02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:32.390
So they gave me the dumbest question that Kim Kardashian,

2385
02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:33.970
Kanye West were on the cover of vogue.

2386
02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.070
And right before that it was Anne Hathaway.
And so they told me,
they go,
hey,

2387
02:17:39.071 --> 02:17:41.380
why don't you ask her what she thinks about the cover?

2388
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:45.640
Because everybody was like,
oh,
this is bull crap that Kim Kardashian was on it.

2389
02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:49.630
I asked Anne Hathaway that question and she goes,
well,
you know,

2390
02:17:49.631 --> 02:17:52.480
I don't run the magazine so it really doesn't matter to me.
I'm like,
fine.

2391
02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:54.770
So I finished the question.
I'm walking down the stairs and killed,

2392
02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.720
then I hear it.
She goes,
why the fuck would he asked me that question?

2393
02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.000
I don't give a shit who's on that magazine.

2394
02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:05.200
And I was about to turn back around cause I kinda got mad.
But now I was like,

2395
02:18:05.201 --> 02:18:07.560
man,
she's fucking right.
That was a dumb ass question.

2396
02:18:07.561 --> 02:18:09.850
Maybe you could say I'm sorry.
They made me ask you that question.

2397
02:18:09.890 --> 02:18:14.350
So just too late and it was too late.
Yeah.
That's just felt so stupid.

2398
02:18:14.351 --> 02:18:18.490
Asking this question series like winding you up like a little robot,
click,
click,

2399
02:18:18.491 --> 02:18:23.250
click,
get out there and ask the question.
It seems don't ask.
Oh yeah,

2400
02:18:23.350 --> 02:18:26.500
they threaten your job with it.
Well that's why those shows are always so canned.

2401
02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:31.240
You know when you have people talking to entertainers and everything,
so canned.

2402
02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:33.010
It just seems so inauthentic.

2403
02:18:33.011 --> 02:18:36.730
Like they wanted me to ask my first interview ever was with Jennifer Aniston and

2404
02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:40.750
Marley and me and this is right after she broke up with Brad Pitt.

2405
02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:45.400
They want you to ask about price.
They wanted me to ask about and I was like,
no,

2406
02:18:45.401 --> 02:18:50.170
I can't do that.
Did you tell him?
No,
no,
I know it was my first gig.
So you had to,

2407
02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.430
so no,
I didn't.
So I said,
what if I figure out a different way to ask?

2408
02:18:54.730 --> 02:18:59.490
So I found,
so what I,
they were like,
whatever you get,
we need a clip.
You know?

2409
02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:04.270
And this was when I was at e entertainment and this is my first big shoot ever,

2410
02:19:04.271 --> 02:19:06.580
Jennifer Aniston.
And they were like,
you're going to go out there.

2411
02:19:06.581 --> 02:19:11.470
So it was Marley and me,
so she just broke up with Brad Pitt.
So I go,
uh,

2412
02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:15.860
since the movie's about a dog,
I go,
what's the,
uh,
what's the,
um,

2413
02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:20.350
what's the similarities between a dog and a man?

2414
02:19:22.210 --> 02:19:26.650
And she labs and gives a great answer about you.
No one will be around,

2415
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:28.310
but a is always forever.

2416
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.140
<v 0>You know,
like men could treat you wrong.</v>

2417
02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:33.770
So I got a great answer from it and I didn't have to ask about prep.

2418
02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:37.480
And that's the thing is if you find a smart way to ask it,
you can ask it,

2419
02:19:37.481 --> 02:19:42.110
but they just sometimes want you to beat this.
So brutal.
It's,
it's I can't,

2420
02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:46.490
well it's because they don't have to do it and they don't keep the
relationships.

2421
02:19:46.491 --> 02:19:49.700
They don't care about things and they just don't,
they don't even care about you.

2422
02:19:49.701 --> 02:19:53.540
You're a little trained person that they send out a little monkey Patterson

2423
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:57.140
little person listened to me as a person.

2424
02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:02.300
You have to listen to the person who signed the paper is to send you off and

2425
02:20:02.301 --> 02:20:06.470
give you little fucking direction.
Ah,
it's the grossest,

2426
02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:09.380
I mean it was amazing cause I got to build relationships with people.

2427
02:20:09.381 --> 02:20:11.960
But like good for you for recognizing it.

2428
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:15.430
Oh a hundred percent a hundred I knew they were doing so once you may not,

2429
02:20:15.431 --> 02:20:19.100
I mean that by like recognize you got to get out of that 100% it's,

2430
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:24.020
I see my soul couldn't do I cause I couldn't ask people about them breaking up

2431
02:20:24.021 --> 02:20:27.210
or something tragic happening in their lives.
Like how are you doing now?

2432
02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:30.650
Is running to some of them TMZ dudes.
It feel bad.
I'm like look Bro,

2433
02:20:30.890 --> 02:20:33.090
I feel bad too,
but I'm not talking to you like this.

2434
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.110
There's nothing good ever comes out of these.
Like,
it's no disrespect to you.

2435
02:20:36.111 --> 02:20:36.950
I know you're doing a job.

2436
02:20:36.951 --> 02:20:40.210
I'd probably do the same job if I was in your place or pro.
Definitely.

2437
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:43.800
If I was a kid when I was a kid of TMZ was around it,
I take that job.
Well,

2438
02:20:43.801 --> 02:20:46.910
we're going to do,
just try to ask some famous too funny question,

2439
02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.470
but it's just like,
it's not the way to discuss things.

2440
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:54.080
We discuss things and you're coming out of the airport or you're on your way to

2441
02:20:54.081 --> 02:20:56.870
a fucking restaurant somewhere and someone sticks a camera in your face like,

2442
02:20:56.871 --> 02:21:00.930
come on.
Well,
I wasn't doing that.
I was,
I was.
We were going to junk it.
No,
no.

2443
02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:05.630
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But I mean there's these,

2444
02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:10.520
these junkets are a brutal assault on reality.

2445
02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:14.390
This,
you're saying the same thing over and over and over again.

2446
02:21:14.391 --> 02:21:17.720
You ask him to say,
everyone asks you the same question.
You know?
Tell.

2447
02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:22.460
So tell us about this show.
Michael.
You play,
you play Michael.
Yo,

2448
02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:27.650
you're my real name.
This is crazy.
Oh,
by the way,
write this down.

2449
02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:31.700
Michael.
Yo,
average smo.
That's your,
your first comedy special.

2450
02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:33.500
You're going to call it Michael.
Yo average smoker.

2451
02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:36.770
Average smoke because that's what you said when you're talking about the rock.

2452
02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:41.780
He's like,
Yo,
average smile.
So that would be a funny second.
Oh,
that's right.

2453
02:21:41.781 --> 02:21:44.780
You already have one.
I just came out with it.
Yeah.
And when did it come out?
Uh,

2454
02:21:44.781 --> 02:21:48.230
it on Amazon prime.
It's free.
Came out two and a half weeks ago.

2455
02:21:48.350 --> 02:21:52.050
Oh Scott Blasian Blasian cause I'm black and Asian.
I get it.
Yeah.

2456
02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:54.140
Tiger woods say something like that.
No,

2457
02:21:54.141 --> 02:21:58.820
he said he's cut Blasian when Oprah and told her,
told her she wasn't,

2458
02:21:58.821 --> 02:22:02.900
he wasn't black and black people got so,
Ooh,
that's a tough one to swallow.

2459
02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:04.210
Well,

2460
02:22:04.210 --> 02:22:09.210
I tell you what it's tougher is I was up for a job is a very prominent black

2461
02:22:09.951 --> 02:22:12.400
producer told me I wasn't black enough for the job.

2462
02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:17.360
When I get old on theirs,
tanning booths close by.

2463
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:22.040
I'll be back in four days and where rock you fucking world.

2464
02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:27.240
But he has to like,
if you go to like a tanning every day,

2465
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:31.650
I could not get black car,
but I wouldn't get black.

2466
02:22:31.651 --> 02:22:35.870
Can get dark.
You could get dark but not black.
You can get black.
Well,

2467
02:22:35.871 --> 02:22:38.460
what do they want?
What do you want it black?
Like Wesley Snipes?

2468
02:22:40.350 --> 02:22:43.090
No disrespect,
but I guess they said,

2469
02:22:43.170 --> 02:22:46.290
but I think it was more than just skin color.
They wanted a certain,

2470
02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:50.940
there was a certain role they wanted to,
I don't like me.
You don't think,
oh,

2471
02:22:50.941 --> 02:22:53.760
straight up black dude.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

2472
02:22:55.850 --> 02:22:57.090
I mean that's the thing,
man.
Look,

2473
02:22:57.091 --> 02:23:00.120
if you're making a story and you want these characters in the story,

2474
02:23:00.121 --> 02:23:04.550
like say if you have some big fucking goon who terrorizes people,

2475
02:23:04.551 --> 02:23:07.560
you can't get Kevin Hart to play that role and that doesn't make any sense.
No.

2476
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:11.910
That's where the rock comes in.
Right.
Big giant dude.
You know what I'm saying?

2477
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:16.860
Everybody has to have,
you know that's a weird thing about acting too.
It's like,

2478
02:23:16.861 --> 02:23:21.510
man,
you gotta hope somebody has something that you would do good in.
You know,

2479
02:23:21.511 --> 02:23:24.840
like you have to always hope that someone's got a project that you could slot

2480
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:28.980
into that project.
Yeah.
Or You just got to create your own.
That that's true.

2481
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:33.030
To the best.
Is Billy Bob Thornton.
That's Slingblade thing.
Yeah.

2482
02:23:33.031 --> 02:23:37.110
Do you know what he did?
No,
he apparently he was like working on some movie,

2483
02:23:37.111 --> 02:23:39.850
like at some bullshit part in some movie and uh,

2484
02:23:39.870 --> 02:23:44.150
he was like super depressed and started doing this fucking character man,
man,

2485
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:44.580
you know,

2486
02:23:44.580 --> 02:23:49.380
he does that character from sling and then we'll do it in the mirror and shit

2487
02:23:49.381 --> 02:23:51.930
and practice it and decided to make a whole fucking movie about it.

2488
02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:55.920
And that movie,
the launched him like it was his own idea.
Well,
I mean,

2489
02:23:55.921 --> 02:23:57.090
it's kind of like what you're doing.

2490
02:23:57.091 --> 02:24:00.540
You just decided to do your own thing and now you control your own destiny.

2491
02:24:00.541 --> 02:24:04.770
That's where we all need to get to.
Like,
honestly,
this,
you know,

2492
02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:10.440
what I love about comedy right now is I like Jo Koy was my mentors and he's

2493
02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:15.420
blown up in comedy,
you know,
so I see people like you,
Joe,
and you know,

2494
02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:20.460
a pill per and just a Thiel Vod who took me out my very first time doing comedy

2495
02:24:21.151 --> 02:24:25.100
ever did it really?
Madison,
Wisconsin,
you know at uh,

2496
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:27.610
I think it's called state on six or six on stage.

2497
02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.100
That's the first time you ever got paid.

2498
02:24:29.130 --> 02:24:32.040
That's the first time I ever got paid and he's the first person to ever take me

2499
02:24:32.041 --> 02:24:35.070
out.
And I remember we landed and he goes,
you're not,

2500
02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:37.800
you're going to see grown men eating cheese.

2501
02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.170
Like well like sharing bags of cheese.
That's it.

2502
02:24:42.171 --> 02:24:44.700
And what's got w as soon as we got off the plane,

2503
02:24:44.701 --> 02:24:48.720
literally two men on a bit sharing a bag of cheese and he was like,

2504
02:24:48.721 --> 02:24:52.790
I told you like it was very weird.
So weird.

2505
02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:56.820
The culture of cheese and Wisconsin.
Anyway,
it's so you're making now,

2506
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:59.250
not the yells blown up like you're making your own path.

2507
02:24:59.251 --> 02:25:02.700
And I think with comedy now is the time where people can make their own path and

2508
02:25:02.701 --> 02:25:05.670
control their own destiny and we get paid really well.

2509
02:25:05.671 --> 02:25:07.860
I mean just go to the comedy store and look at the parking lot now.

2510
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:13.410
Well it's what it is now is you not dependent upon networks anymore.

2511
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:17.400
The networks that we've created or what I was like to refer to as an organic

2512
02:25:17.401 --> 02:25:21.090
network.
There's a network of friends,

2513
02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:24.430
like when you're talking about bill or Tom Seger,

2514
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:26.200
<v 3>RSF chefy or whoever,</v>

2515
02:25:26.201 --> 02:25:31.060
these people are crystally all these like really successful popular comedians

2516
02:25:31.061 --> 02:25:35.530
right now,
Theo and so and so and so,
Andrew Santina,
these guys are all,

2517
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:39.940
we're all friends with each other and everyone knows like if someone says this

2518
02:25:39.941 --> 02:25:41.120
guy is funny,
he's like,

2519
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:43.960
well listen to the guys who are telling you these guys are all hilarious.

2520
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:46.870
They know who the funny people are.
They know where the pretenders are too.

2521
02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:50.200
They don't talk about them and they avoid them and then you know who the funny

2522
02:25:50.201 --> 02:25:54.070
people are and you just,
it's an organic network,
like there's no paperwork,

2523
02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:55.570
but everybody helps everybody.

2524
02:25:55.571 --> 02:25:59.200
And one of the beautiful things about it is no one's fighting for scraps
anymore.

2525
02:25:59.201 --> 02:26:03.010
It's not like there's TV shows and there's only like if you and me are in the

2526
02:26:03.011 --> 02:26:06.580
audition room and we're friends,
but we're both auditioning for the same role,

2527
02:26:06.581 --> 02:26:10.420
like I don't really wish you were.
He well know.
I hope I might fuck with you.

2528
02:26:10.690 --> 02:26:15.220
I'm like,
do you sweating?
We'll be doing nuc nervous.
You okay?
It's an easy Gig,

2529
02:26:15.310 --> 02:26:16.750
right?
You're done nervous about that,
right?

2530
02:26:16.751 --> 02:26:19.870
You're going to go in there and perform so you're not eating each other each

2531
02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:23.590
other.
You're not,
you're not scratching and clawing for scraps.

2532
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:25.900
Everybody can support each other because first of all,

2533
02:26:26.170 --> 02:26:30.640
there's fucking thousands of places to perform just in this country.

2534
02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:34.390
Thousands.
And there's only a certain amount of Comedians,

2535
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:36.900
like there's plenty of room forever.

2536
02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.000
<v 1>Well,
what I love about,
uh,
like,
oh you guys doing the podcast and blowing up.</v>

2537
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:43.190
It's Jason Segel.

2538
02:26:43.191 --> 02:26:46.580
I used to interview him a lot when he was making movies and stuff and he said,

2539
02:26:46.850 --> 02:26:49.310
the thing about Judd Apatow is after freaks and geeks.

2540
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:52.610
Judd basically made his own network,
you know,

2541
02:26:52.611 --> 02:26:56.390
James Franco and those guys and they supported each other no matter what.

2542
02:26:56.630 --> 02:27:00.590
And I see that same thing happening now and it's good what Comedians,

2543
02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:04.400
comedians are pairing up and saying,
this is our group and if you're funny,

2544
02:27:04.401 --> 02:27:05.350
you're funny and let's,

2545
02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:10.130
let's watch each other's back instead of competing is now like for,
you know,

2546
02:27:10.131 --> 02:27:12.950
I've only been in at nine years,
you know,
I know you've been in a lot longer,

2547
02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:18.100
but my nine years I saw at the beginning a lot of hate and now I'm seeing people

2548
02:27:19.311 --> 02:27:23.480
like now jump on each other's podcasts and it and actually encouraged each
other,

2549
02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:27.470
push each other,
which I think is a great shift for comedy right now.
Well,

2550
02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:30.770
that's the big difference between podcasts and radio because radio guys always

2551
02:27:30.771 --> 02:27:33.800
hated other radio guys.
They always taught him other radio guys.
Like,

2552
02:27:33.801 --> 02:27:36.710
I want that morning spot and this guy's going to try to steal it from me.

2553
02:27:36.711 --> 02:27:41.060
And he's a,
he's across town.
Fuck him.
Yeah,
podcast,
don't do that.

2554
02:27:41.061 --> 02:27:44.720
We get on each other's podcasts and we support each other's podcasts.

2555
02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:46.550
It's like there's plenty of people,
man.

2556
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.150
There's this famine mentalities would fucked everybody up.
It is,

2557
02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:54.410
but that's what Hollywood puts out there.
You know,
it's just the circumstances.

2558
02:27:54.411 --> 02:27:57.750
It's not like it's an organized effort.
No,
it's not there.
This family,

2559
02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.160
<v 3>it's just that this,
there was a search like we were talking about earlier,</v>

2560
02:28:01.161 --> 02:28:02.030
like if you're an actor,

2561
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:04.550
you've got to hope somebody got something that you fit in to.
Yeah.

2562
02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:08.000
So all the other dudes that are like,
you man,
you're competing against them.

2563
02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:11.540
And then you know,
you hear a fucking,
some James Franco type dude got the role.

2564
02:28:11.541 --> 02:28:15.560
You're like,
of course he's famous.
Fuck,
I can't,
I'm never going to catch a break.

2565
02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.461
And this is the,

2566
02:28:16.461 --> 02:28:19.460
this is the feeling that a lot of like really depressed act or sat.

2567
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:19.800
<v 1>Well,</v>

2568
02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:24.230
it's interesting because I was up for these huge hosting gig like last year and

2569
02:28:24.231 --> 02:28:27.500
look like I was going to get it.
And then the night before they say,
oh,

2570
02:28:27.501 --> 02:28:31.970
we gave it to this bigger guy.
Like he was a celebrity's name.
No,

2571
02:28:31.971 --> 02:28:36.700
I won't say his name.
He's,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
nope,
nope,
nope.
No,
no,

2572
02:28:37.330 --> 02:28:41.480
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You know me,
Joe.
I'm very safe.
I'm very safe.
Joe.

2573
02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:46.250
I'm still trying to make it like you.
He got an Indian.
My ages goes,

2574
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:48.080
you don't sound upset.
I was like,
no,

2575
02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.970
because the way I'm wired is I need to get to that level where I'm getting jobs

2576
02:28:52.971 --> 02:28:54.680
I don't deserve.
I know what I mean.

2577
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:02.450
I see why you wouldn't say his name.
No,
you playing it safe.
Put your nut.

2578
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:05.150
But he knows who he is.
No,
he's out there listening to you right now.

2579
02:29:05.390 --> 02:29:09.520
You're better than,
you're better in the audition to him.
He did this better.

2580
02:29:09.521 --> 02:29:11.510
I said about you and that's what they're telling me.

2581
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:13.550
What your agents are telling you.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2582
02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.610
The casting people are telling me this,
but I don't try to fuck you.
No,
no,
no,

2583
02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:23.610
sure.
I'm positive.
Positive.
So what I get to that point,
I'm just like,

2584
02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:27.050
I reversed and I was like,
dude,
when you get to a certain level,

2585
02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:30.440
you get shit.
You don't necessarily,

2586
02:29:30.470 --> 02:29:33.550
he probably didn't even know he was going out for the show.
They really like it.

2587
02:29:33.551 --> 02:29:36.590
Hey,
we've got a new contract and we heard you could do it.
You know what I mean?

2588
02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:39.260
Yeah,
maybe,
but that's this industry.
Once you get to a certain point,

2589
02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:43.550
you get gigs,
you start getting paid.
Once your podcasts blew up,

2590
02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:48.620
you can people send you stuff,
you know?
And that's how this whole thing works.

2591
02:29:48.621 --> 02:29:53.150
And so my mentality is I needed to get to that point where people start giving

2592
02:29:53.151 --> 02:29:56.180
me things and that means working harder.
Okay,
great.
Working harder,

2593
02:29:56.181 --> 02:29:57.950
building my brand,
doing stand up.
I'll do that.

2594
02:29:57.980 --> 02:30:01.130
Don't ever say building your brand.
Don't say that ever again.
Building my brand.

2595
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:02.890
Don't do it.
Well,
okay,
don't,
okay.

2596
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.260
That's some nonsense talk that they throw around brand.

2597
02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:08.600
You're building your brand,
man.
Hey Dude,

2598
02:30:08.601 --> 02:30:10.580
I really love with you doing your thing with your brand.

2599
02:30:10.940 --> 02:30:13.640
That's like a Hollywood thing that they say.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2600
02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:17.030
I love what you're doing with your brand.
Ill

2601
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:22.920
the fuck man.
You don't think a brand is real?
Well,
brands are real like,
uh,

2602
02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:26.420
I'm wearing converse sneakers.
Those are real.

2603
02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:30.890
But see to me when I hear her say I'm wearing under Armour.
Yeah,
I like the rock.

2604
02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:32.950
You always support to Liz campaigns.

2605
02:30:32.970 --> 02:30:37.220
My buddy campaign sent me these will go that they're nice.
Oh wait a minute.

2606
02:30:37.310 --> 02:30:40.030
I like them.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
But like what I,

2607
02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:42.710
your pocket and your podcast is a brand.

2608
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:46.510
I don't think of it that way really well,
but it is thinking about or not,

2609
02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:50.480
but he wouldn't show Rogan experience is a brand,
but building my brand,

2610
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:54.470
like literally there's zero thought of that.
Okay,
got you.
You know,

2611
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:58.460
you're just doing you.
I just just do what I want to do.
Hey man,
just be yourself.

2612
02:30:59.010 --> 02:31:03.560
Just be yourself.
It's,
it's possible.
I am absolutely just doing that.
You know,

2613
02:31:03.561 --> 02:31:05.900
I'm just really lucky that there's a slot,
right?

2614
02:31:05.901 --> 02:31:08.840
Like that I have interests that are like the like,

2615
02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:14.090
like the fact that I do standup comedy and I also do cage fighting commentary

2616
02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:16.880
that's not supposed to exist.
Right.
But to create it.

2617
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:20.040
But it exists because there's a slot.
I got lucky that there was

2618
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:23.310
<v 0>a slot there.
You know that this exists,
this is a sport exists.</v>

2619
02:31:23.311 --> 02:31:26.880
Then I have an understanding of it and a deep appreciation for it.

2620
02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:29.520
And then the comedy exist too.
And then I like that too.

2621
02:31:29.521 --> 02:31:32.940
Like you don't have to do comedy,
nobody has to do comedy.
But for me it was like,

2622
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.710
oh,
like you could do that.
But isn't it an amazing like with like what,

2623
02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:40.950
I'll be honest with you,
when I came on I was like,
oh my God,

2624
02:31:40.951 --> 02:31:44.160
this is such a big show.
It's a huge show.
People get nervous.

2625
02:31:44.370 --> 02:31:46.590
I talked to a lot of people that come on the first time people get nervous

2626
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:48.990
coming to the show,
but what are we got all that booze over there.
Well,
yeah,

2627
02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:53.040
but what's amazing is do you ever think about like if somebody is on your show,

2628
02:31:53.041 --> 02:31:57.810
literally whatever they're selling or like you'll get somebody on this show that

2629
02:31:57.811 --> 02:32:00.690
becomes a regular and now they're selling out all across the country.

2630
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:05.040
And that's pretty amazing.
The power of that you hold.
You know what I mean?

2631
02:32:05.041 --> 02:32:08.280
Which is great.
Which is great.
Which blows me away that,
you know,

2632
02:32:08.281 --> 02:32:12.050
like the last time I saw that,
uh,
I remember,
you know,

2633
02:32:12.090 --> 02:32:15.480
I was at Chelsea lately at the beginning of it and when that show was at its

2634
02:32:15.481 --> 02:32:17.340
peak,
I say,
Chelsea lately,

2635
02:32:17.341 --> 02:32:20.730
Chelsea handler was the American idol of comedy at the end.

2636
02:32:20.731 --> 02:32:23.550
Then if you were on that show,
I didn't even do stand up,

2637
02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:26.310
like literally I was three months in a,

2638
02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:31.230
I would bring five comedians and do like 15 minutes in between everybody and

2639
02:32:31.231 --> 02:32:35.160
bring and sell out shows because I was on that shit.
That's how much power.

2640
02:32:35.370 --> 02:32:38.820
Like she brought comedians that were retired back.
She brought in,

2641
02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:43.880
that was the first time I saw like one show could be so powerful in a niche

2642
02:32:44.821 --> 02:32:46.920
audience where if you love comedy,

2643
02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:49.530
you're going to sell out all these people shows while it's hot.

2644
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:53.910
And now it seems like this show is that like comedians come on here and they're

2645
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:56.640
just selling out all over the place.
And that's a,
that's a tribute to you,

2646
02:32:56.641 --> 02:32:59.400
man and your audience,
how they're so passionate about you.

2647
02:32:59.550 --> 02:33:01.890
And I'm not here to kiss your ass,
but I all,
it's just not,

2648
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:06.890
not bullshitting people and not having people on that suck.
Like doing your bet.

2649
02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:11.760
Like I try to go after,
like to get guys on,
I like you guys are,
I don't know,

2650
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:13.290
hear about them.
You know,

2651
02:33:13.291 --> 02:33:16.910
like Andrew Schultz or Dell and I hear about these guys from New York and people

2652
02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:19.680
tell me,
hey,
you gotta see this guy,
this guy's fucking funny Joe list.

2653
02:33:19.980 --> 02:33:23.550
A lot of people told me,
get these guys on and you know,
look,

2654
02:33:23.551 --> 02:33:27.600
I am a whatever I can do to support comedy.
I'm a fan.

2655
02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:30.990
I'm a fan of comedy.
I love it.
Even if I was never doing it,

2656
02:33:30.991 --> 02:33:32.490
even though I decided right now,

2657
02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:37.440
I don't want everyone to tell jokes on stage ever again.
I will always watch.

2658
02:33:37.770 --> 02:33:40.810
I love it.
I love standup.
I'll always love standup.

2659
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:45.690
So if I can do something and help stand up and helps comedians be successful and

2660
02:33:45.691 --> 02:33:50.691
it helps encourage more people to try it because I think there's thousands and

2661
02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:55.110
thousands of,
uh,
just unexplored standups across the country.

2662
02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:58.770
They just never take a chance.
Never do it.
Never have anybody encourage them.

2663
02:33:58.771 --> 02:34:03.720
Never think about doing it.
If you ever been on say I think it's a super power,

2664
02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:06.150
I really do because your census are so high.

2665
02:34:06.151 --> 02:34:09.450
I'm never been in a situation where when you're onstage,

2666
02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.930
you're saying your act,
you're thinking about something else.

2667
02:34:13.050 --> 02:34:17.620
You're hearing conversations like,
like you're hearing a waitress take order

2668
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:19.810
<v 3>and you're noticing what people are doing.</v>

2669
02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:23.550
Like it's almost like an out of body experience.
Like I in,

2670
02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:28.600
I can't think of any other normal time throughout the day that would ever happen

2671
02:34:28.601 --> 02:34:32.890
where it's pretty amazing what your mind can do when you're on stage.

2672
02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:34.740
We have to train it.
Oh yeah.
No,

2673
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:36.920
I mean that's one of the reasons why I have to do so much stand up.

2674
02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:40.180
Like even for me after 30 years of doing it,

2675
02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:44.290
I still have to do standup four days a week.
I do stand up for days.
Oh yeah.

2676
02:34:44.410 --> 02:34:48.670
If I don't do stand up for weeks earlier,
if I'd take a week off,
that's fine.

2677
02:34:48.671 --> 02:34:51.340
Nothing wrong with it.
I'll take a month off.
Nothing wrong with that.

2678
02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:55.120
But understand that when it's time to roll again,

2679
02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.570
we're gone four days a week.
We're going to do two,
three shows a night.

2680
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:01.480
You're going to go Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday,

2681
02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:03.700
or you're going to do Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday.

2682
02:35:03.730 --> 02:35:04.540
That's what you're doing.

2683
02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:07.210
And that's the only way to do it because if you don't do it that way and you

2684
02:35:07.211 --> 02:35:09.790
don't do three sets a night,
two sets a night,
four sets a night.

2685
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:11.590
If you don't do that,
you never stay.

2686
02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:15.140
You got to get laser beam sharp and the only way to get that D,

2687
02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:18.520
that honed fucking Samurai sword edge,

2688
02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:21.100
you got to constantly be doing it.
It's you,

2689
02:35:21.101 --> 02:35:24.370
that thing that you're doing where you're talking about hearing all these
things,

2690
02:35:24.371 --> 02:35:26.920
but concentrating on what you're saying and being in the moment,

2691
02:35:26.921 --> 02:35:30.220
which is the most critical cause they know when you're not in the moment they

2692
02:35:30.221 --> 02:35:32.970
somehow or another no one,
you're,
you could say the same words,

2693
02:35:33.020 --> 02:35:36.850
the same inflection and it won't work.
Oh,
that's what's amazing about it though.

2694
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:38.570
That's what I love about it.
Like,

2695
02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:44.150
oh I love how you could do two sets in a night and get a totally different

2696
02:35:45.401 --> 02:35:49.600
reaction.
It's so exciting.
I was talking to Darnell Rawlins,
he was like,

2697
02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:53.200
he was talking about what night he had a great set and the next one he didn't

2698
02:35:53.201 --> 02:35:56.140
have too good of a set.
He says,
I went to a grocery store,

2699
02:35:56.141 --> 02:35:57.960
he got on the mic just to get a laugh.
You know,

2700
02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:02.590
it's like I need to get on a mic.

2701
02:36:02.591 --> 02:36:05.980
I needed to get one lap cause you can't go to bed on a bad show.

2702
02:36:06.010 --> 02:36:09.610
Don L is amazing on podcasts.
I tried to talk him into doing a podcast.
Oh,

2703
02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:13.690
he would be so good.
He's starting it.
He's already got a logo.
He's got it.

2704
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:15.550
He's called it too soon with Donna.

2705
02:36:15.551 --> 02:36:20.551
We're always cause half his shit till he is so sunny.

2706
02:36:20.770 --> 02:36:25.450
Manny,
he's a character.
He's such a good dude to just stick a good dude.

2707
02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:28.950
You know who's who's,
who's a person that,
that I,

2708
02:36:28.951 --> 02:36:30.890
I know you're so established now you've got your craft,

2709
02:36:30.891 --> 02:36:34.570
but who's a person that like after they go on you're like,
oh shit,

2710
02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:37.630
I got to bring it.
Is that still that for you?

2711
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:40.900
Because your crowd is soak about it with everybody.

2712
02:36:40.901 --> 02:36:44.200
But I don't think about it in terms of like,
oh shit,
I like comedy.

2713
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:48.520
This is the key to following people like comedy.
Enjoy it.
Go on stage,

2714
02:36:48.521 --> 02:36:51.450
happy like you're laughing and then do your stuff cause it's,

2715
02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:54.030
you're working on in any way.
It's good,
right?
If you,

2716
02:36:54.270 --> 02:36:56.830
if you take enough time and enough effort,

2717
02:36:56.831 --> 02:37:00.400
enough care on your craft and put together an act,

2718
02:37:00.401 --> 02:37:03.970
it's good that people can enjoy it.
So don't worry.

2719
02:37:04.390 --> 02:37:06.280
Enjoy like if like I,

2720
02:37:06.281 --> 02:37:09.640
that's why I brought Joey Diaz and the road with me for so many years because I

2721
02:37:09.641 --> 02:37:12.460
knew that he was just going to erupt that place.
And by the way,

2722
02:37:12.461 --> 02:37:15.040
but when I went on stage,
they were already already in a great,

2723
02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:19.100
they're all laughing.
The laughing hard.
This,
the keys.

2724
02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:22.100
Just everybody should have a good time,
man.
Everybody,

2725
02:37:22.101 --> 02:37:27.030
including your opening act in the Middle Act,
you want murderers to go on.
And I,

2726
02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:31.070
you know,
like the comics I bring aren't as well known yet,
but Leo flowers,

2727
02:37:31.071 --> 02:37:36.050
Nick Care,
Orlando Labor.
But I tell you,
any room they crush,
they crush in.

2728
02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:39.420
Sorry,
one way for Greg Comics to get gray,
but it's like playing on the guy.

2729
02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:41.180
They got to see him.
Absolutely.

2730
02:37:41.181 --> 02:37:43.160
There's a lot of guys out there that people just haven't seen,

2731
02:37:43.161 --> 02:37:47.240
but they're good and I don't and I love coming in after energy.
What about,

2732
02:37:47.241 --> 02:37:49.850
what about the first time you went after a big comic,

2733
02:37:49.851 --> 02:37:52.550
when you were first starting and you did well and it kind of blew you away?

2734
02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:55.550
I don't even know when that happened.
I ate shit for so many years.

2735
02:37:55.551 --> 02:38:00.320
That's all I remember.
I remember eating shit after everyone.
Good.

2736
02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:06.200
I didn't have one good set for like Mitzi used to set me up to.

2737
02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:07.910
She would do it on purpose.
Um,

2738
02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:12.580
she would put you like one of those warm spot in my twenties.
I was,
um,

2739
02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:18.100
young little cutie face and I would go on after fucking murderers like Martin

2740
02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:19.880
Lawrence when he was in his prime,

2741
02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:24.440
when he was wearing leather jumpsuits on stage and leather shirts,
American,

2742
02:38:24.470 --> 02:38:25.041
the room,

2743
02:38:25.041 --> 02:38:29.540
I mean mark in the room where people are falling out of chairs and throwing

2744
02:38:29.541 --> 02:38:30.380
drinks at each other.

2745
02:38:30.730 --> 02:38:34.770
Dan Martin Lawrence was a church in the church.

2746
02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:36.740
She was an assassin man.
I'm telling you,

2747
02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:39.230
people forgot how good he was for a few years.

2748
02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:43.880
There was a few years where Martin Lawrence was nuke and crowds just like,
boom.

2749
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.020
Yeah,
she and I would get on after him and literally people would,
just,

2750
02:38:48.021 --> 02:38:51.950
three quarters of the audience would get up and walk.
When he was off,

2751
02:38:51.951 --> 02:38:54.450
they were done.
They were done.
They were ready to go home.
There were,

2752
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:57.740
they were crying.
They were holding their body like,
oh Jesus.

2753
02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:00.360
And then I would get on,
say some nonsensical,
like,
well,

2754
02:39:00.370 --> 02:39:02.660
let's get the fuck out of it.
Let's go eat.
And they would just leave.

2755
02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:07.580
And that was,
um,
the reality of my time at the comedy store when Mitzi would,
uh,

2756
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:09.530
she wanted you to know you ain't shit,

2757
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:13.850
don't get crazy and you gotta figure out how the fuck can you go on after all

2758
02:39:13.851 --> 02:39:17.180
these murders?
When did you figure it out?
It took a long time.
Yeah.
I don't know.

2759
02:39:17.181 --> 02:39:21.680
I'm going,
when I came here,
I was only six years into comedy,
so a really,

2760
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:25.790
I didn't have any seasoning.
I was,
I was really like a scrub,
you know?
I was like,

2761
02:39:25.791 --> 02:39:29.120
I had some material I had like I could do an hour on the road,

2762
02:39:29.121 --> 02:39:31.700
but it was half of it was bullshit and I was trying to figure it out,

2763
02:39:31.701 --> 02:39:32.960
but adds a few good bits,

2764
02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:35.810
but they weren't good enough and I didn't have the confidence to go on after a

2765
02:39:35.811 --> 02:39:39.410
Martin Lawrence or a dice clay or anybody who was really good.
You know,

2766
02:39:39.411 --> 02:39:43.220
anybody who was a really famous,
I would get nervous or Jesus,
you know?

2767
02:39:43.430 --> 02:39:48.350
But that's that.
But through that I figured out a way to do it.
You know,

2768
02:39:48.351 --> 02:39:49.580
I figured out a way like,
okay,

2769
02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:53.150
I have to figure out a way to grab people and let them know that I know the

2770
02:39:53.151 --> 02:39:57.200
situation.
Like,
oh this unknown fucking loser has to follow Martin Lawrence.

2771
02:39:57.350 --> 02:39:59.930
What a thrill.
What a thrill for me watching everybody get up.

2772
02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:03.470
And so I can fill up material for like bombing,
like,

2773
02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:07.550
like inevitable bombing and recognizing the bombing and addressing it with all

2774
02:40:07.551 --> 02:40:10.610
the rest of the audience.
And then people started laughing,
you know,
like,
uh,

2775
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:14.190
I had a fall prior for five in a row

2776
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:19.220
<v 0>when he was at the comedy store when he was really sick and um,</v>

2777
02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:25.130
uh,
delayed,
great Mallarme Maryland,
Martinez,
her husband,
um,

2778
02:40:25.170 --> 02:40:26.820
and Chewy,
who was the door guy?

2779
02:40:26.821 --> 02:40:31.350
The common store you used to help Richard prior to the stage and it would take

2780
02:40:31.351 --> 02:40:33.590
forever because they would walk him cause you know,

2781
02:40:33.591 --> 02:40:37.710
it's losing control of his body and they sat them down and they would crank the

2782
02:40:37.711 --> 02:40:39.900
microphone up to like as loud as it goes.

2783
02:40:39.901 --> 02:40:44.490
So it was like he would hear the feedback
and he would drink,

2784
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:47.300
would probably wasn't supposed to be doing cause he was on medication and just

2785
02:40:47.310 --> 02:40:51.750
drinking and just just talking and a lot of it was really sad because you

2786
02:40:51.751 --> 02:40:55.160
realize like,
wow,
this is the greatest comic of our time.
I mean,
yeah,

2787
02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:58.260
he's on the wall here in the studio.
Yeah.
I mean he's a,

2788
02:40:58.320 --> 02:40:59.730
if he's not the greatest ever,

2789
02:40:59.731 --> 02:41:03.120
he certainly in the conversation it's like who's the greatest,
I don't know.

2790
02:41:03.450 --> 02:41:08.450
But there's a handful of like super important pioneers is Lenny Bruce and

2791
02:41:08.821 --> 02:41:11.700
there's Richard Pryor.
Those are the two top,
in my opinion,

2792
02:41:11.701 --> 02:41:14.250
there's the ones that are the most important for the art form,

2793
02:41:14.251 --> 02:41:17.790
and this is obviously George Carlin and Kennison and he'd go down the line and

2794
02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:20.820
Eddie Murphy who were talking about for the show to still to this day,

2795
02:41:20.850 --> 02:41:22.630
I think it was one of the all time.
Great.

2796
02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:26.970
I was telling you before I got a chance to talk to Eddie like two years ago,

2797
02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:30.660
he came out with a serious movie,
more dramatic,
I forgot,
I forgot the name of it,

2798
02:41:30.661 --> 02:41:33.990
but it was really good.
And I asked them,
you know,
being a comment,
I was like,

2799
02:41:33.991 --> 02:41:37.140
why haven't you shot another special?
And he goes,

2800
02:41:37.350 --> 02:41:41.850
I have to put too much of my personal life in it and I'm not ready to do that

2801
02:41:41.851 --> 02:41:46.440
yet.
And it Kinda hit me where,
you know,
if you go back and listen to his comedy,

2802
02:41:46.441 --> 02:41:48.270
he talked about his real life.
He talked about his parents,

2803
02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:50.310
he did a lot of what Richard Pryor did.
Yeah,

2804
02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:53.170
he's very personal and you've got to remember it.
I think more of it.

2805
02:41:53.210 --> 02:41:56.760
A Lot's gone on in his life over the last 1520 years.

2806
02:41:57.060 --> 02:42:01.560
And I think if he didn't address things when he hit the stage,
people go,

2807
02:42:01.561 --> 02:42:05.490
why didn't he talk about that?
Where Chris Rock and Kevin Hart,

2808
02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:09.360
they will address whatever stories out about them and go full steam ahead.

2809
02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:13.530
And I think Eddie Murphy probably respects the craft too much where he's like,

2810
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:17.100
I can't do it halfway.
If I,
if I'm not going to do 100% I'm not going to do it.

2811
02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:20.370
That's what I took from that conversation from him.

2812
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:22.740
That makes sense and also just think about it.

2813
02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:25.620
He has two of the best specials probably ever made back then.

2814
02:42:25.650 --> 02:42:28.620
Like the two biggest where everybody still no good at Google.

2815
02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:31.950
Like people still can say that has a vibe.

2816
02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:36.810
You know like people still quit those two.
Yeah,
look,

2817
02:42:36.811 --> 02:42:39.780
he's a,
he's an all time great.
Even if he never does a joke again,

2818
02:42:39.781 --> 02:42:42.270
but he's still got it.
That's what's crazy.
100% he got,

2819
02:42:42.271 --> 02:42:45.300
did you ever see that thing that he did where he was roasting bill Cosby when

2820
02:42:45.301 --> 02:42:49.650
they took away his honorary degree?
Dude,
his timing was sharp.

2821
02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:52.650
Like you were like,
oh my God,
he could go do stand up right now.

2822
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:56.550
But the pressure of that,
because he has two specials,

2823
02:42:56.551 --> 02:43:00.160
it's kind of like a compared to Dr Dre,
after Dr Dre made the crowded day,

2824
02:43:00.161 --> 02:43:02.070
I was like,
oh,
he's going to come out with another one.

2825
02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:04.770
And then it got to a point where,
how do you back up?

2826
02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:08.510
I mean the greatness of those two specials.
I mean it's a lot to live up to.

2827
02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:12.340
Not saying he ever couldn't,
but people are always going to say,
man,

2828
02:43:12.341 --> 02:43:15.850
you remember delirious and raw.
I wish he was like that.
You know?

2829
02:43:15.851 --> 02:43:17.800
And I think that's the fear mean maybe.

2830
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:21.760
I mean you could make that argument about a lot of guys that did keep going,

2831
02:43:22.300 --> 02:43:24.940
you know,
to give me a lot of guys.

2832
02:43:24.941 --> 02:43:27.850
But those guys that kept going to have a delirious,
so raw,

2833
02:43:28.090 --> 02:43:29.260
you know like to network.

2834
02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:34.210
Like I remember first time going to a movie theater to see a standup comedy

2835
02:43:34.211 --> 02:43:39.130
special two times delirious and raw.
Like who does that?

2836
02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:43.510
Kevin Hart does it.
But like that's your,
that was my first,
Oh my God.

2837
02:43:43.810 --> 02:43:46.090
Eddie Murphy on the big screen.

2838
02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:49.030
And those are locked in the history of time.

2839
02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.690
People are going to know those two standup specials for raw for sure.

2840
02:43:52.770 --> 02:43:56.410
Delirious I think was on Hbo,
wasn't it?
I don't remember what's wrong.

2841
02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:59.530
I think delirious was,
I think it was an HBO special.

2842
02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:02.110
All I remember and I think rob was in the mood raw.
Okay.

2843
02:44:02.290 --> 02:44:03.220
So rob was in the movies,

2844
02:44:03.221 --> 02:44:07.390
but it's a kid like me going to the movies to see it and he was so big at the

2845
02:44:07.391 --> 02:44:09.610
time.
And just to follow those up,

2846
02:44:10.090 --> 02:44:12.880
that might've been part of the problem with him too.
He might've got too big.

2847
02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:16.000
That happens to certain comedians like that happened to Steve Martin.

2848
02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:18.880
Steve Martin talked about that.
I mean,

2849
02:44:18.910 --> 02:44:22.090
I don't think either one of us is ever going to understand and how famous Eddie

2850
02:44:22.090 --> 02:44:25.750
Murphy is like what it's like to be Eddie Murphy at that time.
No,
I mean,

2851
02:44:25.751 --> 02:44:28.900
come on now man.
People see him and they get weirded out.

2852
02:44:28.930 --> 02:44:30.040
I got weirded out when I met him,

2853
02:44:30.220 --> 02:44:34.980
put it in theaters for years after it aired on Hbo.
Delirious.
Yeah.
Theaters.

2854
02:44:34.990 --> 02:44:36.820
Yeah.
Um,
uh,

2855
02:44:36.821 --> 02:44:41.500
dice clay had an HBO or a movie theater film.
Um,
he did.

2856
02:44:41.501 --> 02:44:45.860
Um,
he did a,
uh,
oh did,
um,

2857
02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:48.290
dice clay had a movie theater one.
Uh,

2858
02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.920
Gabriel Iglesias has done one that's been in the movies.

2859
02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:55.720
Of course Kevin Hart has just been a few guys who've done them in the movies.

2860
02:44:56.170 --> 02:45:00.790
But yeah.
But I remember like,
you know,
Kevin Hart's was great.
Everybody,

2861
02:45:00.970 --> 02:45:04.210
but I,
for some reason,
maybe because I was a kid,
it was so big to me,

2862
02:45:04.410 --> 02:45:07.540
but to me it was like an event.
You know,
I'm older now,

2863
02:45:07.580 --> 02:45:11.020
I'll go to see Kevin Hart and a movie theater.
But when I was a kid,

2864
02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:15.850
stand up was an event.
I want to just like,
like that.
Yeah.

2865
02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:18.280
Cause you're,
you're hearing curse words.
The,
you know,

2866
02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:22.060
you're hearing all these years to this day,
still reciting stuff from him.

2867
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:26.370
That's a lot of comedy specials.
You don't know the worst 30 years later.
Yeah.

2868
02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:27.490
Well I,

2869
02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:32.580
the first special I ever saw for sure was Richard Pryor live in the sunset

2870
02:45:33.041 --> 02:45:37.870
trail.
I saw my parents took me see it.
You were there?
Yeah.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2871
02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:40.280
Washington.
The movie theater.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Now.

2872
02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:41.440
I was watching it in the movie theater.

2873
02:45:41.441 --> 02:45:44.710
My parents took me and I couldn't believe it.

2874
02:45:44.890 --> 02:45:48.790
Like I had never seen anything that funny.
I couldn't imagine it.

2875
02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:53.770
It's so hard today for an anyone to understand what it was like to hear that

2876
02:45:53.771 --> 02:45:56.560
stuff back.
And when I was at 79 or some shit,

2877
02:45:56.590 --> 02:46:01.060
when was a one was live on the sunsets trip to that bear joke.

2878
02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:03.370
Every I'm up the fire.
Yeah.

2879
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:10.040
He was doing jokes about burning

2880
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.310
<v 1>himself and we were crying,
laughing.
Hilarious.</v>

2881
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:18.730
What year it released in [inaudible] 83 was it really live in the sense of taped

2882
02:46:19.401 --> 02:46:22.790
an 82 really good.
Okay,
so I was mean.
That makes sense.
He had to tape it twice.

2883
02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:26.510
No,
I wasn't 13 olds.
What else?

2884
02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:30.440
Like 80 45 1515 I was 15 years old.
Well,
let's see.
I was,

2885
02:46:30.890 --> 02:46:34.790
I was nine so I saw,
I saw both of those movies and I remember,

2886
02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:38.060
I remember Richard Pryor.
I was like,
wow,

2887
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:40.130
Eddie and Richard,

2888
02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.330
you could tell Eddie studied Richard because they had the same mannerisms.

2889
02:46:44.331 --> 02:46:47.630
They had a couple of the same jokes too.
Just in a different way.

2890
02:46:47.930 --> 02:46:48.531
You know what I mean?

2891
02:46:48.531 --> 02:46:53.531
So it was kind of a thing where I fell in love with Richard Pryor cause that was

2892
02:46:53.991 --> 02:46:56.330
my first six but I was nine,
you know,

2893
02:46:56.331 --> 02:47:00.120
and I saw sunset strip and then I saw the documentary where he had to shoot a

2894
02:47:00.121 --> 02:47:00.954
two nights in a row.

2895
02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:05.300
The first night he bombed and he told everybody to come back the next night.

2896
02:47:05.301 --> 02:47:09.860
And that's the one they shot.
He shot,
he shot,
he shot it two nights in a row.

2897
02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:12.770
First one that he apologized to the crowd.
It wasn't going well.

2898
02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:14.240
And the second night he said,

2899
02:47:14.241 --> 02:47:17.210
y'all need to come back and we're going to try this again.

2900
02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:19.430
And so why would he want the same crowd?

2901
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:22.730
Because he felt like he did a disservice to them.
But what,

2902
02:47:22.731 --> 02:47:26.540
that's so weird that he brought it back to Sam.
Yes.
And he meets,

2903
02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:29.330
he showed his true hundred percent.
It's in this documentary.

2904
02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:33.490
You don't believe it?
I believe it.
I can't.

2905
02:47:33.890 --> 02:47:36.230
I mean that's what was in the documentary.
Yeah.

2906
02:47:36.231 --> 02:47:38.840
But kind of like wouldn't want the same crowd to come back.

2907
02:47:39.050 --> 02:47:42.260
Well he his same material unless he stopped it short.
Well no,

2908
02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:44.810
he didn't finish the shot.
He didn't finish his wrong with him.

2909
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:48.680
He said he was just off like he,
it was him.
It was him.

2910
02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:52.910
And he goes in and they were talking about the first like 15 minutes of the set

2911
02:47:52.911 --> 02:47:56.840
or 20 minutes of the set did not go well and he just stopped it and said,
look,

2912
02:47:56.841 --> 02:48:00.190
I'm not bringing it tonight.
It's off.
Y'All come back tomorrow night.

2913
02:48:00.191 --> 02:48:01.310
Jesus Christ.

2914
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:04.130
And they kept the cameras and they shot it the next night and that's,

2915
02:48:04.250 --> 02:48:09.250
and that's what you have in 19 so in 1983 I was either 14 or 15 and here it is.

2916
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:13.350
Sorry,
I came out in 82 this

2917
02:48:16.890 --> 02:48:21.480
was 82 that means I was 14 yeah,
I was eight.
Yeah,

2918
02:48:21.490 --> 02:48:25.160
it was either 14 or 15 which makes sense.
This is a fun fact.

2919
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:26.870
I definitely know it was pretty pussy for me.

2920
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:31.340
See the film editor train of thought,
forgot most of his material.

2921
02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:34.610
He apologize to the audience and end of the show early leaving the audience

2922
02:48:34.611 --> 02:48:38.270
angry prior pull themselves together and gave a much better performance the next

2923
02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:41.670
night.
Most of the footage in the film was from the second performance.
Yeah,

2924
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:46.520
completely messed up his performance during the first filming of the show.

2925
02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:49.640
Yeah.
But that doesn't say he brought the same audience back.

2926
02:48:49.641 --> 02:48:53.300
Well and the documentaries that he said,
well,
because it was only one show.

2927
02:48:54.590 --> 02:48:56.990
What do you mean they didn't shoot to show specials?

2928
02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:58.520
Like they only take one night.

2929
02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.470
Well he said they filmed one and then they filmed it again.

2930
02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:04.520
He filmed it again the next night.
So that crowd,
I mean,

2931
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:09.210
how are you going to get a crowd?
He didn't get a crowd
in the documentary.

2932
02:49:09.211 --> 02:49:13.830
He said he told everybody because he felt so bad that he write,
he cares.

2933
02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:17.810
He just stopped the show and he stopped the show.
It was like,
yeah.

2934
02:49:18.330 --> 02:49:20.370
And he bought what?
The document,

2935
02:49:20.371 --> 02:49:23.180
it says he brought the same crowd back the next night and he murdered it.

2936
02:49:23.181 --> 02:49:27.780
And that's what you saw?
Yeah.
Wow.
And I still remember that.

2937
02:49:27.970 --> 02:49:30.880
I mean those two,
like a raw,

2938
02:49:30.910 --> 02:49:35.610
delirious in the sunset strip life forever,

2939
02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:38.520
it will stand out in my mind.
It's just,
it's just amazing.

2940
02:49:38.521 --> 02:49:41.310
And then like bill burst special,
the,
the black and white one,

2941
02:49:41.311 --> 02:49:45.330
it's like incredible,
incredible.
You know?
And I just,

2942
02:49:45.630 --> 02:49:50.280
I love watching comedy of people with jokes that I know I never could do.

2943
02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:54.280
That's my own thing,
you know,
I don't like watching cause I'm a family comedian,

2944
02:49:54.281 --> 02:49:58.650
so I'd never watched like family to me,
I talk about family most of the time,

2945
02:49:58.990 --> 02:50:01.380
like don't come.
I don't curse that much.

2946
02:50:01.530 --> 02:50:06.300
How often you curse and an hour show twice maybe.

2947
02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:10.800
What,
what words you use?
Shit.
Yeah.
You have to say fuck no,

2948
02:50:11.010 --> 02:50:15.660
no,
no.
But I say person real nice.
Freaking this freaking guy.

2949
02:50:15.690 --> 02:50:19.070
Do you have said that?
No,
don't say frickin whatever you do fricking,

2950
02:50:19.490 --> 02:50:23.910
that's an fee more offensive to me then.
Fuck yeah.
Oh No,
I just fricking guy.

2951
02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:27.570
It's not in my,
I'm sure I curse a couple of times in this pod,
but I don't,

2952
02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:29.870
it's not in my normal conversation.
Like I,

2953
02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:34.170
even when I'm hanging out with my dude's,
I don't really curse that much.
Yeah.

2954
02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:37.230
Hmm.
I don't know,
and I'm sensitive.

2955
02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:41.290
It's like it's a lot going on with them.
Secret.

2956
02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:45.660
I had my kid,
I'm so sensitive,
man.
I don't miss that.
Did you change?

2957
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:48.820
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

2958
02:50:48.821 --> 02:50:51.820
It changes the shit out of you will see some biological change.

2959
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:56.720
It's also like you girls,
all girls.
It's also,
it's a recognition change.
Like you,

2960
02:50:56.721 --> 02:51:01.270
you kind of understand life in a different perspective that I don't know if it's

2961
02:51:01.271 --> 02:51:04.330
really available to you if you don't have children.
I just think it is.

2962
02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:07.570
I just think it's,
I don't think everybody has to have kids.

2963
02:51:07.571 --> 02:51:10.540
I'm not one of those zealots.
It says,
if you don't have kids,
you were in.
Shoot,

2964
02:51:10.900 --> 02:51:14.410
I don't.
I think that's offensive.
I don't think that's what life's all about.

2965
02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:16.570
I think you can affect people in a very meaningful way.

2966
02:51:16.571 --> 02:51:19.570
Never have kids and there's nothing wrong with that.
But I think for me,

2967
02:51:19.571 --> 02:51:23.470
at least for being the caveman that I am,

2968
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:27.310
it's like it was very important for me to see these little girls grow up and

2969
02:51:27.311 --> 02:51:29.270
become,
you know,

2970
02:51:29.330 --> 02:51:34.330
human beings that are interfacing with the world and getting an understanding of

2971
02:51:34.431 --> 02:51:39.431
what that means and like realizing that if you can do just a little bit to make

2972
02:51:39.891 --> 02:51:41.840
the world a slightly better place,

2973
02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:46.280
that could greatly affect all the people that your own children will come in

2974
02:51:46.281 --> 02:51:47.570
contact with as well,

2975
02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:52.580
and they can actually affect other people and have those other people treat the

2976
02:51:52.581 --> 02:51:56.540
world in a different way and treat people with more respect and be nicer to

2977
02:51:56.541 --> 02:52:01.100
people and you can,
we could have a better world for everybody.
Well,
I,
your kids,

2978
02:52:01.101 --> 02:52:02.450
my kids,
everybody's kids.

2979
02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:06.220
The thing that struck me right away as soon

2980
02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:11.220
<v 0>as my son was born is I've never had the feeling of you.</v>

2981
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:17.320
I would,
as soon as I would die for him,
like as soon as I met him,
you know,

2982
02:52:17.321 --> 02:52:20.740
I would die for as soon as he touched me.
It's like a goddamn prince song,

2983
02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:31.160
but it's like two presses gone too soon.

2984
02:52:31.630 --> 02:52:34.300
Yeah.
What about that guy?
God,
you want to talk about it?

2985
02:52:34.301 --> 02:52:39.130
Super powerful fucking entertainer.
One of a kind human being.

2986
02:52:39.730 --> 02:52:41.890
I remember I was a kid,
I was delivering newspapers.

2987
02:52:41.891 --> 02:52:46.690
I was driving around and I was a w uh,
listen to Attica set of a,

2988
02:52:46.691 --> 02:52:51.370
I wanna be your lover,
which is like his first big hit.
And I was like,
Holy Shit.

2989
02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:55.030
Listen to this guy.
Like listen to this guy.

2990
02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:58.240
And the covers is him with his long hair,
with no shirt on,

2991
02:52:58.241 --> 02:53:01.840
looking beautiful and the covenant,
what is he like?
What is going on here?

2992
02:53:02.110 --> 02:53:04.950
And I was almost,
you know,
it was,
I was like fucking 18 or something.

2993
02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:08.140
I was almost like turned off by the cover.
That's it right there.
I was like,

2994
02:53:08.141 --> 02:53:08.830
this is just,

2995
02:53:08.830 --> 02:53:13.830
I'm not buying this beautiful dream had gotten to a mustache.

2996
02:53:15.221 --> 02:53:19.630
I'm having weird feelings.
Right?
And then I listened to,
I would listen to,

2997
02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:23.290
I wanna be your lover and I was like,
God damn.
What an unusual dude.

2998
02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:25.660
Did you see purple rain?
I'm sure.
Yeah,
of course.

2999
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:30.260
Like that whole Morris Day Apollonia like I want it to be prints I bought,

3000
02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:34.790
I bought an overcoat.
Just you're aware.
A long overcoat.
So at some prince where,

3001
02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:36.540
where are you?
Too Old for the Michael Jackson thing.

3002
02:53:37.050 --> 02:53:40.190
I had the thriller jacket no more that I thought it was,

3003
02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:43.750
I thought the Michael Jackson thing was interesting because I thought he's

3004
02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:47.830
obviously a stunning,
incredibly talented performer,

3005
02:53:47.831 --> 02:53:52.831
but he was so weird and so unrelatable and every way like so oddly feminine and

3006
02:53:54.860 --> 02:53:59.380
childlike,
even though he's in his thirties it was baffling to me.
I was like,

3007
02:53:59.381 --> 02:54:03.070
I get that he's super talented and then when the plastic surgery started

3008
02:54:03.071 --> 02:54:06.640
happening,
it's faced are changing and morphing.
I'm like,
this is just strange.

3009
02:54:06.670 --> 02:54:11.200
Did you ever see either one in concert?
No.
No.
I never dressing prints.

3010
02:54:11.350 --> 02:54:13.750
I saw prince was an amazing,

3011
02:54:13.850 --> 02:54:18.620
I had an opportunity to see prince at the hard rock cafe and I blew it the hard

3012
02:54:18.621 --> 02:54:21.760
rock in Vegas and blew it.
I should have seen him.

3013
02:54:21.820 --> 02:54:25.120
I never thought it was going to die.
Yeah,
and that's,
I'm seeing everybody now.

3014
02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:28.540
Yeah,
you should.
Tom Petty's is another one.
I never saw Tom Petty.

3015
02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:33.290
I went to one of those apprenticeships at the palladium like four years ago.

3016
02:54:33.291 --> 02:54:35.990
He did a random seven nights.
There wasn't anybody there.

3017
02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:39.170
There was maybe 500 people there.
Really?
The whole floor was empty.

3018
02:54:39.470 --> 02:54:41.210
I don't know if why.
I don't know why.

3019
02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:43.280
I don't know if nobody knew at or something.

3020
02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:46.160
They didn't announce it at the right time.
It didn't make it to Twitter,

3021
02:54:46.310 --> 02:54:48.890
whatever it was.
I only heard because my friend worked there.
I only,

3022
02:54:48.891 --> 02:54:52.160
that's the only reason I knew about when we're looking at prince now,

3023
02:54:52.161 --> 02:54:56.030
we're looking at prints as like a dead legend.
I mean,

3024
02:54:56.031 --> 02:54:59.750
he's a legend that's gone and we think of him.
It's like God damn it.

3025
02:54:59.751 --> 02:55:02.060
He was so good.
He had so many great songs,

3026
02:55:02.390 --> 02:55:06.460
but I think then people thought of him as an older guy that they would,

3027
02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:08.960
didn't really care as much about anymore.

3028
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:13.740
Who hasn't put out rail relatively popular music for quite a while.

3029
02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:15.590
He turned into an artist,

3030
02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:19.010
I guess they could say where the music was just for himself and he wasn't really

3031
02:55:19.011 --> 02:55:23.180
trying to new.
Right.
It wasn't a new smash hits.
You know,

3032
02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:25.250
it's like there's some guys,
right,

3033
02:55:25.251 --> 02:55:28.400
that like one of the things that keeps Kanye west relevant is it,

3034
02:55:28.401 --> 02:55:32.720
he's constantly putting out music constantly puts out stuff that people love.

3035
02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:37.720
He constantly puts us stuff that smashes and some guys lose their enthusiasm for

3036
02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:42.720
productivity,
for being prolific.
They,

3037
02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:45.830
they lose that and then they don't put out stuff anymore and then they become

3038
02:55:45.831 --> 02:55:49.340
like Rod Stewart,
like Rod Stewart.
I'd like to see Rod Stewart.

3039
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:53.330
I'm a giant rod toured fan like it when Maggie may comes on the radio.

3040
02:55:53.331 --> 02:55:57.620
I get excited.
I love that Goddamn Song.
I love a lot of his music he was at.

3041
02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:01.490
But how many tickets we sell right now?
You know what I'm saying?
Well,

3042
02:56:01.491 --> 02:56:04.250
he sold out the staples center.
I don't think you wouldn't know.
You know,

3043
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:05.870
you know when you,

3044
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:08.950
I know you're still working on Kanye coming on the show and that's how,

3045
02:56:08.970 --> 02:56:11.420
even though you're not okay,
you know,
blood.
If he wants to do it,

3046
02:56:11.421 --> 02:56:13.610
but I don't want to put any pressure on anybody.
Absolutely.

3047
02:56:13.611 --> 02:56:16.280
And I don't necessarily know that podcasts are the best place for someone,

3048
02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:19.850
for everybody.
They might not be the best place to just talk about shit.

3049
02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:21.410
But did you get better to just do music?

3050
02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:24.560
Did you get to talk to him at least on the phone or talk to him?
Yeah.
Yeah.

3051
02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:28.790
Nice guy.
Let me tell you,
man,
he is so opposite his persona,

3052
02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:33.880
like on the outside like that you see in like in gossip magazines and on TV I

3053
02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:38.900
used to host has done to west foundation a event in Chicago and a lot of people

3054
02:56:38.901 --> 02:56:43.010
don't know the good he did in Chicago.
If they had perfect attendance,

3055
02:56:43.011 --> 02:56:46.490
he would go there every year,
throw a huge concert,

3056
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:51.260
bringing like a common and all different types of Chicago artists.
He would,
uh,

3057
02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:56.120
bus everybody in from all over the city and throw a free concert for all these

3058
02:56:56.121 --> 02:56:58.880
kids that had perfect attendance.

3059
02:56:59.090 --> 02:57:02.990
And it was good to interview him that way because he sucked at that time.

3060
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:06.620
At that time when his mom was still alive.
He's such a down,

3061
02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:11.890
down to earth humble guy and actually shy and shy.
Like he was really shy,

3062
02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:12.530
still wet.

3063
02:57:12.530 --> 02:57:16.470
And this was at the time I would see stories about him yelling at sway.
Yeah.

3064
02:57:17.550 --> 02:57:20.920
Yeah.
And I'm like,
this is not,
the dude that I interviewed was,

3065
02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:23.660
he's volatile and it goes all over the place.
Yeah.

3066
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:27.110
That's part of why he's such an explosive artists.
Oh,
he's incredible.

3067
02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:28.273
Incredible guy.

3068
02:57:28.340 --> 02:57:32.000
Those are the people who think different and but that stupid apple ad think

3069
02:57:32.001 --> 02:57:36.260
different.
Yeah.
There's people that really do think different differently.

3070
02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:41.080
That's one of the problems with that apple ad to English grammar.
But they,

3071
02:57:41.140 --> 02:57:45.090
there's people out there that just have a different vibe there.

3072
02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:47.030
They're on a different frequency.

3073
02:57:47.031 --> 02:57:50.180
There are different wavelength and they're the ones who create great shit man.

3074
02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:54.500
He has a gift.
I mean he is,
you know,
a lot of people outside go,
oh,

3075
02:57:54.501 --> 02:57:58.730
he's out there.
He's definitely out there.
He's out there.
Yeah.
But he's a genius.

3076
02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:03.410
He is a genius.
He's doing something in a different way and that's,

3077
02:58:03.810 --> 02:58:06.750
that moves our cultural long.
That's what it's like.

3078
02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:09.840
That's what when you're doing standup,
right,
like if you're,

3079
02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:14.160
if you're nailing something,
if you really locked down something and boom,

3080
02:58:14.161 --> 02:58:17.940
you put out a live on the sunset strip or a delirious or somebody that you're

3081
02:58:17.941 --> 02:58:20.760
changing culture,
you're,
you're making people.

3082
02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:23.550
People are going to spread out in these ripples.
Yeah.

3083
02:58:23.650 --> 02:58:26.550
We're going to go to their job in the morning.
They're like,
we saw Michael Yo,

3084
02:58:26.551 --> 02:58:29.760
holy shit.
He does his joke about his cat and whatever the fuck it is,

3085
02:58:29.761 --> 02:58:31.460
whatever the joke is and people be crying,

3086
02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:35.760
laughing and that there's ripples to that as positive ripples you change thing.

3087
02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:39.030
It's amazing that like when you do stand up,

3088
02:58:39.060 --> 02:58:43.290
like what I love about it is when I was just a host doing the entertainment

3089
02:58:43.291 --> 02:58:47.010
shows,
I would go into castings and I go,
oh,
you're a host.
Go ahead.

3090
02:58:47.430 --> 02:58:50.580
Now being a comedian,
it's the most,

3091
02:58:50.581 --> 02:58:54.330
I will say that it's the most respected thing in our industry.

3092
02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:58.530
Like I was on the most balls.
I was on the set of modern family.

3093
02:58:58.531 --> 02:59:01.860
When the show was huge and the actors are like,
Oh my God,
you do stand up.

3094
02:59:01.861 --> 02:59:04.980
How do you do that?
And they're on the biggest television show at that time.

3095
02:59:04.981 --> 02:59:09.660
Modern family,
even actors respect to,
so how castings of change I go in now,

3096
02:59:09.661 --> 02:59:11.810
they go,
oh,
we saw you at the Improv where we saw you here,

3097
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:14.640
there and you can host.
This is amazing.
You know,

3098
02:59:14.641 --> 02:59:19.030
so just the respect you get from doing good comedy,
you know,

3099
02:59:19.300 --> 02:59:20.070
it's,

3100
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:24.210
it's better to me then a Taylor swift on stage because she has a whole band.

3101
02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:28.880
She's having a bad night.
She can kind of like lip sync sync or songs.

3102
02:59:28.890 --> 02:59:30.060
They have a bad shock quote.

3103
02:59:30.061 --> 02:59:32.730
It says Michael Yo says he's better than Taylor swift.

3104
02:59:32.731 --> 02:59:37.100
And all she does is lip sync.
God Damn Him.
You know when he was on he,

3105
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:41.670
he respected her.
Alvin has gone,
he's flipped.
It's flipped.

3106
02:59:41.760 --> 02:59:44.340
We got to wrap this up,
dude.
We are hit three hours.
Isn't that crazy?

3107
02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:49.050
Three o'clock toad.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

3108
02:59:49.051 --> 02:59:53.550
Three hours.
Three o'clock.
Two o'clock Goddamn time warp in this room.

3109
02:59:53.880 --> 02:59:57.660
Dude.
Bagley out.
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you so much.
Thank you,
my friend.

3110
02:59:57.950 --> 03:00:00.420
I would tell people how to find you on Instagram,
Twitter,

3111
03:00:00.460 --> 03:00:03.030
all every day at Michael.
Yo,

Oh,

3112

Yeah.
Everybody's got prom.
Check it out,

3114
03:00:11.790 --> 03:00:13.890
I would appreciate it.
Thank you my friend.
That was fun.

3115
03:00:13.891 --> 03:00:15.630
I'm glad we did this dude.
Me Too,
man.
I go,
Yo.

3116
03:00:24.090 --> 03:00:24.330
Ooh.
