1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:01.871
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2
00:00:01.871 --> 00:00:02.704
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.421
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for coming.</v>

5
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it.</v>

6
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:05.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7
00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 2>if I get the hell man,</v>

8
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

9
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.240
<v Speaker 2>looking forward to it for a long time.</v>

10
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I am as well.</v>

11
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed our conversation in New York City two years ago now.</v>

12
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun time and um,</v>

14
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been a big fan of your work for a long time before that and I find you a</v>

15
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>fascinating character and I'm glad you.</v>

16
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got up early this morning,</v>

17
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>English time.</v>

18
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's 8:00 here in Los Angeles,</v>

19
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>so this is like,</v>

20
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>what do you like eight hours ahead of us?</v>

21
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.543
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking to a,</v>

22
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>to even out for awhile fella.</v>

23
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>This is not good for life expectancy,</v>

24
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 2>This is certainly true.</v>

26
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

27
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Let's play this out.</v>

28
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I think another thing that I do that are probably not good for me,</v>

29
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the one,</v>

30
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 2>and I'll get enough sleep.</v>

31
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.281
<v Speaker 1>Don't get enough sleep.</v>

32
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>And you like the booze fella that.</v>

33
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that may be good for me.</v>

34
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

35
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Really moderation in moderation.</v>

36
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>While we're drinking it right now,</v>

38
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>a little Jack Daniels,</v>

39
00:00:57.831 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>is that supposed to be good for colds?</v>

40
00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.521
<v Speaker 1>Does that.</v>

41
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>A man is working for me.</v>

42
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.091
<v Speaker 1>It does work for you.</v>

44
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

45
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>It helps you.</v>

46
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>It certainly does whatever makes you feel better.</v>

47
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you're involved at the.</v>

49
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't know Aubrey de Grey,</v>

50
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you're a researcher at Cambridge.</v>

51
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>You were involved.</v>

52
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Very much so in the forefront of anti aging life extension.</v>

53
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>As far as medical science is concerned,</v>

54
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you're at the forefront of this.</v>

55
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 2>So actually,</v>

56
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

57
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.871
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

58
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>One thing,</v>

59
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been affiliated with the University of Cambridge for a very long time</v>

60
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

61
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.483
<v Speaker 2>How long has it been?</v>

62
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Fucking wikipedia tells assholes.</v>

63
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand six or something like that.</v>

64
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically the same as we were able to bring enough funding to be able to</v>

66
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 2>pay me a full time salary.</v>

67
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 2>It made most sense for me to know actually we're doing something else to pay the</v>

68
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:48.424
<v Speaker 2>bill.</v>

69
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 2>So what is your organization now?</v>

70
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 2>So sensory fetched foundation where if I a one C,</v>

71
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 2>three public charity in mountain view,</v>

72
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 2>California and we,</v>

73
00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>a level of roughly $5,000,000 per year in terms of our budget,</v>

75
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 2>so we're still really pretty small,</v>

76
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 2>but I think we spend it pretty well.</v>

77
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who said what's wrong with his voice,</v>

78
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>he's suffering from a bit of a cold right now.</v>

79
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

80
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's drinking the whiskey.</v>

81
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works that way.</v>

82
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.631
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

83
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:17.464
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

84
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>what's exciting right now in terms of like medical research when it comes to</v>

85
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>life extension,</v>

86
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>like what are,</v>

87
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>what are the exciting areas to you're pursuing?</v>

88
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps the most exciting thing is that no one exciting thing they really</v>

89
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.441
<v Speaker 2>important thing to understand about medical research into aging is to start out</v>

90
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 2>from remembering that aging is not just one phenomenon.</v>

91
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a collection,</v>

92
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 2>a network of interacting phenomena,</v>

93
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 2>and the way that it's going to be effectively tackled by medicine in the</v>

94
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 2>fullness of time is by a divide and conquer strategy.</v>

95
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 2>A panel of interventions,</v>

96
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 2>all of which need to work with me really well in order for the whole nfs to</v>

97
00:02:58.181 --> 00:02:59.014
<v Speaker 2>actually work,</v>

98
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

99
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.460
<v Speaker 2>to an appreciable degree in terms of Perth Berman,</v>

100
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>devel health.</v>

101
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So from my point of view,</v>

102
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm working at the coalface,</v>

103
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.743
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

104
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a fantastic thing that,</v>

105
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>there's always something every week there's something that's got a new</v>

107
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough here in that.</v>

108
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>But of course the breakthroughs are often very technical.</v>

109
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>There are often things that only specialists would understand that they actually</v>

110
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:21.510
<v Speaker 2>were breakthroughs.</v>

111
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.181
<v Speaker 2>They're not like,</v>

112
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:22.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 2>we haven't doubled the mice,</v>

114
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the lifespan of mice in the past week,</v>

115
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

116
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.653
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

117
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.280
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

118
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

119
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

120
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 2>that's how pioneering technology has always developed and the people that do</v>

121
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>need to understand,</v>

122
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.281
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

123
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>the people who are doing the research and who need to know about each other's</v>

124
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 2>results in order to know what experiment to do next.</v>

125
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 2>You know that that community obviously is sufficiently cohesive that these</v>

126
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>pieces of information are distributed.</v>

127
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I obviously play a large part in doing that as well as in actually overseeing</v>

128
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>the research that the foundation does.</v>

129
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

130
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.063
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

131
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>coming back to my original statement,</v>

133
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>there's no one answer,</v>

134
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

135
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.710
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

136
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good point because is there a lot of cooperation between the</v>

137
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:14.240
<v Speaker 1>various different individuals all throughout the world are working on these life</v>

138
00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 1>extension technologies and life extension medical science.</v>

139
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's actually a totally different question to which the answer is</v>

140
00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 2>depressingly different.</v>

141
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>the failed,</v>

143
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>the individual failed that I think all need to be developed to a reasonable</v>

144
00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:35.591
<v Speaker 2>degree of efficacy in order to actually give the overall result that individual</v>

145
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:40.190
<v Speaker 2>failed a nightly cohesive and people talk to each other within the field.</v>

146
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.660
<v Speaker 2>But between the failed,</v>

147
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a very different matter.</v>

148
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've had to do,</v>

149
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.930
<v Speaker 2>everything that I started out in this area,</v>

150
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 2>and certainly over the past,</v>

151
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:50.510
<v Speaker 2>let's say 10 or 12 years,</v>

152
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I've had to actively bring these people together,</v>

153
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>the far too much balkanization building up of silos and of,</v>

154
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.810
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary barriers between field that somehow don't think that they're</v>

156
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:03.920
<v Speaker 2>relevant to each other.</v>

157
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.710
<v Speaker 2>And this happens not in any way.</v>

158
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:11.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm not blaming the scientists for that because it happens rarely as a result of</v>

159
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.580
<v Speaker 2>the vagaries of funding.</v>

160
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 2>The fact that nobody's got enough money and therefore in order to get whatever</v>

161
00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:19.664
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

162
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.300
<v Speaker 2>they've got to focus on the things that are already known to be good at.</v>

163
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>It works extraordinarily strongly against the um,</v>

164
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.151
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

165
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the portability of cross disciplinary work and also against high risk,</v>

166
00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Speaker 2>high gain work.</v>

167
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 2>And it really massively flow science and technology down.</v>

168
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 2>So it's a tragedy and everyone kind of knows it,</v>

169
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 2>but nobody really knows what to do about it.</v>

170
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not any one person's interests to do anything about it.</v>

171
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.690
<v Speaker 2>So the whole system is perpetuated.</v>

172
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 1>So is it one of those situations where you have like various pharmaceutical</v>

173
00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 1>companies or what have you,</v>

174
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 1>standing on the outside looking in,</v>

175
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:57.690
<v Speaker 1>waiting for something to be something that they could</v>

176
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.620
<v Speaker 3>put their chips on something where they can hedge their bets and say,</v>

177
00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:01.861
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

178
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:02.331
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

179
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:04.950
<v Speaker 3>this is a promising little piece of research here.</v>

180
00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Now we'll start to gamble on this being profitable down the line because for</v>

181
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 3>medication especially to be ultimately profitable is there's a huge period of</v>

182
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.380
<v Speaker 3>testing and research and ultimately can cost millions and millions of dollars</v>

183
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.830
<v Speaker 3>before you could ever even find out the efficacy of a product.</v>

184
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.130
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

185
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.761
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

186
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.770
<v Speaker 2>if not quite the same thing as I was thinking about it,</v>

187
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's related when I was talking about earlier was really with respect to</v>

188
00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:31.320
<v Speaker 2>academia per se,</v>

189
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.510
<v Speaker 2>with respect to people who rely on government funding to get worked on the</v>

190
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.410
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical industry or more generally the medical industry have a different</v>

191
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:42.244
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

192
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.290
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of has the same kind of problem.</v>

193
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

194
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.930
<v Speaker 2>medicine is tricky to do and everyone wants to keep it as simple as possible,</v>

195
00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:52.630
<v Speaker 2>which means the inherent bias against,</v>

196
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

197
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.220
<v Speaker 2>against cross disciplinary work,</v>

198
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.600
<v Speaker 2>against a divide and conquer strategy that involved doing more than one thing at</v>

199
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:03.160
<v Speaker 2>the same time to the same person,</v>

200
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.450
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately we're going to have to bite that bullet and there are smart</v>

201
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:11.080
<v Speaker 2>people in the pharmaceutical and medical industry just as there are in academia</v>

202
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.810
<v Speaker 2>and everyone kind of getting used to this.</v>

203
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just that it's a very difficult thing for anyone to be the first group,</v>

204
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:20.801
<v Speaker 2>the first company,</v>

205
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:21.580
<v Speaker 2>the first place,</v>

206
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.510
<v Speaker 2>first referred group to actually do it.</v>

207
00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Kind of got to be a collective shift of mindset.</v>

208
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I kind of sea change in the culture of how all this is done.</v>

209
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.330
<v Speaker 3>So is this something that's being actively pursued all over the world?</v>

210
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Are there pockets of intellectuals that are working on this or</v>

211
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.201
<v Speaker 2>all over the world,</v>

212
00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:42.340
<v Speaker 2>but yet only pockets.</v>

213
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid at this point there is still an enormous tendency,</v>

214
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 2>enormously productive tendency to retreat into doing what just makes money</v>

215
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:57.790
<v Speaker 2>quickly and what get papers published quickly irrespective of whether it's Gals,</v>

216
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.361
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

217
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:02.590
<v Speaker 2>whether it leads to significant progress in the longer term.</v>

218
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

219
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.121
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

220
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 2>the biggest thing that I always point to if they absolutely biologically</v>

221
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.670
<v Speaker 2>inaccurate and damaging idea that the diseases of old age or in farm fence</v>

222
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 2>distinct from aging itself,</v>

223
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 2>it's complete nonsense that leaves about eight.</v>

224
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Anything that causes people who were born a long time ago to be fair,</v>

225
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.290
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't tend to affect people who are in early adulthood.</v>

226
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Those things are that way because they are side effect of being alive.</v>

227
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.080
<v Speaker 2>They are side effects of having been alive and accumulating damage for a long</v>

228
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 2>time in the body.</v>

229
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And that is the only thing that one can fire the definition of aging itself to.</v>

230
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.070
<v Speaker 2>So one should not be dividing these two things and saying the things that</v>

231
00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:52.450
<v Speaker 2>disease and this other thing,</v>

232
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:53.170
<v Speaker 2>if not,</v>

233
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.160
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't be doing that.</v>

234
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>And if we doing that,</v>

235
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.370
<v Speaker 2>then we've got a chance of actually understanding how to attack the this network</v>

236
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 2>of interacting l health issues that affect the elderly in a manner that really</v>

237
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:07.974
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

238
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>We will stop trying to be over optimistic about these things that we choose to</v>

239
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.100
<v Speaker 2>call to.</v>

240
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 2>They've learned over pessimistic about the things that we don't and we'll start</v>

241
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>to realize that all of them together can be tackled.</v>

242
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>So you're looking at aging itself as a type of a disease.</v>

243
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I would actually go the other way.</v>

244
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I would say that the right thing to do is not to look at the local diseases of</v>

245
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.910
<v Speaker 2>old age diseases because of course there is a huge distinction between the,</v>

246
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 2>between things that are side effect of being alive in the first place,</v>

247
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand and infections,</v>

248
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 2>infections or what the word disease should be restricted to infections and</v>

249
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>congenital diseases that we say,</v>

250
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.023
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

251
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.470
<v Speaker 2>infections can be actually eliminated from the body that can be cured by bashing</v>

252
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 2>away at the symptoms and eliminating the infectious itunes.</v>

253
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.381
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

254
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 2>if you try to do that with something that's a side effect of being alive,</v>

255
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>you're obviously not going to succeed unless you like go as far as eliminating</v>

256
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.831
<v Speaker 2>being alive,</v>

257
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 2>which you'd rather defeat the object.</v>

258
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

259
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.401
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

260
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

261
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.020
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

262
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

263
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the conceptual thing that people think that something like outside of or</v>

264
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.210
<v Speaker 2>atherosclerosis or cancer is basically just not all that different from</v>

265
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.950
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis complete bullshit.</v>

266
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.040
<v Speaker 2>And that fundamental conceptual error causes enormous amount of money to be</v>

267
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:36.531
<v Speaker 2>spent in the wrong way against the diseases of old age in ways that will only</v>

268
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 2>ever make a very minimal impact on the disease.</v>

269
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.471
<v Speaker 2>So is that,</v>

270
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 2>that there's sort of a resignation,</v>

271
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.250
<v Speaker 2>that Alzheimer's is just a side effect of old age,</v>

272
00:10:45.251 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 2>that there's nothing they can do about.</v>

273
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

274
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

275
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

276
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>the is not a resignation.</v>

277
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 2>People say it's a disease,</v>

278
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:53.240
<v Speaker 2>therefore we should not on your part.</v>

279
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's the problem that people think they can cure it in isolation.</v>

280
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

281
00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:58.750
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

282
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 2>it's people get old,</v>

283
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.653
<v Speaker 2>but let's kill it.</v>

284
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is what we have to cure is the getting old part.</v>

285
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

286
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 2>What are,</v>

288
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.703
<v Speaker 2>what's.</v>

289
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you think will be the method ultimately,</v>

290
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 2>and obviously there's a bunch of different ideas.</v>

291
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>What do you think will be the method ultimately that we move into that</v>

292
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>direction?</v>

293
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.070
<v Speaker 2>It's been very clear to me for at least 15 years now that the way to do this is</v>

294
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 2>damage repair,</v>

295
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>that we must develop a panel of intervention,</v>

296
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>the panel of therapies which go in and restore the molecular and cellular</v>

297
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.600
<v Speaker 2>structure and composition of the body of an elderly person.</v>

298
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 2>To her it was more or less in early adulthood,</v>

299
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 2>so that means things like putting cells back when the body is having fellows</v>

300
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 2>dying and not being not being automatically replaced by cell division.</v>

301
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 2>It means taking sales away when cells are dividing,</v>

302
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>when they're not supposed to or when they're not dying,</v>

303
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.050
<v Speaker 2>when they are supposed to.</v>

304
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 2>It means cleaning out molecular waste products if they're accumulating because</v>

305
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 2>they saw the body doesn't know how to get rid of them,</v>

306
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know how to break them down or to excavate them.</v>

307
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

308
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 2>pretty basic things really,</v>

309
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that even thinking in that it sounds like a very simplistic</v>

310
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

311
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a very robust framework for actually identifying what needs to be fixed and</v>

312
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.714
<v Speaker 2>how to fix it.</v>

313
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that diet,</v>

314
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 3>it all plays a part in this or do you recommend a specific diet to people to</v>

315
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 3>enhance their their body's ability to repair itself?</v>

316
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't really do that first for two reasons.</v>

317
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.490
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

318
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.580
<v Speaker 2>with regard to data and a more generally lifestyle,</v>

319
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.950
<v Speaker 2>anything that people can do today,</v>

320
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I definitely take the view that there are plenty of other people who know more</v>

321
00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:46.100
<v Speaker 2>about the me and the four.</v>

322
00:12:46.101 --> 00:12:47.990
<v Speaker 2>If I also became an expert in this area,</v>

323
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I really wouldn't be making as much difference as I am making by spending my</v>

324
00:12:51.231 --> 00:12:52.460
<v Speaker 2>time in this other way.</v>

325
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Second thing is that,</v>

326
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.390
<v Speaker 2>and this is rather depressing,</v>

327
00:12:56.391 --> 00:13:01.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's rather an important thing to mention that as far as we can tell,</v>

328
00:13:01.221 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming evidence is that none of these things make very much difference</v>

329
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:06.164
<v Speaker 2>to most people.</v>

330
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.270
<v Speaker 2>It feel an unlucky person.</v>

331
00:13:08.271 --> 00:13:13.271
<v Speaker 2>If you're someone who drew the short Straw and you are aging unusually rapidly,</v>

332
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.750
<v Speaker 2>then it's a bit different.</v>

333
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

334
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.690
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're aging unusually rapidly,</v>

335
00:13:20.691 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 2>only in one particular way or one or two ways.</v>

336
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe there are supplements or dietary or lifestyle regimen that will</v>

337
00:13:29.931 --> 00:13:33.770
<v Speaker 2>substantially normalize your rate of aging and that's obviously a good thing,</v>

338
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.470
<v Speaker 2>but for those of us who are already average,</v>

339
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.080
<v Speaker 2>especially for those of us who are already doing better than average,</v>

340
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.130
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case.</v>

341
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 2>The evidence seems to be that these interventions simply don't give you anymore.</v>

342
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 2>The body is already as well tuned as it can be subject only to the development</v>

343
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.410
<v Speaker 2>of much more sophisticated interventions of the thought that sensory research</v>

344
00:13:54.411 --> 00:13:55.550
<v Speaker 2>foundation is working on.</v>

345
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.220
<v Speaker 3>So the things like getting good sleep,</v>

346
00:13:58.221 --> 00:13:59.180
<v Speaker 3>getting good diet,</v>

347
00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 3>they're really essentially only one</v>

348
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.263
<v Speaker 2>go so far.</v>

349
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.170
<v Speaker 2>There are only going to go very familial out.</v>

350
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

351
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.623
<v Speaker 2>So you'll have a.</v>

352
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 2>we'll live an extra 10 years or sometimes even 10.</v>

353
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I think an overstatement,</v>

354
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I think we're talking like more like one or two if you're lucky.</v>

355
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 2>One or two.</v>

356
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>So he pulls it up.</v>

357
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:15.184
<v Speaker 2>Folks,</v>

358
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>

359
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.940
<v Speaker 2>here's a good illustration of this.</v>

360
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 2>People often around the rest of the world,</v>

361
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.770
<v Speaker 2>people laugh at the Ufa a lot for it,</v>

363
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.450
<v Speaker 2>for the fact that even though it spans a huge amount of medical care far more</v>

364
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 2>ahead than any other country.</v>

365
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.001
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

366
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 2>if you look at longevity,</v>

367
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:36.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 2>the USA is way down the leg table.</v>

369
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like number 45 or something like that.</v>

370
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.513
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

371
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.691
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

372
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:44.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

373
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 2>this is just so you know,</v>

374
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.833
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

375
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.810
<v Speaker 2>that money doesn't buy health or something.</v>

376
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.290
<v Speaker 2>But actually a much more important message comes if you look at the real</v>

377
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>

378
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 2>not just the league table,</v>

379
00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 2>it's something I'd like to ask you,</v>

380
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:00.990
<v Speaker 2>just if you know that.</v>

381
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.210
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the difference is between the life expectancy of people in the</v>

382
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 2>USA and the life expectancy of people in Japan?</v>

383
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.750
<v Speaker 2>The longest live country in the world?</v>

384
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I would say the life expectancy,</v>

385
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.350
<v Speaker 1>the United States is probably a good average is probably in your sixties where I</v>

386
00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.600
<v Speaker 1>would say Japan is probably in your seventies,</v>

387
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.943
<v Speaker 1>so I'll give you a number.</v>

388
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Sixty four,</v>

389
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.170
<v Speaker 1>78.</v>

390
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:25.750
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

391
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You say you're going to say 14 years.</v>

392
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.073
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

393
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.033
<v Speaker 1>Four years.</v>

394
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Four full full.</v>

395
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not much.</v>

396
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.413
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

397
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:34.201
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>

398
00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:35.580
<v Speaker 1>And the for the last four,</v>

399
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.211
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

400
00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:37.044
<v Speaker 1>you can have them.</v>

401
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

402
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.690
<v Speaker 2>of course the left foil you can.</v>

403
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the same in Japan.</v>

404
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 2>A long time if to stay healthy long time first and then the.</v>

405
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:47.850
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

406
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the period of decline is typically about fame.</v>

407
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.620
<v Speaker 2>However long the period of good health was beforehand.</v>

408
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So in all these factors that people look to to enhance like,</v>

409
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>surround yourself with loved ones,</v>

411
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 1>have a good community,</v>

412
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>but do something that you enjoy doing it when they're talking.</v>

413
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 1>They're really only talking about a very small amount of time</v>

414
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.553
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

415
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 2>The reason I spent so much time emphasizing this and making sure that people</v>

416
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 2>understand it is because if people don't understand,</v>

417
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.770
<v Speaker 2>if people think well,</v>

418
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 2>they can do a great deal to post the oral health just by doing things that they</v>

419
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.380
<v Speaker 2>can do already,</v>

420
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to be correspondingly less enthusiastic,</v>

421
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:28.790
<v Speaker 2>less committed to figuring out and helping and hastening the development of</v>

422
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 2>things that we can't do already.</v>

423
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.651
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

424
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:32.040
<v Speaker 2>the sort of stuff that I'm working on,</v>

425
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>it's really because the impact of things that we can do today so small that it</v>

426
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.400
<v Speaker 2>becomes urgent to develop new things.</v>

427
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 1>What do you think will be the method for repairing damage?</v>

428
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean how?</v>

429
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 1>How will that find itself in our lives?</v>

430
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.200
<v Speaker 2>There are many different types of debt and the only reason why it was possible</v>

431
00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:56.440
<v Speaker 2>for me to come up with a really solid,</v>

432
00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:01.441
<v Speaker 2>robust clinical research program was because 15 years ago I was able to identify</v>

433
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.700
<v Speaker 2>a way to classify.</v>

434
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:07.480
<v Speaker 2>They've many types of damage into a much more manageable number of categories.</v>

435
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Just seven categories within the law.</v>

436
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Within each category there is just one generic intervention which may differ in</v>

437
00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:20.140
<v Speaker 2>detail from one example within the category to another,</v>

438
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.460
<v Speaker 2>but early in detail.</v>

439
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.090
<v Speaker 2>So basically we're talking about and seven different types of repair.</v>

440
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.430
<v Speaker 2>So for illustration,</v>

441
00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:31.990
<v Speaker 2>let me just talk about when I tell them I'm one type of damages,</v>

442
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.831
<v Speaker 2>loss of cells,</v>

443
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:37.831
<v Speaker 2>cells dying and not being automatically replaced by the division of other cells.</v>

444
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.310
<v Speaker 2>That basically the reason why we get Parkinson's disease.</v>

445
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.840
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the best example of it.</v>

446
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Most obvious example,</v>

447
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm now in Parkinson's disease.</v>

448
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 2>What happens is there's just one part of the brain called the substantia Nigra</v>

449
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 2>in which there are a special type of neuron called dopaminergic neurons.</v>

450
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 2>These neurons die much more rapidly than neurons in most parts of the brain,</v>

451
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 2>and sure enough eventually they have enough of them now and most of us,</v>

452
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you've already lost about 20 percent of guys near by old age,</v>

453
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 2>but some people live a little bit faster and then maybe a last 70 or 80 percent</v>

454
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 2>intellegence.</v>

455
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people that got Parkinson's disease,</v>

456
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.770
<v Speaker 2>so then they asked what is the damage repair?</v>

457
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 2>The onset,</v>

458
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 2>it's actually really clear and well known in this case,</v>

459
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.780
<v Speaker 2>namely stem cell therapy.</v>

460
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what stem cell therapy is you,</v>

461
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.950
<v Speaker 2>but excuse me,</v>

462
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.060
<v Speaker 2>you put cells into the body that are prepared in advance,</v>

463
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.621
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

464
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:39.621
<v Speaker 2>They're set up so that they will have the tendency to divide and transform into</v>

465
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 2>replacements for the cells that the body was not replacing lights out.</v>

466
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.990
<v Speaker 2>So you restore the number of cells in the tissue.</v>

467
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Does she started working again?</v>

468
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 2>You've fixed the disease and about 20 years ago people started trying this</v>

469
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 2>because people realize this didn't really work too well back that and it worked</v>

470
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:56.874
<v Speaker 2>occasionally,</v>

471
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but the basic problem was we didn't know enough about how to manipulate stem</v>

472
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:04.230
<v Speaker 2>cells before injecting them into the body.</v>

473
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Now we know a lot,</v>

474
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 2>lot more and there are new stem cell trials for Parkinson's disease starting up</v>

475
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

476
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 2>which people are really optimistic about it.</v>

477
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a very good chance,</v>

478
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I would say even a 50 slash 50 chance that we will be able to say in as little</v>

479
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 2>as 10 years from now,</v>

480
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.450
<v Speaker 2>the Parkinson's disease has genuinely been cured with them.</v>

481
00:19:23.451 --> 00:19:24.260
<v Speaker 2>South therapy.</v>

482
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:24.681
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

483
00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:26.270
<v Speaker 1>That is very promising.</v>

484
00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:27.230
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

485
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Ten years.</v>

486
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a relatively short amount of time.</v>

487
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.323
<v Speaker 1>Unless your.</v>

488
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It is 74.</v>

489
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

490
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.210
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

491
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>It a short amount of time.</v>

492
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.180
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the therapies that we think also need to be developed to address other</v>

493
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.950
<v Speaker 2>part of aging.</v>

494
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I think harder than that and I think we could be talking about 20 or 25 years</v>

495
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.110
<v Speaker 2>and even then we're only talking about a 50 slash 50.</v>

496
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.380
<v Speaker 2>A probability of getting there for anything that's more than a few years away.</v>

497
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously extremely speculative.</v>

498
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 2>If we're talking about timeframes,</v>

499
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a responsibility to give her a bath,</v>

500
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.060
<v Speaker 2>get to the general public because the general public's bath guest is going to be</v>

501
00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:08.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot worth.</v>

502
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

503
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.390
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to know,</v>

504
00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you've got to have some kind of idea of how close something in order to</v>

505
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:20.120
<v Speaker 2>understand how much to agitate to make it happen faster,</v>

506
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.460
<v Speaker 2>mean a thousand years away.</v>

508
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:26.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be a priority to make it only 990 years away.</v>

509
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.553
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

510
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

511
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

512
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of why we to talk about these timeframes.</v>

513
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:32.391
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

514
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there's at least a 10 percent chance that we won't get there for</v>

515
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.020
<v Speaker 2>a hundred years.</v>

516
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

517
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>That's no big deal,</v>

518
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

519
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Because 50 percent challenge is quite enough to be worth fighting for.</v>

520
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>

521
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>

522
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You and I met at the global two,</v>

523
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.090
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

524
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.251
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

525
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:48.530
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

526
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 3>45 initiative event in New York City,</v>

527
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 3>which is a group of sort of a,</v>

528
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 3>a group of two different groups of people.</v>

529
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.950
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are concerned with biological aging,</v>

530
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 3>which is your group medical,</v>

531
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:05.164
<v Speaker 3>biological aging,</v>

532
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 3>and these people that some folks classify as a Psi Phi dreamers.</v>

533
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 3>That belief you're going to be able to download your consciousness into a robot</v>

534
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 3>and bypass the whole biological process in the first place and that all this</v>

535
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 3>work about repair,</v>

536
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 3>it's only going to be a moot point because we're going to get to a point where</v>

537
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 3>we're going to develop a body that's far superior to the biological body that</v>

538
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 3>we're born with and will simply,</v>

539
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 3>in part our consciousness into that.</v>

540
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you give any credence to that?</v>

541
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you do dabble in that or do you just concentrate on what you're doing?</v>

542
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I have a very open mind about these things.</v>

543
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at all fun of people talking about things that are clearly impossible,</v>

544
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.120
<v Speaker 2>but very often when I'm thinking initially looked clearly impossible look left,</v>

545
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.440
<v Speaker 2>you understand that it might actually already definitely really difficult,</v>

546
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.260
<v Speaker 2>or this could be an example.</v>

547
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Uploading is the idea of moving world consciousness to a difference.</v>

548
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.133
<v Speaker 2>Hardware,</v>

549
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not completely clear that it can't be done.</v>

551
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.210
<v Speaker 2>The May and the end be reasons why it totally can't be done,</v>

552
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.260
<v Speaker 2>but I think all that really matters now is that we can say that it's very</v>

553
00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:13.094
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

554
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

555
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:15.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

556
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I would certainly say in fact that</v>

557
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I bet serious money that the problem with aging will be decisively solved by a</v>

558
00:22:25.641 --> 00:22:30.641
<v Speaker 2>biomedical approach of the thought that we're aware pursuing well before it gets</v>

559
00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:32.760
<v Speaker 2>sold by an uploading a pro,</v>

560
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.460
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>

561
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 2>like a central technologist,</v>

562
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I know I might be wrong and therefore I'm delighted that there are people</v>

563
00:22:40.971 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 2>working in these other areas so further,</v>

564
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.660
<v Speaker 2>if they their work turned out to be easier than I think it hit and my work turns</v>

565
00:22:47.661 --> 00:22:48.560
<v Speaker 2>out to be harder,</v>

566
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 2>that and they get their first,</v>

567
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.460
<v Speaker 2>then there'll be saving lives that I couldn't save.</v>

568
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.353
<v Speaker 2>That works for me.</v>

569
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:53.781
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

570
00:22:53.781 --> 00:22:55.850
<v Speaker 3>there's a philosophical debate here,</v>

571
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.290
<v Speaker 3>a philosophical conversation,</v>

572
00:22:57.291 --> 00:22:58.550
<v Speaker 3>and that conversation is,</v>

573
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.690
<v Speaker 3>why would you want to continue?</v>

574
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.060
<v Speaker 3>How long do you truly want to live?</v>

575
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to live to be a thousand?</v>

576
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to live to be 100,000 years and will that be an issue as well?</v>

577
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.250
<v Speaker 3>As far as national,</v>

578
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.110
<v Speaker 3>our national natural resources go.</v>

579
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.591
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

580
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:17.690
<v Speaker 3>are we already overpopulated?</v>

581
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Are we already putting a tremendous burden on the natural resources of this</v>

582
00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:24.980
<v Speaker 3>planet that will be accentuated by a thousand year old people just running</v>

583
00:23:24.981 --> 00:23:26.900
<v Speaker 3>around having babies when they're 900 years old.</v>

584
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to hold for that question in two very separate parts.</v>

585
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.230
<v Speaker 2>First we're going to talk about the so called philosophical issue of how long</v>

586
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 2>one would want to live.</v>

587
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:40.890
<v Speaker 2>I find that quite remarkable that people worry about this simply because it's</v>

588
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 2>not the way that people actually think about anything else.</v>

589
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Let's remember that the longevity aspect of all of this work is a side effect.</v>

590
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't work on longevity.</v>

591
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

592
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't work on immortality the way you might think if you read the</v>

593
00:23:58.461 --> 00:23:59.294
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>

594
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I just work on health.</v>

595
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm just interested in stopping people from getting sick when they get older.</v>

596
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Now if you think about it,</v>

597
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 2>all medicine is like that.</v>

598
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 2>All medicine involves stopping people from getting sick or fixing them up if</v>

599
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:17.690
<v Speaker 2>they are fake and old medicine has a side effect that people live longer than</v>

600
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 2>they otherwise would have done.</v>

601
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.850
<v Speaker 2>So the only real difference between the work that sensory research foundation</v>

602
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:27.851
<v Speaker 2>does and the work that everything everyone else in medical research does is a</v>

603
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 2>difference of degree.</v>

604
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:34.150
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the longevity side effect of our work may be substantially greater</v>

605
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 2>than the longevity side effect that we're familiar with.</v>

606
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 2>It's still a side effect.</v>

607
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.020
<v Speaker 2>So if we come to the question of how well I might want to live,</v>

608
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

609
00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:44.223
<v Speaker 2>just like any,</v>

610
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 2>even a meaningful question to me,</v>

611
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.084
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying,</v>

612
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 2>what time would you like to go to the toilet next Sunday?</v>

613
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.973
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

614
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.060
<v Speaker 2>we know that that's a dumb thing to have an opinion about it.</v>

615
00:24:55.070 --> 00:25:00.070
<v Speaker 2>A dumb thing to have an opinion about because we know we're going to have more</v>

616
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:03.530
<v Speaker 2>information on the topic near at the time and we're going to be able to act on</v>

617
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the information and it's the same deal.</v>

618
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

619
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 2>nobody makes decisions on the basis of how long ago they were bought.</v>

620
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.140
<v Speaker 2>People increasingly make decisions as they get older on the basis of how long</v>

621
00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 2>they think they've got to live,</v>

622
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.150
<v Speaker 2>but that's because the amount of time they think they've got to live with going</v>

623
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:20.984
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

624
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 2>which won't be going down anymore.</v>

625
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.590
<v Speaker 2>If you've got an arbitrary amount of time behind you earn other arbitrary amount</v>

626
00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:27.560
<v Speaker 2>of time ahead of you,</v>

627
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 2>your decision making is going to be based on more short term considerations,</v>

628
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 2>like peer pressure.</v>

630
00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:34.080
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

631
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.293
<v Speaker 2>as I point out,</v>

633
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Speaker 2>when people ask me these things oftentimes say,</v>

634
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.353
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

635
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.200
<v Speaker 2>take yourself back to the first time you got laid.</v>

636
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

637
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

638
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Now think about what you were thinking at the time.</v>

639
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Were you thinking,</v>

640
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

641
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:51.051
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

642
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I have to get this person into bed right now because I've only got another 60</v>

643
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 2>years to live.</v>

644
00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.113
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

645
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just ridiculous.</v>

646
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.781
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

647
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 2>so then I want to come to like the second half of your question,</v>

648
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 2>which was the business about overpopulation and such.</v>

649
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Like this is I again,</v>

650
00:26:07.721 --> 00:26:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

651
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I recall somewhat at the idea that the.</v>

652
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.510
<v Speaker 2>He said for philosophical question to me it's a psychological question and</v>

653
00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:15.344
<v Speaker 2>that's not the same at all,</v>

654
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.360
<v Speaker 2>but without getting into semantics,</v>

655
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.543
<v Speaker 2>what is the answer?</v>

656
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I have a three level onset and this applies to all of the questions were might</v>

657
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.230
<v Speaker 2>arrays with regard to the problems that might hypothetically be created as a</v>

658
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.680
<v Speaker 2>consequences of solving the problem we've got today.</v>

659
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.533
<v Speaker 2>The problem of writing,</v>

660
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.573
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

661
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.900
<v Speaker 2>So first thing is specific answers.</v>

662
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Just let look at the actual scenario closely rather than a knee jerk reaction</v>

663
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:43.140
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

664
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 2>is the problem actually let you to occur at all?</v>

665
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:45.991
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

666
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 2>in the case of of the population,</v>

667
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.910
<v Speaker 2>what we have to ask ourselves,</v>

668
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

669
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.490
<v Speaker 2>how rapidly would the population actually increase in the context of eliminating</v>

670
00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 2>death from aging and how badly with that matter?</v>

671
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 2>At the moment,</v>

672
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.720
<v Speaker 2>we've already got an overpopulation problem.</v>

673
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 2>We've got too many people on the planet.</v>

674
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:06.510
<v Speaker 2>We've got global warming and stuff.</v>

675
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

676
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 2>why do we have global warming?</v>

677
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:11.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not because we have 7 billion people.</v>

678
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 2>It's because we have 7 billion people,</v>

679
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 2>all of whom are burning a lot of carbon and that's not going to be true for very</v>

680
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

681
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 2>As we ramp up solar energy and we invent nuclear fusion and so on,</v>

682
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.980
<v Speaker 2>you know the is going to be in the relatively near future a situation where we</v>

683
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:34.491
<v Speaker 2>increase the carrying capacity of the planet a lot by these technologies that</v>

684
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:38.100
<v Speaker 2>mean that we can have more people with less environmental impact.</v>

685
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 2>It's very likely that that kind of trajectory,</v>

686
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and of course I'm not only talking about global warming here and talking about</v>

687
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 2>all other types of pollution that we engage in,</v>

688
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that kind of technology will out run any changes that may happen in terms of</v>

689
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:52.884
<v Speaker 2>demography,</v>

690
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.790
<v Speaker 2>so that's the first level.</v>

691
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.240
<v Speaker 2>The second level answer is perhaps more important to kind of general while</v>

692
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>applies across the board,</v>

693
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 2>whether it's other population you're worried about or boredom or dictators</v>

694
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 2>living forever or how will we pay the pensions or any of the standard digit</v>

695
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:08.703
<v Speaker 2>reactions.</v>

696
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.730
<v Speaker 2>The answer is how bad could it be?</v>

697
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a sense of proportion about this.</v>

698
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.580
<v Speaker 2>How bad could the problems be?</v>

699
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.593
<v Speaker 2>As a</v>

700
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 2>relative to the severity of the problem we have today and also ones that</v>

701
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:24.391
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

702
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 2>we have to remind ourselves exactly what is the severity of the problem we have</v>

703
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:28.824
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

704
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 2>how many people die of aging every day?</v>

705
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 2>The answer is 100,000 dollars and of course most of them don't just die.</v>

706
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.540
<v Speaker 2>They die after a long period of disease and debilitation and decrepitude a</v>

707
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 2>decline and dependency in general misery.</v>

708
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:49.550
<v Speaker 2>So there is no question that aging is responsible for the vast majority of human</v>

709
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:52.770
<v Speaker 2>suffering in the world today.</v>

710
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Not even if we don't even have to restrict ourselves to the industrialized</v>

711
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:57.414
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

712
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.700
<v Speaker 2>The overall,</v>

713
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I was asking you about life expectancy earlier,</v>

714
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.760
<v Speaker 2>so saying like,</v>

715
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 2>a four year difference between the US and Japan.</v>

717
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Turns out there's only 10 years difference between the world as a whole and</v>

718
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:10.614
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>

719
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that amazing or what?</v>

720
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.411
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty amazing.</v>

721
00:29:13.411 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>So worst case scenario and best case scenarios,</v>

722
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 2>only 10 years.</v>

723
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Well not worse case average case.</v>

724
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Real worse than they are down in the forties or fifties.</v>

725
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 2>But worst case as far as global mean,</v>

726
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.211
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

727
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

728
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.223
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

729
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

730
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.280
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

731
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.630
<v Speaker 2>what we're saying here is aging,</v>

732
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 2>it's undoubtedly the world's worst problem right now has been for a long time</v>

733
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 2>and we have to ask,</v>

734
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.280
<v Speaker 2>even supposing,</v>

736
00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but we ended up in a situation where population was going to be a problem</v>

737
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 2>because we hadn't invented technologies fix that to increase the carrying</v>

738
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:44.810
<v Speaker 2>capacity of the planet quite as rapidly as we needed to.</v>

739
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 2>So we were faced with this rather irritating feature of having to have fewer</v>

740
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:54.740
<v Speaker 2>children than we would like in order to make room for all the elderly herstal</v>

741
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 2>healthy and not dying.</v>

742
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 2>How bad is that?</v>

743
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Seems to me it's hard.</v>

744
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make a case that the right thing to do would be to let the people</v>

745
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:06.640
<v Speaker 2>age and die rather than to your okay.</v>

746
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 2>And the third level of answer is perhaps the most decisive of all,</v>

747
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.130
<v Speaker 2>some level of.</v>

748
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:12.461
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

749
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

750
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.990
<v Speaker 2>even if you've convinced yourself that these problems are going to happen,</v>

751
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 2>and even if you also convinced yourself that these problems are going to be so</v>

752
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.330
<v Speaker 2>bad that they might outweigh the problem that we're solving.</v>

753
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:28.350
<v Speaker 2>The question is who used to say who should actually be making the decision as to</v>

754
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.510
<v Speaker 2>whether the therapy,</v>

755
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:32.344
<v Speaker 2>the years.</v>

756
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 2>The answer clearly is humanity of the future rather than humanity of the</v>

757
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:38.284
<v Speaker 2>precedent.</v>

758
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 2>If we say to ourselves,</v>

759
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:39.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh dear,</v>

760
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:40.121
<v Speaker 2>oh dear,</v>

761
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 2>you know the population,</v>

762
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

763
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.890
<v Speaker 2>let's not go there and we thereby delay the development of these therapies that</v>

764
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 2>what we would be doing is denying humanity of the future,</v>

765
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 2>the option whether to use the therapy based on the information that it had</v>

766
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 2>available to us about,</v>

767
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.360
<v Speaker 2>available technology that will ever.</v>

769
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.560
<v Speaker 2>What if we develop these things as fast as possible,</v>

770
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 2>then humanity of the dads get the choice.</v>

771
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Now I do not want to be someone who is helping to condemn a cohort of the future</v>

772
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 2>to an unnecessarily painful and unnecessarily early death.</v>

773
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Just because I thought I knew better than that.</v>

774
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Innovation and advancement seems to be a fundamental part of human society and</v>

775
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:23.741
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

776
00:31:23.741 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 3>It just seems to be something that we do no matter where you go to someone who</v>

777
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 3>was always trying to improve upon everything.</v>

778
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 3>When you have medical science,</v>

779
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.810
<v Speaker 3>it only stands to reason that that too would try to improve and advance and life</v>

780
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.580
<v Speaker 3>expectancy of,</v>

781
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.121
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

782
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:40.931
<v Speaker 3>the way you describe it,</v>

783
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:44.110
<v Speaker 3>the way you did with that being the number one problem physically,</v>

784
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:45.760
<v Speaker 3>health wise in our world,</v>

785
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be a huge issue.</v>

786
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a huge issue that we're going to try to solve.</v>

787
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a fundamental part of being a human being.</v>

788
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I very much like the way you said that.</v>

789
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that the right way to explain the fallacy of,</v>

790
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

791
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>we could leave aging alone because natural,</v>

792
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 2>which some people say,</v>

793
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.751
<v Speaker 2>some people say,</v>

794
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

795
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.120
<v Speaker 2>aging is not like a disease.</v>

797
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 2>They have them through everything.</v>

798
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.880
<v Speaker 2>It's basically natural.</v>

799
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't touch it.</v>

800
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 2>And you're absolutely right.</v>

801
00:32:08.651 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 2>You said it perfectly.</v>

802
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 2>The way I would say is like,</v>

803
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 2>it would be unnatural for us to,</v>

804
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

805
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.220
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

806
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

807
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:17.711
<v Speaker 2>oh dear,</v>

808
00:32:17.711 --> 00:32:18.491
<v Speaker 2>let's leave it alone.</v>

809
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's horrible.</v>

810
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It was natural for the human for humanity is to see what's natural and we don't</v>

811
00:32:25.721 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

812
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.003
<v Speaker 2>and to fix it.</v>

813
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

814
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:32.310
<v Speaker 3>there's that existential angst that people tend to wallow in and what's the</v>

815
00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:32.731
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

816
00:32:32.731 --> 00:32:34.410
<v Speaker 3>what's it's all going to end some day,</v>

817
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.640
<v Speaker 3>what's the big deal?</v>

818
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:36.810
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

819
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

820
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>many groups have been many different schools of thought when it comes to that.</v>

821
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Some people just think that's nonsense,</v>

822
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:42.441
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed the moment,</v>

823
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:43.131
<v Speaker 3>live in the moment,</v>

824
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 3>live,</v>

825
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.481
<v Speaker 3>live today.</v>

826
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:45.314
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about the fee,</v>

827
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people who don't subscribe to that,</v>

828
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 3>who really do get depressed when they worried about their inevitable demise.</v>

829
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 3>When you come across,</v>

830
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 3>when you come around and say,</v>

831
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

832
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 3>we are developing new technologies that are gonna,</v>

833
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:59.870
<v Speaker 3>allow you to live within this lifetime.</v>

834
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 3>We're going to meet the first person who lives to be a thousand years.</v>

835
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:02.721
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

836
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:03.251
<v Speaker 3>well great.</v>

837
00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 3>A thousand years of suffering an existential angst.</v>

838
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.160
<v Speaker 3>They don't want it and that's where it's a philosophical question really because</v>

839
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a matter of how do you approach everyday,</v>

840
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 3>how do you.</v>

841
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 3>How do you approach this experience?</v>

842
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you look at this experience?</v>

843
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>

844
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 3>the moment you get laid,</v>

845
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:17.511
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

846
00:33:17.511 --> 00:33:17.781
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>

847
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I got to get her into bed because I only have 60 years left,</v>

848
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 3>or do you look at this experience saying,</v>

849
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 3>while this is going on,</v>

850
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.470
<v Speaker 3>there are a million wonderful things to enjoy about this life,</v>

851
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 3>and on top of that,</v>

852
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.210
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that as time goes on,</v>

853
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:35.810
<v Speaker 3>we're getting far better with this whole civilization thing and one of the</v>

854
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:40.811
<v Speaker 3>things that I think would benefit us more than anything possible would be if we</v>

855
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 3>could have people that could be alive and healthy and live for 500 years.</v>

856
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:50.081
<v Speaker 3>I imagine that type of wisdom that they could impart on the rest of us imagined</v>

857
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:55.421
<v Speaker 3>the life lessons that you would get from a few centuries of mistakes and</v>

858
00:33:56.031 --> 00:34:01.031
<v Speaker 3>corrections and lessons and and and information that you've absorbed.</v>

859
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 3>We could transform society and culture,</v>

860
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 3>World Society,</v>

861
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:08.030
<v Speaker 3>not National Society,</v>

862
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 3>not local society,</v>

863
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 3>but world society in a radical way.</v>

864
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Just with the wisdom that we would all be able to share.</v>

865
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a lot of truth in that.</v>

866
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.013
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

867
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

868
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could argue that the fact that we have culture,</v>

870
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.120
<v Speaker 2>that we can write things down and fell and maybe that doesn't matter so much</v>

871
00:34:26.121 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 2>that individuals could be around the white elephant for whatever.</v>

872
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.990
<v Speaker 2>But in practical terms,</v>

873
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.711
<v Speaker 2>it does matter.</v>

874
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:38.711
<v Speaker 2>I think it's got forgotten when the people who came of with them a lot around</v>

875
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 2>anymore and things got rediscovered.</v>

876
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Twentieth,</v>

877
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.300
<v Speaker 2>30th lights,</v>

878
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:47.000
<v Speaker 2>right through other rather ridiculous the refill for a related point which I</v>

879
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:48.370
<v Speaker 2>think is worth bringing up at the,</v>

880
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:49.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

881
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

882
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.170
<v Speaker 2>the state with regard to the,</v>

883
00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:52.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

884
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:53.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

885
00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

886
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 2>the value of,</v>

887
00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.320
<v Speaker 2>of living a long time and the value of all of the perceived value of living a</v>

888
00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:01.154
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>

889
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.220
<v Speaker 2>which is that at the moment,</v>

890
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:09.530
<v Speaker 2>the people who feel well life not worth living,</v>

891
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.090
<v Speaker 2>flavor or whatever are actually the same people who have a lot of trouble</v>

892
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:16.880
<v Speaker 2>understanding why the life worth living for 50 years.</v>

893
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

894
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 2>the people that spend their time essentially living their life in front of the</v>

895
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:21.704
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

896
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.910
<v Speaker 2>they difficulty here is simply a lack of education.</v>

897
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:31.630
<v Speaker 2>The fact that most people in today's world do not have the training to be able</v>

898
00:35:34.101 --> 00:35:36.320
<v Speaker 2>to understand how to get the most out of life,</v>

899
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 2>who do they do have good education,</v>

900
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 2>good understanding of how to get the most out of life.</v>

901
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 2>We always have a massive backlog.</v>

902
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I've probably got a thousand years of backlog already.</v>

903
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Other thing that I'd like to have done,</v>

904
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I've found that I liked to have seen books.</v>

906
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to ride,</v>

907
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.530
<v Speaker 2>play for elect of God.</v>

908
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 2>People don't like to have matt,</v>

909
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and by the time I'm through that,</v>

910
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain I'm going to have at least another 10,000 years of backlog.</v>

911
00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

912
00:35:59.300 --> 00:35:59.811
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

913
00:35:59.811 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

914
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:00.830
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

915
00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:01.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

917
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.670
<v Speaker 2>all we need really is to educate people better.</v>

918
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.470
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting way to put it.</v>

919
00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Educate.</v>

920
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

921
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.641
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

922
00:36:07.641 --> 00:36:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

923
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I tend to agree with you,</v>

924
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.740
<v Speaker 3>but I think that for a lot of people it tends to be an issue of mental health.</v>

925
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

926
00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.100
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that suffer from depression or struggle with depression</v>

927
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.900
<v Speaker 3>and life itself becomes very difficult for them to endure.</v>

928
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:24.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

929
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:25.641
<v Speaker 2>I will stop you there.</v>

930
00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Please come.</v>

931
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing I think we need to understand the spectrum where there are</v>

932
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 2>obviously some people who are extremely depressed.</v>

933
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:38.481
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend actually in the UK who is clinically depressed right now about</v>

934
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 2>the problem of aging.</v>

935
00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Her parents are in a bad way.</v>

936
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.830
<v Speaker 2>There is a plan and it's really going to.</v>

937
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.703
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

938
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 2>that's an extreme example.</v>

940
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 2>If we talk about the just Malays know the end,</v>

941
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:53.911
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

942
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:54.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

943
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.410
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

944
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.910
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

945
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:55.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

946
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:59.130
<v Speaker 2>that I think is a much milder version of the same thing.</v>

947
00:36:59.131 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Then I will accept what you say that this is quite common,</v>

948
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.320
<v Speaker 2>but I would also say that it's part of what I was talking about,</v>

949
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 2>lack of training,</v>

950
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:09.551
<v Speaker 2>lack of,</v>

951
00:37:09.551 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 2>lack of,</v>

952
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>lack of exposure to the opportunities that life has to offer.</v>

953
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>A lack of understanding of how to actually seek out those opportunities.</v>

954
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it's such a hard thing to eliminate</v>

955
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.370
<v Speaker 3>because I don't agree with you that it's education because I know some very</v>

956
00:37:25.371 --> 00:37:28.880
<v Speaker 3>educated people that struggle with depression and I think a lot of it has to do</v>

957
00:37:28.881 --> 00:37:30.200
<v Speaker 3>with physical health that the,</v>

958
00:37:30.201 --> 00:37:32.330
<v Speaker 3>the meat wagon that you're carrying around,</v>

959
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.150
<v Speaker 3>that you're trudging through life with.</v>

960
00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.410
<v Speaker 3>If it's burdensome,</v>

961
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.880
<v Speaker 3>if it's causing you issues,</v>

962
00:37:37.881 --> 00:37:38.930
<v Speaker 3>if you don't take care of it,</v>

963
00:37:38.931 --> 00:37:39.741
<v Speaker 3>if you eat poorly,</v>

964
00:37:39.741 --> 00:37:40.790
<v Speaker 3>if you smoke cigarettes,</v>

965
00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:41.350
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

966
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:46.040
<v Speaker 3>you tend to overindulge and alcohol and it leaves your liver constantly</v>

967
00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:48.200
<v Speaker 3>processing state and you're just a mess.</v>

968
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Like those people tend to have a dollar experience and perhaps a,</v>

969
00:37:52.961 --> 00:37:54.290
<v Speaker 3>a more burdensome experience.</v>

970
00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:54.711
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

971
00:37:54.711 --> 00:37:55.544
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

972
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like the tail of the curve.</v>

973
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.830
<v Speaker 2>People that badly like that paypal.</v>

974
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:06.800
<v Speaker 2>And if we don't get the lodge end of the population in the thick end of the</v>

975
00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:07.340
<v Speaker 2>wedge,</v>

976
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 2>then we're talking about a model,</v>

977
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.370
<v Speaker 2>the phenomenon.</v>

978
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 2>But actually remind me of another thing that,</v>

979
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

980
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:18.970
<v Speaker 2>the is at the moment a very strong tendency in society say when exposed to the</v>

982
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 2>ideas about the possibility of bringing education to control.</v>

983
00:38:21.921 --> 00:38:26.510
<v Speaker 2>And consequently living under strong tendency to think,</v>

984
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.260
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

985
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 2>the law,</v>

986
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.750
<v Speaker 2>the quality of that life will be put advance because people have this sense in</v>

987
00:38:33.831 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>their head that quality and quantity,</v>

988
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I inherently opposed to each other.</v>

989
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 2>The more quantity you have,</v>

990
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 2>the left quality you're bound to have.</v>

991
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And of course that makes sense in today's world in a way because by large to the</v>

992
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 2>either a lot of things we like to do that are bad for it will shorten their</v>

993
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:52.001
<v Speaker 2>lives by,</v>

994
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 2>whether it's smoking or whatever.</v>

996
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

997
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but that's not going to be true in a scenario in a world in which we have</v>

998
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.650
<v Speaker 2>therapists that can actually address these various types of damage and repair</v>

999
00:39:04.651 --> 00:39:06.640
<v Speaker 2>them in those situations.</v>

1000
00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 2>If you think they gotta be on the same side of the fence,</v>

1001
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 2>quality is going to be the thing that confers quantity.</v>

1002
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.840
<v Speaker 3>So you imagine a world where cigarettes are being consequential.</v>

1003
00:39:15.841 --> 00:39:19.580
<v Speaker 3>You be smoking cigarettes just pop in some sort of repair pill and Bam,</v>

1004
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.350
<v Speaker 3>no more Marlboro cancer.</v>

1005
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Well basically,</v>

1006
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1007
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't like to point that out too heavily because of course it's not</v>

1008
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 2>true yet,</v>

1009
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.460
<v Speaker 2>so thank you on it.</v>

1010
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:28.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1011
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:29.231
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1012
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:29.681
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1013
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't know how long the therapy they're going to take to come along</v>

1014
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:38.070
<v Speaker 2>and they bat in order to maintain your chances of to maximize your chances of</v>

1015
00:39:39.311 --> 00:39:44.311
<v Speaker 2>actually being around in time to benefit from the therapy they actually live</v>

1016
00:39:45.441 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 2>with healthy lifestyle.</v>

1017
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't at the moment.</v>

1018
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I were talking earlier about maybe you'll only get a year or two,</v>

1019
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:52.100
<v Speaker 2>but that might be the key area too,</v>

1020
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:52.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1021
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:55.360
<v Speaker 3>It might be the key year or two that brings us to the next thousand.</v>

1022
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.103
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1023
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 3>You said that stem cells within a decade,</v>

1024
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:05.671
<v Speaker 3>you believe there's a large possibility that it could cure Parkinson's,</v>

1025
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.970
<v Speaker 3>these other things that may be 50 slash 50 and 25 years.</v>

1026
00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they like what,</v>

1027
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:12.760
<v Speaker 3>what are the big ones that you're excited about?</v>

1028
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1029
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.950
<v Speaker 2>so most of what we work on,</v>

1030
00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:17.270
<v Speaker 2>it sounds very first foundation.</v>

1031
00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:18.210
<v Speaker 2>If they thought things,</v>

1032
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.350
<v Speaker 2>we actually do basically no stem cell therapy work and that family,</v>

1033
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.420
<v Speaker 2>because so many other people are doing and it's understood as a very plausible</v>

1034
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 2>and very exciting approach to treating a number of different conditions,</v>

1035
00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.200
<v Speaker 2>not restricted,</v>

1036
00:40:33.201 --> 00:40:36.260
<v Speaker 2>of course do age related ones and um,</v>

1037
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:36.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:40:36.681 --> 00:40:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it would be a poor use of our limited funds to,</v>

1039
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:40.870
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1040
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.650
<v Speaker 2>to add a drop into that bucket,</v>

1041
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1042
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:48.140
<v Speaker 2>but most of the other things that we felt needed to be done have neglected.</v>

1043
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:48.951
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1044
00:40:48.951 --> 00:40:49.221
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1045
00:40:49.221 --> 00:40:50.840
<v Speaker 2>let me think where I would even start.</v>

1046
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1047
00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:51.711
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1048
00:40:51.711 --> 00:40:55.070
<v Speaker 2>One great example that we've been working on is not disease.</v>

1049
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Atherosclerosis is of course the number one killer in the western world.</v>

1050
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:00.620
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1051
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1052
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it's the code of honor attacks and strokes and it's related because it's caused</v>

1053
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.070
<v Speaker 2>by the lifelong accumulation of a particular type of damage.</v>

1054
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.850
<v Speaker 2>And this guy to talk of damage is the accumulation of waste products in the</v>

1055
00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:14.684
<v Speaker 2>artery wall.</v>

1056
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.920
<v Speaker 2>The wife that mattered to him the most is oxidized cholesterol.</v>

1057
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Cholesterol itself is not a bad molecule.</v>

1058
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.060
<v Speaker 2>People got this wrong a lot,</v>

1059
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.881
<v Speaker 2>but glass right?</v>

1060
00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:24.740
<v Speaker 2>The vital molecule,</v>

1061
00:41:24.741 --> 00:41:26.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to remove your cholesterol,</v>

1062
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 2>you do want to have a remove the contamination cholesterol that accumulates a</v>

1063
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 2>low significant levels in the body oxidized restaurant in particular.</v>

1064
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 2>That is what poisons white blood cells that are in the artery wall and makes</v>

1065
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 2>them into what are called foam cells,</v>

1066
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:47.740
<v Speaker 2>which are the first step in the creation of an atherosclerotic plaque.</v>

1067
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.210
<v Speaker 2>And we'd like to stop that happening and we'd like to prevent atherosclerosis</v>

1068
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:54.044
<v Speaker 2>for variety.</v>

1069
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.320
<v Speaker 2>So the way we've done that is we've identified bacteria in the soil actually</v>

1070
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.830
<v Speaker 2>that had Jane's and enzymes that are,</v>

1071
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:09.850
<v Speaker 2>that allow them to break down oxidized cholesterol and we've identified these</v>

1072
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 2>bacteria and the drains and enzymes and we've introduced those genes into human</v>

1073
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:16.970
<v Speaker 2>fell and fell culture.</v>

1074
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 2>And it works.</v>

1075
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 2>We have shown that these cells that have a engineered gene,</v>

1076
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 2>a much more protected,</v>

1077
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 2>that much more robust in the presence of a certain amount of this toxic oxidized</v>

1078
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:30.850
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol than health data.</v>

1079
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And of course we're moving forward to take that to,</v>

1080
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:34.724
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1081
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.520
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1082
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:35.781
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1083
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:38.950
<v Speaker 2>other types of style into mice before we go into clinical trial.</v>

1084
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of thing that we're doing that earlier stage,</v>

1085
00:42:42.051 --> 00:42:43.580
<v Speaker 2>so it might take a bit longer.</v>

1086
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 2>This oxidized cholesterol.</v>

1087
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Can this be eliminated with diet?</v>

1088
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.261
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1089
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 2>You know the fundamental problem is that these molecules,</v>

1090
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.660
<v Speaker 2>these oxidized cholesterol species,</v>

1091
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 2>they get into a white blood cells.</v>

1092
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 2>They get into a part of the cell called the lifers.</v>

1093
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 2>They poisoned the cell,</v>

1094
00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:01.500
<v Speaker 2>they inactivate the license,</v>

1095
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and that means that the white blood cells can no longer do what they used to be</v>

1096
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 2>able to do it.</v>

1097
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.240
<v Speaker 2>They can no longer process normal cholesterol.</v>

1098
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1099
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:10.070
<v Speaker 2>you can't do anything to the data.</v>

1100
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:15.071
<v Speaker 2>That stuff is just there because the cells don't have any machinery to get rid</v>

1101
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

1102
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.050
<v Speaker 2>but are they a product of what we eat,</v>

1103
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.071
<v Speaker 2>like product,</v>

1104
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 2>but it actually dental product,</v>

1105
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:23.930
<v Speaker 2>so they happen just because the bound to happen,</v>

1106
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 2>but cholesterol comes from animal protein.</v>

1107
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Is that a constant kind of we bring in cholesterol in our diet and we also</v>

1108
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 2>synthesize our own cholesterol and the liver and that's how it should be.</v>

1109
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 2>That cholesterol is doing a good job.</v>

1110
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:42.200
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that oxidation is a chemical reaction that is going to happen in</v>

1111
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:42.561
<v Speaker 2>the body,</v>

1112
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 2>whether you like it or not.</v>

1113
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.280
<v Speaker 2>The fact is we are aerobic organisms.</v>

1114
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 2>We need to breathe,</v>

1115
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:48.220
<v Speaker 2>we need to,</v>

1116
00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.990
<v Speaker 2>we need to inhale oxygen in order to keep going.</v>

1117
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 2>And breathing is really bad for you.</v>

1118
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Breathing is bad for you.</v>

1119
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Breathing is why we get free radicals,</v>

1120
00:43:57.321 --> 00:43:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bit nonnegotiable.</v>

1121
00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:59.323
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>

1122
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.210
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to intervene in this process.</v>

1123
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.510
<v Speaker 2>One step down the chain of events to get rid of the toxic products of breathing</v>

1124
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:09.740
<v Speaker 2>rather than to get rid of breathing itself.</v>

1125
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Breathing is bad for you.</v>

1126
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty straightforward statement.</v>

1127
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's unequivocal.</v>

1128
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1129
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1130
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 1>so when,</v>

1131
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:19.910
<v Speaker 1>when they use like hyperbaric chambers,</v>

1132
00:44:19.911 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 1>oxygen rich environments to enhance healing,</v>

1133
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.730
<v Speaker 1>is that extra band for you necessarily?</v>

1134
00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.440
<v Speaker 2>So of course breathing is also good for you if you don't breathe then yet at</v>

1135
00:44:29.441 --> 00:44:30.100
<v Speaker 2>least grade,</v>

1136
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:30.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1137
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's a trade off.</v>

1138
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 2>There are some aspects of branding than about for you.</v>

1139
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.080
<v Speaker 2>And we need to fix that aspect.</v>

1140
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And those aspects have zero to do with diet.</v>

1141
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.131
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

1142
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:41.964
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1143
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1144
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't type of cholesterol,</v>

1145
00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.640
<v Speaker 2>so I feel really low on,</v>

1146
00:44:46.641 --> 00:44:47.211
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1147
00:44:47.211 --> 00:44:48.710
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C or vitamin A,</v>

1148
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:53.950
<v Speaker 2>then you are depleting your own body's ability to limit the toxicity of</v>

1149
00:44:56.331 --> 00:45:01.331
<v Speaker 2>breathing and therefore the breathing will be even more bad food that otherwise</v>

1150
00:45:01.851 --> 00:45:02.360
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

1151
00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.100
<v Speaker 1>So oxidants are crucial if you're going to bother breathing</v>

1152
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:06.360
<v Speaker 2>to a point.</v>

1153
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that because breathing has been around a long time and</v>

1154
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:11.490
<v Speaker 2>breathing,</v>

1155
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 2>breathing was invented about 2 billion years ago.</v>

1156
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1157
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 2>evolution has done what evolution tends to do.</v>

1158
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It made the best of a bad job.</v>

1159
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 2>And therefore at this point,</v>

1160
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.910
<v Speaker 2>some of the toxic byproducts of breathing free radical,</v>

1161
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1162
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:29.220
<v Speaker 2>actually not just bad molecules that are also good,</v>

1163
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 2>they used by the body as signaling molecules.</v>

1164
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 2>So if we were to have a magic wand that we could wave and just get rid of all</v>

1165
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 2>the free radicals in the body,</v>

1166
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.540
<v Speaker 2>that will be extremely bad.</v>

1167
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.420
<v Speaker 2>You'd die at one.</v>

1168
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 2>What we have,</v>

1169
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:42.933
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>

1170
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 2>a rather interesting balance that the body techs,</v>

1171
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.480
<v Speaker 2>if you have too few antioxidants,</v>

1172
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.650
<v Speaker 2>then that's bad news.</v>

1173
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you have an abundance of antioxidants,</v>

1174
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 2>if you take megadoses of vitamin C or vitamin here,</v>

1175
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1176
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really do much written.</v>

1177
00:45:57.931 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't is because the body wants a certain amount of free radicals around so</v>

1178
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:04.730
<v Speaker 2>it dials down the inherent,</v>

1179
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:09.570
<v Speaker 2>the inbuilt antioxidant Mechan machinery and you end up basically where you</v>

1180
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:10.404
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

1181
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So this bacteria that you're introducing to skin culture,</v>

1182
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:19.000
<v Speaker 2>getting the bacteria themselves were introducing that one,</v>

1183
00:46:19.001 --> 00:46:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Jane from the back.</v>

1184
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Terry one gene from an eminent,</v>

1185
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.500
<v Speaker 1>integrating it into language,</v>

1186
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.000
<v Speaker 1>artery tissue.</v>

1187
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 1>We are in cultures.</v>

1188
00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>

1189
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:28.773
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1190
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.260
<v Speaker 1>How far away do you believe you are to implementing this in an actual human</v>

1191
00:46:33.261 --> 00:46:34.010
<v Speaker 1>being</v>

1192
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.843
<v Speaker 2>or?</v>

1193
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1194
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.580
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials I think could be.</v>

1195
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Could be 10 years away.</v>

1196
00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I think we were probably talking,</v>

1197
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.050
<v Speaker 2>we'll probably talking a.</v>

1198
00:46:45.051 --> 00:46:46.570
<v Speaker 2>This is an intermediate one way might.</v>

1199
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I would expect that we've got a 50 slash 50 chance of bringing this to the point</v>

1200
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.140
<v Speaker 2>of being an approved therapy within maybe 15 years.</v>

1201
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:54.761
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1202
00:46:54.761 --> 00:46:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Me As a lay person,</v>

1203
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:57.940
<v Speaker 1>standing on the outside looking at all this stuff,</v>

1204
00:46:57.941 --> 00:46:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm always very optimistic.</v>

1205
00:46:59.321 --> 00:46:59.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1206
00:46:59.711 --> 00:47:00.461
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be great.</v>

1207
00:47:00.461 --> 00:47:01.241
<v Speaker 1>Within my lifetime,</v>

1208
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:04.090
<v Speaker 1>to see some huge changes talking to you though,</v>

1209
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I get less optimistic,</v>

1210
00:47:06.101 --> 00:47:11.101
<v Speaker 1>but I get more aware of the actual landscape itself and I started realizing,</v>

1211
00:47:11.351 --> 00:47:11.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1212
00:47:11.531 --> 00:47:16.210
<v Speaker 1>this this thing that we have that we're carrying around this body has an</v>

1213
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:21.810
<v Speaker 1>indescribable number of operations that are going on simultaneously and there's.</v>

1214
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.450
<v Speaker 1>There's there's reactions and counter reactions and all of these are completely</v>

1215
00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>totally</v>

1216
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:30.641
<v Speaker 3>understood,</v>

1217
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:31.310
<v Speaker 3>so when you're.</v>

1218
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:36.100
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about anti aging or life extension or any of these things,</v>

1219
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about just a stupendous number of different processes that are</v>

1220
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 3>going on in the body that we're going to have to figure out and that is going to</v>

1221
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 3>take a very,</v>

1222
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 3>very long time and not one person is going to ever understand all of the</v>

1223
00:47:51.191 --> 00:47:52.024
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1224
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Perfectly articulated why people who started the biology of aging Hud,</v>

1225
00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 2>but about the mid 1980 to go to the point of absolute rejection of the idea that</v>

1226
00:48:04.611 --> 00:48:08.390
<v Speaker 2>what they even were working on was doing anything about aging.</v>

1227
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

1228
00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:14.090
<v Speaker 2>It had become very frowned upon even to talk about intervention and a ground</v>

1229
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.721
<v Speaker 2>application,</v>

1230
00:48:14.721 --> 00:48:15.560
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1231
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.551
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>

1232
00:48:16.551 --> 00:48:17.900
<v Speaker 2>because everyone understood,</v>

1233
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.501
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1234
00:48:18.501 --> 00:48:18.861
<v Speaker 2>the buddy,</v>

1235
00:48:18.861 --> 00:48:19.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated.</v>

1236
00:48:19.761 --> 00:48:21.320
<v Speaker 2>We understand it so poorly.</v>

1237
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It's never gonna happen,</v>

1238
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 2>so please.</v>

1239
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.490
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing that changed for in two steps.</v>

1240
00:48:28.491 --> 00:48:28.940
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1241
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.520
<v Speaker 2>establish a workout and then the debt,</v>

1242
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:31.354
<v Speaker 2>the debt,</v>

1243
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.020
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that happened late 19,</v>

1244
00:48:33.021 --> 00:48:33.650
<v Speaker 2>88,</v>

1245
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.981
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

1246
00:48:33.981 --> 00:48:38.981
<v Speaker 2>98 with people started to discover simple ways to extend the longevity of some</v>

1247
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.420
<v Speaker 2>certain laboratory organism,</v>

1248
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:45.310
<v Speaker 2>initially worms and eventually my wife.</v>

1249
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 2>This was enormously exciting.</v>

1250
00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Those discoveries and they fall out from them,</v>

1251
00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:53.960
<v Speaker 2>still dominate the failed in people's eyes.</v>

1252
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1253
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:59.750
<v Speaker 2>the problem is it doesn't work for long lived organisms essentially because it's</v>

1254
00:48:59.751 --> 00:49:04.751
<v Speaker 2>all about the ability of the organism to respond to famine and short lived</v>

1255
00:49:06.141 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 2>organisms need to be able to respond more dramatically to Pharma.</v>

1256
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:11.090
<v Speaker 2>And then long lived Wednesday.</v>

1257
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:13.490
<v Speaker 2>So I'll go into more detail if you really well,</v>

1258
00:49:13.491 --> 00:49:14.510
<v Speaker 2>but that's the basics of it.</v>

1259
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:19.910
<v Speaker 2>The one that did work was when I came along 15 years ago and talked about damage</v>

1260
00:49:19.911 --> 00:49:20.744
<v Speaker 2>repair.</v>

1261
00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Here's the reason why damage repair is so important.</v>

1262
00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.160
<v Speaker 2>It sidesteps a.</v>

1263
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:29.270
<v Speaker 2>all of that complexity that you were talking about and all of our ignorance</v>

1264
00:49:29.271 --> 00:49:34.271
<v Speaker 2>about that complexity was it sidestep it because the damage that the body does</v>

1265
00:49:35.121 --> 00:49:40.121
<v Speaker 2>to itself throughout life as a side effect of its normal operation is only</v>

1266
00:49:41.391 --> 00:49:43.700
<v Speaker 2>harmful late in life.</v>

1267
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:48.890
<v Speaker 2>The body is set up to tolerate a certain amount of that damage and the problem</v>

1268
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.400
<v Speaker 2>only starts when the amount of damage exceeds the amount that I set up to</v>

1269
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:53.283
<v Speaker 2>tolerate.</v>

1270
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.090
<v Speaker 2>So that means that until that point,</v>

1271
00:49:56.570 --> 00:50:01.520
<v Speaker 2>the damage is not participating in this massively complex network of processes</v>

1272
00:50:01.521 --> 00:50:02.720
<v Speaker 2>that we call metabolism.</v>

1273
00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just accumulating as a,</v>

1274
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1275
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.080
<v Speaker 2>an inert byproduct.</v>

1276
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.620
<v Speaker 2>It's only by mass action after it becomes a enormously abundant in late life</v>

1277
00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:14.270
<v Speaker 2>that it becomes part of metabolism,</v>

1278
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:17.030
<v Speaker 2>a gap that's hugely important.</v>

1279
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.550
<v Speaker 2>It means that if we go in and target the damage,</v>

1280
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.390
<v Speaker 2>one who's not participating in metabolism,</v>

1281
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:28.810
<v Speaker 2>we have a much better chance of doing so appreciable side of that than we would</v>

1282
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 2>if we were going in and trying to manipulate metabolism itself.</v>

1283
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Which abl within itself,</v>

1284
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:35.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1285
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 2>and crazy insane network of Spaghetti code that not got any comments,</v>

1286
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1287
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.240
<v Speaker 2>And you try to do anything to it to stop it doing the thing.</v>

1288
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:46.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't want it to do the creation of damage.</v>

1289
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have unintended consequences that do more harm than good,</v>

1290
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't do that,</v>

1291
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:58.331
<v Speaker 2>if you instead of the damage itself was is outside of that network of metabolism</v>

1292
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 2>than he'd done had that problem in the same way.</v>

1293
00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Is there any focus on concentrating on the potential of.</v>

1294
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 3>You were saying that the body has a very good ability to deal with all this</v>

1295
00:51:11.281 --> 00:51:15.750
<v Speaker 3>damage at a young age and as you get older it becomes less and less able to</v>

1296
00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.050
<v Speaker 3>blend the real solution,</v>

1297
00:51:19.051 --> 00:51:20.670
<v Speaker 3>be catching it early.</v>

1298
00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Finding people that are very young and implementing these strategies on them.</v>

1299
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Not really because the only reason why an older person who's less able to cope</v>

1300
00:51:30.471 --> 00:51:31.304
<v Speaker 2>with the it,</v>

1301
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 2>it's because the older person has more damage occurring.</v>

1302
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Moreover around why is that?</v>

1303
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Because it had longer to accumulate and me going away,</v>

1304
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 2>so young person doesn't have much damage.</v>

1305
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.570
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really make sense for someone in their twenties.</v>

1306
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:46.423
<v Speaker 2>Even 30,</v>

1307
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 2>let's look for 20,</v>

1308
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:48.021
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

1309
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 2>40 years from now when they therapies actually exist,</v>

1310
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.670
<v Speaker 2>would it make sense for a 20 year old to actually a of the therapist?</v>

1311
00:51:55.671 --> 00:52:00.671
<v Speaker 2>Probably not because that's going to be at least another 20 or 30 years before</v>

1312
00:52:01.491 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 2>they're going to suffer any actual serious functional decline as a result of</v>

1313
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:09.160
<v Speaker 2>this damage and during that time the therapy,</v>

1314
00:52:09.161 --> 00:52:14.161
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get better by more convenient and more comprehensive and</v>

1315
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.793
<v Speaker 2>thorough.</v>

1316
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>The tradeoff is to wait for the therapist to be improved.</v>

1317
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1318
00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:22.020
<v Speaker 3>that's not necessarily what I was getting at.</v>

1319
00:52:22.021 --> 00:52:22.854
<v Speaker 3>What I was getting at.</v>

1320
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.310
<v Speaker 3>You were saying that over time that damage accumulates to the point where your</v>

1321
00:52:26.311 --> 00:52:28.260
<v Speaker 3>body can no longer process the damage anymore.</v>

1322
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:29.730
<v Speaker 3>What would it be?</v>

1323
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.380
<v Speaker 3>More advantageous to catch it before it accumulates to deal with the issues</v>

1324
00:52:34.381 --> 00:52:35.790
<v Speaker 3>before they become substantial?</v>

1325
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1326
00:52:36.291 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 2>but what fence is,</v>

1327
00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 2>we're going in and saying,</v>

1328
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 2>let's not take 20 year old,</v>

1329
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

1330
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 2>like 40 or 50 year old,</v>

1331
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.640
<v Speaker 2>eight year old,</v>

1332
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.331
<v Speaker 2>not 80 year olds.</v>

1333
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:48.980
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked if you're 80 already fucked you just for now that it's harder.</v>

1334
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Let me go into that a little bit more data.</v>

1335
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 2>If you take someone who's let's say 50,</v>

1336
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.430
<v Speaker 2>that all the natives defense therapy,</v>

1337
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 2>the damage repair therapy that reduce their level of damage to a white world</v>

1338
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:01.340
<v Speaker 2>back when they were 20 or 30 years ago,</v>

1339
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 2>and of course bundling periodically.</v>

1340
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1341
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 2>if the damage has already got the point where it caused disease and disability</v>

1342
00:53:08.991 --> 00:53:09.824
<v Speaker 2>to image.</v>

1343
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's say someone who's typically it,</v>

1344
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>they've gone downhill quite a lot.</v>

1345
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Then these therapies are still going to be very useful,</v>

1346
00:53:16.431 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be useful in a slightly different way.</v>

1347
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.740
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be useful when used in combination with traditional geriatric</v>

1348
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.560
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

1349
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 2>The kind that currently we have today.</v>

1350
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Remember what I said earlier,</v>

1351
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 2>that the geriatric therapies today don't work and they never will work.</v>

1352
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Basically because they're attacking the symptoms.</v>

1353
00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:40.170
<v Speaker 2>They are kind of laboring under the apprehension that the diseases of old age or</v>

1354
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>like infections.</v>

1355
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Well that means is that basically they hacking away at something that is</v>

1356
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:50.151
<v Speaker 2>becoming harder and harder to hack away at because it's cause it namely the</v>

1357
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:52.890
<v Speaker 2>damage from me throughout life.</v>

1358
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 2>It's continuing to accumulate,</v>

1359
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 2>so if you think about what that means,</v>

1360
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 2>if we were able to go in and actually repair the damage,</v>

1361
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:02.970
<v Speaker 2>then we would be in,</v>

1362
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

1363
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.180
<v Speaker 2>potentiating the geriatric therapists,</v>

1364
00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 2>we will allow the geriatric therapist to actually work and it may end up being</v>

1365
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 2>that we need to do that,</v>

1366
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:13.400
<v Speaker 2>that if someone's in there,</v>

1367
00:54:13.401 --> 00:54:17.430
<v Speaker 2>it was going downhill and we only fix the damage that got them that way.</v>

1368
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.660
<v Speaker 2>That won't be enough because the diseases,</v>

1369
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:20.431
<v Speaker 2>the pathology is,</v>

1370
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a lot of their own at that point.</v>

1371
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.110
<v Speaker 2>We made to go in at two levels at the same time.</v>

1372
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:28.350
<v Speaker 2>What are these geriatric therapists that I've just been,</v>

1373
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.251
<v Speaker 2>I've just been like,</v>

1374
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:29.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1375
00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:30.663
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1376
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1377
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:34.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1378
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.620
<v Speaker 2>injecting dopamine for Parkinson's disease for example.</v>

1379
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:38.431
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

1380
00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1381
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:39.930
<v Speaker 2>short term benefit,</v>

1382
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 2>mild benefit,</v>

1383
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 2>a reason.</v>

1384
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the problem is getting worse.</v>

1385
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:46.260
<v Speaker 2>The cell to continuing to die,</v>

1386
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you're going to need more and more drug.</v>

1387
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Many become more and more resistant to,</v>

1388
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:49.981
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1389
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 2>it's being supplied in the wrong schedule anywhere at the wrong times because</v>

1390
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:57.810
<v Speaker 2>you can own it because just took it to the nature of delivery.</v>

1391
00:54:57.811 --> 00:54:59.430
<v Speaker 2>You can only deliver it in a Boliss,</v>

1392
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1393
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1394
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 2>these things are all ways in which such therapies cannot be perfect.</v>

1395
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if we were to put the cells back to repair the originating damage,</v>

1396
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:15.380
<v Speaker 2>then any other things downstream that had gone wrong in the rest of the brain</v>

1397
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.110
<v Speaker 2>would be treatable by other therapies,</v>

1398
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:22.260
<v Speaker 2>by more traditional therapies in a much more effective way.</v>

1399
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And they can now one of their methods or you're looking into for repairing</v>

1400
00:55:25.651 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 2>damage other than introducing this bacteria to.</v>

1401
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:28.891
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1402
00:55:28.891 --> 00:55:29.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1403
00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's the second one I mentioned the first run,</v>

1404
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:32.750
<v Speaker 2>but wherever was just stem cell therapy,</v>

1405
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1406
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1407
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 2>let's take another one.</v>

1408
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's take um,</v>

1409
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:37.853
<v Speaker 2>the immune system.</v>

1410
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:42.510
<v Speaker 2>So the immune system is a classic example of the problem of what I call death</v>

1411
00:55:42.511 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 2>resistant cells.</v>

1412
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 2>That means cells with that rather than having too few of them in Parkinson's</v>

1413
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

1414
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you have too many of them.</v>

1415
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:51.750
<v Speaker 2>And in particularly,</v>

1416
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>you have too many because they're not dying when they're supposed to.</v>

1417
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.020
<v Speaker 2>People don't often think in terms of the idea that felt that there could be any</v>

1418
00:55:59.021 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 2>cells that should die,</v>

1419
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.390
<v Speaker 2>but the immune system is a great example of that where when you get an</v>

1420
00:56:04.391 --> 00:56:05.224
<v Speaker 2>infection,</v>

1421
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 2>finances I have now,</v>

1422
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:07.404
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1423
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you have a very small population of white blood cells that divide like crazy to</v>

1424
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:16.970
<v Speaker 2>get to a big enough population to attack and eliminate the infection.</v>

1425
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.360
<v Speaker 2>After that happened,</v>

1426
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:23.660
<v Speaker 2>that almost all of them die again to leave written basically for a completely</v>

1427
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:25.870
<v Speaker 2>different subset to divide like crazy.</v>

1428
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Next time you get a different infection.</v>

1429
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Turns out that in old age,</v>

1430
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 2>that whole cycle of division and death,</v>

1431
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1432
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:40.230
<v Speaker 2>basically goes wrong and you end up with a lot of cells that divide like crazy</v>

1433
00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 2>to attack an infection.</v>

1434
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Then when the things got away,</v>

1435
00:56:42.851 --> 00:56:44.020
<v Speaker 2>they don't die again.</v>

1436
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 2>And they're getting in the way they inhibited the proliferation of other cells.</v>

1437
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 2>So what do we want to do about that?</v>

1438
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1439
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 2>there are various options out there,</v>

1440
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 2>but we think that we need to go for the juggler of this.</v>

1441
00:56:55.571 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 2>We need to do something that's very decisive and so we're looking at a method</v>

1442
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 2>that's called suicide gene therapy.</v>

1443
00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Well now that sounds pretty crazy,</v>

1444
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:05.320
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

1445
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:10.320
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that it's actually much less crazy than the name implies.</v>

1446
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's like gene therapy has been a routine technique in the lab,</v>

1447
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.960
<v Speaker 2>a Doosan mice,</v>

1448
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:17.561
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1449
00:57:17.561 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 2>for quite a long time.</v>

1450
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what it is is you introduce a gene into cells that produce the toxic</v>

1451
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 2>protein when the protein is produced,</v>

1452
00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:27.664
<v Speaker 2>the cell dies,</v>

1453
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:32.730
<v Speaker 2>but you arrange this so that the protein is only produced when the cell gets</v>

1454
00:57:32.921 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 2>into a particular state that you don't want to do.</v>

1455
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.813
<v Speaker 2>At that point,</v>

1456
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm relatively routine idea.</v>

1457
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.100
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1458
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.170
<v Speaker 2>what we would like to do is to make it work for humans.</v>

1459
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.140
<v Speaker 2>And the problem there is you've got to make it safe.</v>

1460
00:57:47.141 --> 00:57:47.974
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1461
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:48.431
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1462
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 2>gene therapy in general is a very tricky concept to make safe and that it some</v>

1463
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 2>ups and downs over the past 20 years at least.</v>

1464
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 2>But the um,</v>

1465
00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.740
<v Speaker 2>got into service,</v>

1466
00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't therapy had additional difficulties.</v>

1467
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.060
<v Speaker 2>You really don't want this go this Jane talks that where's the toxic protein?</v>

1468
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Just killing cells randomly when it shouldn't be.</v>

1469
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.770
<v Speaker 2>So we're working on new,</v>

1470
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 2>more elaborate ways to put multiple lines of defense against that problem.</v>

1471
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:22.450
<v Speaker 2>How many different people do you guys employ that you have working on all these</v>

1472
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 2>various methods?</v>

1473
00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:24.401
<v Speaker 2>Kind of.</v>

1474
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what you mean by employed because we have some people that way fund</v>

1475
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.230
<v Speaker 2>through university labs,</v>

1476
00:58:29.231 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 2>but taking the broader definition of everyone who relied on us for that salary,</v>

1477
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I think throughout that at this point.</v>

1478
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And do you,</v>

1479
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 2>do you personally oversee all these various projects or do you other the chief</v>

1480
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:41.284
<v Speaker 2>science officer?</v>

1481
00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.880
<v Speaker 2>I oversee the project and the fence of.</v>

1482
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.793
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1483
00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I would say the decision making process of prioritizing projects,</v>

1484
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:50.890
<v Speaker 2>deciding which new projects to do,</v>

1485
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:55.891
<v Speaker 2>deciding how about I was going to regularly with the professors and other lab</v>

1486
00:58:58.121 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 2>heads that are responsible for the project.</v>

1487
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:00.971
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1488
00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:02.290
<v Speaker 2>that's what I did in addition to,</v>

1489
00:59:02.291 --> 00:59:07.010
<v Speaker 2>of course also bang the chief outreach reserve and the chief wizard.</v>

1490
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1491
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.820
<v Speaker 2>not mean everyone notices you,</v>

1492
00:59:10.821 --> 00:59:12.210
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about life extension.</v>

1493
00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a sorceress beard.</v>

1494
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.940
<v Speaker 2>This is by that day I told my last float by.</v>

1495
00:59:16.941 --> 00:59:17.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1496
00:59:17.121 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for the ethic.</v>

1497
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.420
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1498
00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Then he asked the my wife campaigns after we met for a long time.</v>

1499
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:28.200
<v Speaker 2>We met 25 years ago now and it took her five years to persuade me to grow there,</v>

1500
00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.450
<v Speaker 2>but eventually I tried to give it a go and I was as surprised as anybody when it</v>

1501
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:33.284
<v Speaker 2>came out like this.</v>

1502
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because that's kind of your calling card I suppose it has</v>

1503
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:36.921
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>

1504
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:37.754
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1505
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>are you satisfied by this research?</v>

1506
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Is this is a stimulating to you?</v>

1507
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Is this something that you truly enjoying this process?</v>

1508
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.151
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1509
00:59:45.151 --> 00:59:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I always have an ambivalence.</v>

1510
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:48.570
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

1511
00:59:48.571 --> 00:59:48.961
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1512
00:59:48.961 --> 00:59:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm extremely gratified that it's going so well from a personal perspective of</v>

1513
00:59:52.921 --> 00:59:55.650
<v Speaker 2>if I'm proud that I've been able to make a significant difference,</v>

1514
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time all of that,</v>

1515
00:59:57.311 --> 01:00:02.311
<v Speaker 2>it always enormously to by the knowledge that the still a lot of people dying</v>

1516
01:00:03.301 --> 01:00:04.050
<v Speaker 2>out that,</v>

1517
01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:05.850
<v Speaker 2>that this is not going to fly.</v>

1518
01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.430
<v Speaker 2>So I talked about our budget before,</v>

1519
01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

1520
01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1521
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:12.660
<v Speaker 2>we have about $5 million a year that we spend.</v>

1522
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:17.370
<v Speaker 2>That's an incredibly small amount for the thing that producers most of the</v>

1523
01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:18.270
<v Speaker 2>world's suffering.</v>

1524
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.253
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1525
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1526
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.150
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell's going on there?</v>

1527
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:26.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I spend more of my time trying to raise money than I do actually</v>

1528
01:00:26.071 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>overseeing the thought I have to the dilemma.</v>

1529
01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1530
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:30.841
<v Speaker 2>Well that's right.</v>

1531
01:00:30.841 --> 01:00:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean even if it was a third one more zero to that budget,</v>

1532
01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:38.940
<v Speaker 2>if we had like $50,000,000 or $100,000,000,000 a year spend,</v>

1533
01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.000
<v Speaker 2>we'd probably be going three times faster,</v>

1534
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>three times faster and that would save the most insane number of lie.</v>

1535
01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:50.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that really gets me out of bed in the morning.</v>

1536
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you have the ear of politicians?</v>

1537
01:00:53.381 --> 01:00:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you have the ear of,</v>

1538
01:00:54.761 --> 01:00:59.470
<v Speaker 3>of of people that are in charge of the universities that will listen to you and</v>

1539
01:00:59.471 --> 01:01:01.300
<v Speaker 3>perhaps allocate more money your way.</v>

1540
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a very complicated network of conversations that needs to happen.</v>

1541
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.540
<v Speaker 2>The difficulty with politicians,</v>

1542
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.750
<v Speaker 2>of course there's the politicians ultimately have one single God I live,</v>

1543
01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:15.751
<v Speaker 2>which is to get reelected as the public policy tends to follow public opinion</v>

1544
01:01:16.511 --> 01:01:17.650
<v Speaker 2>rather than leading edge.</v>

1545
01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's more important to me to appeal to public opinion and try to educate</v>

1546
01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>people and right at the quality of debate,</v>

1547
01:01:24.851 --> 01:01:27.760
<v Speaker 2>that's why they said that interviews like this apart from anything else.</v>

1548
01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1549
01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:30.160
<v Speaker 2>then of course there's other people,</v>

1550
01:01:30.161 --> 01:01:30.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1551
01:01:30.341 --> 01:01:32.320
<v Speaker 2>this wealthy individuals trying to,</v>

1552
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:32.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1553
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I try to,</v>

1554
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I try to meet as many of those.</v>

1555
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I can generally get them to understand what's going on.</v>

1556
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.890
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we're a five,</v>

1557
01:01:38.891 --> 01:01:39.011
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1558
01:01:39.011 --> 01:01:39.341
<v Speaker 2>one c,</v>

1559
01:01:39.341 --> 01:01:41.440
<v Speaker 2>three public charity obviously does help.</v>

1560
01:01:41.441 --> 01:01:44.320
<v Speaker 2>It means that anyone can give us money in a tax efficient manner,</v>

1561
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:45.270
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1562
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.350
<v Speaker 2>we've just got to get more of that money in the door.</v>

1563
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Do you have kickstarter?</v>

1564
01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Go Fund me.</v>

1565
01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Any of those accounts?</v>

1566
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:54.410
<v Speaker 2>We have done a certain amount of crowd funding,</v>

1567
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately must,</v>

1568
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:56.151
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1569
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:58.750
<v Speaker 2>pretty much all of the crowd funding a,</v>

1570
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.940
<v Speaker 2>that can be taken a really difficult to reconcile with what we do essentially.</v>

1571
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're looking for small amounts,</v>

1572
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.341
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1573
01:02:07.341 --> 01:02:09.940
<v Speaker 2>but we're looking for relatively large amount of United States seven digit,</v>

1574
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1575
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>project for those things.</v>

1576
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really got to appeal to the imagination what the specific achievement is</v>

1577
01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:18.250
<v Speaker 2>going to be a,</v>

1578
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:19.183
<v Speaker 2>with early stage.</v>

1579
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to explain that in terms that really gripped paypal.</v>

1580
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really worked all that well for us.</v>

1581
01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.690
<v Speaker 3>What we were describing before that pharmaceutical companies sort of hedging</v>

1582
01:02:28.691 --> 01:02:29.051
<v Speaker 3>their bets,</v>

1583
01:02:29.051 --> 01:02:31.480
<v Speaker 3>waiting on the sidelines for something to be worth betting on.</v>

1584
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:33.311
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

1585
01:02:33.311 --> 01:02:34.840
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to change that if we can,</v>

1586
01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:39.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever impact we can have on it and this podcast gets millions and millions of</v>

1587
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.580
<v Speaker 3>downloads and I'm sure we'll have some effect on it,</v>

1588
01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:43.720
<v Speaker 3>but I would like to,</v>

1589
01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:44.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1590
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.221
<v Speaker 3>whatever you need,</v>

1591
01:02:45.221 --> 01:02:49.290
<v Speaker 3>do you need things tweeted for you and posted on the bottom.</v>

1592
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.570
<v Speaker 3>This is fascinating stuff to me.</v>

1593
01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously because I have zero research background,</v>

1594
01:02:55.871 --> 01:02:57.310
<v Speaker 3>no medical science background.</v>

1595
01:02:57.311 --> 01:03:00.370
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's like when I get a chance to talk to someone like you,</v>

1596
01:03:00.371 --> 01:03:05.371
<v Speaker 3>it's like a window into this world that I only a ordinarily get through articles</v>

1597
01:03:06.251 --> 01:03:07.540
<v Speaker 3>and papers.</v>

1598
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:08.621
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1599
01:03:08.621 --> 01:03:09.454
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1600
01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:09.970
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1601
01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:11.440
<v Speaker 3>it's massively important.</v>

1602
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.283
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>

1603
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.280
<v Speaker 3>as I discussed before,</v>

1604
01:03:15.281 --> 01:03:15.911
<v Speaker 3>as I said before,</v>

1605
01:03:15.911 --> 01:03:18.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a fundamental part of human nature.</v>

1606
01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:21.300
<v Speaker 3>We want to improve everything and your health and your,</v>

1607
01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:26.301
<v Speaker 3>your ability to enjoy this time is huge and if you could extend that,</v>

1608
01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.590
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1609
01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:29.560
<v Speaker 3>you have the potential to be a better person.</v>

1610
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:31.720
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm a better person now than I was 10 years ago.</v>

1611
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.840
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd be even better if I could get another 100 and you know,</v>

1612
01:03:34.841 --> 01:03:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I think we could do some real change and I think a lot of that real change</v>

1613
01:03:39.281 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

1614
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:40.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1615
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.350
<v Speaker 3>there's that issue.</v>

1616
01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Like why worry about this are fundamental problems are the toxification of the</v>

1617
01:03:44.711 --> 01:03:45.380
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

1618
01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:45.531
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1619
01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:45.940
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1620
01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:50.940
<v Speaker 3>I think we could put more emphasis on that if we could have some of the</v>

1621
01:03:51.611 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 3>brilliant people that we have a live today live longer</v>

1622
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 2>back in 2006.</v>

1623
01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:57.450
<v Speaker 2>When I spoke at Ted,</v>

1624
01:03:57.451 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>actually I made that whole comfort,</v>

1625
01:03:59.761 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 2>the centerpiece of my talk.</v>

1626
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I said basically zero visionaries.</v>

1627
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:05.220
<v Speaker 2>You like aiming high.</v>

1628
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.530
<v Speaker 2>This could be the critical feature of this.</v>

1629
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Even independently of the in inherent humanitarian value of defeating aging,</v>

1630
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 2>aging is the thing that has ground up doubt over the history of civilization,</v>

1631
01:04:22.981 --> 01:04:27.060
<v Speaker 2>the thing that has made us know that we are at the mercy of nature.</v>

1632
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.150
<v Speaker 2>If we can bring that truly under control,</v>

1633
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.010
<v Speaker 2>then this will empower us.</v>

1634
01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:37.011
<v Speaker 2>It will make us feel really much more confident that we can address the other</v>

1635
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>really hard problems,</v>

1636
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 2>whether it's climate change,</v>

1637
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1638
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 2>world peace,</v>

1639
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be.</v>

1640
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.710
<v Speaker 3>The guys who run the global 20 slash 45 initiative,</v>

1641
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:45.991
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1642
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:46.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1643
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.030
<v Speaker 3>the idea that,</v>

1644
01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:47.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1645
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:51.050
<v Speaker 3>there'll be some sort of technological answer to this question.</v>

1646
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Are they supportive of the biological ideas as well as their cooperation between</v>

1647
01:04:55.221 --> 01:04:55.880
<v Speaker 3>these two groups?</v>

1648
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.713
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

1649
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1650
01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.520
<v Speaker 2>There's always a spectrum of opinion with regard to desirability and feasibility</v>

1651
01:05:03.731 --> 01:05:04.564
<v Speaker 2>of the things.</v>

1652
01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>But absolutely,</v>

1653
01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:06.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1654
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows that we're on the same side.</v>

1655
01:05:08.831 --> 01:05:10.330
<v Speaker 2>We're not in favor of getting fit.</v>

1656
01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:12.830
<v Speaker 3>You are truly a mad scientist.</v>

1657
01:05:12.831 --> 01:05:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I know you're tired and I know you,</v>

1658
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 3>you're way past your bedtime when it comes to the UK.</v>

1659
01:05:18.221 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 3>So I really appreciate you being here and for for folks at home,</v>

1660

1662
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.970
