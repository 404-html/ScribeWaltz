<v Speaker 1>but I didn't see it.</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.981
<v Speaker 1>I wish that a fighter's appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>science of boxing more.</v>

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>When GSP one of those fights he train </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Freddie Roach and it came back with</v>

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>that Fucking Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made waves,</v>

5
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people didn't copy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arlovski did first it was like,</v>

6
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So she's,</v>

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate it that much.</v>

12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>More like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so much to learn.</v>

13
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>You said there's three levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking pretty much in the UFC.</v>

14
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a discussion last night when,</v>

15
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that triangle jail from the top.</v>

20
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Damien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia.</v>

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.933
<v Speaker 1>That guy came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to the first couple of matches </v>

22
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then somebody told him he was a boxer.</v>

23
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>He started getting lit up and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

24
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking back to just grab your leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all funded.</v>

25
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent.</v>

26
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

27
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a year off.</v>

28
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the Olympic wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 1>a facility wherever.</v>

29
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Just focus on wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still work on your striking.</v>

30
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Go with Duane Ludwig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be awesome.</v>

31
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Rafael Cordeiro.</v>

32
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

33
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>You've got to change shit up now </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

34
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wrestling should be the focus.</v>

35
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>When you see a Rhonda Rousey Promo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't see her getting mets.</v>

36
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>You should see her shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the clench.</v>

37
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Double leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take down singles.</v>

38
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>It should be wrestling every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twice a day for think about her camp,</v>

39
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>her whole camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a boxing gym.</v>

40
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Coaches a boxing coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they want her to be this boxer.</v>

41
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.023
<v Speaker 1>People sold her as a next Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have all that coming in and she </v>

42
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>was murky and girls remember I was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

43
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn her striking.</v>

44
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>She's knocking bitches out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to level.</v>

45
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's coming up?</v>

46
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>She's knocking them out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

47
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the media in a lot of people are</v>

48
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang she,</v>

49
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>she's a knockout artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hear those in her going,</v>

50
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>your knockout artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can strike with anyone.</v>

51
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And her coach like,</v>

52
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was always the case.</v>

53
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You remember when Gerald fought in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

54
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:16.944
<v Speaker 1>it was always the case when Gerald is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he a black male back then or brown </v>

55
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>belt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a brown belt.</v>

56
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Really Good Jujitsu guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his fucking striking coach had it.</v>

57
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that he was a Thai boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

58
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go out there and get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>

59
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.903
<v Speaker 1>And I remember Eddie and I would watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>him hit the bag and hit the meds and </v>

60
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:33.811
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

61
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some scary guys in the UFC.</v>

62
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>And he got a real scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Josh Thompson,</v>

63
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

64
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

65
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

66
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go down like that and then got</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

67
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.023
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What ended up happening as Gerald's </v>

68
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu's jokes treatment as we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about his.</v>

69
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>He was my first student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first before 10th planet.</v>

70
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching Jujitsu to a guy named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerald Street,</v>

71
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>then he a blue belt at the time and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought them up,</v>

72
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>shut him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got really good at the twister,</v>

73
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>really good at rubber guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber who first meet Hook,</v>

74
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>rubber guard triangle and MMA history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:09.724
<v Speaker 1>in a gladiator challenge show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was kicking ass and then he fires </v>

76
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:17.251
<v Speaker 1>John Silva in England in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a spectacular match.</v>

77
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>A Joe showed that fight to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana White.</v>

79
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Dana white game was shot game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson,</v>

80
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.250
<v Speaker 1>he started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started working more a pie with this,</v>

81
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>this Muay Thai coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was six months.</v>

82
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>He was training six months with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

83
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>And he'd been doing any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrestled in high school as well.</v>

84
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>So He'd been grappling a total at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

85
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Joey reading into the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing some for sure.</v>

86
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Joe was just confused in my head.</v>

87
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.120
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

88
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>so he was interested and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting point.</v>

89
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same thing.</v>

90
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It's when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm striking like let's say I got,</v>

91
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm a striker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muy Thai,</v>

92
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:05.314
<v Speaker 1>came in and he'd been doing more type </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years and he wanted to learn the </v>

93
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>ground and he was doing mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already fighting.</v>

94
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comes up a lot.</v>

95
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show them Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in his corner.</v>

96
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be telling him to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>his ass down and work up into Jitsu.</v>

97
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

98

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In six months instead was Bangkok.</v>

118
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.094
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go out there,</v>

119
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 1>so this is what I look at it.</v>

120
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a good thing.</v>

121
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing because this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

122
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.443
<v Speaker 1>Is He Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so believing that he was Bangkok ready </v>

123
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>after six months of Moitai that when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did the walkout in the UFC,</v>

124
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.090
<v Speaker 1>he came out with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

125
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bicep bracelets or whatever,</v>

126
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.543
<v Speaker 1>tigar dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and during the time he was in the </v>

127
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 1>octagon and did you know he went around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Octagon and blessed?</v>

128
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing that through Josh Thompson sitting</v>

129
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>there and I talked to Josh Donaldson </v>
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>

130
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson wrestled in high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a good striker.</v>

131
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking up people off his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was triangling people.</v>

132
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>We knew all about Josh Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerald was not.</v>

133
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>He was not in the best frame of mind for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

134
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.393
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Josh Thompson was a fucking </v>

135
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>killer back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a kid.</v>

136
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in his prime back then.</v>

137
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>That was josh when he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the top,</v>

138
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.200
<v Speaker 1>like five or six guys in the division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got rid of the 155 pound division.</v>

139
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>It was him and Eve Edwards and Eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edwards knocked him out.</v>

140
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eva,</v>

141
00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>where's became an uncrowned king?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this would happen.</v>

142
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.533
<v Speaker 1>So luckily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is according to Josh Thompson </v>

143
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh goes,</v>

144
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:33.644
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so worried about a standard time </v>

145
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.753
<v Speaker 1>stop that when we saw the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole thing was how do we know the </v>

146
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:44.524
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was for sure Josh </v>

147
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Tomlin's not going to want to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground with Gerald.</v>

148
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 1>That's where all this good shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking people up in Nma.</v>

149
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>All his fights up until the USC was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking people up with the Jujitsu.</v>

150
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>So how are we going to get the fight to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground?</v>

151
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>We were thinking about pulling an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate,</v>

152
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>a unorthodox cardpool.</v>

153
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.123
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking like six </v>

154
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

155
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I know he thinks he's Bangkok ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's six months,</v>

156
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

158
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Josh takes him down and I was sitting</v>

159
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 1>there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck thing?</v>

160
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.783
<v Speaker 1>He takes a general dental because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so worried about his tie and Gerald do </v>

161
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>right away throws up a hellfire with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>

162
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>He threw a lot of heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty bad ass to see.</v>

163
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first he almost had him in an arm bar.</v>

164
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Josh pulls out and then there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scramble on the ground.</v>

165
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Gerald ghost for a leg lock because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally pulls out of his garden.</v>

166
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:40.264
<v Speaker 1>Then general who was really good at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>locks and he went for a leg lock and </v>

167
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>then Josh Thompson hit him like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the head of the killer.</v>

168
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.550
<v Speaker 1>That was one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.260
<v Speaker 1>That was one of those going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>going to lead boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risky.</v>

171
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.120
<v Speaker 1>What started this all off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh.</v>

172
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.013
<v Speaker 1>You bolded those coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coaches get these fucking people </v>

173
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.333
<v Speaker 1>convinced that they're trying to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer in one particular camp though </v>

174
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>because in every campus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have like a super star</v>

175
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>camp and it come from my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

176
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you have a superstar wrestling coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing coach,</v>

177
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:12.764
<v Speaker 1>you're spending your time with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to see you win with all their </v>

179
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

180
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Even my coaches get tossed them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The W should be number fucking war.</v>

181
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>It's nice when they win with some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

182
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.073
<v Speaker 1>like fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you showed me that shit that's </v>

183
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.050
<v Speaker 1>always good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all about the Goddamn dumpy.</v>

184
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 1>That's number why you gotta have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>head coach.</v>

185
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a head coach that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a striking coach.</v>

186
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds like a head coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hume as a head coach.</v>

187
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>You know like when he works with Dj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do everything,</v>

188
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work on submissions together,</v>

189
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>spar together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he worked,</v>

190
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.603
<v Speaker 1>they work on all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques and it's total technique and </v>

191
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.064
<v Speaker 1>tactics oriented conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many stars are though in the </v>

192
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like five.</v>

193
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>If one is honestly this like in my mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he,</v>

194
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>if he's not number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's him and for us a hobby,</v>

195
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but I count two that can do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really know the game in and out.</v>

196
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Can do a game plan from standing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restroom to grapple.</v>

197
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mean.</v>

198
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I think those are the one guy might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for you.</v>

199
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:15.460
<v Speaker 1>One guy might be better for the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are the.</v>

200
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.323
<v Speaker 1>Those are the top dogs too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such wizards on the ground are </v>

201
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>wizards to and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could physically do it too.</v>

202
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big part of it and plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know the transition.</v>

203
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes if you go to a pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu guy,</v>

204
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

205
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.043
<v Speaker 1>this isn't gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I commit both hands this I'm gonna </v>

206
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:30.894
<v Speaker 1>get blast in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what George Grid Gel </v>

207
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu</v>

208
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>back when there was very few black </v>
<v Speaker 1>belts,</v>

209
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.954
<v Speaker 1>but then he became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to stand and bang with </v>

210
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>everybody and that was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became this thing standing in banging</v>

211
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens so often.</v>

212
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:45.234
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare that a guy comes back and </v>

213
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 1>figures it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Damien Maia House.</v>

214
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia tried it that way for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

215
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.513
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got sucked into it and they figured </v>

216
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.890
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the time.</v>

217
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda should they took it to what says </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

218
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.530
<v Speaker 1>You go to the dance or took it to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

219
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of early.</v>

220
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I saw a lot of high level Jujitsu guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into the UFC that the hands a Mensa</v>

221
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>mense yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like a three striking and they</v>

222
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:15.624
<v Speaker 1>never evolved to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the fucking striking is evolving </v>

223
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.120
<v Speaker 1>quick a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 1>it used to be that the only guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only black belts that got to the UFC</v>

225
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:32.541
<v Speaker 1>were like the guys that were only </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated their lives to get to.</v>

226
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 1>They just started learning and striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell,</v>

227
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.013
<v Speaker 1>you can tell like holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to fucking get some </v>

228
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>kind of clench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious,</v>

229
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.993
<v Speaker 1>but now with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many goddamn black belts in </v>

230
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Brazil now that it's not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about,</v>
