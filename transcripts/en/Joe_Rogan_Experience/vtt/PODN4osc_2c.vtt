<v Speaker 1>Drive by day,</v>

2
00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.993
<v Speaker 1>All Day.</v>

4
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Now what's the situation with Cyborg at this point?</v>

6
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>That shit pissed hot again,</v>

7
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the,</v>

8
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>to see what the commission does,</v>

9
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>what kind of suspension she's getting at least a year.</v>

10
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>At least.</v>

11
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>What she pissed hot four is also a,</v>

12
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>an anti androgen.</v>

13
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a Dyo has DHT inhibitor.</v>

14
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to rub that shit in my head to prevent a hair loss.</v>

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>They might give her three h t and it's also used by people who take steroids to</v>

16
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>diminish the effects of,</v>

18
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>of like when females take steroids,</v>

20
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>diminish the effect.</v>

21
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>It's also a,</v>

22
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a masking agent,</v>

23
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>so if you've take steroids,</v>

24
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>some people take that stuff as a masking Asian,</v>

25
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.871
<v Speaker 1>she's 31.</v>

26
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>It's also a diuretic.</v>

27
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very weird drug called Spiro.</v>

28
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:47.641
<v Speaker 1>No lack.</v>

29
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Dane lack dean lactone.</v>

30
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>But it has many different uses.</v>

31
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.561
<v Speaker 1>If she,</v>

32
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>if she gets three years,</v>

33
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what's an argument that not a good argument.</v>

34
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>All the arguments that she gave her,</v>

35
00:00:58.621 --> 00:00:59.454
<v Speaker 1>not good arguments,</v>

36
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>that she took something out of competition that she was told by her doctor that</v>

37
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.251
<v Speaker 1>it'd be okay.</v>

38
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>When it's clearly on the Usada banned,</v>

39
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>blessed,</v>

40
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>it's 100% band.</v>

41
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's certain things you could take out us out of context,</v>

42
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>like the big ones pot.</v>

43
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Like say if they catch you tomorrow and you're supposed to fight in six months</v>

44
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and you're smoking weed like crazy and they test you and they go,</v>

45
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:20.431
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

46
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:21.061
<v Speaker 1>we got test to go,</v>

47
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:21.211
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

48
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna let you know I've been smoking a lot of weed.</v>

49
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.401
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

50
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

51
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not steroids.</v>

52
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>That's why John Jones didn't get in trouble when he pissed hot for cocaine three</v>

53
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>weeks out of the fight with Daniel Cormier because that's not in competition and</v>

54
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not a performance enhancing drug.</v>

55
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.941
<v Speaker 1>He's just partying.</v>

56
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So what this is though is a performance enhancing drug,</v>

58
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>not just a performance enhancing drug,</v>

59
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:46.251
<v Speaker 1>but problematic in that it inhibits its performance enhancing in that it works</v>

60
00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>as a diuretic.</v>

61
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to use diuretics,</v>

62
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.011
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

63
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>it also inhibits your,</v>

64
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

65
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.221
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

66
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>their ability to detect steroids in you.</v>

67
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>She's in trouble.</v>

68
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't show you saw it as going to eat her ass up.</v>

69
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And if she gets three years,</v>

70
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

72
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.333
<v Speaker 1>how old is she?</v>

73
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>She's in her mid thirties.</v>

74
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

75
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

76
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>it's time to get tested her because she passed on three world title fights.</v>

77
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>They had three world title fights lined up for her at one 45,</v>

78
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>which is the weight class that she asked for that she said she couldn't make it</v>

79
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>in eight weeks.</v>

80
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And so then they gave her more weeks and they gave her,</v>

81
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

82
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>they gave her a third test and they're like [inaudible] up and whether or not</v>

83
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>they were going to test her anyway,</v>

84
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:26.701
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

85
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>But that's when they tested her and that's when she pissed hot.</v>

86
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

87
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And she did not reveal before that,</v>

88
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>that she was taking that and then she does the whole thing is she's in trouble.</v>

89
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen a skip in all babies?</v>

90
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

91
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>This is a skeptical baby now.</v>

92
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.293

96
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

97
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like bitch,</v>

98
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>that's skeptical snakes.</v>

99
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>So skeptical with with Cyborg super schedules.</v>

100
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the skeptical house?</v>

101
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.640
<v Speaker 1>The motherfucker,</v>

102
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>so skeptical.</v>

103
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Skeptical Cadillac,</v>

104
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Cadillac House.</v>

105
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.513
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

106
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real house?</v>

107
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

108
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Those were windows,</v>

109
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.240
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking window is that skeptical window.</v>

110
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they did that on purpose?</v>

111
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:19.504
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

112
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with people?</v>

113
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>It almost seems like that was an accident.</v>

114
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

115
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Go with Cyborg.</v>

116
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.521
<v Speaker 1>She gets three years.</v>

117
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>She's in trouble.</v>

118
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.163
<v Speaker 1>I financially too.</v>

119
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>When Rhonda loss again and she's throwing shade at Rhonda,</v>

120
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>my bitch,</v>

121
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

122
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>

123
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you just got busted for steroids.</v>

124
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Shameless or steroids.</v>

125
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>She got busted for a dihydrotestosterone.</v>

126
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:40.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

127
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

128
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

129
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not a precursor.</v>

130
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a dihydrotestosterone inhibitor.</v>

131
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.551
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

132
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Inhibitor.</v>

133
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.051
<v Speaker 1>and to me,</v>

135
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>my brain goes,</v>

136
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>

137
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>You're in trouble.</v>

138
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>She certainly could be in trouble.</v>

139
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if she got,</v>

140
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.850
<v Speaker 1>she said it was,</v>

141
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>she's got a bunch of issues because she really did record body getting down to</v>

142
00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>one 40 which downtime,</v>

143
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure that that seems fine when you wreck your body,</v>

144
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>like I think she's saying that she takes in too much water now and her body is</v>

145
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>like trying to hold on to water and that they gave her a drug to diminish the</v>

146
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.874
<v Speaker 1>amount of water.</v>

147
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a couple of doctors about this.</v>

148
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I asked some questions and they all gave me that snake face generally</v>

149
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>

150
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you know her background too.</v>

151
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

152
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.493
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

153
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>he don't fuck with anything that's illegal and you definitely don't fuck with</v>

154
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>anything that people use because they're women that take steroids.</v>

155
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just a coincidence that you happened to be,</v>

156
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you should look at every fucking label extremely carefully.</v>

157
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Is that the worst cut of all time?</v>

158
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>it's one of them.</v>

160
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.361
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean cut?</v>

161
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:43.991
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

162
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:44.824
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

163
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>thought of all chis Diego Sanchez made one 45 be fought and won 85 and ultimate</v>

164
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>fighter one Kenny Floyd.</v>

165
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

166
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>She fucking dead lifts 305 pounds a couple weeks after passing on fights,</v>

167
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>she passes on the fight and then puts up Instagrams of her dead lifting massive</v>

168
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.864
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

169
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.741
<v Speaker 1>You're in,</v>

170
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>and it was whoever the fuck handles her Twitter account because I wrote that up</v>

172
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>because a I,</v>

173
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>me and Brett Akimoto,</v>

174
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>we're having a discussion about it on Twitter.</v>

175
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.273
<v Speaker 1>Very good dude.</v>

176
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>We were having a little back and forth on Twitter about it and uh,</v>

177
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:18.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:19.241
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

179
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it weird that she's not fighting for the title?</v>

180
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:21.311
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

181
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>what's weird is that they pack that she passed on title fight and then post</v>

182
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Instagram photos of her dead lifting and then she responded that it's just like</v>

183
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:31.820
<v Speaker 1>what football players do when they're not in camp.</v>

184
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.251
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

185
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

186
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You saw that,</v>

187
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that golden snitch was like,</v>

188
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

189
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say song?</v>

190
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

191
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>she's not writing now I'm looking at the English is perfect.</v>

192
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:40.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

193
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:41.734
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

194
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.330
<v Speaker 1>this is whoever works with her or her boyfriend or whoever the fuck handles the,</v>

195
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 1>the Instagram account.</v>

196
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

197
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>that's no excuse.</v>

198
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of maintenance that you do that's not dead lifting.</v>

199
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>305 fucking pounds.</v>

200
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>You do that to put on mass.</v>

201
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>That is why you dead lift you dead lift to put fucking mass.</v>

202
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>She's got Muto mass.</v>

203
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>He's got plenty of mass.</v>

204
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>She has no problem with mass,</v>

205
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

206
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not what she needs.</v>

208
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>If she really wants a fight at 145 pounds and she needs more than eight weeks to</v>

209
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:09.794
<v Speaker 1>make the weight,</v>

210
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>what she should be doing is longterm cardio.</v>

211
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what she's doing too though,</v>

212
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Jo.</v>

213
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.841
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

214
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I do that and then the morning I run every morning though.</v>

215
00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:17.451
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

216
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>come the fuck on.</v>

217
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

218
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.280
<v Speaker 1>those aren't as heavy as they learn to develop that power son.</v>

219
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

220
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

221
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.251
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>That's 300 some pounds.</v>

223
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>That's 305 pounds,</v>

224
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.604
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

225
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.403
<v Speaker 1>That's what she's doing.</v>

226
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.530
<v Speaker 1>This is youtube though.</v>

227
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
<v Speaker 1>Why did she tag?</v>

228
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Why did she take Gabby Garcia?</v>

229
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.213
<v Speaker 1>That's worse.</v>

230
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Get here we go see a help tab.</v>

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:49.101
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:49.221
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

242
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are you doing with your phone?</v>

244
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with your phone?</v>

245
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.710
<v Speaker 1>You're going to put that online,</v>

246
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out.</v>

247
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Give me just the golden snitches and literally just waiting.</v>

248
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>If he's talking to a woman,</v>

250
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>dead lifting 305 for reps were going there.</v>

251
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>6:00 AM tomorrow morning.</v>

252
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

254
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

255
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.211
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

256
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>it is possible that you could get that big and that jacked without anything,</v>

257
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a long fucking time and that's what you're doing.</v>

258
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing all the time.</v>

259
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>If you look at some of those crossfit gals that some of those are on steroids,</v>

260
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>100% but some of them are not and you can get big if you have the right genetics</v>

261
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>and you do that kind of lifting.</v>

262
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

263
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>but that kind of lifting is for people that want to put on power.</v>

264
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 1>She's got ridiculous power.</v>

265
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg has some of the nastiest power you're ever going to see in women's MMA</v>

266
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>most probably the most.</v>

267
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>The most it right up there with,</v>

268
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

269
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>she has the full range.</v>

270
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll kick you a knee you and punch you and elbow you where Nunez Nunez</v>

271
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.271
<v Speaker 1>will kick you hard.</v>

272
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:44.040
<v Speaker 1>But it's her punches that are fucking ferocious and she doesn't hit hard and</v>

273
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>sideboard.</v>

274
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.060
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

275
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

276
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Subway hits you like Wendy Tyson with braids.</v>

277
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>She hits.</v>

278
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

279
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>she hits girls.</v>

280
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>You see the cop?</v>

281
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>No fucking kind of shut off the bat.</v>

282
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>She makes worldclass girls look like that.</v>

283
00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Grandma and my cousin,</v>

284
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>she's a beast monster.</v>

285
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunate that there's so much controversy.</v>

286
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I would love if there was someone like cyborg with no shade attached to it,</v>

287
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>no weirdness attached to it.</v>

288
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>But now she's got these two strikes against her.</v>

289
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Will Amanda Nunez,</v>

290
