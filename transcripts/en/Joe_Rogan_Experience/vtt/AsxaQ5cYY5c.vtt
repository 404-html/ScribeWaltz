You have to deal with.

17
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.790
One of the reasons why we're starting this podcast,
ladies.
I didn't,

18
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.830
I forgot it's black Friday.

19
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.890
I don't know why I forgot it's black Friday because I've been talking about it,

20
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:15.270
but I left.

21
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.300
I'd been give myself enough time and I hit this fucking clog near near the the

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.030
mall.
I fucking hate clogs.

23
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.740
I hate the clog at the post office more than any clog because it's just the same

24
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:32.670
thing.
It's like there's a line everybody has to get to this one woman,

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.070
she doesn't want to be there and you didn't want to be there.
It's a mess.

26
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.510
And with stamps.com you can avoid all that shit.

41
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.970
what does,
what does that mean?
It means it's not just a black Friday sale.

42
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.190
It goes for a few days,
but it's a bad ass sale.

Let's talk about life soccer about Greg Fitzsimmons is new comedy special that I

59
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.550
laughed my ass off.
Coming back from the Irvine Improv jazz music,

60
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.870
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience,</v>

61
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.840
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

62
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.890
<v 2>Reg Food Sermons,
my longest running front in comedy.
That's it.</v>

63
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.930
Nobody can break that record.
You can't go back.
Can't possibly

64
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.150
<v 3>with each other is our longest relationships.
As long as you stay alive.
Right.</v>

65
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.290
We,
uh,
we keep it together.
I'm gone back.
I'm an interview.
Some of the boys.

66
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.500
Are you really?
Yeah.
I'm going back and doing this club laugh.

67
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:20.220
Boston December five.
Oh No.
That place is really good.
Yeah,
for sure.
Fears.

68
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:23.570
They're actually this weekend.
Right,
right.
And they just had,
um,

69
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.190
said somebody else.
I'd Proops was there the week before,

70
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.340
but I'm going to do a live podcast on Thursday and I'm going to get some of the

71
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:31.050
guys out.
Uh,
I'm not sure.

72
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:36.051
I reached out to a syslog and Gavin and Mike McDonald and Donovan.

73
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.220
<v 2>Do dil those guys resist that or do they enjoy those conversations?
Like,</v>

74
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.920
because there's a,
there's a bit of remorse in those conversations.
The,
the gray,

75
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.100
we talked to those great comics.
I had a Gavin I want,

76
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.900
so I think is probably our favorite.
Right?
Well,
pretty much honestly,

77
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:58.920
I think one of the greatest performances I've ever seen is a tie between Gavin

78
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.910
and back in his prime.
Teddy bears rock.
Ah,

79
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.810
do you remember how God damn good.
He was so good.
He made you want to quit.

80
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.460
I know,
like I remember seeing him,

81
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:13.050
it was an open mic night and teddy went up and I think Jonathan Katz was

82
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:15.890
actually hosting,
it was one of the times where it was George McDonald,

83
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.030
Jonathan Katz,
remember these still like different people,

84
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:21.030
different headliners used to host the open mic night and he went up in the

85
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.670
middle and just,
you know,
fuck around for 10 minutes or whatever.

86
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.230
And I wanted a quick common and I was like,
no way.
This swagger.

87
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.390
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean it was the definition of swagger.</v>

88
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:32.850
He would walk back and forth on the stage and you know,

89
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:36.210
when a guy has got that comes to where he's rubbing his thumb against the tips

90
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.410
of his fingers as a kind of like flips his hand around and it was all like he'd

91
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:45.411
wear the silk suits and he had this horrible orange hair and he would just talk

92
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:50.560
like a Thespian.
I mean,
he would get to come celebrate with y.

93
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.650
<v 2>You would have to see it to understand.
Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.360
And you would really have to see it in the context of 1988 where it was,

95
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.070
I was convinced he was going to be a God damn superstar.
I was convinced.

96
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.830
I was like,
there's no way you're gonna stop this guy from being Billy crystal.

97
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.110
<v 3>Oh clearly you weren't talking to alcohol and drugs when you said that now I</v>

98
00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:10.180
didn't know cause they stopped him in his tracks.

99
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.760
<v 2>Yeah,
dead boy did I,
I watched that.</v>

100
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.960
I watched that because I was the beneficiary of it a few times cause like gigs

101
00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:19.180
got canceled because teddy couldn't make it or what have you.

102
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:21.550
So it went wrong and I got a Gig like glass minute,

103
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.180
<v 3>I had to stretch twice in a weekend when you know when we were featuring and</v>

104
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.710
they were like,
can you do 30 we'd be like,
yeah.
And our heads were gone.

105
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.830
I got 22 and some crowd work and so I'm up there and I'm supposed to be getting

106
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:38.831
the light at 27 and a k instead I'm getting a stretch sign and I'm like fuck.

107
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.160
Oh No.
So I go as long.
I do like an extra 12 minutes and I'm dying.

108
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.520
And Teddy comes in and apparently he sits the club owner.
When he came in,

109
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:48.470
he goes,
yeah,
yeah,
I'm on.
I'm on a highway.
And uh,

110
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.640
some guys sideswipes me and he says he's,
he takes him out.
Absolutely.

111
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.880
I mean here.
Oh,
did I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's side view.
Mirror is off.

112
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.490
He says the same thing the next night and it's like,

113
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.930
this guy's got a fucking problem.
But,
um,
no,
but I don't,
I,

114
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.040
I don't know if the sadness,
I think it depends.

115
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:09.041
Like if you still accept that telling jokes for an hour a night for five nights

116
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.570
a week and paying your rent and eating and have a fun,

117
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.070
if you could still accept that that's a good thing in life,
then they're,

118
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:19.100
they're not sad.

119
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.410
<v 2>Well,
it certainly is.
It certainly always is.</v>

120
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.640
The sadness comes from more people not knowing how good they were.
Right,
right.

121
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:28.430
You know,
you want people to know when you hit that high level,

122
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.480
you want people to know.

123
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.680
I mean me swinging was the one that I can certainly say.

124
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.450
Although he was a murderer at the time it was so Boston centric that it was very

125
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:41.330
difficult for him to have that sort of impact.

126
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.000
<v 3>Cause he got the shots too.
Yeah.
He got these national</v>

127
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.090
<v 2>Bosure he did.
He got a few,
a few big spots he did like,</v>

128
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.180
you know one of those comic strip lives or something like that evening at the

129
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:54.340
Improv type thing.
He got quite a few.

130
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.470
They did some of the young comedian specials.

131
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.710
The Rodney Dangerfield was one of the fairly brothers movies right now.

132
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:03.190
All the fairly brothers.
Wow.
He's always a cop.

133
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:09.190
He's,
I've seen him crush like,
like it was like a perfect set.

134
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.460
Like,
like you can't get any better than that.
Yeah.
You just get different.

135
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.060
<v 3>Was riding laughs just waiting on them and as soon as they fade overhand right</v>

136
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.200
back into the lab

137
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.300
<v 2>and he had this not give a fuck,
look to him.
He had a big bald spot.</v>

138
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.100
I didn't give a fuck.
His hair was always fucked up.
He couldn't care less.
Right.

139
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.940
He was so like Blue Collar Boston,
that guy went on stage.

140
00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:32.650
You automatically accepted him.

141
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.180
He's the guy that you would just have a beer with.
He's a guy like a,

142
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.950
you might have Steve comes over and has a beer.
Yeah,
bring him over.
Hey Steve,

143
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:43.600
what's wrong Steve?
Hey,
how are you?
Sit down and just jovial and sucks.

144
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.040
You're right into his personality.

145
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.770
<v 3>Yeah,
but he could murder.</v>

146
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.660
Somebody was just telling me about him and Oh my God,
it's so funny.

147
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.280
He,
he has an agent in Boston.
I,
I don't know who the guy is,

148
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.180
is some new agents and somebody called and said they wanted to off from a

149
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.090
certain amount of money to do it.
Like you know,
up there,
it's a lot of like,

150
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:07.020
you know the,
the,
the elks lodge in Mattapoisett or you know,

151
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.190
these gigs that are like fire houses or whatever and they offered him a certain

152
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.830
amount of money and the agent goes,
I'm now,

153
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:18.450
right now Steve is commanding more money in the marketplace.

154
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.580
It's like commanding in the market,
but a Tuesday night.

155
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.940
What's the marketplace on a Tuesday night?
Exactly.

156
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.320
<v 0>I think there's no better place to at least start out than Boston because of</v>

157
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:33.890
that.
Because none of us,
there was no like you're going to make it.
All right.

158
00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:36.770
So making it making,
it was just being a professional comic,
right?

159
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.920
Just figuring out how to get to be a professional.
So in that sense,
yeah,

160
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:40.610
there's no,

161
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.610
I don't think there'd be any remorse where I'm sure people still packing in to

162
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:45.390
see guys like Gavin.
Right.

163
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.830
But the world should have known the world should have known.

164
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.900
I feel like it was France Almita capture a little bit and that,

165
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.840
that movie that he did.
Yeah,
he captured it a little.

166
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.580
<v 3>Well,
he captured what came before us,</v>

167
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.140
which was just before us when it was literally in the formative stages of like,

168
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:07.740
let's put a microphone in a room and have people talk to audience.

169
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.700
Crazy men do it right.
That's tough guys that don't give a fuck.

170
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.510
Go up and treat the audience like bitches and animals.

171
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.900
And they were animals and it was very testosterone driven.
And like you said,

172
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:22.620
there was a lot of drugs.
There's a lot of drinking.
And it really was like a,

173
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.800
a certain,
the recipe was your ability to write,

174
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.920
which you only need it for the first year cause then you lock it on that set for

175
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:33.600
the rest of your life and then the ability to perform and then balls.

176
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:37.860
Then it was like who onstage has the biggest balls because it was all about can

177
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:40.650
this guy follow me and trying to bury the guy after you.

178
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.450
<v 0>Yeah.
And we've talked about that on the set,</v>

179
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:45.570
but this was their number one flaw was that they didn't change their set.
Right.

180
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.960
They and they,
they were very Boston centric and they never changed her sets.

181
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.650
Right.
But the positive side of that was,
God damn,

182
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.550
they would get those jokes down to a Samurai sword,
sharpness.

183
00:10:56.551 --> 00:11:00.540
They would just hammer those jokes down until they were flawless.

184
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.680
Like Gavin,
the jokes weren't even jokes.
Like if you eat,

185
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.070
some of them you wrote down on paper,
you would go to Sam.

186
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.660
Why that's going to be funny.
Like no,

187
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:11.220
that's going to be the funniest thing you've seen all day.

188
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.960
So I'm just going to be funny.
Go Watch that.

189
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.910
<v 3>He just kinda like,
you know,
the way,
the way it comes over.
And he goes,
us,
uh,</v>

190
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.240
we'd like some wine.
And we said,
sure,
and he goes out red or white.
And I,

191
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.190
and I said,
why don't you surprise me?

192
00:11:24.191 --> 00:11:25.990
And he slapped me in the forehead with his balls.

193
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.320
And it does a lot of great joke out of his mouth.

194
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.970
You're fucking dying because the attitude,
you got to see it.
Right.
But you know,

195
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:38.200
and I think that what we learned from that was number one,
right?
Uh,

196
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.240
but number two,
while you're writing,

197
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:45.270
do that bit enough times where you do find a way to make it absolutely crush,

198
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.070
you know,
to like to do that doing the same joke again and again and again.

199
00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:55.720
There's no shame in that as long as it's getting better each time until you get

200
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:58.420
to the point where,
like with Gavin,
where it's just they're,

201
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.690
they're just boiled down perfect little pieces of comedy.

202
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.030
<v 2>That's the problem with like,
when you release a special to you go,</v>

203
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.700
God damn is this thing,
right?
I don't know if this is done yet.
Now,
you know,

204
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.930
there's that,
that weird feeling of remorse right after you do it.

205
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.820
And the worst is after we record a special,

206
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:17.660
and then like a month later you have the ultimate tag line that transforms the

207
00:12:17.661 --> 00:12:18.860
bit.
Okay.

208
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.670
<v 3>Yeah.
Or you realize that there's two sentences in the middle that we're doing</v>

209
00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:24.530
nothing.
And you and you just,

210
00:12:24.531 --> 00:12:27.170
because sometimes they drop a bit and then when I bring it back,

211
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.670
it's a great thing because you forget the shit that was Anessa.

212
00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:34.820
You only remember the good elements all of a sudden it's a stronger Joe.

213
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.610
<v 2>Yeah.
That's good though.
That's a good way of looking at it.</v>

214
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:40.390
Like sometimes walk away from it and come back to it.
Yeah.

215
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.150
You gotta be willing to take that fucking initial step,
like it's triple.

216
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.140
It was really funny.
Um,
Wednesday night we did a show at the ice house,
right.

217
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.090
Tripoli went up,
killed it.

218
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.050
But he had a couple of new jokes that it was trying to like for the first time.

219
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.440
And it was just laughing about how going on stage with a new jugs like Bambi

220
00:12:57.441 --> 00:13:01.460
legs,
like you know,
and he's like,
don't worry,
I'm going to work these legs out.

221
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.730
But that's really what it feels like.
Yeah,
we do like,
man,

222
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.170
it's seems pretty funny when I'm going over it in front of my computer,
but fuck,

223
00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:10.390
who knows what's,

224
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.130
<v 3>it's amazing because sometimes something hits you and try it on stage and it's</v>

225
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:17.830
actually more comedy than you thought it would be.

226
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:23.020
Then there's times where like I sit down with a pad and I jot shit ideas and

227
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.740
then at the end of it you go like,
wow,
I thought I had like a rant.

228
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.240
I have maybe a one liner out of all that and it's like,
and you don't know,

229
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:35.350
and it's not necessarily that the crowd is telling you it's good or not.

230
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.090
You don't know until you're actually putting it out.
If,
if,

231
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.820
if it feels stand up be or if it was just something that was probably good on

232
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.400
paper.

233
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.410
<v 2>Yeah.
The,
the,</v>

234
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.380
the form of communication that you have with an audience when you're onstage is

235
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:51.450
impossible to replicate outside of that environment.
It's,

236
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.800
you could try to imagine it in your head where you're alone in front of a

237
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:55.221
computer,

238
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:59.550
but your mindset is so ultimately different than it is when you're doing standup

239
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.410
that even when you win the business 25 years,
it's like we have,

240
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.310
it's fucking guesswork,
right?
You're just taking wild guesses.

241
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.300
<v 3>No,
you're,
the car is idling when you're writing the cars idling you,
you haven't,</v>

242
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.430
you haven't fucking pushed on the gas yet.

243
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.190
<v 2>That's why it's so important to do both.</v>

244
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.480
It's so important to do both and the both mean you gotta do the actual sit down

245
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:22.050
writing part two.
There's a lot of guys like to skimp on that.
I'm like,
look,

246
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:25.410
I know that you write a lot on stage.
I know you're right a lot during the day.

247
00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:25.741
I know,

248
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:30.741
but I guarantee you if you sat down for x amount of times per week and dedicated

249
00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:34.620
yourself,
just write,
just sit in front of computer,
write a blog,
write something.

250
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.180
Right.
I a

251
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.590
<v 3>towel man.
To this day,
that fucking guy,
I'll drop in and see him.</v>

252
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.630
And not only is it all new shit,

253
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:46.580
it's shit from the news from the last three days that he clearly sat down and

254
00:14:46.581 --> 00:14:48.770
wrote,
this isn't like extemporaneous.
Yeah.

255
00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:53.060
Tell doesn't go up and just riff.
He has written that shit

256
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.670
<v 0>down.
Yeah.
And it's,
no,
no doubt.
Yeah.
He doesn't riff very,</v>

257
00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.340
I mean he'll deal with something in the crowd or something.
He'll do crowd work,

258
00:14:59.341 --> 00:15:02.160
but when it comes to material,
he's like beaded it out.
Yeah.

259
00:15:02.161 --> 00:15:06.690
He's got a very unique style.
You know,
he's a,
he's a like a tenacious worker.

260
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.310
I did his showtime show,

261
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.780
which was this ever a show that you would slack off if you are the host,
right.

262
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.000
It's Dave's old porn,
right,
where you sit in front of porn,
you know,

263
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.400
porn tapes from like the 1980s and you do like the mystery science theater thing

264
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.960
to them.
But dude,
he's gotten like,
no tonight Duis and about what worked,

265
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.310
what didn't work and what we should do and what we shouldn't do.

266
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.660
Maybe we should try this and like,

267
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.660
like know enough to know enough to know and he's fucking chain smoking and going

268
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.720
over these notes and sitting down with the are and they're having meetings and

269
00:15:33.721 --> 00:15:34.270
shit.
I'm like,

270
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.870
<v 3>well,
and then he edited it for ever,</v>

271
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:42.280
he actually went into his own pocket like a hundred thousand dollars beyond what

272
00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:44.660
they were paying him to edit it.
Whoa.

273
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.600
And then he put together like bonus tracks for a DVD he was going to release,

274
00:15:49.601 --> 00:15:54.250
cause he got ownership of the shell and I swear to God he was still editing it

275
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.450
that until very recently.
So he's gonna release the DVD.
Yeah.

276
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.630
But now he's even further than the hall.
It'll work.
It'll work out.

277
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.670
It's a great show.

278
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.650
<v 0>He's not getting enough credit right now.
You know,</v>

279
00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:08.450
it tells not getting the credit he deserves right now.
Right here in that like,

280
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.160
you know,
you go to sema clubs and like just half field audiences.
I'm like,

281
00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:13.580
that's ridiculous.
Like

282
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.700
<v 3>he's got a new show coming out on Kai.
Just spoke to them a couple of days ago.</v>

283
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.680
He's hosting a s like a standup show.
Yeah.
Standup shuts,

284
00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:24.810
there'll be three or four comics per,
I don't know if on their power forward.

285
00:16:24.811 --> 00:16:27.970
Shapiro.
Yeah.
So I think he's doing that next week actually.

286
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.680
<v 0>Yeah.
He's awesome man.
Yeah.
He's his,
his uh,
skanks for the memories,
right?</v>

287
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.590
One of my all time favorite.

288
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.810
<v 3>Oh God.
Yeah.
All time favorites.
So I'm fucking this girl doggy style.</v>

289
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.480
I didn't plan it that,
but that plan it that way.

290
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.850
But that's how she passed out anyway.

291
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:47.050
A couple of mcnuggets later and then it just keeps,
you know,

292
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:50.770
that joke today would get like,
you know,
that would be a part of rape culture,

293
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.550
right?
He'd be on the cover of Salon.

294
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.680
David tell supports rape culture.

295
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.570
Did you see what the writer from the variety set about?
Sarah Silverman?
What did,

296
00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:05.410
she was too dirty and she was trying to be one of the guys and her career would

297
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:09.490
be further along if she didn't,
if she worked,
didn't work.
So blue.

298
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.650
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.
Leigh dumb.

299
00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:15.500
She's the biggest female standup comic in the world.
Where would be further,

300
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.340
well cause TV reviewers feel like,
you know what,

301
00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:21.820
we don't all have the agenda of being billionaires that play theaters.

302
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.360
A lot of us are pretty fucking happy where we are.

303
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:28.660
It's like what I was just saying about the Boston comedians don't put on them

304
00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:30.310
that they wanted to be international stars.

305
00:17:30.311 --> 00:17:35.311
Like Sarah Silverman does the same kind of material she would do no matter what

306
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:39.280
the venue,
she works as much as she wants.
She's considered cool.

307
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:43.180
So she gets roles in movies and TV and she,
I don't know,

308
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.070
she seems to be having a fucking great time

309
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.190
<v 0>having a great time when she's fucking hilarious.
She's really good.</v>

310
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.190
Like anyone who says it's an Asshole,
right?

311
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.053
<v 2>Like look,</v>

312
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.420
there's things that people like and there's things that people don't like.

313
00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:57.780
Like you could take me to see a certain type of music that you really enjoy and

314
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:01.470
I don't get it.
It doesn't mean that it's bad,
it means it's not for me.

315
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.360
But when you break down something that's obviously very successful and very well

316
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:09.060
loved,
like you're missing the point.
The point,

317
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:12.300
the reason why it's funny is because she is dirty because she has dirty,

318
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.510
it gets how her fucking mind works right from mine.
Didn't work like that.

319
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:18.060
The jokes wouldn't be funny,
right?
Like it might not be your thing.

320
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:19.830
You might be easily offended.
Whatever the fuck it is.

321
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:22.590
You might have a crab up your ass when you want to write this thing down.

322
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:26.790
You might have decided to take a,
you know,
a particular snotty approach,
but,

323
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:27.531
<v 3>well,</v>

324
00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:31.700
there's a few moving parts when it comes to trying to objectify if something is

325
00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:36.410
good or bad in the arts.
And one is,
is the person,
like you said,

326
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.390
if you're genuinely dirty and you're being dirty,
then it works.

327
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.470
If you're trying to be edgy because you see that that's where the comics do that

328
00:18:45.471 --> 00:18:49.820
doesn't work.
So to me it's about like,
what's your authentic voice?

329
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.470
And number two,
just because somebody is highly commercially successful,

330
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.650
like doesn't mean what they're doing is bad.

331
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.990
That means that it happens to be in sync with what a lot of people like.
Right?

332
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.320
You know,
like,
uh,
I think that uh,
like Aziz Ansari,

333
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.560
he's successful because he literally did focus groups with people to decide

334
00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:16.540
which of his material would work best with 18 to 35 year old.

335
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.420
Like that's the opposite of what good is.

336
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.310
<v 2>Are you sure he did that?</v>

337
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.260
<v 3>I read about it in,
if it was a fucking piece in,</v>

338
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.650
I might've been the New York Times.

339
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.440
<v 2>You sure he wasn't fucking around.
That might be something.</v>

340
00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:35.240
And it was a marketing major in college.
Wow.

341
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.760
That's something that I would say if I was fucking around like,

342
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.550
because it's so the,
I still can't get over whatever do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

343
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.920
Well you know what I did,
I hired a bunch of people to go out and survey people.

344
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.630
This is my point on surveys is always been you never get a good answer with a

345
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:53.930
survey because you only get the answer for people dumb enough to answer the

346
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:54.770
survey.
Correct.

347
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.160
Most people like you or I are not going to answer God damn survey on how old the

348
00:19:58.161 --> 00:20:00.260
world is.
Right.
So when you read the Gallup poll,

349
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:03.440
the recent one that said that some insane number of people,

350
00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:07.880
like 46% of the United States believes in the biblical version of the creation

351
00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:12.000
of earth,
right?
I mean,
I think it's 6,000 years,
Austin 10 that's the,
the the,

352
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:16.790
the fucking standard.
That's 46% of the Co.
But it's not,
it's not,

353
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.600
that's not true.
It's 46% of people dumb enough to answer your fucking survey.

354
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.570
It's not 46 yet.
It's not,
I don't buy it.

355
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:27.560
No more than 46% of the people know that.

356
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.050
Whether or not you believe in the Bible,
a biblical God,

357
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.100
more than 46% know that the Bible,
first of all,
it's been translated many,

358
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:37.580
many times and leave room for error.
And second of all,

359
00:20:37.581 --> 00:20:39.560
they understand the work of science.
You know,

360
00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:42.890
just because you believe in some higher power to make you feel better,

361
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:45.560
what have you,
it doesn't mean you reject everything.

362
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.210
<v 3>I think the number,
I don't know if it's as high as 46%,</v>

363
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:53.920
but does it according to these poles that people that believe that humans and

364
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:58.670
dinosaurs existed at the same time is inexplicably.
Hi.

365
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.260
<v 2>Do you know that that was Sarah Palin?</v>

366
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:05.600
She said that Sarah Pailin had a conversation with a librarian and was Cilla

367
00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:10.100
Alaska.
Well,
she said that on the Internet there was a photograph of,

368
00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:13.820
of human footprint inside of dinosaur footprint.
And the woman,

369
00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:16.910
like the woman like talked about this and Sarah Palin was running for president

370
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.240
or vice president,
whatever.
And she was like,
what?

371
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.440
Pause the pause.
Fuck.

372
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.410
Like this is a woman that got beat away from being the president.
And she,

373
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.690
wow.
She thought that dinosaurs and humans walked together.

374
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.430
And then you see people who are intelligent.
Yeah.
We'll get that pill that down.

375
00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:41.100
Brian claim dinosaurs of people coexist.
Amazing.

376
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.830
Cause it say they're about the librarian.

377
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.030
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,</v>

378
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.380
<v 2>yeah.
Whatever.</v>

379
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.620
<v 3>Well,
and I think that,
um,
uh,
what's the other one?
I'm not Sarah Palin.</v>

380
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.250
<v 2>Michele Bachman.
Michele Bachmann's worse.
Well,
her husband's gay,
right.</v>

381
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.840
Is Gay as gay,
as gay,

382
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.460
as gay as the day is beautiful and long and flower smell pretty and butterflies

383
00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:07.850
are beautiful.
That guy's gay.
I let you like,
he can't suck enough dick.

384
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.790
There's no way.
If you could just just give him a free pass.

385
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.700
If you ever got that guy liquored up and put a heart on in front of him,

386
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.210
he would jump on it like Greg Louganis off the top here,

387
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.290
Swan dive on that.

388
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.890
<v 3>His head would be spinning out of a gainer and he'd still gets some tongue on</v>

389
00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:25.320
the shaft.

390
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.920
<v 2>He would automatically start salivating to the point where it was like a</v>

391
00:22:28.921 --> 00:22:33.570
waterfall coming out of his mouth,
pouring down his shirt,

392
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.700
just so alive,
a long string.

393
00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:41.040
You wouldn't know where the pool started and the saliva for Dick stocks coming

394
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:45.330
out of his mouth.
It would literally be like a saliva waterfall and like when,

395
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.900
when not when people have a backyard and they have those really like,

396
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:54.060
like fancy little rock formations where the water comes down into their pool.

397
00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:56.160
If you're really fancy schmancy,
that was his mouth.

398
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.850
<v 3>Yeah.
If he,
he would say to a young man,
do you want to go in the hot tub with me?</v>

399
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.310
And the guy would go,
okay,
they'd get in the hot tub and the guy would go,

400
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.130
there's no water in here.
And he'd go,
just wait,

401
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.840
let me see your cock.

402
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.780
<v 2>That warm and Gooey,
it's comes out 96 degrees.</v>

403
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.610
<v 3>I'd let them blow me if I knew that I could take down Michelle Bachmann</v>

404
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.660
particular down from what though?
I just because she will be an elected leader.

405
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:25.580
Joe,
do you really feel that?
I know.
So look,

406
00:23:25.581 --> 00:23:30.460
you just have to see who fox news is trotting out and she is one of the first

407
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:32.740
pundits they go to for comments on shit.

408
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.030
She is introducing legislation in Congress right now that is actually being

409
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:40.480
enacted.
So what's the stopper?
Me,

410
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.020
I will suck her husband's deck and release it on the,
on the Internet.

411
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.040
I'll take the hit.
All

412
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.350
<v 2>we need to do is get them on some ecstasy,
right?</v>

413
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.660
Just get them to realize the folly of his ways.

414
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.160
It's like these people that are like that.

415
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:55.580
I guarantee you if you got them on some ecstasy and gave him a hug and go

416
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:59.960
fucking don't worry about it man.
Don't worry about it.
I know who you are.

417
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.970
Just let it go be.
You don't,
don't be gobble,
gobble,

418
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:07.970
gobble,
just grabbing them and stuffing them in.

419
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:11.420
This Steph it in party up.
Dude,
you're already like 60.

420
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.760
He's probably actually probably having a lot of gay sex.

421
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.020
<v 3>Oh,
there's no doubt he's having a lot of gay sex.</v>

422
00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:18.060
And I think it's similar with a lot of celebrities.

423
00:24:18.061 --> 00:24:22.410
I don't want to mention names like say Oprah,
like her husband,
I believe.

424
00:24:22.411 --> 00:24:26.520
How dare you?
I believe,
um,
I eights I've heard rumors.

425
00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:28.380
He always have to substantiate things like that.

426
00:24:28.381 --> 00:24:30.720
I've heard rumors that he looks extremely gay.
To me.

427
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.400
<v 2>I would say those rumors automatically.
Um,</v>

428
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.460
if I knew that there was a woman out there or a man out there,

429
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:41.810
brother whose girlfriend makes $100 billion,
I would say that guy's gay.

430
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.400
Right?
Fucking right out of the gate.
Yeah,

431
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.340
<v 3>because you're,</v>

432
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.000
you're dick would get so small from being around that much money every day and

433
00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:49.834
it's not yours.

434
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.310
<v 2>She is so dominant over him and what does that guy do is you make a hundred</v>

435
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.140
grand a year.
I mean,
who knows what the fuck he does.

436
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.190
<v 3>I think he goes out and does well,
here's,</v>

437
00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.350
here's the cash in for doing nothing is the,

438
00:24:59.351 --> 00:25:04.351
he does speeches like they pay him to come in and do motivational speeches.

439
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.390
<v 2>My God.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.
Motivational speeches.</v>

440
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.620
Yeah,
whatever.

441
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.730
This is how you find a really which powerful woman and just connect to her.

442
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.560
That's it.
That's the course.
That's the course.
Look,
who knows?

443
00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:22.570
Maybe the guys are really brilliant,
intelligent guy.

444
00:25:22.571 --> 00:25:24.820
Maybe doesn't give a fuck about money.
Maybe it's just enlightened.

445
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.620
<v 3>No,
it's true.
Actually.
I know dudes that are like that,</v>

446
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:31.520
that are with really strong women and they are totally cool with it.
They,

447
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.500
they find them and you know,
and chanting and humorous and they go for the ride.

448
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.830
That's fine.
I guess for us we're kind of Alpha males,

449
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.310
so I think it would be difficult for us to picture being in the back seat

450
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.450
<v 2>maybe and maybe not.
I think there's,</v>

451
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.060
it's really hard when you say that this would work or that would work

452
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:54.560
generalizing because there's people in my life that on paper I shouldn't like

453
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.020
hmm.
And I fucking love them.
You know what I mean?

454
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.100
This is relationships that I've had with people that despite all the craziness,

455
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.220
I enjoyed the fuck out of my time with them and you know,

456
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:06.230
and sometimes in a more intense way,

457
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.810
like even though it wasn't like it wasn't anything that had legs like took,

458
00:26:09.811 --> 00:26:10.641
it actually lasts like,

459
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:14.390
cause after a while you have real relationships where you could actually go on

460
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:15.610
vacation with someone.
Right.

461
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.500
Do you remember when you first started going vacation with girlfriends and like

462
00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:21.710
three or four days,
then you're like,
oh my God,

463
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:24.910
I need to jump out of a fucking window now.
Oh,

464
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.790
I had a girl that I faked a phone call.
My friend called me up.

465
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:30.830
I faked an obligation to get rid of her.

466
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.780
She came to stay with me for the weekend,
just for the weekend and two days in,

467
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:39.800
she was complaining about everything to the point where it was like there was no

468
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:44.310
fun to be had.
Everything was just a complaint,
complaining about the music,

469
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.170
complaining about where we're going to go to eat,

470
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.190
complaining about every fucking thing.
And it was,
I was panicking.

471
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:54.780
My friend called me up and,
and I,
and I go,
hey,
what's up man?
And I go,
oh dude,

472
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:59.190
I forgot shit.
Fuck,
I got to come get you all.
My God,
I'm so sorry.
Well,

473
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.370
this is my friend Johnny who's quite a slick character.
It was like,
oh,

474
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:05.220
I can't hit what's going on,
what's going on?
Are you doing over there?
And I go,

475
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.200
Bethany's here.
Shit.
Is that her name?
Damn.
A nice person.

476
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.490
But it was the wrong time for both of us were,
look,

477
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:17.620
I was a fucking pain in the ass then too,
right?
That was part of the problem.

478
00:27:17.621 --> 00:27:18.650
It's like I will fucking,

479
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.620
<v 3>that's it too.
I think that when you're a young man,</v>

480
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.830
I think it'd be hard for you to travel with anybody but other young men,

481
00:27:24.831 --> 00:27:28.310
you're just,
you a fucking explore.
You want to really go nuts.

482
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.230
<v 2>Yeah.
Not only that,
you're dumb.
Yeah.
I was 20,
I was 24,</v>

483
00:27:32.231 --> 00:27:35.460
I think it was maybe 23 at the time.
I was so stupid.
Yeah.

484
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.000
I mean it was so stupid and crazy and it was doing like two years removed from

485
00:27:40.001 --> 00:27:44.530
fighting.
So my brain was hardwired the wrong way.

486
00:27:44.531 --> 00:27:47.140
Like I had to rewire my brain was,

487
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.520
was wired for violent competition and then breaks in between that.

488
00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:55.410
Like that was my whole life.
So going from that to like the,

489
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:59.680
the like being around girls and relationships and trying to manage those waters

490
00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:04.270
was very confusing for me because I fighting was such like a solitary pursuit.

491
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.133
Right.

492
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.000
<v 3>I had a,
I used to keep journals,
uh,</v>

493
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.340
up until probably when I was like 23 or something,

494
00:28:10.341 --> 00:28:14.720
but I was dating this girl and we went to Europe together.
Uh,

495
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.840
it was like after Sophomore Year of college that summer she had,

496
00:28:17.841 --> 00:28:21.320
she had studied abroad in,
in Austria for the second semester.

497
00:28:21.321 --> 00:28:25.400
So I saved us some cash and I flew over there and we met in London and we went

498
00:28:25.401 --> 00:28:30.401
to Ireland and we went to France and I was fucking miserable and I was keeping a

499
00:28:31.371 --> 00:28:33.830
journal and I look back at it now and it wasn't her,

500
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.180
it was just that like I just wanted to do my own fucking thing.

501
00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:42.380
I wasn't into negotiating and compromising because at that age you feel like

502
00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:45.380
life is so short,
you don't want to waste a day.

503
00:28:45.381 --> 00:28:48.050
You just feel like whatever the most exciting thing is,

504
00:28:48.051 --> 00:28:49.280
that's what you want to be doing.

505
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.150
And that's often not what comes out in the copper.

506
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.470
<v 2>This definitely that.
But this is also,
I was just selfish.
Yeah.</v>

507
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.850
I didn't want to do what anybody else.
No,
I think that's what we're both saying.

508
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.990
I mean,
but it wasn't even that I was thinking,
Hey,
life is short.

509
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.250
It wasn't a romantic,
it was like totally egotistical.
You know?

510
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.420
Like if you look back,

511
00:29:08.421 --> 00:29:12.080
like if you had to go back in time and be yourself when you were 23 or 22 years

512
00:29:12.081 --> 00:29:16.040
old,
like what a fucking mess that would be.
Like you'd be like,
ah,

513
00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:18.100
what do I have to deal with?
Yeah.
You know,

514
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.450
you would like look at the relationships that you'd try to manage,

515
00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:24.500
like what the fuck mess you created and that you're just such a different human

516
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:29.270
now than you were then.
You spend so much energy on relationships back then.

517
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.170
But I'll tell you man,
having like a relationship,
like a special,

518
00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:38.171
like when you were 16 the amount emotionally I grew from like 16 to like 18

519
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.270
which was during the term that I had this girl as a girlfriend,

520
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.710
but she was a very nice person too.
She was the,

521
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.590
she was not in a mean or nasty in any way,
which was really nice as well.

522
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.490
Like I dated some girls after that were,

523
00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:56.050
they were mean and nasty and when it will first time a girl in salt you,

524
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.460
it's like,
it's a weird thing,
you know?
Because like this,

525
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.180
my first girlfriend never would do that.

526
00:30:01.181 --> 00:30:04.660
She was very smart as well and like we would have conversations,

527
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:07.660
they were interesting conversations,
but there was no manipulation.

528
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:08.494
There's no weirdness.

529
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.920
And then I dated this girl about a year later that was the opposite.

530
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.110
She was very nice.

531
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:17.110
She was very pretty unfortunately for her because it gave her this fucking,

532
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.490
this ability to constantly have men around her constantly have people hitting on

533
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:24.910
her.
But she knew how to fuck with you and like you would see it happen.

534
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:26.860
She would say something like he was,
he knows always that crooked.

535
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.913
<v 5>Mm.</v>

536
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.840
<v 2>And I was just going like,
what?</v>

537
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.360
Like I don't know why.
And then I remember thinking,
what the fuck was that like,

538
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.200
Ooh,
what's going on here?
Yeah.
She would say shit like that.
Like all the time,

539
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.043
you know?

540
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.300
<v 3>Yeah.
Weird Shit.
And that's where you see bad marriages is when,</v>

541
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.780
when either person in salts,
the other one,
it's like,
unless it's,

542
00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:50.740
you really get that,

543
00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:53.570
that's their stick and they fuck around and bust each other's balls.
Right.

544
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.180
But when you see the guy get a little bit,
you know,
damaged by it,

545
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.760
you just think God,
ah girl,

546
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.080
<v 2>the girl getting damaged out of it,</v>

547
00:31:03.081 --> 00:31:07.640
he has even more like tension because there's a physical violence worry,

548
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.120
you know,
obviously you know women do violence on men.

549
00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:14.030
I mean I lost a very good friend and Phil Hartman for that very thing.

550
00:31:14.031 --> 00:31:16.080
His wife shot him while he was in his sleep.

551
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:21.440
That was a horrible relationship and that was a relationship where his ex wife

552
00:31:21.441 --> 00:31:26.390
used to do subtle shit to insult him in front of large groups of people.

553
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.740
Like she would chew chip him down because she was a failed actress and you know,

554
00:31:30.741 --> 00:31:32.720
Phil was a superstar.
It's coming up Saturday night live.

555
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.480
It was constantly a movies and you know,

556
00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.490
he was just a will like a deeply loved guy.
And so she would take,

557
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.240
he would take her to parties and she would take that opportunity to insult him

558
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.750
in front of people,
like in real subtle ways like acuity.

559
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.040
We're talking about cars because Phil was like a car nut and he bought a Ferrari

560
00:31:52.041 --> 00:31:53.990
and he was so happy he bought this car.

561
00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:57.140
Like he saved up his money and he's like a big deal for him.
He saved,

562
00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.200
there was money made from a couple of movies and he always wanted one of these

563
00:32:00.201 --> 00:32:03.980
things and the way he would talk about it,
like he was a very interesting guy,

564
00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.270
very,
very smart,
smoked weed and it would get like real crazy about shit,

565
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:12.050
like really into things and have these wild conversations and like kid who's a

566
00:32:12.051 --> 00:32:15.290
really,
like he loved things.
He loved becoming a pilot.

567
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.200
Like he became a pilot while we were doing news radio.

568
00:32:18.201 --> 00:32:21.770
And I remember seeing them sitting there like studying due to flee all these

569
00:32:21.771 --> 00:32:24.850
aviation books.
I'm way to add for that,
right?

570
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.790
This guy would study and like his lines,
like when we had a scene,

571
00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:31.550
he would study his lines over and over and over and over.

572
00:32:31.551 --> 00:32:34.490
And he was sitting like a consummate professional.
And this guy.

573
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.320
So when he was talking about this Ferrari,

574
00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:40.220
it was about the Italian engineering and the shape of it and the sound

575
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.900
<v 0>of the engine.
The whole experience was everything he had just,
and so she goes,</v>

576
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.710
I like trucks.
You know,
my ex boyfriend had a truck,

577
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.930
my boyfriend's back home had trucks.

578
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.980
And so what is he thinking when he,
what do I hear?

579
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:59.981
What I hear is she's talking about these dudes who are probably truck I pictured

580
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:02.960
truck,
I've pictured brutish men,
right.

581
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.620
Gorilla fucking her in the back of this truck.
Just throwing some hay down,

582
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:10.320
ripping her pants off and just fucking send them.
And he's not alone.
Of course,

583
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.450
this isn't fucking,
there's a line of dude ropes,
fucking stirrups on and shit.

584
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.180
But she would say that kind of shit.
Yeah.
You know,

585
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.000
she would always make jokes about him being old or you know,

586
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.020
various jokes about whatever.
You know,
she was trying to chip them down about,

587
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:27.650
but I'll never forget that.
You know,
I like trucks.

588
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.960
All my ex boyfriend's back home had trucks.

589
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.770
<v 3>Yeah.
That's just a gross thing to say.
Yeah.
And you get that from your parents.</v>

590
00:33:34.771 --> 00:33:37.920
I mean,
they model it for you.
How you're going to treat your spouse is like,

591
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.720
I see it every fucking time.

592
00:33:39.721 --> 00:33:43.080
I was hanging out with a friend a couple of nights ago and the parents were

593
00:33:43.081 --> 00:33:44.730
around his,
uh,

594
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.140
his inlaws were around and I could see the way they treat each other.
I was like,

595
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.000
Oh yeah,
that's your marriage.
That's how your wife,

596
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.860
<v 0>Oh,
it's so true.</v>

597
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.980
<v 3>So my parents,
like,
they really respected each other.
Like they never,</v>

598
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.320
they never did that.
They kicked it around a lot,

599
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:03.230
but it was so obviously fun what they were doing.

600
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.860
And they really respected each other.
They never took shots in public.

601
00:34:06.861 --> 00:34:07.580
And when they had,

602
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:11.270
if they had to have a serious discussion and it wasn't yelling,

603
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.330
they would wait until we went to bed.
They go on the other side of the house,

604
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:17.150
close the door,
and we heard muffled,
you know?

605
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.480
Whereas like some people just Sir fucking argument in front of their kids,

606
00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:22.900
it's like,
well,
that's what your kids are going to do when they grow up.
Yeah.

607
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.410
<v 0>Yeah.
That's super important,
man.</v>

608
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.930
It's super important to to show them the model of what's possible and if you're

609
00:34:30.931 --> 00:34:34.230
in a bad relationship,
it's just as equally important to get out.
Right.

610
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.990
One of the really important things my mother taught me when I was a little kid

611
00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:40.410
is it getting out of a relationship.
When we were five,

612
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.560
she moved to sing with my grandmother and then we got an apartment.

613
00:34:43.561 --> 00:34:47.250
We moved out of my dad's place because her and my dad were involved in this a

614
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:50.820
abusive relationship.
So I remember thinking that like,
wow,

615
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.270
like my mom was smart.
She does the right thing when shit goes wrong,

616
00:34:54.271 --> 00:34:57.900
she doesn't just take it,
she has options out.
She figures a way out of it.

617
00:34:57.901 --> 00:35:01.860
Even with two kids,
you know?
So it took a lot of courage to do,

618
00:35:01.861 --> 00:35:05.460
I was going to say balls,
but that's ridiculous.
So you know,
it takes,

619
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.930
it takes like a real sense of action in doing,

620
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.460
<v 3>right.
Yeah.
I think I,
I,
I think that people always say like,</v>

621
00:35:12.461 --> 00:35:15.580
one thing I've noticed about happy people in life is they all do this.

622
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.230
But I have seen a trend with people that are happier in life and more confident

623
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.880
use their options.

624
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:25.690
They don't ever feel painted into a corner and like they have to stick with this

625
00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:29.080
job.
They go like,
no,
you know what?
I'll go get a degree.
I want to do this.

626
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.990
And they don't see the obstacles as big as people that are unhappy too.
Well,

627
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.990
<v 0>as long as you're willing to appreciate the fact that all the energy you put</v>

628
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.100
something might

629
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.260
<v 2>not immediately translate into this new thing.</v>

630
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.050
Like there's a lot of people that are not willing to accept a dip.

631
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.960
Like that was another thing learned,
learned when,
um,

632
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.000
my mom and my Stepdad got together,
my,

633
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:52.590
my stepdad was a computer programmer and a had a really good job computer

634
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:55.110
programming,
but didn't want to do it anymore.
I wanted to become an architect.

635
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.110
So it took a chance,
went back to school,

636
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.680
then became an architect and became successful at that.
So I got to watch that.

637
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:05.220
Like this isn't what I like to do.
Let's do something else.
And he was happy.

638
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.330
He was happy.
So I get to see those two different,
well one was artistic,
you know,

639
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.510
the computer program I think I guess could be artistic as well,
but he won.

640
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.990
It's more a visual artistic thing,
like wanted to design bill.

641
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.280
<v 3>I think in computer programming.
Back then it was probably a lot less artistic.</v>

642
00:36:20.281 --> 00:36:22.080
It was probably a lot more just,
you know,

643
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:27.110
coding just 10 go to 10 go to 20 like all that fucking numerical.

644
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.400
But I think that,
you know,

645
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:33.930
to see him be happy really is the payoff because that's what you're looking at.

646
00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:34.411
You're looking at,

647
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:38.580
oh he's happy he did this and you work backwards from that and it encourages
you.

648
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.610
Whereas like get my dad,
this is what he did.
He was on the radio.

649
00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:46.260
He took big fucking shit.
I saw my dad not work for three years,
three years,

650
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.770
and we still,
we didn't get thrown out of our house.
He made it work.

651
00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:54.460
<v 2>Why wasn't that a situation where your dad had gotten out of favor with some</v>

652
00:36:54.461 --> 00:36:56.680
people in Boston?
Like politically strong?
Yeah,

653
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.800
<v 3>no,
no.
This is in New York.
In New York.
Yeah.</v>

654
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:01.410
He was a big radio guy in New York and it was just like,
you know,

655
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:06.411
program managers change the station director's whatever and they want to bring

656
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:11.580
in new people and so he got knocked out and it was just a shrinking market am he

657
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:14.340
was on am radio and it has started to shrink.

658
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.440
<v 2>Was there a situation where he had gotten into it with some politician or</v>

659
00:37:17.441 --> 00:37:19.700
something?
When my imagining this sink

660
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.810
<v 3>stern,
stern used to shit on my dad.
Really?
Yeah.
When my,</v>

661
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.040
when stern was coming up,

662
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:30.040
my dad was like one of the top Djs in New York my whole life.

663
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.940
And so a stern was coming up and my dad used to also host the Jerry Lewis

664
00:37:33.941 --> 00:37:35.710
Telethon.
He was the New York host for it.
You know,

665
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:39.070
every city has its own and he used to shit on my dad saying he must be a husband

666
00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:43.060
because he's hosting a telethon and he,
but he wouldn't let it go.
Like he just,

667
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.070
he went after guys like gene clave and Ims,

668
00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:50.830
all the guys that were big at the time and that was his emo and that then put

669
00:37:50.831 --> 00:37:53.950
him in that category and then he's surpassed them all.

670
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.210
So my dad,
I don't think it hurt my dad,

671
00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.690
although he didn't like stern and my mother hated stern,

672
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.700
but then later he,

673
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.250
my dad died and then stern made a big eulogy about my dad on the air.

674
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.060
Talked about how much he respected him,

675
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.720
how he was like the most well liked guy and the radio and how much you learned

676
00:38:13.721 --> 00:38:16.690
from him.
And so I buried the hatchet.
I was like,
all right.
He was doing,

677
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.240
because my dad always got what he was doing too.
He's like,
yeah,

678
00:38:19.241 --> 00:38:22.330
I don't like the guy,
but you know,
good chess move.

679
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.060
Got Him where he was gone and so,
you know,

680
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.080
it was fucking,
it was weird.

681
00:38:29.081 --> 00:38:33.310
My mom is so upset that I go on stern now still.
Oh yeah.
Irish people.

682
00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.590
<v 2>Correct.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's fascinating man.</v>

683
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.500
Yeah.
So you do,

684
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.200
did you have showbiz aspirations because your dad was in radio and you saw that

685
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:47.860
business,
you got to see him prosper and be a big time Dj.

686
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.070
<v 3>Did you,
I don't think the DJ part appeal to me,</v>

687
00:38:50.071 --> 00:38:53.520
but he used to host a lot of charity events and you know,

688
00:38:53.521 --> 00:38:57.210
standup comedy didn't exist then like it did now.
So for him,

689
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.320
I think he would have been a comedian and his day because the,

690
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.390
his favorite thing in the world was to go get up in front of,
you know,

691
00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:07.470
all hallows where he went to high school and raise money by Boston,
you know,

692
00:39:07.471 --> 00:39:11.040
shitting on the priests and they'd laugh and he would make fun of this guy in

693
00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:15.630
the crowd.
And he had his stories.
He had his like classic 10 stories he tell.

694
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.860
And it was just like stand up.

695
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.240
That's the thing that I got excited about it and I saw his happiness when he did

696
00:39:21.241 --> 00:39:21.780
it.

697
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.840
And I got obsessed with standup and I used to collect comedy albums and I used

698
00:39:24.841 --> 00:39:29.160
to get up like my daughter just last night on thanksgiving.
She,
uh,

699
00:39:29.161 --> 00:39:33.090
we had a few other girls over the house and my daughter got them all together

700
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:33.630
and uh,

701
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.840
they rehearsed for like an hour and a half and they put this show together and

702
00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.490
it was like acrobatics and shit.

703
00:39:38.491 --> 00:39:43.110
But my daughter and seed it and she did the big welcome to the Thanksgiving show

704
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:47.850
and it was like so funny.
It was like,
that was me at 10 give me a microphone,

705
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.770
let me MC.
And I was doing that shit and that's,
that's,
I never thought,

706
00:39:52.771 --> 00:39:55.800
like you said before,
like I didn't think about show business.

707
00:39:55.801 --> 00:39:58.290
I didn't think about entertain.
I just thought about stand out.

708
00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:01.800
I want to stand up there and do that.
That energy,
that's it.

709
00:40:01.801 --> 00:40:03.090
And it just led where it led.

710
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.910
<v 2>It's kind of funny in all the time that's passed that now.</v>

711
00:40:07.911 --> 00:40:12.911
Probably the thing that people know you for from the most is being on stern and

712
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.830
doing a podcast and doing other people's podcasts.
Right.

713
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.380
And doing your own radio show on Sirius on the stern show because it's all gone

714
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:23.810
like three one 80,
right.
Bally business,

715
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:27.890
I mean three 16 fact back to you what your dad did,
right.
That's like,

716
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.760
you mean you are known as being a hilarious podcast,

717
00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:34.490
which is essentially the same as the broadcaster.
It's the same thing.

718
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.900
<v 3>Yeah.
And I didn't want to go into,</v>

719
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.630
I remember growing up is like I don't want to be on radio.
You know,
I didn't,

720
00:40:39.631 --> 00:40:40.321
I didn't get it.

721
00:40:40.321 --> 00:40:43.170
I go in and do my dad's radio show and I thought it was so fucking weird that

722
00:40:43.171 --> 00:40:46.290
there was only a few people and we were talking to each other and were like,

723
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:47.910
I didn't know who we were talking to.

724
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:52.620
And then what really sold me on radio was like doing stand up on the road and

725
00:40:52.621 --> 00:40:53.760
going in at,
you know,

726
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:58.260
six 37 in the morning and Toledo and going in and talking to these shock jocks

727
00:40:58.261 --> 00:41:01.740
and doing four or five in a row on a Thursday morning.

728
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.840
And I started to get into it.

729
00:41:03.841 --> 00:41:07.200
I liked that they were challenging me and that they,
you had to get on,

730
00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:11.220
they're moving bus.
It was like,
you know,
they were gonna fucking bing,
bing,
bing.

731
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.340
And now let's go to Wally,
the weather guy,
and you had to send,

732
00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:17.580
your head is spinning because you just got in on a flight four hours before.

733
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.220
And I liked the challenge of having a like,
you know,

734
00:41:20.221 --> 00:41:24.060
go toe to toe with those guys and then you get to know the guys that you like,

735
00:41:24.061 --> 00:41:27.750
like you know Preston and Steve and Philly,
great guys.
I mean just this,

736
00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:31.400
this guys we both worked with and they're the ones that really shine and we're

737
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.100
going to be in an La,
Kevin and bean.
And uh,

738
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.280
so you go back and then all of a sudden you go like,
wow,

739
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:40.100
this is a cool way to make your living.
These guys don't have to travel.

740
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:43.040
They get to kind of do what I'm doing.
But in the same place,

741
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.430
<v 0>Dale Dudley and crew in Austin,
it's another,
right,
right.
Yeah,
there's a few left,</v>

742
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.020
but not many.
The business is dying.
Bob and Tom,
the business is dying.

743
00:41:52.021 --> 00:41:52.854
It's changing.

744
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.160
<v 3>Uncle Nasty in Denver.</v>

745
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.440
<v 0>Yeah,
he's a great guy.
You know,
here's the issue and here's,</v>

746
00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.260
here's what's missing.
First of all,

747
00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.000
the the medium can only go so far in regular radio censorship.

748
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:08.170
And the fact that there's commercials,
it sucks,
it ruins the show,
it ruins it.

749
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.460
You,
you can't go an hour without taking a break for a Pepsi ad.

750
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.160
You're fucking up the conversation and you just,
you just are,

751
00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:18.580
they need to figure out a way to sandwich advertisements in the radio.

752
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.670
But I think ultimately the real problem is it radio as a medium,

753
00:42:21.671 --> 00:42:26.290
like one group getting to decide what gets distributed and only a sim,

754
00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:29.440
a small amount of channels.
It's a ridiculous idea.

755
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.120
We all know a hundred guys that were more entertaining than the local radio djs

756
00:42:34.121 --> 00:42:37.540
that we had to deal with a lot of towns,
a lot of regular guys who were like,

757
00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:39.460
maybe they were construction workers,
maybe there were lawyers,

758
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.370
but they were hilarious and interesting to talk to and they wouldn't make a way

759
00:42:42.371 --> 00:42:44.880
better fucking Dj.
And a lot of those guys knew that

760
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.360
<v 3>two yeah,
they knew it.
So when you came in they would challenge you.</v>

761
00:42:48.361 --> 00:42:52.590
And what I liked was learning how to do radio and then eventually starting to

762
00:42:52.591 --> 00:42:54.720
shift it.
So it kid started out,

763
00:42:54.721 --> 00:42:58.890
they were interviewing me and then I got good enough where all sudden I was

764
00:42:58.891 --> 00:43:02.550
interviewing them and I would,
I,
you'd find the one guy you could shit on,

765
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.050
whoever was in charge,

766
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.800
you go after that guy because his sidekick and the radio and the,

767
00:43:07.801 --> 00:43:08.670
and the weather girl,

768
00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:13.380
they fucking hate this guy because he's a control freak and they always have to

769
00:43:13.381 --> 00:43:15.180
put up with shit.
So when you take him on,

770
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.350
they got your back there laughing at him.
So I,

771
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.440
you start there and then you just start asking him personal questions and by the

772
00:43:22.441 --> 00:43:26.130
end of the interview it's like they come around because they know it's good

773
00:43:26.131 --> 00:43:29.800
radio and you're not,
you're not being fucking directed.

774
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.070
<v 0>And the going after you with personal questions right away is such a hack tech</v>

775
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.830
because all you're trying to do is make someone insecure.

776
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.670
All you're trying to do is put them back on their heels.
All you're going to,

777
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.090
if you're,
you know,
whatever you're doing,

778
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:44.330
whatever questions you're asking that or intrusive like I see what you're doing,

779
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.550
all you're trying to do is make someone uncomfortable cause you don't even

780
00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:49.550
really have anything to say.
You don't have enough confidence and you,

781
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.390
your ability to actually be interesting without immediately trying to fuck with

782
00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:56.870
someone.
Especially like the comedian morning DJ thing.

783
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.020
There's a lot of guys are great,
a lot of guys are great to deal with,

784
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.310
but there's a small percentage of Djs that always resent comedians.

785
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.220
And I've heard a million comedian say it and for whatever reason,

786
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:08.840
whether they think that they could have been us,

787
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:12.410
so they wanted to do what we do or they resent the fact that you know,

788
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:16.220
they can't do it,
whatever the fuck it is.
They considered themselves funny,

789
00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:17.450
but there's no actual proof.

790
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.770
They don't get that instant feedback that we get from being on stage all the

791
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:22.310
time.

792
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:26.890
So there's like a weird sort of a thing between djs and comedians sometimes.

793
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:30.920
<v 3>Yeah.
And sometimes it is that they did the best ones.</v>

794
00:44:30.921 --> 00:44:32.820
I still do it like they're like,
oh yeah,

795
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:35.790
and I'm hosting the early show Saturday and you're like,
oh fucking,

796
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.980
that's great man.
So you're on my side.

797
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:41.310
You're a comic and you don't want to throw me under the bus because there is

798
00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:42.121
somewhat of a brotherhood.

799
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:47.121
It's the guy that quit and now you come in and he sees that you're making more

800
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:49.200
money than him.
You work in an hour.
And I,

801
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.940
<v 0>how about the guys who quit become managers?
Really?</v>

802
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.120
Those guys are file,
I don't know.
He's stand up.

803
00:44:56.121 --> 00:44:58.920
So he became mad as a few comedy managers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

804
00:44:58.921 --> 00:45:02.550
There's a few people that quit and then they got into the business.

805
00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:06.240
There's some weird back door.
Yeah.
Other controlling young talent.

806
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:07.123
<v 3>Right.</v>

807
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.690
<v 0>Controlling the future and the dreams.
Right.
Sucking it up.</v>

808
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.790
Have you ever met a casting director that was like that?

809
00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:18.140
Like had this thing about controlling the dreams,
trolling your dreams?

810
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:23.250
<v 3>You know,
I never,
I would audition for casting directors.
I never got jobs,</v>

811
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:28.200
so I never got to know them.
I knew them as well as,

812
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.410
yeah,
there was traffic on the four oh five sorry I'm late.
And uh,

813
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.510
do you want me to do that again?
No thanks.

814
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.290
<v 0>They would have like little pets that they would book booking gigs.
You know,</v>

815
00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.330
guys that had gotten close to them.

816
00:45:40.331 --> 00:45:43.630
And there's this one woman that I knew that it was a casting director that was

817
00:45:43.631 --> 00:45:48.110
always banging these guys.
It would audit.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
Casting couch.
Yeah.

818
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.390
Well she threw it on dude's and she was ultra aggressive too.
And she would like,

819
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.780
like my friend was driving somewhere with her and she was like,
look,

820
00:45:55.781 --> 00:45:59.020
we could just stop at my place.
It's only two minutes away.
Ha just kidding.

821
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.900
Actually I'm not.
And the key tries,

822
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.660
he's driving and he's trying to like figure out how to,
you know,

823
00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:08.050
they're supposed to go to this thing together with some function and you know,

824
00:46:08.051 --> 00:46:11.890
she's essentially saying,
look,
I'm two minutes away.
Come and fuck me,
you know,

825
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.610
pulling in my house real quick and then we'll be on our way.
And he's panicking,

826
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:15.881
you know,

827
00:46:15.881 --> 00:46:18.460
cause he thought this would be a good thing for his career to go with her to

828
00:46:18.461 --> 00:46:20.830
this thing and be close to her and he may never know.

829
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:25.950
So my casting something and she's literally just slinging her pussy at him and

830
00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:28.360
she's disgusting.
Unfortunately

831
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.660
<v 3>I liked the story because how many guys at casting directors have done,</v>

832
00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:34.410
you know,
the famous,

833
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.110
can I say so I'm at least glad that there's a woman doing it,

834
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.910
but you know who they love,
you know,
casting directors love who?
Brian Cowen,
man,

835
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.110
he charms the shit out of the room to,

836
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:49.290
the worst thing is I'd go to an audition and already I'm like,
I just,

837
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.350
I went to acting school for two years in New York and I always felt like I was a

838
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:56.790
good actor,
but I was a bad audition or I just never,
I never got it how to do it.

839
00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.960
And the worst was I'd sign in and I'd look at the signature ahead of me and as

840
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:05.220
Brian Callen and now I'm sitting there waiting to go in and you can hear the

841
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:07.170
laughter and the door opens.

842
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:11.460
And he's got his arm around her and they're meeting for lunch and I was like,

843
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.710
fuck,
and can you validate parking?

844
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:15.680
<v 0>Is there any given her three different books to read?</v>

845
00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:21.940
Told her which authors he really appreciates her said about him that his book

846
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.860
maybe one of the most important books ever,

847
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:29.050
<v 3>by the way.
And you know Keynesian.</v>

848
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.310
I shift

849
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:35.140
<v 2>some of your mutual funds too.
He's hilarious.
But yeah,</v>

850
00:47:35.141 --> 00:47:39.310
he's really good at that auditioning thing.
What's your,
what's your,
well you got,

851
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:43.090
you've got put into development deals and you didn't like audition for news

852
00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:46.210
radio,
right?
I auditioned for news radio and I auditioned for,

853
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.130
the show is on before too called hardball.

854
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.260
It's actually hilarious and ridiculous,

855
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.730
but I'd only auditioned twice ever for two different things.
Hard Ball,

856
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.590
which I got.
And then news radio,
which I got those,

857
00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.760
the only two auditions I've ever went on.
What was your secret?
Just get lucky,

858
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.670
get lucky and be cast into something that it makes sense for me to be cast into.

859
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.250
I didn't like try to do anything.

860
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.410
I was trying to be a comic and then I did MTVs half hour comedy hour and I've

861
00:48:10.411 --> 00:48:13.840
got a development deal.
My manager genius.
Yeah,
with Disney.

862
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.160
My manager is a genius.
He,
he's always been like a really clever guy.

863
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:22.480
And what he did was he,
he,
I had an offer for a development deal with MTV,

864
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.140
but it was after MTV had gotten ruined by Denis leary leaving.

865
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.590
Like Denis leary became a big star and MTV and then he bolted.

866
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.030
And so MTV was like,
all right,

867
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:35.830
we're going to lock people in to like serious contracts.
I remember that.
So they,

868
00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.930
they had this ridiculous contract,

869
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:41.830
it was like shit money and it was for a long period of time,
this and their,

870
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.370
their sentiment,
their idea was we create stars.

871
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.830
Like you get on MTV and we're going to create,

872
00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:50.950
we're going to turn you into a star.
And it was like,
wow,
I don't know.

873
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.490
It sounds great.
Like I'd be on MTV.
That sounds great.

874
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:56.860
I'd be like totally Pauley or something,
but fuck.

875
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.460
And so my manager said he made him,

876
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.160
he took my tape of me on the half hour comedy hour and sent it out to all these

877
00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:04.870
different production companies and said,

878
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:07.270
this guy's about to sign an exclusive deal.
If you want something,

879
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:08.740
you have to move within 48 hours.

880
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.730
And so all of a sudden we had all these development deal options and I was in la

881
00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:14.260
in a minute.
It was all because of my manager.

882
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.020
He just exactly what a manager is supposed to do.

883
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.960
He made a movie and he made a move that I would have never done right.

884
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:21.460
I would have never figured out how to do it.
I never,

885
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:22.450
I would've never thought of it.

886
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.960
He's just knows the business and he's super clever and he knows when there's

887
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:28.720
like a little feeding frenzy and he knows how to start one and then I'll send

888
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.340
them on TV.
Like within months.

889
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:35.140
I might know atom class before you get Bob Nelson,
Bob Nelson,

890
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:37.900
who was a big guy on Hbo,

891
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:41.470
he did a special and hour special on Hbo and he was on the Rodney Dangerfield

892
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:46.180
special,
but he never acting right?
Not well.
I think he did a couple of movies,

893
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.090
but he was huge as a stand right at the time.

894
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.120
He would do the thing with [inaudible] 75 yeah,

895
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:57.100
it'd be 57 a boxer and do all these characters on stage.
He's hilarious.
Well,

896
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.720
he got clean and sober and yeah,
found God and found,

897
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:06.400
found God and God found him or however they met and I met on j date,

898
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:11.180
they became BFFs and he decided to only didn't to me.

899
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.640
Um,

900
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.640
he decided that he was going to use his prayer partner or something like that as

901
00:50:18.211 --> 00:50:22.330
a manager.
So he gave my,
my manager notice,
you know,

902
00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:24.400
that he was going to leave and be managed by this guy.

903
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:28.010
So my manager flew out to or drove out rather

904
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.320
<v 0>to Boston to look for new talent.
That's how I met him.</v>

905
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.950
I met him because of this guy.
If it wasn't for Bob Nelson and Jesus,

906
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.920
I would have never met my manager.
So Jesus brought me to my manager,

907
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.820
who I think is the most important person I've ever met as far as like my career,

908
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.220
Jeff Sossman for sure.
And he's,
he's new one.

909
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.980
We've been together since I was like 22 or something like,

910
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.640
<v 3>that's amazing.
Yeah,</v>

911
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:51.520
we didn't get it from the rare for people not as show business.

912
00:50:51.521 --> 00:50:56.521
The thing is is it's a very tenuous relationship with management.

913
00:50:56.591 --> 00:50:58.000
Like I remember my first manager,

914
00:50:58.001 --> 00:51:01.600
I really thought I bought into the whole like we're best France,

915
00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.100
which didn't organically happen about it.
Fact,
it never really did happen,

916
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.600
but I believed it did.

917
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:11.200
And so to actually strike a real friendship with a manager,

918
00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:14.800
I warn people off of it.
I tell young comics,
look,
remember you,

919
00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:16.810
all your representation agents,
managers,

920
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.470
they believe in you and that's amazing and you should be really thankful for

921
00:51:20.471 --> 00:51:21.191
that.
You know,

922
00:51:21.191 --> 00:51:24.790
like they're going to wake up every day and be the only other person thinking,

923
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.510
I want Greg Fitzsimmons his career to go better so that that's great.

924
00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:32.190
But remember that they're going to drop you if you're not making the,
you know,

925
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.470
at the end of the day they're working at a job and they got to show some profits

926
00:51:35.471 --> 00:51:38.950
at the end of the year,
so don't get too invested in the friendship thing.

927
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.940
But with you guys over so many years it,

928
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:47.230
it becomes a friendship that is probably what like equal to the business

929
00:51:47.231 --> 00:51:48.064
relationship

930
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.760
<v 0>more than,
because if our business relationship ended,</v>

931
00:51:51.761 --> 00:51:53.130
our friendship would never happen.
Right.

932
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:55.540
Our business relationship would never end either.
I mean,

933
00:51:55.541 --> 00:51:58.720
I told them when we first started working together,
I just knew,
you know,

934
00:51:58.721 --> 00:52:02.680
there's certain things in life you just know he's,
he's not just a,
he says,

935
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.570
first of all,
he's fucking hilarious.

936
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.990
He's without a doubt the funniest manager of all time.
He's a hilarious guy,

937
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.220
never thought about doing standup,

938
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:13.390
but he says ridiculously funny shit all the time and he loves making comics

939
00:52:13.391 --> 00:52:14.980
laugh,
so catch it,
you know,

940
00:52:14.981 --> 00:52:18.940
off your guard and say something like ridiculous and hilarious.
He's just,

941
00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.020
he understands comedy like in and out.
He's also brutally honest.

942
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.050
Like he was fucking brutally honest with me when I sucked.

943
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:29.080
He was brutal when it first started out and he saw my potential.

944
00:52:29.081 --> 00:52:31.960
He was brutally honest with me that he was brutally honest with me when he told

945
00:52:31.961 --> 00:52:34.690
me he thought I was playing pool too much and I wasn't doing enough stand up.

946
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.670
Yeah.
We've been friends,

947
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:40.000
like from the first time when we first started becoming a manager,

948
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:44.470
he also became my friend.
So if I had to pick 20 people,
20 people,

949
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.530
we're all gonna die and 20 people are going to go off into space and live

950
00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:51.420
forever.
He's coming with my fingers too.
Wow.
Yeah.

951
00:52:51.421 --> 00:52:53.530
I so I agree with you though.
For the most part,

952
00:52:53.531 --> 00:52:58.490
like my agents please the gum that go,
do they listen to the Pi?

953
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:02.830
This is this.
I love them.
I love my current agent.
She's awesome.
But my,

954
00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:07.890
what happened with me was a series of betrayals and you know,

955
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.480
bad deals and people,
you know,

956
00:53:10.481 --> 00:53:13.180
just a lot of stupid shit has happened with agents.

957
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.350
Not a single stupid shit has ever happened with my manager and the position I

958
00:53:17.351 --> 00:53:22.351
think a good manager has is a good manager is looking out for your career in

959
00:53:22.961 --> 00:53:25.620
total for the long haul and Susman.

960
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.340
One of the things he always gives me great advice as far as do what you actually

961
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:33.840
want to do.
Forget about how much this is paying you.

962
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.400
Forget about how this would pay you more.

963
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.530
I'm going to inform you this is how much it's getting.

964
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.920
You're going to get paid this much more or this is this,
this is that,

965
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.480
but what do you want to do?

966
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:46.680
Let's let's look at the your life and your career as a whole.

967
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.030
Like what would you want to do right

968
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.470
<v 3>now?
Do you want to be in computers?
You want to be an arcade,</v>

969
00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.560
<v 0>do what you want to do.
And he's always had that advice,
right?</v>

970
00:53:53.561 --> 00:53:56.920
It's never been like go specifically for this amount of money.

971
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.410
And there was some times where it was like,
well,
I don't know what to do.

972
00:53:59.411 --> 00:54:02.540
Like fear factor was a perfect example.
Like,
she's,
I don't know,

973
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.770
do I really want to host a fucking game show?
They sick dogs on people?
Like,

974
00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.900
I mean,
he's like,
well,
you know,
you've got to think about this.

975
00:54:07.901 --> 00:54:09.640
You're ultimately going to be the one doing it.
I mean,

976
00:54:09.641 --> 00:54:12.460
here they're offering me this big show and he's saying,
you know,

977
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.350
don't do it if you don't want to do it,
but if you want to do it,

978
00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:15.610
this is the show.
Right.
You know,

979
00:54:15.611 --> 00:54:19.270
it's like a smart way to handle a career and he's,

980
00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.720
his position has always been the managers there for the long haul.
The agents,

981
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:25.150
they're great,
but they're a tool.
They're a,

982
00:54:25.151 --> 00:54:28.960
there a way that you connect to the buyer there a way you connect to the person

983
00:54:28.961 --> 00:54:29.310
who wants to do,

984
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.530
<v 3>you want to show in nature,</v>

985
00:54:30.531 --> 00:54:32.750
they're going to drop you faster if you're not making money because they

986
00:54:32.751 --> 00:54:33.950
represent way more people.

987
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.600
<v 0>Yeah.
They're like a stock market.
This is not,
there's,</v>

988
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:40.090
I mean there's some humanity involved,
but like when the car was men,

989
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.980
Sia thing went down.
My agent dumped me.
I had an agent dumped me before that.

990
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.400
You know,
there's a lot of,
like,
there's a lot of dumping going on.

991
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:50.940
There was a lot of leg abandoning and this ain't going to work.
Or you know,

992
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.970
phone calls after a bad audition,
you better shape up,

993
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:58.710
fuck you fucking end and send this,
you know,
those weird ones,
you know,

994
00:54:58.711 --> 00:55:00.700
we were like,
this is just weirdness.
Right,
right.

995
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:01.943
<v 3>You know,</v>

996
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.390
I went through a lot of agents in my life and I've been really lucky.

997
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:11.010
I got one that,
uh,
not just one,
but like the agency I'm with,

998
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:11.550
there's the one,

999
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:14.430
there's kind of like the big guy and then there's the guy that does like day to

1000
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:16.140
day more stuff,
who's also a big guy.

1001
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:20.250
But like I've been there so long that they've both moved up but extremely loyal

1002
00:55:20.251 --> 00:55:23.730
to me and I respect them and you know,
I feel like they give me a good shake.

1003
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:28.740
But one agent that I left was my fault.
I was at,

1004
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:33.450
it was at Gersh,
I was at courage where I was happy and I,
you know,
and I,
I like,

1005
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:34.800
I like some people over there,

1006
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:39.540
but I was the lonely during pilot season and there was this black agent named

1007
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:43.860
Laurie and a and then sort of name.
And then there was a,
a black,
uh,

1008
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:46.320
assistant for somebody.
Can they just be people?

1009
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.600
What the blacks someday these people,

1010
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.930
these people that you're mentioning that you keep calling black people.
No,

1011
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:57.440
but it's,
it's important for the story.
It's more for the story.

1012
00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.270
So the other girl's name was like Danielle.
Okay.

1013
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:03.530
And so I'm in there one day and this bag in pilot season where there wasn't

1014
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.820
email and shit.
So when you had auditions,

1015
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.270
they either had to FedEx a script to your house or you had to drive to your

1016
00:56:09.271 --> 00:56:13.710
agent's office and pick up some scripts.
So it was back in the day where Joe,

1017
00:56:13.711 --> 00:56:17.520
if I could tell you how many fucking auditions I went in on in my life,

1018
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:21.180
I am so grateful to the agents that believed in me.
I mean,

1019
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:25.780
I had so many swings at the,
and it was not meant to be,
so I'm in there.

1020
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:28.600
I got to fucking arm full of scripts for auditions.
I'm going in,

1021
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:33.601
it's pilot season and I'm walking out and I see a black woman and I go,

1022
00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:38.470
Hey,
Danielle.
And she goes,
it's Lori who's the big agent.

1023
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.480
And I went,
oh,
okay.
And on the ride home,
I call my age and I'm like,
yeah,
uh,

1024
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:45.880
I think I have to find them.
Then I call my manager.
I said,

1025
00:56:45.881 --> 00:56:49.930
I think I got to find other agencies.
Because you don't get past that.

1026
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:53.310
<v 2>Yeah,
that,
well,
that's just a mistake.
Why do people get so upset if you call it?</v>

1027
00:56:53.311 --> 00:56:54.520
I don't know if they got upset.

1028
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:58.540
I just PR I projected it most likely they probably got upset.

1029
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.830
People get upset if you don't say the right noise with your mouth.

1030
00:57:00.831 --> 00:57:02.920
That represents them.
Right.
They're very attached to,

1031
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:05.770
especially when it's a name that's not even original.
It's not like your,

1032
00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:08.680
your name is Kwan Aila,
March and Alda.
Some shit.

1033
00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:13.720
<v 3>I do have a hard time telling black people apart though.
No,
I'm not kidding you</v>

1034
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:15.770
<v 2>there are so good though.</v>

1035
00:57:15.771 --> 00:57:19.040
It telling Asians apart and I'm really good at your routine.

1036
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.490
You did it successfully on the fly,
on your new special.

1037
00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:24.860
I thought it was hilarious because I was driving home.
I was like,

1038
00:57:24.861 --> 00:57:26.630
this motherfucker did it a special,

1039
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.500
I do it every night.

1040
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.430
You have this weird thing where you could tell like who's Cambodian?

1041
00:57:34.431 --> 00:57:37.580
Who's Filipino,
who's,
you're probably like 80% on

1042
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.840
<v 3>93 I was in Edmonton last week and I called out.</v>

1043
00:57:41.841 --> 00:57:45.890
There were four girls in the audience and I guessed them in order.
I said,

1044
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:47.750
you are Filipino,

1045
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.360
which is kind of a slam dunk because a lot of Filipinos in that area.

1046
00:57:50.361 --> 00:57:53.090
I do my research and then I called out.

1047
00:57:53.091 --> 00:57:56.840
One woman was Korean and then another woman said she was Asian.
I said,

1048
00:57:56.841 --> 00:57:58.610
you're Indian?
She said,
yes,

1049
00:57:58.611 --> 00:58:03.200
I actually am Indian and the last one I said you're half white and the other

1050
00:58:03.201 --> 00:58:07.870
half is Japanese.
How can for for for how can you tell Greg is there?

1051
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.480
I could tell the Japanese is usually like they have like a look that looks

1052
00:58:11.481 --> 00:58:12.950
Japanese,
Japanese.
There,

1053
00:58:12.951 --> 00:58:17.951
the palace of the Asian women and their faces are a little bit puffy,

1054
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.620
but in proportion,
right.
If I can see their feet,
it's over.
I got it.

1055
00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.160
But,
but no Vietnamese are very petite,

1056
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.380
very angular and Puffy Lips.

1057
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:33.440
Filipinas are the largest breast of the Asian women.

1058
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:36.650
Chinese really do have flatter faces.
It's that simple.

1059
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:40.470
Koreans are a larger version of the Chinese,
uh,

1060
00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.450
Cambodians have a Tan.
I mean,

1061
00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:49.580
<v 2>did you see the article about the woman in China who had had like $100,000 where</v>

1062
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:54.570
the prostate surgery met a man and then the husband when the children came out

1063
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.470
was suing because he thought that she had had sex with him.
The man,

1064
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.680
like there was no way the kids could be this ugly if they were from his

1065
00:59:01.681 --> 00:59:02.514
beautiful wife.

1066
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.650
And then he found out that his wife had had all this plastic surgery and he won.

1067
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:13.380
He Won.
Oh Shit.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
He won because his wife was too ugly,

1068
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:16.320
which just think about the nose job thing.
Pulled it up,
Brian.
Brian,

1069
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.551
<v 3>I mean,</v>

1070
00:59:16.551 --> 00:59:20.150
you have kids that come out with giant fucking noses and your wife doesn't and

1071
00:59:20.151 --> 00:59:20.984
you don't.

1072
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.130
<v 2>Yes.
That happens.</v>

1073
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.180
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
That happens a lot in Newton where I grew up.
Yeah.</v>

1074
00:59:26.181 --> 00:59:29.900
That's the nose jab capital.
These,
cause there's a lot of nose jobs man.

1075
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:32.150
And young kids too.
It's really sad.

1076
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.380
You know when you see a young kid getting their face cut open,
like,
um,
there's a,

1077
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:39.960
there's a kid in my neighborhood that's 16.
It just got a nose job.
No,

1078
00:59:39.961 --> 00:59:41.880
that's apparently like in,
in Hollywood.
It's,

1079
00:59:41.881 --> 00:59:44.340
that's a big like sweet 16 present for girls.

1080
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.130
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
this is the evil man says it's a hoax.
Oh,
it's a hoax.
Yeah.</v>

1081
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:53.980
God Damn.
At the Telegraph.
What,
what day was that?

1082
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:56.320
Uh,
this was,

1083
00:59:56.350 --> 01:00:01.350
it's a whore works Harkes November 9th,

1084
01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:04.540
2013.
Oh,
okay.
So that must be the way,
it's hard to tell.

1085
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.600
<v 3>No,
look man,
if I,
if a girl has plastic surgery,</v>

1086
01:00:08.601 --> 01:00:11.990
you kind of can tell.
I don't know if she had that much plastic surgery.

1087
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:13.970
The guy's got to be a moron to think that.

1088
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:17.590
<v 2>Yeah,
it didn't.
That's her natural face that you could actually do.</v>

1089
01:00:17.591 --> 01:00:21.530
That didn't make sense.
You could actually sue something for that.
Yeah.

1090
01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:25.720
It looks like it was a marketing thing for our plastic surgery company.

1091
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:29.950
Wow,
that's smart.
Yeah,

1092
01:00:29.951 --> 01:00:31.540
because it's amazing what they can do.

1093
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.690
Have you seen what a lot of these Asian women are doing with her eyes?
No,

1094
01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.350
especially Korean.
In South Korea apparently is the plastic surgeon,

1095
01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.120
surgery capital of the world,

1096
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.440
and a lot of South Korean women are getting plastic surgery,
facial work done,

1097
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:48.850
and they get this weird thing done to their eyes were their eyes look enormous.

1098
01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:52.690
They turn their eyes into agent from Asian eyes is anime eyes.

1099
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.520
It's very odd.
Post some pictures of it up Brian.

1100
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:59.080
So it's very weird and it's like it's very prevalent.

1101
01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.540
<v 3>Korean sat very,
they have a,
how do you say it?</v>

1102
01:01:03.541 --> 01:01:07.080
Without sounding offensive.
They have thinner eyes.

1103
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.580
<v 2>Then eyes.
Well,
they're getting,</v>

1104
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:11.610
that shit changed and they're also getting their jaws changed.

1105
01:01:11.611 --> 01:01:12.421
His girls were getting,

1106
01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:17.421
their jaws were always into that for women broken and then reset to make a more

1107
01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:21.000
appeasing shape.
They're all kinds of really nutty shit.

1108
01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:23.820
They're doing to their faces,
Chin implants.

1109
01:01:23.821 --> 01:01:27.150
A lot of women are getting these chin implants.
If they have a weak chin,

1110
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.680
they put a chin implant in to strengthen their,
it's so fucking strange man.

1111
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.350
They put like a plastic Chin on you

1112
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.290
<v 3>and it seems like the direction should always be whatever you're planning on</v>

1113
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:41.830
doing.
And my Chin do half of that.
Whatever you're giving me for tits,

1114
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:46.540
do half a like you wouldn't be able to tell there were breast implants if they

1115
01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:49.360
didn't have to go double d every time.

1116
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:51.870
Put in some fucking solid C Cup.
Oops.

1117
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:56.350
<v 2>Yeah.
Well you know,
or don't do anything or don't do anything.</v>

1118
01:01:56.590 --> 01:02:00.880
But if you're gonna do it,
just show restraint.
The problem with it is man,

1119
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:04.980
just like Anorexia or what bodybuilders get,
it's,

1120
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:06.290
you don't see yourself anymore.

1121
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:11.530
You start getting like so micro that you miss the macro.
You miss the no,

1122
01:02:11.531 --> 01:02:15.670
no girls dude,
pull up girls,
girls,
surgery eyes.

1123
01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:19.060
There's some insane photos.
Oh yeah,
look at that.

1124
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.460
What the fuck her chin look like?
It was changed.
There's some better ones.

1125
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.810
There's some ones,
women's eyes that are like really strange.

1126
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.770
Yeah.
Look at this guy though.
Before he had,
you know,
the obvious slant,

1127
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:36.690
but now it's actually all it looks better.
It looks better.
No,

1128
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.220
I think Brian was saying the opposite.

1129
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.750
Look at the girl above that one and the all above that one.
That one.
That one.

1130
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:47.290
<v 3>Yeah.
I think that looks better.
I like the anime eyes.
Yeah,
like the anime eyes.</v>

1131
01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:50.830
She's wearing makeup as well.
Yeah.
That's the thing with before,
after pictures,

1132
01:02:50.831 --> 01:02:53.590
it's always like they,
you know,
they're taking them at a different angle.

1133
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.940
<v 2>Yeah.
They do different levels.
Different women.
I know.
Yeah.</v>

1134
01:02:59.941 --> 01:03:04.140
They did our job,
but the job,
yeah.
Look what they did where they draw different.

1135
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:06.540
Yah.
She had like a,
an Okie jaw.

1136
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:10.610
Remember that bass pro wrestler that fought Muhammad Ali and Tonio Gnocchi.

1137
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.330
This difference.
Whoa.
Yeah,
that's exactly right.
And the first one.

1138
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:20.010
Yeah.
Well they,
they crack that open.
I had a friend who had his underbite fixed.

1139
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:20.710
He had a,

1140
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.930
he was born with a ridiculous underbite and then when he was 21 he had it fixed

1141
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:27.660
and then Bam,
all of a sudden became this really handsome man.

1142
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.540
Whereas up until he was like 20 or 21 he was like,

1143
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:34.050
a freak kind of makes you look dumb.
The underbite well,

1144
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.700
you know it's a bad gene thing.
You look at it and go,
that's not right.
You know,

1145
01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.610
<v 3>it's like eyes that are too close together.
A jaw.
That's two lights.</v>

1146
01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.400
Like the whole Divinci code that there's this

1147
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.990
<v 2>Nachi.
What's that?
FIBONACCI?
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1148
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.140
It's a FIBONACCI sequence.

1149
01:03:48.141 --> 01:03:52.910
It's like the same thing that you see in nautilus shells and then sunflower

1150
01:03:52.911 --> 01:03:55.190
seeds.
The,
the mathematical code,

1151
01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.630
like the length of triangulation of the size of your note,
like all the,

1152
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:04.130
all your features.
They all fit the same way a pine cone fits.

1153
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.360
Like there's,
there's a mathematical proportion to people's faces.

1154
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:12.410
So when you fuck with things and change them,
like a lot of times it's weird,

1155
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.390
like,
especially like the big nose thing.

1156
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:17.060
Like when people like all of a sudden don't have a big nose anymore.
You're like,

1157
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:20.420
why is your head so long?
Then like,
where's your nose?

1158
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.480
<v 3>I know some comedians that should do reverse plastic surgery cause they're too</v>

1159
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:29.220
good looking.
They should add a giant nose and shaved the top of their head off.

1160
01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.400
<v 2>Well definitely guys don't want to fucking hear good looking guys.</v>

1161
01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:38.480
Tell them jokes while their girlfriends laughing.
No lot of guys know that shit.

1162
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.640
They do not.

1163
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.060
<v 3>That's why the good looking guys end up going so fucking dark.</v>

1164
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:47.710
Like you look at like,
uh,
what's his name?
Um,
uh,
Jessel neck.

1165
01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.600
Like he's so good looking that he has to become gross.

1166
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:56.110
Really Gross I think to,
to sort of get the guys back.

1167
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.550
<v 2>I wouldn't ever gone with him.</v>

1168
01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:03.020
I would've gone with a homeboy from Dane Cook show.
Uh,
Gary Goldman,
Goldman.

1169
01:05:03.021 --> 01:05:07.790
It's beautiful.
Matte right.
Giant too big handsome guy played football for BC.

1170
01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.430
He shoots it's perfect features,
beautiful hair.
I would go with Gary Goldman.

1171
01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:17.080
I'm not listening.
If I'm,
I'm date not happy.
This guy's up there.
Yucking it up.

1172
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:20.180
This big beautiful man.
Yeah.
And not only that,

1173
01:05:20.181 --> 01:05:22.690
but it looks big enough that he could kick my ass.
That bothers me.

1174
01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:26.200
All this stuff is huge.
Yeah,
well it's the,
you know,
the thing,
the,

1175
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:28.180
the immediate like,
I don't like that,

1176
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.910
which is one of the big advantages of a guy like Joey Diaz.

1177
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:35.170
Joey Diaz goes on stage and it's a human cartoon,
like right away,

1178
01:05:35.171 --> 01:05:39.730
he's the Ron Jeremy of comedy and a lot of ways and for people don't know what

1179
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:42.880
you're saying.
You know.
Well,
this one of the appeals of Ron Jeremy,
right.

1180
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:48.070
<v 3>He is,
uh,
not challenging you.
You could walk in the room,</v>

1181
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:52.960
tap out Ron Jeremy and watch a smile creep on that girls face in the porn scene.

1182
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.010
She would,
she'd rather be fucking

1183
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.590
<v 2>most likely.
Right.
Except Ron Jeremy's got enormous cock.</v>

1184
01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.260
<v 3>How much do women care about the enormous cock thing?
Is it overrated?</v>

1185
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.030
<v 2>This guy doing a documentary on it?
Yeah.</v>

1186
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:09.280
I remember the guy that was a embarrassed by his girlfriend on the jumbo tron.

1187
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:14.050
There was a guy who he on live TV,
he proposed to his girlfriend.
Oh,

1188
01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:17.200
I've heard about the stories and he got rejected.
She said No.
Well,

1189
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:22.201
he's making a documentary on his penis size because the reason why she rejected

1190
01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:25.150
him is because his penis is too small.
Pull that up.

1191
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.980
That's he's so he's working on this documentary now as an La guy and he's just

1192
01:06:29.981 --> 01:06:32.590
being real open about his dick size.
It's like,
you know,
if,

1193
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.890
if average is five and a half inches,
I'm below average.
That's what he's saying.

1194
01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:36.850
So it's,
you know,

1195
01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.820
really does have legitimately have a small Dick and he's doing all these things

1196
01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:42.920
like you attached a weight to it.
He tries to stretch his dick out to it,

1197
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:43.803
into all these different things

1198
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:48.250
<v 3>they show you.
Talk about a market that for advertising,
man,
nobody,</v>

1199
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:52.330
it's like hair loss and small penis.
That's all.
Because every guy,

1200
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:57.670
I have a good size.
I have a big penis.
How big?
Every woman I've slept with,

1201
01:06:57.671 --> 01:07:00.490
his commented on it.
They love it.
They,
I don't know if they love it,

1202
01:07:00.491 --> 01:07:05.320
but some of them don't like it.
It's too big girth also or no,
it's proportional,

1203
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.340
but it's,
um,

1204
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.110
it's something that has been commented on and my brother is a matter of fact,

1205
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:15.990
uh,
women that he slept with have said to me that he also has a very big team,

1206
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.320
very happy with your penis.
Extremely happy with,

1207
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.110
<v 2>so you wouldn't be a good guy to talk to for this guy if you wanted to.</v>

1208
01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:23.780
<v 3>Now,
if he talked to me,</v>

1209
01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:26.900
I think he'd feel like you feel when Gary Gulman is onstage

1210
01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:32.030
seven inches.
No,
I don't have a huge cock.
Don't get me wrong.

1211
01:07:32.031 --> 01:07:34.130
I'm not saying huge cock.
I'm saying it's a really,

1212
01:07:34.131 --> 01:07:36.140
I think women are surprised him 150 pounds.

1213
01:07:36.141 --> 01:07:39.630
I think they're surprised at the size of it.
And I think that,
um,

1214
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:42.890
it's one of the few things about me physically that's not repulsive to me.

1215
01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:47.840
I hate that I'm bald.
I hate that I'm skinny and that I'm pale.

1216
01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.840
I hate everything about my body,
but I'm very happy with my penis.

1217
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.820
<v 2>It's funny because the stuff that they use to market for big Dicks,</v>

1218
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.180
like all bullshit,
but the stuff that they use for hair,

1219
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:02.440
there's some stuff that works,
like Propecia works and Rogaine works,

1220
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:06.490
but the Dick thing,
nothing yet.
There's still things out.

1221
01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:09.280
There are still things out there for the hope.

1222
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.150
Just the fucking vague hope that maybe something,

1223
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.020
<v 3>my point is does it really matter?
Like do,</v>

1224
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:20.410
does the average woman really care about a dick being bigger or smaller?

1225
01:08:20.571 --> 01:08:24.740
Isn't it really about like how is the foreplay?
How's the motion?

1226
01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:29.660
How's like what are you doing with your hands?
Oh,
10,000,004 days.

1227
01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.970
A lot of black dudes goofing on him.

1228
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.300
But did people know at that moment it was about as Dick?

1229
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.100
<v 6>Oh yeah.
No,
no,
no.
That was it.</v>

1230
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:40.250
She didn't think that we were right for each other was because my penis was a

1231
01:08:40.251 --> 01:08:41.240
little too small for her.

1232
01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.190
What Patrick and I had his first experience in the bedroom.

1233
01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.880
That's her member.
Mine is different.
Girls were just making out.

1234
01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:53.330
Sex is a very important part of relations.
Anybody says the size doesn't matter.

1235
01:08:53.331 --> 01:08:55.990
I don't think that size matters,
that guys with small Dicks,

1236
01:08:55.991 --> 01:08:59.630
let's say that I think that the men of the world deserve an answer to this

1237
01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:01.530
question.
And so I'm going to find it.

1238
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:08.280
That's sad apartment,
that little Dick apartment.
So great.

1239
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.300
Probably just said,
hold on,
let us go.

1240
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:18.500
What the fuck?
This looks interesting touch.
Yeah,

1241
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:20.990
but do you want it?
Oh yeah.
Wow.

1242
01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.800
The male body was not subject to a critical gaze.

1243
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.280
And nowadays everybody wants to have a big penis in as like a gift.

1244
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:33.110
I don't want this on my Netflix history though.
Don't be scared.

1245
01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:38.060
You get a big Dick.
Let it swing someone constantly.
Come on,
take a look.

1246
01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.690
<v 3>Well,
you know Colin Quinn heard about it because I'd slept with a few female</v>

1247
01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:44.270
comedians,
did it,
talked about it.
And so there was a room.

1248
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.840
So Colin Quinn on tough crowd said,
I,
I want to see it after the show.

1249
01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:50.390
We're in the green room and I,
I whipped it out,

1250
01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:53.330
which you can say when it's big enough,
you'd say whipped it out.
And uh,

1251
01:09:53.331 --> 01:09:55.760
he was there with this,
uh,
with a few people.

1252
01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:58.850
And one was this black woman and she went,
oh

1253
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:01.850
well that says it right there.

1254
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:07.370
<v 0>That's hilarious.
Yeah.
This,
uh,
this is an interesting subject for a documentary,</v>

1255
01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:10.250
but when a guy says it's something,
does it matter to a girl?

1256
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:13.880
He's being a fucking idiot.
Period.
You don't know what matters to a girl.

1257
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.720
You don't even understand what it's like in any way,
shape or form to be a woman.

1258
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.530
So pretending that you know what a woman wants sexually,
that it doesn't matter.

1259
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.590
It might be the most important thing is actually,
how about that?
Yeah,

1260
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:26.450
evolutionarily it makes sense.

1261
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:30.940
<v 3>I'm just wondering,
because the size of a woman's vagina to me doesn't,
I?
I can't.</v>

1262
01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:34.390
I remember walking away going like,
like guys go,
oh,
she had such a tight pussy.

1263
01:10:34.391 --> 01:10:38.140
Like I don't remember ever really that being a giant factor.

1264
01:10:38.141 --> 01:10:41.380
Like I remember being like with young girls who were like,
you know,

1265
01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:45.880
1718 and definitely it was small.

1266
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.870
<v 0>Right?
But just stop and think about what you've already said.</v>

1267
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.300
You've already said you have very nice sized penis.

1268
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.780
So for you it wouldn't have as much of an impact as a guy who's got a needle.

1269
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:57.890
Dick,
a guy having a needle,
dick dating a girl with a tight pussy is a huge plus.

1270
01:10:57.891 --> 01:11:01.630
Right?
For you it's like your Dick is pretty good size.
It doesn't matter.
Yeah.

1271
01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:06.320
You know,
but to the girl,
I think for a lot of girls in matters a lot.

1272
01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.830
It's not,
it sucks guys who have little Dicks,

1273
01:11:09.831 --> 01:11:13.620
I'm sorry it's a Shitty fucking roll of the dice,
but it's the way of life

1274
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.110
<v 3>isn't it?
Like if you look like a bat,</v>

1275
01:11:16.111 --> 01:11:17.910
like I don't know a lot about basketball players,

1276
01:11:17.911 --> 01:11:21.630
but I know there's some really small guys and they learned to drive to the hoop

1277
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:23.940
better and they steal a lot of balls on defense.

1278
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:27.420
You learn how to make it up and the rest of your game you get that.

1279
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:31.900
<v 0>There's nothing keeping that guy with a big giant Ron Jeremy Dick from being</v>

1280
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.820
good at eating pussy and being a great personality and being really sensitive

1281
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:38.270
and supportive.
Boyfriend's a star.
No it's not.

1282
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.280
It doesn't matter like just because you have a lot of get up and go doesn't mean

1283
01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:48.060
that a guy who also has natural talent and physical attributes doesn't also have

1284
01:11:48.061 --> 01:11:48.894
a lot to get it right.

1285
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.260
It's like the difference between a martial arts champion and a guy who really

1286
01:11:52.261 --> 01:11:53.910
will never be fighting for the title.

1287
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.200
It's like there's certain guys that just lack the physical advantages that the

1288
01:11:58.201 --> 01:11:59.034
guys at the version,

1289
01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.960
<v 3>yeah,
but the guy who didn't have the natural advantages,</v>

1290
01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.740
he lives in a bad neighborhood and needs to kick ass or he's going to get
killed.

1291
01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:09.280
I have a small Dick has to get good foreplay down,

1292
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:11.440
learned about finger in that anus.

1293
01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.600
<v 0>Anderson Silva can be living in a castle.
It's still put,</v>

1294
01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:18.420
get out of his Rolls Royce and kicked the shit out of you.
Right.

1295
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.580
There's certain guys that can just do that because they have natural physical

1296
01:12:21.581 --> 01:12:25.810
advantages.
They also have talent and they also have an incredible work ethic and

1297
01:12:25.811 --> 01:12:27.220
intelligence.
On top of that,

1298
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:31.210
you would assume that someone with a lot of natural talent doesn't work as hard

1299
01:12:31.211 --> 01:12:33.550
to never get as good.
And that is often the case.

1300
01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:37.300
But just because you're a hard worker,
it doesn't mean you're guaranteed success.

1301
01:12:37.301 --> 01:12:40.180
There's certain realities about the physical attributes.

1302
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:44.140
And a guy with a little dick is never gonna be able to fuck.
Like Ron Jeremy,

1303
01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.120
Ron Jeremy's got a hog and his pants and he pulled that's fucking nine inch fat

1304
01:12:49.121 --> 01:12:52.180
cock and you're like,
Holy Shit,
me,
his dick is huge.

1305
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:56.230
And he goes down on them for a long time.
He's an animal.
But,

1306
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:59.800
but what I'm saying is there's nothing to stop a guy who's built like that from

1307
01:12:59.801 --> 01:13:03.220
also being a really nice guy.
Like,
so for a guy like this,
he said,

1308
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.960
I don't think size matters.
Listen Dude,
that's a part of life.

1309
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:11.800
Okay.
Just like the shape of your face matters.
Just like an underbite matters.

1310
01:13:11.801 --> 01:13:14.500
It's a weird thing.
Should it be the only thing?
Absolutely not.

1311
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:17.840
<v 3>No.
You can still be the,
you can overshadow that.</v>

1312
01:13:17.841 --> 01:13:21.470
Hopefully with cunnilingus and with,
uh,

1313
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.600
talking dirty eye contact.

1314
01:13:23.601 --> 01:13:26.920
I mean there's a lot of things during lovemaking that are factors in lovemaking.

1315
01:13:26.921 --> 01:13:30.680
You ain't even say fucking you went deep cause I'm talking about something to

1316
01:13:30.681 --> 01:13:31.514
men.

1317
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.710
I think that like I'm sure personality,

1318
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.650
you know guys that after the sex,
like I'm ashamed based Irishmen.

1319
01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:46.430
Every time I would get laid I would fucking get dressed as soon as possible and

1320
01:13:46.431 --> 01:13:47.450
make an excuse to leave.

1321
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.390
There's a guy who can hang around and cuddle that that means something.

1322
01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:55.330
<v 0>Sure.
And there's also something in like the way two people connect.</v>

1323
01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.130
Like there's certain girls like they might be exactly as good looking.

1324
01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.480
Like if you looked at them like wow,

1325
01:14:01.481 --> 01:14:04.030
she's very pretty and she's very pretty like they're equal.

1326
01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:07.960
But one girl just has a way of talking,
just has a way of being,

1327
01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:12.670
just has a charm or a wit and makes you just want to fuck so bad.

1328
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:15.970
And when you're with her,
it's so exciting and satisfying and crazy.

1329
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:19.300
And the other girl,
you might as well just be jerking off into the abyss.

1330
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:22.690
It's just like you're just wasting your time and it's nonsense and she can be

1331
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.610
beautiful.
She could be beautiful with a perfect body.

1332
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:28.480
It's gets boring after a while.
If you're not connecting with someone,

1333
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.220
ultimately it gets boring.

1334
01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.410
<v 3>I was in Denmark,
um,
I was like 18,</v>

1335
01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:35.840
and I was over there and I,

1336
01:14:35.841 --> 01:14:39.660
I lived there for two months and there was this girl who was like a supermodel.

1337
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:43.860
And believe it or not,
having dark hair in Denmark is a big deal.

1338
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.340
Everybody's blonde and blue eyed.
And if you look different,
like black guys,

1339
01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:51.300
the guys in the military that live in Scandinavia fucking tear it up.

1340
01:14:51.301 --> 01:14:54.630
The chicks love it.
And I'm up there and just because I have dark hair,

1341
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:57.210
I'm actually doing better than I normally would.

1342
01:14:57.211 --> 01:14:59.040
I was getting better quality women.

1343
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.950
So I was with this girl who was really beautiful and uh,

1344
01:15:01.951 --> 01:15:04.800
and I had sex with her and going back to my journals that I would keep.

1345
01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:08.650
And I wrote in my journal that I had sex with savant,

1346
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.480
know whatever the fuck her name was.
And uh,
and I was so surprised.

1347
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:16.440
It was kind of boring.
She didn't really,
she just wasn't that exciting.

1348
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:20.250
And so she,
I was staying at her friend's house.

1349
01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:25.580
Her friend read my journal and told her and then she,

1350
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.180
we hooked up again,
which I didn't think we would,
it was like a onetime whatever.

1351
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.050
And then she really came after me and fuck me again.
Hard.

1352
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:37.950
And then at the end she goes,
so was that better than the first time I go,

1353
01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:40.120
what are you talking about?
She was like in your journal the first time.

1354
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.600
So she had a point to prove.

1355
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:43.940
<v 0>That's hilarious.</v>

1356
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.330
<v 3>I yelped I give her bad Yelp came back swinging.</v>

1357
01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.560
How long before this

1358
01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:55.320
<v 0>Yelp for personalities,
like a slug of floating star above people's heads.</v>

1359
01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:55.781
You see what?

1360
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:58.830
Google glass when you curse her over them when you meet him on the street and

1361
01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:00.640
he's coming for sure.

1362
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:04.060
Just the sum total of the people that you interact with in your daily life.

1363
01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.850
The only people that actually get access to this,
you know,

1364
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:09.460
like a thing when you allow people to rate you.

1365
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:14.870
<v 3>Well,
there's a thing now called,
um,
my son does it called ask.</v>

1366
01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:19.790
Yeah.
And it's very similar to that.
People ask each other questions like he,

1367
01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:20.510
they'll ask him,

1368
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:24.770
who's the prettiest girl in seventh grade or do you like so and so?

1369
01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:29.840
And then the people get,
they get rated on that and how they,
how they respond.

1370
01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.713
Right,
right.

1371
01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.620
<v 0>Problem with that is you,</v>

1372
01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:34.470
do you want to be with someone who agrees with you on everything?

1373
01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:37.500
Do you want to be with someone who's like,
if you're,
if you're meeting someone,

1374
01:16:37.501 --> 01:16:40.470
I think one of the cool things about relationships is meeting someone who is

1375
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.760
nothing like you.
Nothing in like what they like,
like,
and you can be like,

1376
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:46.620
you really liked that,
you know,

1377
01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:50.220
like just getting to know something and knowing that just because you don't like

1378
01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:54.030
the same things,
you could still like each other.
I enjoy people that like music,

1379
01:16:54.031 --> 01:16:55.500
but I think it's fucking terrible.

1380
01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:59.610
Like I have a gang of friends that love the grateful dead.
I've never got it.

1381
01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.850
I don't get,
I'm probably never will be another one.
There you go.
There you go.

1382
01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:03.960
Exactly.
I love you.

1383
01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.700
<v 3>I love that.
And I know a lot of guys that did a hate Bruce Springsteen.</v>

1384
01:17:07.701 --> 01:17:10.050
And I just sense it doesn't make

1385
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:12.530
<v 0>any sense if you,
if you listen to born to run,</v>

1386
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:16.280
born to run is a fucking masterpiece.
It's a masterpiece.

1387
01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.400
[inaudible] album is a masterpiece,
the whole opposite masterpiece.

1388
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:23.300
But the dude is,
he,
he's undeniable,
undeniably talented.

1389
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:26.680
Just a little too good looking.
That's the problem.
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1390
01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:28.760
That's why the underbite listen,

1391
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:33.020
he's still very beautiful in his own little caricature he way in a blue collar

1392
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:35.810
way.
It doesn't get any better than that.
A lot of guys don't like that.

1393
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:36.830
Your girls want to fuck.

1394
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.700
<v 3>It's probably true that and,
and also he was poetic,
you know,
I mean,</v>

1395
01:17:40.701 --> 01:17:42.410
you look at the words to jungle land,

1396
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.240
<v 0>Oh,
jungle lands,
one of the best of all time,</v>

1397
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.660
<v 3>greatest songs of all time,
you know,
and it's like,
uh,
and in the quick,</v>

1398
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.673
quick at the moment

1399
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:52.310
<v 0>and reach for their guns and shot and make it final stage.
He gets older.</v>

1400
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.610
He's still slinging debt.
Yeah.
Oh,
brilliant disguise.

1401
01:17:55.611 --> 01:17:59.070
Remember he gotten that divorce with a beautiful woman.
You got a divorce.

1402
01:17:59.071 --> 01:18:03.680
And then he wrote a brilliant disguise.
That's a God damn home run of a song.

1403
01:18:03.681 --> 01:18:05.350
Right.
Fuck that song's good.

1404
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.640
<v 3>And after nine 11,
the rising,</v>

1405
01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:11.780
he wrote that album and it was like the most movie was to me the most authentic.

1406
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:14.600
And he actually had written a lot of it before nine 11,

1407
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:19.070
but in the context of it coming out then it was the most authentic response

1408
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:21.650
artistically that I saw tonight.
11.

1409
01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:26.080
It was an inspirational and they played it,
uh,
at,
at God was at,

1410
01:18:26.081 --> 01:18:30.290
at his inauguration,
I think it was at Obama's inauguration.

1411
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:34.580
They had a choir come out and sing the rising.
And I mean you talk about my son,

1412
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:38.270
me and my wife was sitting there and my,
my son's like,
why are you guys crying?

1413
01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:39.260
And you're like,
and we're like,

1414
01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:42.860
you can't explain to him that the black president is a big deal cause he's only

1415
01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:46.490
seen one get elected.
Right.
And,
and you know,
and you like,

1416
01:18:46.491 --> 01:18:49.760
someday you're going to understand what this moment means and how perfect this

1417
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:52.640
fucking song is right now.
But yeah,

1418
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:56.930
I think that that not getting people's tastes the same.
Doesn't matter.

1419
01:18:56.931 --> 01:19:00.470
It's attitude.
You'll never get attitude across on the Internet.

1420
01:19:00.471 --> 01:19:04.190
And when you meet somebody and you see them roll their eyes at somebody,

1421
01:19:04.191 --> 01:19:07.100
you also think is corny.
Sometimes that's the spark.

1422
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.750
<v 0>Oh yes.
Well the cornea is a different thing.
I mean,</v>

1423
01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:12.570
it's just like things that I like that are fucking terrible.

1424
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.280
I know they're terrible,
but I enjoy them.
Yeah.
You know,
I go,

1425
01:19:15.281 --> 01:19:18.510
I'll end Jay legitimately enjoy an episode of Walker,
Texas Ranger.

1426
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.840
I will enjoy it.
I don't expect anybody else to sit there and watch it with me.

1427
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.880
You know?
It's like,
but I will enjoy it.

1428
01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.260
And you can't tell me that this music that I like,
that people will say socks.

1429
01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:30.690
I like some Toby Keith songs.
I don't give a fuck.

1430
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:34.380
You like some big hair bands too,
right?
Bon Jovi,
one direction.

1431
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.270
Look a little Bon Jovi.
You try to be funny.
Um,
I like,
um,

1432
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.650
you know all like Whitesnake Whitesnake right,
but so what,

1433
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.860
so what I like shut stuff that you might think sucks.

1434
01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.360
<v 3>Have you ever seen a bear,
a band called a,
is it hair nation?
No.</v>

1435
01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:55.410
What does that look like?
A spoon.
It's the one,
it's a spoof band in Hollywood,

1436
01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.210
but they've got the sickest musician,
Harris Steel Panther.

1437
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.750
No,
not steel.
Panther is another one now.
It's not new.
They've been around,

1438
01:20:03.751 --> 01:20:06.740
they play Tuesday nights at a,

1439
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.900
at of the big rock clubs and I saw him in Vegas.

1440
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:14.520
You would love them because it's like the best um,
def Leppard songs.

1441
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:18.180
Whitesnake poison light.
But the song you really want to fucking hear,

1442
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.060
I'm sure it's not steel panther ups,
not Steel Panther.

1443
01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:25.980
I know that's the same genre,
but these guys are um,
God,
it's not school of rock.

1444
01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:26.814
It's like,

1445
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:31.050
I'll think of it if you want to put it on your website later,

1446
01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:34.270
but I'm still panthers fucking awesome cause I didn't like the,

1447
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:37.620
I didn't light hair,
bad hair metal at all when I first heard it.

1448
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:41.670
Then I saw these guys and I had to go back and now I start listening sometimes

1449
01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:44.880
to a hair nation,
I think is the name of the station on Sirius.

1450
01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:49.680
The plays that music and I had to go back and start going,
oh,
I missed some shit.

1451
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:53.470
I missed some good shit.
That's fine.
Yeah.
Um,

1452
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:58.200
find it at Bri.
Brian,
find this band for me.
Spending look like an asshole.

1453
01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.430
<v 0>Use Two hands.
Momma yelling at Brian.
He's your guy.</v>

1454
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:06.730
She's helps more people need to yell at them.
Um,
yeah.

1455
01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.340
I saw Steel Panther in Vegas at the uh,
at the House of Blues.
They're amazing.

1456
01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.910
Yeah.
Incredible.
His fuckin Ozzy Osborne impression is insane.

1457
01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:15.320
You feel like you're actually seeing Ozzie,

1458
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.220
I mean he moves like Ozzie sings like Ozzy.
Sounds like Ozzy.

1459
01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:20.480
The musicians are bad ass

1460
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:24.960
<v 3>metal shop.
Metal shop.
Metal shop.
Hmm.
Alright.
School,</v>

1461
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.140
School of metal.
Metal School,
metal school.

1462
01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:31.370
<v 0>Maybe it is metal shop and you're fucking this whole show up.
No.</v>

1463
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:33.450
Trying to find this thing.
Fuck.

1464
01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:36.120
I hate when I do this on a podcast you want to do in life.

1465
01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:37.860
It makes me think of my memory's going.

1466
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:40.020
There's only so many things you can store.

1467
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.600
Do you find that as you get older you have less room for shit?

1468
01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:45.090
<v 3>Yeah,
without a doubt.</v>

1469
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:47.760
It's very frustrating because I'm getting to the point where,
you know,

1470
01:21:47.761 --> 01:21:51.420
I used to just write on shows and now I'm in the position where like I just,

1471
01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:53.850
I ran two shows this fall.
This is where,

1472
01:21:53.851 --> 01:21:56.740
and I need my memory more than ever before and it's,

1473
01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.230
it's less than what it used to be.

1474
01:21:58.231 --> 01:22:01.830
And I just think if I had my memory from back then I could actually do this job

1475
01:22:01.831 --> 01:22:03.400
well.
Um,
but

1476
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:07.370
<v 0>this,
take some of this that ever give me any of those Alpha brain.
I kept a,
uh,</v>

1477
01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:09.290
send you a bunch of it.
I'll have a bunch sent to you.

1478
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.300
<v 3>I had this game,
my,</v>

1479
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.250
my friends were a over one night and we were having a conversation and they just

1480
01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:16.200
kept doing that where they couldn't think of stuff.

1481
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:19.650
And I thought of an idea for a game show that I pitched,

1482
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.110
sold it didn't get picked up.

1483
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.020
And then I pitched and sold to another network and we,

1484
01:22:25.021 --> 01:22:28.160
and it didn't get picked up and it was basically,
it was,
uh,

1485
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:31.590
an old lady is called ass granny.
And it was,
uh,

1486
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:36.690
me living with my mother and I have kids and she keeps trying to tell them these

1487
01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:37.920
great stories from her life.

1488
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:41.670
Like about when she ran with the bowls with Picasso or she was on the freedom

1489
01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:44.820
marches down south and there are these stories from her rich life,

1490
01:22:44.821 --> 01:22:47.690
but she keeps forgetting shit.
So she goes,
so I was out in,
you know,

1491
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:51.500
I was in the capital of Washington state.
Um,
what's it called?
Uh,

1492
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.510
what's it called?
And then you,
you clap in and you give her the answer.

1493
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.380
But she tells these funny stories about her wildlife and,
and I,

1494
01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:02.370
and that was like the perfect fucking game show to me.
Um,

1495
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:06.190
but that's how people really talk.
You catch him sometimes and it's like,

1496
01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:08.350
so what I do now is if somebody gets stuck,

1497
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:12.850
I will give the most ridiculous answer possible and I'll keep doing it as

1498
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:16.090
they're trying to think and it fucks them up.
That's not nice.
They'll be like,

1499
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:18.910
what's that one?
You know,
the ones on the first year?
Yes,

1500
01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.010
because I am insecure with myself.
Greg,

1501
01:23:22.011 --> 01:23:25.840
a middle school was the name of this band and then it changed.

1502
01:23:25.841 --> 01:23:30.430
They changed it to metal shop and then they changed it to steel panther.
Okay,

1503
01:23:30.431 --> 01:23:33.430
got it.
Then that's the band and the guy looks in the mirror at himself when he's

1504
01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:37.090
playing bass.
Yeah.
Boy,
they could have saved a lot of time.

1505
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:39.520
I should have kept up with the band.

1506
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.560
Why do they keep changing their fucking names?

1507
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:44.950
Why don't you like stay on their Twitter,
follow the Twitter feed?
Well,

1508
01:23:44.951 --> 01:23:48.550
it's one of those bands where if you go to Vegas,
which you know,
my,
my,

1509
01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.000
my interest in Vega says as crawled,
who is zero at this point?

1510
01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:55.780
I used to really like it,
but it was great if you could go and you'd know,

1511
01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:59.680
all right,
I want to see cookie jar.
You know that that performer cookie jar?
No.

1512
01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:02.290
What is cookie jar?
He's like this guy who plays,
uh,

1513
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.580
how could you possibly see that?
You know,
you know,
cookie jar,
you know.
Well,

1514
01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:10.450
he's a big,
he's a big name in,
in Vegas.
He's like,
yeah,
he's,

1515
01:24:10.451 --> 01:24:13.510
he's a guy who does,
he's got an amazing voice.

1516
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:18.250
And a toupee and he sings everything from like youtube going back to Elvis and

1517
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.150
he plays a synthesizer and gets it going in a loop and then he starts another

1518
01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:25.660
instrument.
He's,
he's really,
really great lounge act and so,

1519
01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:29.720
but if you go to Vegas,
it's important that you have like a,

1520
01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.000
what do they call steel panther.
Yeah.

1521
01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:34.300
You have a steel panther and a cookie jar and,

1522
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.590
and maybe you know a comedian that's in town and then it,

1523
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.200
then it's worth actually be in there for a couple of days there.
Yeah,

1524
01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:43.900
there's still some great shows.
That's cookie jar.
Whoa.
Jesus Christ.

1525
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:46.540
You don't,
you don't know if he's a parody or not.
He is,

1526
01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:51.541
but he's not because he's so fucking good that you find yourself just,

1527
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:55.080
you're not laughing at them at all.
You're,
you're there on it where there's like,

1528
01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:55.570
show me

1529
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:57.700
<v 2>and in Vegas there's one thing that appeals to me,</v>

1530
01:24:57.701 --> 01:25:00.190
the idea of doing a show at the same place all the time.

1531
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:02.560
I really do enjoy traveling and doing standup,

1532
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.910
but I also liked the fact of being a desk.

1533
01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:06.730
I like the idea of being a destination,

1534
01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:11.020
like if you're going to go to see Siegfried and Roy used to be God blessed them

1535
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:15.370
restless faster or whatever.
He's still alive.
He used to be a lot of people.

1536
01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:16.530
It is Penn and teller.
This,

1537
01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:20.620
there's certain people that go to Vegas and they'll still like wrap their trip

1538
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:22.600
around going to see Penn and teller.
They're like,

1539
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:25.150
we got tickets to see Penn and teller.
This is what we're going to do.

1540
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:26.710
We're going to catch Cirque de Solei.

1541
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.100
We're going to do like that's a destination.
Like those Cirque du Soleil shows.

1542
01:25:30.101 --> 01:25:31.570
They do like Zumanity or whatever.

1543
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.930
<v 3>Oh,
those.
Those are destinations.
Well,
somebody who I know,</v>

1544
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:39.200
a younger girl I worked with on a show and she's like,
yeah,
my family's in town.

1545
01:25:39.201 --> 01:25:41.810
We're going to go out to Vegas.
I go to you and do this.
She's like,

1546
01:25:41.811 --> 01:25:43.560
we got tickets to see Vinny favor.
Read out.

1547
01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:50.390
That's a destination in Vegas now.
Good for him.

1548
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:55.610
That's what you want to be.
Joe,
do you want to be fitting fear free and say that?

1549
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:57.950
I said good for him.
I'm trying to be positive.

1550
01:25:57.951 --> 01:26:00.380
You fuck is the worst comedian ever.

1551
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.220
Oh No,

1552
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.160
<v 6>you didn't.
I'll piss on your little picnic.</v>

1553
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:09.410
I'll piss on your little big mag.

1554
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:16.580
Well,
carrot top has got a great fucking Gig.
I mean,

1555
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:20.570
I think that guy makes some insane eight or $9 million a year,

1556
01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.220
does a genre of comedy that is,
he's the best at,

1557
01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:25.900
you know,

1558
01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:28.990
<v 0>well,
he's not just the best.
He's annihilated the genre.
Right.</v>

1559
01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.870
There's no more prop comic.
Right,
right.
I remember who pointed it out.

1560
01:26:31.871 --> 01:26:35.380
I forgot who.
I think it was Todd glass.
It was pointing it out.
He's like,

1561
01:26:35.381 --> 01:26:38.560
there's no one else.
Like,
they used to be a genre.

1562
01:26:38.561 --> 01:26:42.990
They used to be guys who are ventriloquist fucking amazing.
When Jeff,
uh,

1563
01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:47.420
Jeff Dunham and peanut,
he fucked that.
There's no one left.
It was like this,

1564
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.801
of course,

1565
01:26:47.801 --> 01:26:50.590
auto and George still in New York and there's a couple of guys like Willie Tyler

1566
01:26:50.591 --> 01:26:52.270
and Lester and those guys are still working.

1567
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.640
But as far as like new guys that are ventriloquist,

1568
01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.210
it's so rare to go to a comedy club and see a puppet.

1569
01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.760
It used to be one out of 20

1570
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.990
<v 6>Oh and you and I would fucking,</v>

1571
01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:08.020
I remember once we did a gig out in western mass and the headliner was a puppet

1572
01:27:08.121 --> 01:27:12.920
guy and you and I went on ahead of him and just did nothing but puppet jokes

1573
01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.830
time and then we left before he went on.

1574
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.020
I remember that we were so cruel back then.

1575
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.980
We had such was such a fucking standards that we're not to be broken.

1576
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.820
No such ideas about what's common and what's not comedy.

1577
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:29.040
I know now I would kill to see a good profit.
I love that shit.

1578
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:33.440
Get High and go watch a fucking proper great carrot.
Top is a good,

1579
01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:38.390
proper lot of people give that guy.
She also writes new material all the time.

1580
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:41.780
Like he did the roast and he had a bunch of funny shit from there for the roast.

1581
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:42.850
Yeah,
it's a good act.

1582
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.850
You know what I haven't seen blown out as a genre is the guitar act.

1583
01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:51.150
There's guys that are big,
you know?
I think Stephen Lynch,
isn't he a big guitar?

1584
01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:52.460
Yes.
Just guys that are big,

1585
01:27:52.461 --> 01:27:57.020
but that haven't really cracked to the point that carrot top has or Jeff Dunham

1586
01:27:57.021 --> 01:28:00.530
has.
Well,
how about a guy like Michael Winslow?
Who a sound effects guy?

1587
01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:04.790
Like how many sound effects guys are there?
Have you ever heard that guy?

1588
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:09.770
Do whole lot of love.
Yeah.
Pull that up.
Yeah,
we'll up.
Michael Winslow.

1589
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:14.570
All in is Babylon.
It's fucking incredible.
Do you remember the line?

1590
01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:18.020
So incredible.
You won't believe it's actually just coming out of his mouth.

1591
01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.470
And who was the comic who had that joke?
Uh,
in Boston?
Uh,

1592
01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:27.050
Alara Pucci and it was a is this is an auto mechanic singing led Zeppelin.

1593
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:30.850
You need coolant here.
It,

1594
01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:35.740
so he's on a show doing this led Zeppelin and went,

1595
01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:39.230
when did the original artists,
this is Michael Winslow from police academy.

1596
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.920
All right.
All right.
It's insanely talented voice artist.
Listen to this.

1597
01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:50.760
So it was one guy with a

1598
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.020
<v 5>tar and here comes Winslow.</v>

1599
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.610
That's his mouth.

1600
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:07.000
That's him singing.

1601
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:20.410
<v 7>The host has this look on his face.
Like what the fuck?</v>

1602
01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:40.543
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1603
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:42.990
<v 2>The drums is all</v>

1604
01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.073
<v 5>mountains.</v>

1605
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:51.920
Come on man.

1606
01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:54.020
<v 7>That's his mouth.
Amazing.</v>

1607
01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:02.403
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1608
01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.150
<v 7>It's incredible.</v>

1609
01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.420
<v 6>That's incredible.
That's great.
Yeah.</v>

1610
01:30:20.421 --> 01:30:23.420
I remember seeing them do purple haze one time and he was like,

1611
01:30:23.421 --> 01:30:27.350
excuse me while I kiss a flight.
And it was like a,
yeah,

1612
01:30:27.351 --> 01:30:31.610
I mean that was a very Hendrickson version of Zeplin.
Yeah.
It was more of a,
yeah.

1613
01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.150
More blues or torsion and,

1614
01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.570
<v 2>yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well I think he's a bit of Hendrix Fan.
How could you not be,</v>

1615
01:30:39.170 --> 01:30:40.490
you know,
there's a thing that,
uh,

1616
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:44.690
I was watching this Anthony Bordain episode the other night and it was,
uh,

1617
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:48.730
he was talking about going to Japan for the first time and then encountering

1618
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.880
Japanese culture and Japanese cuisine and seeing like how insane their society

1619
01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:57.850
is and how different it is and how he acquainted it.
He,
he,
he,
uh,

1620
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:02.480
said it was like,
it was like taking acid for the first time,

1621
01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.700
but it was also like the feeling that it left him.

1622
01:31:04.701 --> 01:31:08.060
It was like the feeling that Eric Clapton and Jimmy page must have had when

1623
01:31:08.061 --> 01:31:11.370
Jimmy Hendrix came to town.
Right.
I go,
fuck,
now what?

1624
01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.280
<v 6>That's what everybody,</v>

1625
01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.970
<v 2>the hat,
right.
Anybody that talks about like,</v>

1626
01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.140
like I've heard people say that like Jimi Hendrix is overrated.
I've,
I've,
I've,

1627
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:26.560
I've had arguments with people but like this podcast called the Joe Rogan

1628
01:31:26.561 --> 01:31:28.740
experience,
cause I'm a Jimi Hendrix Fan.
I mean there's,

1629
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.850
I stole it straight from Jimi Hendrix when I,
when,

1630
01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:33.550
when I'm listening to like Jimi Hendrix,

1631
01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:37.960
even today I think I find it insanely and town,
insanely talented,

1632
01:31:37.961 --> 01:31:39.670
insanely amazing.

1633
01:31:39.671 --> 01:31:43.630
But when you take it about like this guy coming out in the 1960s with this,

1634
01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.820
like this was so alien and revolutionary and so different from anything that had

1635
01:31:48.821 --> 01:31:53.440
come before.
Hmm.
Well you listen to like a [inaudible] child,
like Voodoo child,

1636
01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:57.430
slight return,
the slower version of it.
Like all of it did the,

1637
01:31:57.610 --> 01:32:02.180
the sounds that guy was in the way he was putting it together and he was,

1638
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.530
<v 3>and it was about war.
I mean,
ultimately he's doing fucking,
you know,</v>

1639
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.560
he did that and machine gun at the,
um,
uh,
what was the New Year's eve?

1640
01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:12.670
Tell me did it the M in San Francisco,

1641
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:16.450
I have to fill it was live at the Fillmore and like the whole thing was about

1642
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:18.430
Vietnam.
It's like that was the undertones of it.

1643
01:32:18.431 --> 01:32:23.431
He's constantly weaving machine gun fire and they and rockets coming down and it

1644
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:28.090
was like his,
his ability,
like I heard the story about at um,

1645
01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.283
uh,

1646
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:34.290
Monterey Festival in 1967 which launched not only Hendricks but a Otis Redding

1647
01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:41.440
and um,
who is the other,
there was somebody else huge that got launched.

1648
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.431
Was it the,

1649
01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:47.431
who might've been the WHO's first major performance in North America also,

1650
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:52.540
but when he came on they say that backstage.
Everybody always wonders.
Like,

1651
01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:55.030
what was it like,
like what was going on backstage?
It must've been,

1652
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:57.130
were they all like refund together with ever?

1653
01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.850
Apparently Hendrix had a,
um,

1654
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:05.440
sergeant pepper's had just come out and Hendricks had learned the entire album

1655
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:10.740
and was playing the guitar and the lead on the entire album while everybody,

1656
01:33:11.351 --> 01:33:15.460
like I,
I forget who else was there,
like sat around.
Just mesmerized.

1657
01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.270
<v 2>Wow.
Yeah,
Dude.
Pull up.</v>

1658
01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:22.350
Hendricks plays Monterey pop 1967 finale.

1659
01:33:22.650 --> 01:33:25.050
Wild thing.
He plays it.
Uh,

1660
01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.280
this was 1967 the world's introduction to this guy,

1661
01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:33.000
he was only around for a short amount of time.
That's what's such a mind fuck.

1662
01:33:33.210 --> 01:33:36.780
And he was so young.
He was 27 when he was dead.
Yeah,
27,

1663
01:33:36.781 --> 01:33:40.650
him and Morrison and Janis Joplin,
three of arguably the greatest of all

1664
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:44.460
<v 3>was not a drug addict.
He,
you know,
he happened to die while he was fucked up.</v>

1665
01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:46.440
I think it was alcohol or whatever.

1666
01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.660
And it was famous stories about him using acid,

1667
01:33:48.661 --> 01:33:51.330
but he really used acid as a way to expand his mind.

1668
01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.700
He was not an addict in any way.
The way,

1669
01:33:53.701 --> 01:33:55.560
when you think of somebody like Jim Morrison,

1670
01:33:58.170 --> 01:34:00.870
<v 2>well I don't,
you know,
there's,
I don't know what happened to Hendricks.</v>

1671
01:34:00.871 --> 01:34:05.640
Obviously he died like when I was a baby,
choked on his own vomit.
But you know,

1672
01:34:05.641 --> 01:34:09.600
there's a huge book out by,
um,
one guy,

1673
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:11.460
he was a foreign body guard or something like that.

1674
01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.560
The claims that his manager had Hendricks killed because a Hendrix was leaving

1675
01:34:16.561 --> 01:34:20.150
him.
He did.
His first manager was a gangster.
And not only was Hendrix killed,

1676
01:34:20.151 --> 01:34:23.910
but his girlfriend was thrown off the roof of a building the same night.
No,

1677
01:34:23.911 --> 01:34:26.910
like really close to that.
Like after the murder,

1678
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:30.720
his girlfriend was thrown off the roof of the building.
Oh yeah.
And uh,
you know,

1679
01:34:30.721 --> 01:34:34.800
I don't know if this guy is right or wrong,
but the guy was a,
um,

1680
01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:39.000
the guy was in a band too.
I think he was in,
um,

1681
01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:44.850
fuck he was in one of those,
uh,
early,

1682
01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:47.940
early sixties.
Rock and roll bands.

1683
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.290
<v 3>The Guy,
the guy who was the manager?</v>

1684
01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.360
<v 2>Yes.
Hey.
Yeah,
no,
not the guy.
Who's the manager?
The guy who wrote the book.
Oh</v>

1685
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:59.450
<v 6>yeah.
Um,</v>

1686
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:02.930
it's also a story about how like it was either going to be the who are Hendricks

1687
01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:07.931
closing out Monterey and there was like a little bit of a drama about it and I

1688
01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:11.930
think that's why he lit his fire,
his guitar and fire at the end of his set.

1689
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:15.000
Listen to how good this is,
man.

1690
01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:20.020
I look how little he uses his left hand to Strunk.
He's doing a lot of the notes,

1691
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:22.720
just banging his right fingers down on the fret

1692
01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:27.480
<v 9>board.
Wow.
The animals.</v>

1693
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:28.710
That's who the guy was from.

1694
01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:30.120
<v 6>Eric Burdon in the animals.</v>

1695
01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.470
The guy who worked for the band I think could run of the most underrated rock

1696
01:35:34.471 --> 01:35:38.340
bands in history.
The animals.
I'm pretty sure that's who it was.

1697
01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.340
Wow.
Man.
All this playing lead,
playing rhythm,
guitar,

1698
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:49.880
singing and chewing gum at the same time.

1699
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:52.183
Chewing gum

1700
01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.380
and not looking ever eyes closed.

1701
01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:00.873
<v 5>Ooh.</v>

1702
01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.380
<v 6>And doing Michael Winslow noises with his mouth</v>

1703
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.040
<v 9>flap.
Yeah.
This is,</v>

1704
01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.950
people kind of have to understand how new this was

1705
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:15.480
<v 6>and hasn't been done since.
You know,
prince is the closest that's come to this.</v>

1706
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:19.010
<v 9>Well,
there's been some interesting guys since that,
you know,</v>

1707
01:36:19.011 --> 01:36:21.370
there's some guys that don't get any credit like you know who uh,

1708
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:26.120
Gary Clark is now.
Garrett Clark is a,
this guy out of Texas.

1709
01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.020
I think that's his name.
Shit.

1710
01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:32.770
<v 6>How much did Lenny Kravitz want to be this</v>

1711
01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.560
<v 9>Gary Clark Jr Carter?
Is that it?
Gary Clark Jr or you just,</v>

1712
01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:44.330
<v 6>you get that left hand in the air is all being played.
That's on the front</v>

1713
01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:49.060
<v 9>ports.
Yeah.
This is it.
It's Gary Clark Jr.
That's his name.
Yeah.</v>

1714
01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:53.140
Pull up this song.
Bright Lights.
This is a,
I mean,

1715
01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:56.050
I don't want to compare this dude to Hendrix and give him a lot of grief,

1716
01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.850
but this,
this guy is a bad motherfucker that doesn't get as do

1717
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:05.580
<v 6>and I don't understand why pull up bright lights.
This is,
I mean Guessi does,</v>

1718
01:37:05.581 --> 01:37:09.390
I'm looking at one of his songs.
It has 470,000 hits,

1719
01:37:09.391 --> 01:37:13.890
so I guess he does get his due,
but um,
he's still around.

1720
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:17.960
I may do is playing.
Oh yeah.

1721
01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:20.373
<v 10>Two drummers.</v>

1722
01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:25.180
<v 9>Oh,
this is him playing some pop festival or something.
What does it say?</v>

1723
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:35.440
<v 10>Crossroads.
Crossroads Guitar Festival.</v>

1724
01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:40.460
2010 crossroads Guitar Festival on Warner Brothers records.

1725
01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.953
It was pretty big.

1726
01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:46.960
<v 6>Much more vocal oriented.</v>

1727
01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.073
<v 10>The fucker did</v>

1728
01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.513
<v 5>losses.</v>

1729
01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:04.050
<v 9>See,
here's the song that I've never heard on the radio.</v>

1730
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.380
I've never heard this guy on the radio head.
Yeah.
I mean I don't,

1731
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.550
maybe he's being played on the radio and I'm not aware,

1732
01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:12.120
but this is one of the things I fucking love about the Internet.

1733
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:17.780
Is it a dude like that with some 1970s cop glasses and the crazy beard?

1734
01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:26.260
<v 3>You're going to know my name by the end of</v>

1735
01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:30.880
<v 9>this impurity to this music,
you know?
Yeah.
Well it's,
yeah,</v>

1736
01:38:30.881 --> 01:38:35.050
it's basic fucking Delta Blues.
Yeah.
And it's that he's doing it the right way.

1737
01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:39.940
You know what I mean?
It's like,
fuck that shit.
There's nothing that stands out.

1738
01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:40.980
You know,
there's one

1739
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.550
<v 0>thing that used to drive me fucking crazy when I was a kid and I would listen
to,</v>

1740
01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:47.880
I know Whitney Houston has a beautiful voice and I know Mariah Carey could sing

1741
01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:52.420
her ass off,
but it was that thing that they used to do the,
Ooh,

1742
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:57.300
all that extra shit you're throwing in there that like if you listen to like,

1743
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:59.160
there's certain artists that don't,

1744
01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:02.130
they have a beautiful voice but never do that.

1745
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:07.280
<v 3>You're not showing off.
Yeah.
You go back Fiona Apple,
right.
Authentic,</v>

1746
01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:12.170
right.
Pure,
authentic fucking be or Sinead O'Connor.
Perfect.
Perfect example.

1747
01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.300
Or Natalie manes,
another great example,
but doesn't have to.

1748
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:21.650
Then you go back to like Sarah Vaughan where she was showing off but not,

1749
01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.300
not in a fucking,

1750
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:27.620
he was in a playful way that was very much part of jazz and blues back then.

1751
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:32.480
Ella Fitzgerald,
they were those that was flourished.
That wasn't the bait.

1752
01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:35.870
The base of the song wasn't twisting a fucking note to death.

1753
01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:40.250
It was just little like they would do scat singing a little bit in the middle.

1754
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:45.530
But Sarah Vaughan's voice to me is still the greatest female vocals of all time.

1755
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:49.570
Yeah,
there's been a lot of great fucking female vocalists,
man.
And I,

1756
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:54.090
<v 0>there's a thing about hearing a great female voice that's very different than</v>

1757
01:39:54.091 --> 01:39:57.090
hearing a great man voice,
like great female voices.

1758
01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:00.420
Like people give Cheryl crow a hard time because she does a lot of poppy

1759
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:05.190
bullshit.
But that bitch can sing her ass off.
She's got some songs.

1760
01:40:05.191 --> 01:40:08.700
She has this one song that she did with kid rock.
Um,

1761
01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.620
I forget what the name of it is.
A valid one.

1762
01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:18.500
The ballad one weather.
Yeah.
I saw you last night.

1763
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:24.960
Her voice is just so beautiful.
It does something to your body,

1764
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:28.910
like it just calms you down or something that puts you in a different place.

1765
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:33.960
You hear it,
you go,
God damn,
that bitch just nailed it.
She nailed it.

1766
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:37.230
<v 3>If you're ever down,
you know,
sometimes you get,
you get,</v>

1767
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:39.820
there's always that you've got to call an audible on your depression.

1768
01:40:39.821 --> 01:40:42.070
Like sometimes you start to feel it and you go,
all right,

1769
01:40:42.071 --> 01:40:44.560
I got to snap the fuck out.
Let me get some coffee and work out.

1770
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:46.750
And there's other times where it's,
it's got to,

1771
01:40:46.751 --> 01:40:50.700
the fingers are deep in and you've gotta go,
I gotta go down with this one.
Oh No,

1772
01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:51.520
I gotta roll.

1773
01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:54.490
I've got to go underwater water and roll a few with this bitch and then I'll get

1774
01:40:54.491 --> 01:40:58.090
a role with the depression radiator,
all the depression.
So when you hit that,

1775
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:01.540
you grab a grab a blue

1776
01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:06.490
<v 6>by.
Um,
uh,
oh.
What the fuck is her name?
Um,</v>

1777
01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.950
Sarah on?
No,
no,
no.

1778
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.320
<v 3>Late sixties,
early seventies.</v>

1779
01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:17.230
<v 6>Oh,
come on Greg.
You're playing that fucking game again.
Oh No,
Greg,</v>

1780
01:41:17.231 --> 01:41:22.140
you're in the hole right now.
Fuck.
Oh Lou,
look up blue.

1781
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.880
Not Janice.
Oh,
I leann rimes

1782
01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:35.880
<v 2>Leann rimes.
Leann rimes has a beautiful voice.</v>

1783
01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:37.790
<v 3>Eiffel 65.
Joni Mitchell,</v>

1784
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:41.510
Joni Miss Joni Mitchell blue might be the greatest,
uh,

1785
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:44.480
I it top 10 albums of all time.
I put,
I put that album in there,

1786
01:41:44.481 --> 01:41:45.800
but you gotta be sad for it.

1787
01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.430
<v 2>You know the singer tits off that people don't realize it's gonna sound</v>

1788
01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.030
ridiculous.
Miley Cyrus,
she's got a fucking cover.
Fuck you Brian.

1789
01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.310
She's got a cover of a Dolly Parton's Jolene that I just put up on Twitter.

1790
01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.770
It's fucking fantastic.
He had no problem with her.

1791
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:05.610
But why did she make such shit like that thing that she did at the video music

1792
01:42:05.611 --> 01:42:08.400
awards,
like who was managing her?
They didn't know.
Come to her and go,
listen,

1793
01:42:08.401 --> 01:42:11.820
listen,
this other song is fucking good.

1794
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:16.380
Like if you could do shit like this,
like God damn bitch,
like this is really,

1795
01:42:16.381 --> 01:42:17.770
really,
really,
really good

1796
01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.410
<v 3>to get radio play.</v>

1797
01:42:19.411 --> 01:42:23.790
It's so specific what you need to do and she's addicted to the corporate cock

1798
01:42:23.791 --> 01:42:24.361
now she's,

1799
01:42:24.361 --> 01:42:28.830
she came up a child star and she can't accept not being number one.

1800
01:42:28.831 --> 01:42:32.010
So they get led around by their nose is do this,
do this.

1801
01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.720
<v 2>Maybe she's just a kid and doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.</v>

1802
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:38.500
<v 3>I think that she's a little more mature than that because she gave some advice</v>

1803
01:42:38.501 --> 01:42:42.940
to,
um,
to a Justin Bieber when he stopped,
you know,
he started,

1804
01:42:42.941 --> 01:42:46.270
he's acting out a little bit and apparently she reached out to him and said,

1805
01:42:46.271 --> 01:42:49.600
look man,
take a breather.
Go ahead.
Go on the sidelines for a while.

1806
01:42:49.601 --> 01:42:53.110
I get your shit together because it's a long road.
Then she really,
yeah.

1807
01:42:53.111 --> 01:42:54.460
So I kind of respected that.

1808
01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.810
<v 2>The,
well,
maybe she's just,
you know,
it needs to mind her own business</v>

1809
01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:01.440
<v 3>matches</v>

1810
01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.310
<v 2>fucking walking around with a giant foam number one finger rubbing her ass</v>

1811
01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:10.110
against some guy's cock on TV.
We'll play this Joe lead please Jolie video.

1812
01:43:10.170 --> 01:43:14.460
Pull that,
pull that video up.
Miley Cyrus.
Joey's.
I'm like my,
this,

1813
01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.350
it's on my Twitter feed.

1814
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.530
<v 3>My first podcast of every year.
I make predictions for the following year 10.</v>

1815
01:43:21.531 --> 01:43:24.870
Yeah.
I say whether the Dow will be up or down shit.
Like,
oh,
all day.

1816
01:43:24.871 --> 01:43:27.640
You'd be the predictor in Karnak.
No,
I'm not good at it.

1817
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:32.590
And for three years straight I've predicted Miley Cyrus having some kind of a

1818
01:43:32.591 --> 01:43:35.890
drug blowout thing and the media and it hasn't quite happened yet,

1819
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:39.250
but it's getting there.
She smoked weed on some a watch,
right?

1820
01:43:39.251 --> 01:43:43.040
I'm talking about like some Brittany Spears Shit.
I keep predicting.
I don't

1821
01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.300
<v 2>think she's listened to this man.
Put it in the beginning.</v>

1822
01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.790
<v 9>This is fucking good man.
I like that video.
It's a nice,
that's a nice shot.</v>

1823
01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.820
No,
let me tell you something.

1824
01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:16.330
If you can separate her from all the controversy and just listen to this.

1825
01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.470
He didn't know anything about her Childhood Star Dad,
Billy Ray Cyrus.

1826
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.420
You'd be like,
that's a bad ass bitch.
Watch her.

1827
01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.140
Well cause she's got a husky strong voice.
She's a bad ass bitch dude.

1828
01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:39.430
She can do this.
I mean she does that Shit but she can do this.

1829
01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:42.150
<v 8>This smell is like more the spring</v>

1830
01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:47.380
be with you Jolie.

1831
01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:52.760
<v 9>Come on son.
That's undeniable.
That's,
that's raw talent.
Yeah,
no problem.</v>

1832
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:56.080
<v 3>I got no problem with his swinging around on a fucking ball half naked.</v>

1833
01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:56.914
She looks great.

1834
01:44:57.330 --> 01:45:00.310
How many years I spent sitting on the couch next to my kids watching Hannah

1835
01:45:00.311 --> 01:45:04.240
Montana.
I want to kill myself.
This is redemption.
Why did you watch it?

1836
01:45:04.330 --> 01:45:07.030
Cause like you know,
even you could leave the room.

1837
01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.700
<v 0>They're watching.
Do you have to be there?
I thought she was hot.
She was so young.</v>

1838
01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.760
I haven't these legal to say that.
No.

1839
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.180
Did you hear this fucking thing you're going to do in the UK where they're going

1840
01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:24.190
to actually like you're going to have to,
this is a proposal.

1841
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:26.860
You're going to have to request whether or not you get access to porn,

1842
01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:29.890
get to opt in.
What the fuck?
Really,

1843
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:33.120
really there.
How depressing is that?

1844
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:36.420
<v 3>It's the present.
Because you know we're headed towards is that uh,</v>

1845
01:45:36.421 --> 01:45:37.470
I forget what that act is,

1846
01:45:37.471 --> 01:45:42.471
where the government is going to be able to decide who gets a who is basically

1847
01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:47.050
some companies are going to get faster,
high speed Internet access than others.

1848
01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:52.340
That's what keeps coming up in Congress is the ability to control proceed and

1849
01:45:52.441 --> 01:45:55.260
control,
uh,
internet speed.
And so,
you know,

1850
01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:58.710
the Internet right now is free loose and you know,
democratic,

1851
01:45:59.070 --> 01:46:01.410
but over the next five,
10 years it's going to get,

1852
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:03.300
it's going to get bottleneck that you know,

1853
01:46:03.301 --> 01:46:06.960
the little sites that you want to get out.
Democracy now,
Shit like that.

1854
01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.420
Good luck to me.
You have a fucking dial up service.

1855
01:46:09.421 --> 01:46:12.450
Meanwhile Disney is going to be flowing through and high def.

1856
01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:15.670
<v 0>I'm not sure I agree with that.
I don't think that's,
no,
it's a real bill.
Yeah.</v>

1857
01:46:15.671 --> 01:46:17.710
But I don't think it's going to get through.
I mean even if it does get through,

1858
01:46:17.711 --> 01:46:20.980
I don't think it's going to stop a potential second internet or a third

1859
01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.680
interview.
I already have internet.
Right.

1860
01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.670
There's already a second one that I think they used for,

1861
01:46:24.671 --> 01:46:28.340
I think at universities and the military are,
so I'm using it right now.
Um,

1862
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.313
I don't know that.
Okay.

1863
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:31.160
<v 3>No.
When other countries are creating their own,</v>

1864
01:46:31.161 --> 01:46:34.010
they're calling an intranet like a down,
is it?

1865
01:46:34.011 --> 01:46:38.930
Brazil and France are talking about how they can have a national internet.

1866
01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:41.760
<v 0>Yeah,
we'll Brazil's reeling from the finding out.</v>

1867
01:46:41.761 --> 01:46:45.990
The NSA has been spying on them for all these years as is Germany as is a lot of

1868
01:46:45.991 --> 01:46:47.250
other cramps and France.

1869
01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.760
You know there's a recent article that I was reading about Microsoft coding

1870
01:46:52.921 --> 01:46:57.870
windows and coating their encryption to battle the NSA and I was like,

1871
01:46:57.910 --> 01:47:00.880
this is,
this is incredible.
Our own country,

1872
01:47:01.210 --> 01:47:03.030
I can't believe I'm reading this,

1873
01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:07.320
like why is Microsoft working for the terrorists or or the terrorist,

1874
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:09.420
the fucking government because something's wrong here.

1875
01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:14.540
When you got a company that's openly talking about working on their encryption

1876
01:47:14.671 --> 01:47:19.230
to keep the national security agency from peering into people's computers,

1877
01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:22.170
like what are we saying here?
What the fuck?

1878
01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:25.630
<v 3>It's not only that,
but it's not like Microsoft isn't already lobbying congress.</v>

1879
01:47:25.631 --> 01:47:29.800
It's not like they've got as much juice as any company in America and they still

1880
01:47:29.801 --> 01:47:32.350
have to build firewalls against the government.

1881
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:35.710
<v 0>I had a conversation this past week with a guy that I deeply respect.</v>

1882
01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:39.790
It was telling me that he thinks Edward Snowden's a trader and should be in jail

1883
01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.030
and he doesn't give a fuck if they're going to look into his emails because as

1884
01:47:43.031 --> 01:47:46.750
long as it prevents terrorism,
and I was,
I was like,
Oh wow,

1885
01:47:46.751 --> 01:47:48.310
look what's going on here.
I've been like,

1886
01:47:48.311 --> 01:47:50.890
can I come in your house and just fucking look around?
Well,
what kind of a,

1887
01:47:51.130 --> 01:47:53.200
I didn't understand the law,
the logic behind it.

1888
01:47:53.201 --> 01:47:55.930
Like who do you think these people are they daddy?

1889
01:47:56.290 --> 01:48:01.210
Are they these perfect egalitarian world leaders who are only,

1890
01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.660
they only think in,
in the most beautiful way possible.

1891
01:48:04.661 --> 01:48:07.570
They're there without ego or fear,
insecurity.

1892
01:48:07.571 --> 01:48:09.880
They make the right decisions every time.

1893
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:13.340
Are they that or are they just people with jobs that are able to peer in new

1894
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:14.800
email because it appears that it's that,

1895
01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:18.750
<v 3>well,
go back to Watergate.
I mean,
just the,
the little amount that they,</v>

1896
01:48:18.751 --> 01:48:23.700
you take a w this government now may not be threatening to you and the state of

1897
01:48:23.701 --> 01:48:26.790
the government may not be threatening.
The status quo is pretty safe right now.

1898
01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:30.840
We're ready.
Stocks are going up.
And,
uh,
there's no political prisoners,

1899
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:34.200
but that should change as fast as the tea party gets into office.

1900
01:48:34.201 --> 01:48:37.680
And the Christian right is indulged and they suddenly start saying,

1901
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.390
we want to go back and see who signed a petition for abortion rights.

1902
01:48:42.391 --> 01:48:44.130
Cause all sudden abortions are illegal.

1903
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:47.000
And they want to know who's going to be fighting against them and they're gonna

1904
01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.010
start accessing shit that it may not be now,

1905
01:48:50.011 --> 01:48:54.360
but in 10 years you're not going to want a digital history that's available to

1906
01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.280
anybody in the government that that's in power.

1907
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:58.800
<v 0>Well that's also one of the things that the NSA has been looking into.</v>

1908
01:48:58.801 --> 01:49:02.070
They've been looking into finding out people's porn history so that they could

1909
01:49:02.071 --> 01:49:05.170
use them to discredit opponents.
Of course,
because you know,

1910
01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:08.760
it was a lot of people out there that didn't a freaky shit.
Right.
And by the way,

1911
01:49:08.761 --> 01:49:12.380
if you look at porn these days,
you look at like go to one of those porn sites,

1912
01:49:12.381 --> 01:49:15.640
let's free porn sites and you enter that,
you click categories and you know,

1913
01:49:15.650 --> 01:49:20.310
like Jesus little wheezes.
It gets very specific.
Yes it does.

1914
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:21.480
And Weird Shit.
Like,

1915
01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:26.610
what have you found out that your congressman was only in the anal cream pies?
I,

1916
01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:30.360
how would you deal with that?
Like,
Hey,
that's on him.
That's all.

1917
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.680
But then you found out the other guy,

1918
01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.450
he just likes watching straight couples porn.
Hey,
Bob is one of us.

1919
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.130
He's a regular guy.
He wants to represent Minnesota and our quality healthy way.

1920
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.730
Sure he watches a little porn,
but who doesn't?

1921
01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.440
<v 3>But here's the kind of porn.
He was</v>

1922
01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.770
<v 0>watches guys and in fact,</v>

1923
01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:52.330
white guys and white girls missionary position,
look,

1924
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:56.290
their hands are interlocked.
Meanwhile,
his opponent,
Steve,

1925
01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:57.970
mostly tranny porn,

1926
01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.220
mostly anal cream pies in tranny porn.
He likes to see

1927
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:08.490
<v 3>the dripping juices of a man leaking out of it.
The booty of a man.
It's really,</v>

1928
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:09.240
um,

1929
01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:13.260
it's anybody's game and the future because we're leaving a fucking big footprint

1930
01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:17.010
and I don't know,
maybe we're being naive and living that way in the first place.

1931
01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:17.581
<v 0>Well,</v>

1932
01:50:17.581 --> 01:50:21.480
I think we should crack down on anyone who tries to control anything instantly.

1933
01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.180
I think we should boycott them.
I think we should rise up.

1934
01:50:24.181 --> 01:50:27.420
I think anytime you see anything where they're trying to control people and it's

1935
01:50:27.421 --> 01:50:30.660
not justified attack on the Internet,
it's,
yeah,

1936
01:50:30.661 --> 01:50:31.980
it's the only way it's gonna work out.

1937
01:50:31.981 --> 01:50:35.010
Like they have to realize that there's real repercussions for trying to control

1938
01:50:35.011 --> 01:50:37.920
people in that.
And you know,
and then there's,
there's also,

1939
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:41.970
there's things that I think that people do online because of anonymity and

1940
01:50:41.971 --> 01:50:46.020
because of the fact that this is a new thing to be able to interact with people

1941
01:50:46.021 --> 01:50:49.440
without any social repercussions,
without seeing their face when you insult them.

1942
01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.610
Because of that,
there's a lot of mean evil shit that goes down on the Internet.

1943
01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:56.280
And I agree that there's something gross about that.

1944
01:50:56.490 --> 01:51:00.780
And maybe there's some sort of a compromise in that regard where identities can

1945
01:51:00.781 --> 01:51:05.010
be exposed if someone turns out to be a real piece of shit online.
But

1946
01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:09.340
<v 3>I think they're doing youtube now.
I think you have to start your Facebook,
eh,</v>

1947
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:12.380
one of them.
You have to actually,
if you make comments,

1948
01:51:12.381 --> 01:51:14.720
your identity has to be searchable.

1949
01:51:15.190 --> 01:51:19.090
<v 0>Yeah.
Well Google is also being owned.
Our owns youtube now,
you know,</v>

1950
01:51:19.091 --> 01:51:22.680
so that's prowl owns youtube.
Yeah.
Shit.
Yeah.

1951
01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:25.000
So that's probably where that's coming from.
Wow.

1952
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:26.920
Well what do you think about the group anonymous?

1953
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:32.230
I think there's a real need for something,
whether it's an anonymous,

1954
01:51:32.231 --> 01:51:33.920
call it whatever you want to call it.
I like,

1955
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:36.490
I like the name of anonymous cause I like the principle behind it,

1956
01:51:36.491 --> 01:51:39.520
but I think they do a lot of good shit when things go bad.

1957
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.740
They did big chased after this girl,
they found this,

1958
01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:44.110
there was a video of this woman who was throwing puppies into the,

1959
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.710
into the water.
She was throwing them into a river and people were horrified.

1960
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:49.990
They went after that pitch.
Right.
And I think they should,

1961
01:51:49.991 --> 01:51:54.100
that's a sociopath is a person who's tossing puppies into a river.

1962
01:51:54.101 --> 01:51:57.190
Like that's fucked.
That's fucked to watch.
Yeah.

1963
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:59.410
I think in situations like that,

1964
01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:04.000
I think it's good to have a United front to have a bunch of people who recognize

1965
01:52:04.001 --> 01:52:06.670
a,
a,
a moral issue,

1966
01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.330
like something that's morally wrong and realize they can do something about it

1967
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:11.710
and they could bring in the law.

1968
01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:15.390
They could actually find someone and inform the on them,
you know?

1969
01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:17.620
<v 3>Yeah.
They're the renegade that,
you know,</v>

1970
01:52:17.621 --> 01:52:21.100
like the cop who can't get the criminal because of the rules and they can go

1971
01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:23.980
around it.
And then the obvious danger is,
well,
first of all,

1972
01:52:23.981 --> 01:52:28.060
anonymous is a loose network of people because by their very nature,

1973
01:52:28.061 --> 01:52:32.770
they don't know each other.
They just have certain ones they don't meet,

1974
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:34.810
they don't,
there's no website for them.

1975
01:52:34.811 --> 01:52:39.190
It's just people that have the capacity to get online and hack seem to have a

1976
01:52:39.191 --> 01:52:43.600
sensibility who called themselves anonymous of going after big business when

1977
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:46.340
they're divulging your information.
Um,

1978
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.800
sometimes even just showing the government where there's open,
yeah.

1979
01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.890
What'd you call him?
Portals into their systems.

1980
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:56.140
But the obvious danger is what if they just,

1981
01:52:56.580 --> 01:53:00.710
I don't like guys to,
uh,
you know,
talk about,

1982
01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:04.040
um,
equal rights.
They don't like,
you know,

1983
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:08.660
it's because they have no,
uh,
no.

1984
01:53:08.770 --> 01:53:12.740
Um,
accountability.
Who knows what their,
what their moral code is.

1985
01:53:13.410 --> 01:53:16.920
<v 2>Yeah.
Well there's,
there's also the fact that you can't have a group of people.</v>

1986
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:17.970
You can't,

1987
01:53:17.970 --> 01:53:20.840
you can't have a giant group of people because they act as a group done.

1988
01:53:21.190 --> 01:53:23.310
And people love groups.
They love being a part of groups.

1989
01:53:23.311 --> 01:53:27.570
They love acting as a group.
It's almost like it has to be,

1990
01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.860
it has to be a non group.
Right.
You know,

1991
01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:34.030
the moral outrage of people and like having things like,

1992
01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:39.180
it's almost like there should be a list of what companies should be avoided if

1993
01:53:39.181 --> 01:53:42.240
you,
uh,
don't want to support unethical practices.

1994
01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:46.780
<v 3>Yeah.
And by unethical,
what it should almost be more specific.</v>

1995
01:53:46.781 --> 01:53:51.520
Like if you go to,
uh,
there's certain website you can log in,

1996
01:53:51.970 --> 01:53:55.780
what are the issues that if 50 questions and it asks you certain issues,

1997
01:53:55.781 --> 01:54:00.250
where do you stand one to five strongly support this,
you know,
environmental or,

1998
01:54:00.251 --> 01:54:03.550
you know,
small government,
whatever your thing is.
And then by the end of it,

1999
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:08.790
they can then send you to a group that most represents your collective morality.

2000
01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:13.780
And then they will tell you what to boycott,

2001
01:54:13.781 --> 01:54:18.781
what not to boycott as opposed to being told by a certain news station,

2002
01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.480
uh,
you know,
uh,
think this way by this way,

2003
01:54:22.481 --> 01:54:27.070
because they're assuming that you all have the same set of beliefs that should

2004
01:54:27.071 --> 01:54:28.450
be more honed.

2005
01:54:28.810 --> 01:54:30.390
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a,
that's a,</v>

2006
01:54:31.090 --> 01:54:34.630
I think there's some value in doing something like that and trying to figure out

2007
01:54:34.631 --> 01:54:37.810
what people like and try to categorize people in certain ways.

2008
01:54:38.050 --> 01:54:39.430
But I think there's always the,
the,

2009
01:54:39.431 --> 01:54:44.320
the real issue with not being able to totally locked down a person's personality

2010
01:54:44.321 --> 01:54:47.530
just from a bunch of questions and it's so flat and one dimensional.
Right.

2011
01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:48.640
You know,

2012
01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.330
a person might fill out all the forms and pick out all the things that you agree

2013
01:54:52.331 --> 01:54:55.180
with,
then you meet them and their personality sucks.
Right,
right.
And you're like,

2014
01:54:55.181 --> 01:54:57.570
you're fucking annoying.
I'm not in a group of this asshole.

2015
01:54:57.710 --> 01:54:59.280
<v 3>Hey.
Yeah.
And it's like you said,</v>

2016
01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:02.760
a gone back when you were talking about people that will take a survey about

2017
01:55:02.761 --> 01:55:06.210
whether or not they think dinosaurs and people lived together like stupid people

2018
01:55:06.211 --> 01:55:08.340
take the survey.
Exactly.
And I mean,

2019
01:55:08.341 --> 01:55:12.360
you think of the fact that like Mitt Romney was neck and neck with Obama then

2020
01:55:12.361 --> 01:55:15.600
lost by 20%.
How the fuck did that happen?

2021
01:55:15.670 --> 01:55:19.210
<v 2>Yeah,
it was negative.
Well,
who knows what's real.
Yeah.</v>

2022
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:21.070
That's the other problem when it comes to votes.

2023
01:55:21.071 --> 01:55:24.160
Who knows what the fuck is going on when you're actually voting,

2024
01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:28.840
when you watch that HBO Hacking Democracy.
Oh yes.
A documentary now.

2025
01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:33.470
Oh my goodness.
It's all about the,
the,
the voting issue and the,
um,

2026
01:55:33.670 --> 01:55:36.920
the Bush election with Gore and uh,

2027
01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:38.980
how it's been proven that you can,

2028
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:42.190
not only can you manipulate the votes with those Diebold machines,

2029
01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:44.220
they since changed name Diebold because

2030
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.970
<v 0>of this documentary.
They changed their corporation named,</v>

2031
01:55:46.971 --> 01:55:48.810
they became something else.
Like,
let me,
let me,

2032
01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:51.470
<v 3>well,
the guy who was like one of the main sponsors from Florida,</v>

2033
01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:52.870
<v 0>the Bush campaign,</v>

2034
01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:56.590
and he made fucking machines that you could alter with a third party,

2035
01:55:57.070 --> 01:56:00.130
like a third party,
not the person counting the vote,
not the person voting,

2036
01:56:00.131 --> 01:56:04.750
but a third party can inject information and change the actual results of the

2037
01:56:04.751 --> 01:56:09.400
vote.
Right.
And no one did anything.
No one went to jail,
no one,
nothing happened.

2038
01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:12.550
This HBO thing came out and that that was the fucking end of it

2039
01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.820
<v 3>and they lost all the paperwork.
That company after the election,</v>

2040
01:56:15.821 --> 01:56:20.170
it was all carted off somehow in a rush and then went missing.

2041
01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:22.360
And the Al Franken wrote a whole book about it.

2042
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:25.460
<v 0>Yeah.
Diebold is changing its name.
That's what they,</v>

2043
01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:27.360
they changed it to what they call it now.

2044
01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:28.973
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2045
01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:33.360
<v 0>I have to go take a piss.
Can I go for a minute?
Yeah.</v>

2046
01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:35.673
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2047
01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.260
<v 0>Votings just like total bullshit Gregg.</v>

2048
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.470
<v 5>Yup.
Go ahead and pee.
Yeah.
I don't know.</v>

2049
01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.130
<v 0>I wished that I could believe 100% that your vote counted,</v>

2050
01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:53.230
but I hate the whole system when it comes to like electorial college and I hate

2051
01:56:53.231 --> 01:56:58.150
the whole idea of a representative and state representatives and that your,

2052
01:56:58.170 --> 01:57:01.750
your vote only really doesn't go towards like one person.

2053
01:57:01.751 --> 01:57:03.760
It doesn't really count towards who gets elected.

2054
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:07.690
It counts towards who gets elected as a representative and then how many

2055
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:12.670
electoral votes your state carries and how much weight your state carries in the

2056
01:57:12.671 --> 01:57:16.510
national election.
You see it all and it's like impossibly complicated.

2057
01:57:16.511 --> 01:57:19.150
And if you were a cynic,
which I guess I am in a lot of ways,

2058
01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.850
he would look at it and go,
this is designed for fuckery.

2059
01:57:22.210 --> 01:57:25.240
This is designed to make it so that they can manipulate it.

2060
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:28.540
It's ultimately no one,
no one is really,

2061
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:32.620
you don't really get one vote.
No one gets a vote on everything.

2062
01:57:32.650 --> 01:57:34.090
Everything's like that.
I look at taxes,

2063
01:57:34.091 --> 01:57:37.150
look how crazy confusing taxes already it didn't have normal person.

2064
01:57:37.151 --> 01:57:41.050
You get all these forms and all this like literature.
That makes no sense.

2065
01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:42.730
Let's not even half of it.
It's not even English,

2066
01:57:42.731 --> 01:57:46.390
it's like old English or something like counting English.
But it's like,

2067
01:57:46.391 --> 01:57:46.841
it's like,

2068
01:57:46.841 --> 01:57:49.600
it seems like there's a lot of things in the government that just need to be

2069
01:57:49.601 --> 01:57:52.900
rehauled you know,
updated like,
you know,
voting should be online,

2070
01:57:52.930 --> 01:57:56.320
like just like you say online,
uh,
using really high security,

2071
01:57:56.321 --> 01:57:59.590
which probably is possible.
You could probably do that.

2072
01:57:59.650 --> 01:58:02.560
You could definitely do that.
People that are cynics,
listen,

2073
01:58:02.710 --> 01:58:07.710
they bank billions and billions of dollars every day gets transferred online.

2074
01:58:07.930 --> 01:58:12.160
Banking online is a fact and yeah,
it gets manipulated.
Occasionally people,

2075
01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:13.660
People's credit cards get hacked,

2076
01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:18.940
but it's pretty God damn good banking online works.
You could vote online easily.

2077
01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:21.940
They don't want you to vote online because if you can vote online,

2078
01:58:21.941 --> 01:58:25.870
you will lose all the power.
If you actually,

2079
01:58:25.871 --> 01:58:30.040
if there's independent servers that get to dictate who gets elected for things,

2080
01:58:30.041 --> 01:58:34.150
Holy Shit.
Do you lose power?
And if it's not independent service,
why isn't it?

2081
01:58:34.450 --> 01:58:38.380
Why?
Why would you,
why would it be the government servers?
Well,
let's,
let's have,

2082
01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:41.260
let's have people chip in and know.

2083
01:58:41.261 --> 01:58:45.850
We'll create some sort of a coalition for fair voting and then we all vote

2084
01:58:45.851 --> 01:58:49.570
online.
So you'll have your regular election mean.
Let's just try it as a goof,

2085
01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:52.450
a Lark,
as you will for the first couple of years.

2086
01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:54.430
Let's not have our votes actually count,

2087
01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:58.780
but let's see what the people's vote actually is.
A test.
Yes.

2088
01:58:58.781 --> 01:59:01.000
And let's add that.
Let's make it real simple.

2089
01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:02.530
Put it on your Facebook when you log in.

2090
01:59:02.531 --> 01:59:05.440
Would you do us a favor here and just vote who you want for president?

2091
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:08.350
And if you want,
if you have time,
vote for some other shit too.

2092
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:12.100
And let's just find out what the fuck do we go through this sealed [inaudible]

2093
01:59:12.150 --> 01:59:13.480
and if we fail,
and by the way,

2094
01:59:13.481 --> 01:59:16.960
then we could also have an independent analysis of the actual numbers,

2095
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:20.260
the numbers of people voting 18 to 34 the numbers of people voting,
you know,

2096
01:59:20.261 --> 01:59:22.270
such and such and what incomes and what have you.

2097
01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:26.500
And it would be a hundred percent accurate and reliable because it would be

2098
01:59:26.501 --> 01:59:28.570
based on your Facebook or whatever,
you know,

2099
01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:31.540
I don't want to give Facebook a plug,
whatever,
whatever the fuck it is.

2100
01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:35.080
Google plus Twitter.
Yeah.
Twitter,
whatever it's based on,
uh,

2101
01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.270
as far as like your login,
you know how you do that?

2102
01:59:37.271 --> 01:59:39.880
Like you can log into websites through your Twitter and then you can actually

2103
01:59:39.881 --> 01:59:43.810
tweet like articles from that website.
That's how it should be.

2104
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:46.390
And if they can verify,
verify who you are,

2105
01:59:46.391 --> 01:59:49.870
verify your information like they can with Facebook and then your hour with

2106
01:59:49.871 --> 01:59:50.890
Twitter and then you're done.

2107
01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:55.250
<v 3>Right.
No,
I'm,
I'm with you 1000% on that.
And,
um,
you know,
uh,</v>

2108
01:59:55.300 --> 02:00:00.280
I've so God crushing that the Obamacare website was so bad because that,

2109
02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:04.170
that alone will stop that from happening for at least another five,
10.

2110
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:07.540
<v 0>I think it's silly to think it wouldn't be bad if it's made by the government</v>

2111
02:00:07.570 --> 02:00:11.050
and it's the first time website.
It's silly to think that that was good.
I mean,

2112
02:00:11.051 --> 02:00:14.980
I think that people's expectations with this being able to stand up to the

2113
02:00:14.981 --> 02:00:18.190
amount of traffic it was going to get ridiculous and it got more traffic than

2114
02:00:18.191 --> 02:00:20.920
they thought,
which is part of the problem.
Of course.
How would you know?

2115
02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:23.260
You can't know until you do it in like every website,

2116
02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:27.050
there's got to be a Beta period.
Most like big websites when they launched,

2117
02:00:27.051 --> 02:00:28.900
they launched in Beta first.
They check,
they check.

2118
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:30.100
But when you're the government,

2119
02:00:30.101 --> 02:00:31.840
they assume that you know what the fuck you're doing.

2120
02:00:31.841 --> 02:00:33.130
What's more evidence that they don't,

2121
02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:37.080
<v 3>they probably want it to get it out before the Supreme Court overturned it
again,</v>

2122
02:00:37.081 --> 02:00:37.900
somehow.

2123
02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:39.370
<v 0>I don't understand all this man.</v>

2124
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:42.050
I don't understand how something could be a law and you know all these people

2125
02:00:42.051 --> 02:00:44.260
were fighting against that law.
I don't send the,

2126
02:00:44.261 --> 02:00:47.320
I don't understand the arguments for it and I don't understand the arguments

2127
02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:51.610
against it.
I don't understand any arguments against giving people health care.

2128
02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.340
I think the ultimate goal for sure,

2129
02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.690
she'd be making sure that everyone is covered if they get injured or sick cause

2130
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:03.280
we all know that that is what sets poor people completely into a whole.

2131
02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.600
If you get injured at work,

2132
02:01:04.601 --> 02:01:07.900
if you get sick at work and you rely check to check and then all of a sudden

2133
02:01:07.901 --> 02:01:12.460
you're fucked and you're out of the hospital bills,
which can be astronomical.

2134
02:01:12.461 --> 02:01:15.610
The number one cause of bank or SMI and the country as medical bills.

2135
02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:18.820
I think anybody who doesn't think that people deserve healthcare,

2136
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:20.020
I think they're crazy.

2137
02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:23.260
I think we should have a national healthcare and I think it should be free.

2138
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:24.310
I don't think it should be,

2139
02:01:24.311 --> 02:01:27.040
the government has to force people to buy health care.

2140
02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.190
I don't think it should be that corporations are forced to pay for their

2141
02:01:30.191 --> 02:01:33.070
employees healthy.
I don't necessarily think it should be any of those things.

2142
02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:36.130
I think it should be a part of what our taxes go to.

2143
02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:38.200
I think it's better fucking street.
Yeah,

2144
02:01:38.230 --> 02:01:40.130
<v 3>cleaning and health coverage.
Yeah.</v>

2145
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:42.230
<v 0>Well you should be able to decide.
I mean,
look,</v>

2146
02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:45.830
if 48% if you make more than $250,000 a year,

2147
02:01:45.831 --> 02:01:49.340
you're in some 48% tax bracket or whatever the number is that has a lot of

2148
02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:50.300
goddamn money.

2149
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:54.170
And the idea that that doesn't come with a dental care program is fucking

2150
02:01:54.171 --> 02:01:55.430
ridiculous.
You know,

2151
02:01:55.431 --> 02:01:58.520
if you make quarter million dollars and you give $125,000 a year to the

2152
02:01:58.521 --> 02:02:00.380
government,
that's kind of crazy.

2153
02:02:00.590 --> 02:02:02.390
It's kind of crazy that you don't get health care.

2154
02:02:02.391 --> 02:02:06.610
Like what are you doing with all that money?
Like where's that going?
Yeah,

2155
02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:09.920
it's going to war.
You're right,
it is going to war.
And that's ridiculous.

2156
02:02:09.921 --> 02:02:12.680
And when you seen in in perspective like that,

2157
02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:16.370
I think that's one of the things that we're getting now that we never got
before.

2158
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.360
The actual numbers,
they always like $3 trillion deficit.

2159
02:02:20.361 --> 02:02:22.880
It always seemed insurmountable and crazy and weird.

2160
02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:26.930
But now because we're being hammered every day with information because of

2161
02:02:26.931 --> 02:02:30.140
independent news sites,
independent websites,
independent,

2162
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:33.170
like the young Turks and all these different independent news sources where

2163
02:02:33.171 --> 02:02:36.320
they'll show you with no bias with no they don't.

2164
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:39.020
They don't have anybody that's telling them what to say.

2165
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:43.670
This is just what their take on something is look at the numbers and they can go

2166
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:45.830
on and rant about it as long as they want.

2167
02:02:45.831 --> 02:02:47.300
And when that something like that happens,

2168
02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:52.010
those ideas spread out and they start launching and then people start tweeting

2169
02:02:52.011 --> 02:02:54.830
these ideas back and forth to each other.
So we start,

2170
02:02:54.831 --> 02:02:58.660
we're starting to scrutinize things like the budget and how much money goes to

2171
02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.020
things.
And this Obamacare thing is also forcing that argument in a lot of away.

2172
02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.930
<v 3>Yeah.
There's a lot of statistics like you know,</v>

2173
02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.200
first of all you have to attack the spin and if the right is trying to tell you

2174
02:03:08.201 --> 02:03:12.880
that small businesses are going to be crippled because of Obamacare or put out

2175
02:03:12.881 --> 02:03:16.180
of business,
well that's just not what the numbers say.

2176
02:03:16.181 --> 02:03:21.181
The numbers say that the percentage of businesses that fall underneath the

2177
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.100
Obamacare,
uh,
um,
uh,

2178
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.850
like there's a certain amount that it's just covered by medicare that's not

2179
02:03:27.851 --> 02:03:28.684
Obamacare.

2180
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:33.040
So that if you disqualify that and the amount of people that the companies that

2181
02:03:33.041 --> 02:03:37.830
are big enough that are required are ready to provide,
uh,
uh,
um,

2182
02:03:38.290 --> 02:03:39.910
medical coverage for their employees.

2183
02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:45.180
It's like half of 1% that would be affected businesses that have to take it on

2184
02:03:45.191 --> 02:03:48.040
that don't already take it on.
Really.
It's all big business.

2185
02:03:48.041 --> 02:03:51.730
Everything's big business.
And you know,
same thing with farms.

2186
02:03:51.731 --> 02:03:55.570
The whole thing about like these farm bills that go through,
it's all aggro.

2187
02:03:55.571 --> 02:03:57.520
It's not a already called big agro.

2188
02:03:57.521 --> 02:04:01.840
It's not like nobody's lewd know families are losing their farms.
It's,

2189
02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.750
<v 0>are you sure about this because I mean I've read a lot of things about families</v>

2190
02:04:05.751 --> 02:04:06.710
losing their farms

2191
02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:10.470
<v 3>now.
It's all hype.
What?
It's all hype.
I don't know about that.</v>

2192
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:13.080
Are you really sure about that?
If you look at the numbers,

2193
02:04:13.081 --> 02:04:17.370
the amount of farms that are actually lost,
there's breaks.
They,

2194
02:04:17.371 --> 02:04:20.910
there's so there's so much fucking money given out to farm sustainable business

2195
02:04:20.911 --> 02:04:21.730
as so many tax

2196
02:04:21.730 --> 02:04:24.590
<v 0>break,
large farms.
You're talking about corn farm subsidies.</v>

2197
02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:26.610
<v 3>Well,
they're all getting it.</v>

2198
02:04:26.611 --> 02:04:29.070
And the truth is a lot of them are making crops that we don't need.

2199
02:04:29.071 --> 02:04:32.310
We don't need as much soy and corn is,

2200
02:04:32.311 --> 02:04:36.540
we're making it depletes the soil.
There's no rotation and what we need,

2201
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:41.550
we need farms because they actually have some semblance of rotating crops and,

2202
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:46.170
um,
you know,
using the,
the cattle,
using the manure from the cat,

2203
02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:49.590
everything feeds each other as opposed to these big farms.

2204
02:04:49.591 --> 02:04:54.510
It's just like we can't sustain the,
the world on,
uh,
you know,

2205
02:04:54.630 --> 02:04:56.070
uh,
on beef.

2206
02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:59.490
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
there's also the issue with feeding cows beef,</v>

2207
02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:00.930
which is not a natural part of their dying.

2208
02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:02.790
Have you ever seen king corn the dark now?

2209
02:05:03.330 --> 02:05:08.280
Kevin Smith was on the podcast many years ago and um,
turned me onto it.

2210
02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:09.240
And it's a,

2211
02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:13.890
just all dictating how strong the corn industry is and how much money is

2212
02:05:13.891 --> 02:05:16.320
involved in making corn.
I mean,
it's,
it's,

2213
02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.830
it's crazy and it's a useless vegetable.
There's almost no nutrients in corn.

2214
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:23.010
Yeah.
It's not natural like for you to process it.
It doesn't,

2215
02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:27.240
your body doesn't like it.
It's why shit.
And corn is like always synonymous.

2216
02:05:27.241 --> 02:05:30.170
You know,
I'd eat the shit out of her corn.
Why are you seeing shit in our corner?

2217
02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.860
Right.
And not seeing Broccoli in there

2218
02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:35.840
<v 3>cause it has a very thick cell wall that doesn't break down.</v>

2219
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:36.890
And so what they did,

2220
02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:39.230
they made some kind of deal where they're making it into ethanol.

2221
02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:43.430
They put all this fucking corn into ethanol.
We don't need corn to put into gas.

2222
02:05:43.431 --> 02:05:45.740
That was like a thing in one year.
They said,
well,

2223
02:05:45.741 --> 02:05:48.710
we can always just fucking burn it up and put it into guests.
We don't,

2224
02:05:48.711 --> 02:05:53.150
we shouldn't be growing corn to do that.
So I mean,

2225
02:05:53.151 --> 02:05:56.940
I don't know a lot about it,
but I do know that I've read articles about,
um,

2226
02:05:57.020 --> 02:06:00.200
small farms being run out of business and they were all,

2227
02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:03.650
they've already been bought up by the big companies.

2228
02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:07.790
The ones that are left from my understanding,
are not going to be,
uh,

2229
02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:12.260
destroyed by
the government.

2230
02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:16.030
<v 0>Well I don't,
I don't know.
I don't have enough information to add to that,</v>

2231
02:06:16.031 --> 02:06:19.930
but I think it is bizarre that we're like as a practice feeding animals food

2232
02:06:19.931 --> 02:06:21.340
that's not supposed to be eaten.
Right.

2233
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:25.030
And there we have to force antibiotics and if you don't force feed them

2234
02:06:25.031 --> 02:06:27.310
antibiotics,
if they don't get antibiotics,

2235
02:06:27.311 --> 02:06:30.070
they develop all these lesions and their stomachs because their body doesn't

2236
02:06:30.071 --> 02:06:32.350
want to break down all this corn.
The grass eaters,

2237
02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:35.200
they're supposed to be grass eaters.
You ever have grass fed beef?

2238
02:06:35.201 --> 02:06:38.950
Do you buy grass fed beef?
No,
I buy it exclusively now.
It tastes better.

2239
02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:42.820
Where do you get at whole foods?
A lot of a organic grocery store.

2240
02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:46.150
Oh then I probably do eat sprouts.
No,
you got to ask for it.
Oh yeah.

2241
02:06:46.151 --> 02:06:47.500
Cause a lot of,
like even when I was at,

2242
02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:51.100
I was at whole foods and I was asking for it and the butcher was actually trying

2243
02:06:51.101 --> 02:06:54.280
to steer me towards um,
grass fed meat.
And he was like,

2244
02:06:54.281 --> 02:06:57.580
it's actually tastes here or try to steer me towards corn fed meat.

2245
02:06:57.970 --> 02:07:00.640
And he's like,
it's actually tastier is more marbling.
And I was like,
dude,

2246
02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:04.860
I know what I like.
I'd like to get that.
Please don't like you.

2247
02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:08.410
What are you saying?
Like you're telling me to eat something that's less healthy.

2248
02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:11.200
Like you're saying it's tastier.
I don't even agree.
I don't agree.

2249
02:07:11.201 --> 02:07:11.711
It's taste here.

2250
02:07:11.711 --> 02:07:14.740
It's a matter of choice and second of all it's been demonstrated that the shit

2251
02:07:14.741 --> 02:07:17.590
is not that good for you.
Like when you're eating corn fed beef,

2252
02:07:17.591 --> 02:07:20.630
you're eating a sick animal.
The reason why they're so fat and Marbley,

2253
02:07:20.770 --> 02:07:24.010
it's their fucking ready to die.
Like it's,
it's like a fucking,

2254
02:07:24.011 --> 02:07:26.290
it's like Rob Ford.
It's like if you ate the mayor of Toronto,

2255
02:07:26.710 --> 02:07:29.710
like he'd be a corn fed cow looking at me like I don't have the fuck.

2256
02:07:29.711 --> 02:07:33.930
Is that guy still alive?
Smoking crack and eating pussy there.

2257
02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:36.310
Charlie Sheen,
man,
if he came

2258
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:40.450
<v 6>to America he would be the King of Florida.
Fuck yeah.
If he just went to two.</v>

2259
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:44.560
If he just moved to America long enough where they trusted him and decided to

2260
02:07:44.561 --> 02:07:47.880
run for mayor of Florida,
he would be the king of Florida governor rather.

2261
02:07:48.850 --> 02:07:52.210
I think he got a reality show already and then he was such a fuck up.

2262
02:07:52.211 --> 02:07:56.560
They cancelled it after like one episode,
but that's the reality shell.

2263
02:07:56.561 --> 02:07:59.020
I want to watch.
The reality show is just the Internet.

2264
02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:04.060
You don't want an organize bullshit Beverly hills housewives version of that
guy.

2265
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:08.050
You want him doing impromptu live press conferences where he talks about a woman

2266
02:08:08.051 --> 02:08:11.530
accusing him of eating her pussy and says,
I have plenty to eat at home.

2267
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:12.970
So you see that?

2268
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.990
I wonder what his wife and his wife said about that because that's almost an

2269
02:08:16.991 --> 02:08:19.120
insult saying that there's probably said she pretty,

2270
02:08:19.121 --> 02:08:20.830
she probably said a ask him again.

2271
02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:24.550
I think we got some leftovers here at the house.
It doesn't sound like you.

2272
02:08:24.551 --> 02:08:25.510
She has a huge pussy.

2273
02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:28.870
He said he has plenty to eat at home now that he's not eating enough of it.

2274
02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:32.440
You know,
I think that,
uh,
cause I'm happily married and this is Toronto.

2275
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:36.380
This isn't some podunk town.
This is the biggest fucking city and right.

2276
02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:39.960
Biggest city in Canada by far.
Yeah.
It's an enormous city.
Yeah.

2277
02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:44.530
Massive metropolitan city because of Paul and very international and when my

2278
02:08:44.531 --> 02:08:46.920
favorite places to perform,
I love it.
Love to run it.

2279
02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:50.400
<v 9>Yeah.
I love this guy to listen to this.
Listen,
this press conference,</v>

2280
02:08:50.401 --> 02:08:53.580
I mean it's fucking fantastic.
He goes out there,

2281
02:08:53.581 --> 02:08:56.790
he's got a fucking Football Jersey on.
He's a thousand pounds overweight,

2282
02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:02.190
even beats Charlie sheen with overeating.
But he just talks,

2283
02:09:02.191 --> 02:09:06.120
they stick all the things that he's so relaxed and calm.
Comment yesterday.

2284
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:08.940
<v 6>Listen to all this.
Um,
what's going on?</v>

2285
02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:12.713
Why is that

2286
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.410
<v 11>documents that was released.
There we go.
Done.
Unfortunately.
Um,</v>

2287
02:09:18.850 --> 02:09:21.010
it's unfortunate to have to take the legal action.

2288
02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:26.770
I don't appreciate people call Atlanta a prostitute and never had a prostitute

2289
02:09:26.771 --> 02:09:30.100
here.
I'm very happily married at home.
Um,

2290
02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:33.170
this is very disturbing against,
um,

2291
02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:36.250
unfortunately I have to take legal action against sizes of grants and McGeorge

2292
02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:39.820
for stop lists and,
um,
mark Toohey,

2293
02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.750
I have to take legal action against the waiter that said I was doing lines.

2294
02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:49.380
Your market.
Don't wait.
The lies,
that is not true.
Um,
you know what?

2295
02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:51.590
It hurts my wife when,
uh,

2296
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.230
they're calling a friend of mine a prosecuted Atlanta is not a prostitute.

2297
02:09:56.350 --> 02:10:00.430
She's a friend.
And it makes me sick how people are saying this.

2298
02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:03.250
So unfortunately I have no other choice.

2299
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:08.200
I'm the last one to take legal action.
I can't,
I can't put up with it anymore.

2300
02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:12.910
So I've named the names,
um,
litigation.
We'll be starting shortly.
I've had enough.

2301
02:10:12.911 --> 02:10:15.970
That's why I warned you guys yesterday.
Be careful what you wrote.
Okay.

2302
02:10:15.971 --> 02:10:18.070
So that's all I have to save for now.

2303
02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:22.990
And the next thing I want to call a member Tanya at Hamilton and tell them that

2304
02:10:23.110 --> 02:10:25.760
we're going to have to spank the middle a tiger cats on.

2305
02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:30.070
The last thing was Olivia gone back.
Does it says that I wanted to eat her pussy?

2306
02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:33.160
They let,
he's gone nuts.
I've never said that in my life tour.

2307
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:34.040
I would never do that.

2308
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.530
<v 2>I'm happy married.
I've got more than enough to eat at home.</v>

2309
02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:42.160
<v 3>Unscripted nails,
every word of it.</v>

2310
02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.080
<v 2>And the best part about that video is after he leaves,
one of the reporters goes,</v>

2311
02:10:46.081 --> 02:10:49.650
I fucking love that guy.
Says it.

2312
02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:52.430
It's like finally something's happening

2313
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:54.120
<v 3>and he's naming names.
I mean,</v>

2314
02:10:54.121 --> 02:10:57.630
the first thing you learn is politician is keep it vague,
keep it general.

2315
02:10:57.631 --> 02:11:00.840
This guy's going like,
and Billy the waiter down there,
he said that

2316
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:04.970
<v 2>I was doing lines in the fucking waiter says,
you're doing lines.</v>

2317
02:11:04.971 --> 02:11:06.230
Most likely you're doing lines,

2318
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:10.040
especially if there's a video of you smoking crack.
Right.
He admits to that.
Yes.

2319
02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:12.470
He admits to the video of him smoking crack.
He's beautiful.

2320
02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:14.440
<v 3>He is a beautiful man.</v>

2321
02:11:14.490 --> 02:11:17.700
<v 2>Meanwhile,
by the way,
by the way,
he does good.</v>

2322
02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:20.670
<v 3>These Honami has gone through the roof with him as the mayor.</v>

2323
02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:24.720
She's not a bad man.
He's also a guy who came up through going to the projects,

2324
02:11:24.721 --> 02:11:28.140
helping out the working poor and you know,
being an inspiration.

2325
02:11:28.141 --> 02:11:32.370
I think he coaches a football team and the reason why he's an off his favorite

2326
02:11:32.371 --> 02:11:35.280
[inaudible] rating is not that fucking low considering.

2327
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:39.510
And it's because the poor people remember where this guy came from and he,

2328
02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:43.200
they know what he's done for them.
They'll overlook who gives a shit.

2329
02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:47.760
Nobody really should give a shit the crack.
Yeah.
The rest of it.
Who Cares?

2330
02:11:48.850 --> 02:11:50.680
<v 2>It's kind of funny that it's cracked too.</v>

2331
02:11:50.681 --> 02:11:54.010
It's like you went for the most ghetto of ghetto drugs and he did it with a

2332
02:11:54.011 --> 02:11:56.800
bunch of black people and they got videos of him.
I mean,

2333
02:11:56.801 --> 02:11:59.710
does he not know what a fucking cell phone is when they're holding a cell phone

2334
02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:03.310
in front of him?
Yeah.
Look at Mike Tyson.
Shit's the best part where he said,

2335
02:12:03.311 --> 02:12:07.060
he w he wants to fight Mike Tyson.
He's like,
I'll kill Mike Tyson.
And he said,
Oh,

2336
02:12:07.061 --> 02:12:11.250
you haven't seen that?
And that's the best one.
I've seen that.
Oh my God.
I,
I,

2337
02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:15.010
I've seen one where you challenged some guy too.
I'm an MMA fight.

2338
02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.940
Maybe that's it.
He challenged,
I've only watched like five seconds of it.

2339
02:12:18.941 --> 02:12:23.150
I was like,
this guy's crazy.
So I was like,
Jason Ellis,
he's amazing,
right?

2340
02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:27.970
<v 3>Well,
I mean,
we had Marion Barry,
but that guy was like,
not like this.</v>

2341
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.380
He didn't have the dimensions

2342
02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:33.140
<v 2>guy had.
He also does not have the ability to own it.</v>

2343
02:12:33.141 --> 02:12:37.210
Marion Barry lied about it at all.
Like we,
Marion Barry was on opiod.
Uh,

2344
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:41.410
and Anthony and I got to ask him some questions and uh,
I was a person.
Yes,

2345
02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:44.360
in person.
It's close as you are to me.
And I was like,

2346
02:12:44.361 --> 02:12:46.490
what about the crack thing when they caught you smoking crack?

2347
02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:49.340
Like I knew he only had like five minutes and I was like,

2348
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:52.670
I am going to ask this like right away.
Like you can't like beat around the bush.

2349
02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:55.430
He's in and out.
He's doing a bunch of different reviews.
I go,

2350
02:12:55.431 --> 02:12:57.680
what was that about?
What was going on there?
He goes,
they,

2351
02:12:57.770 --> 02:13:01.760
they did not know whether or not what I had was crack.
Okay.

2352
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:05.660
What they have is a video.
Me Smoking.
I go,
but what was it?
Was it crack?

2353
02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:09.770
Like wouldn't,
wouldn't answer.
It wouldn't say,
listen man,

2354
02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:13.020
I got a little crazy.
I fucked up.
I smoked a little crack.
That's what

2355
02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:15.600
<v 3>it should never said</v>

2356
02:13:17.170 --> 02:13:20.480
<v 2>I did lines.
That's an outright lie.
It's an insult.</v>

2357
02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:23.930
My friend is not a prostitute.
As soon as you have to see,

2358
02:13:23.931 --> 02:13:25.100
your friend is not a prostitute

2359
02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:27.720
<v 3>twice man by name.</v>

2360
02:13:27.850 --> 02:13:31.980
<v 2>Oh cool.
Yeah,
I've got to that fucking guy.</v>

2361
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.170
<v 10>I'm telling you.
First degree murder,
Mike Tyson,</v>

2362
02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:46.330
he has this series walking around.

2363
02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:50.700
It was fucking scared.
I need fucking

2364
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:55.080
10 minutes out.

2365
02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:02.370
Absolutely fuck around me.
Like my brothers are adults telling me you were liars.

2366
02:14:03.010 --> 02:14:05.250
These hurts or it's

2367
02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:11.490
his fucking daddy.
Oh my God,
he's coked up.
Oh,

2368
02:14:11.491 --> 02:14:12.780
how come I haven't seen this?

2369
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:20.350
Everyone in the room and he keeps on saying brother like Hulk Hogan.

2370
02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:24.470
No fucking interference.
Brother can find wins.

2371
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:28.930
I will fucking donate.
It gives up rows

2372
02:14:32.290 --> 02:14:33.420
15 minutes

2373
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:38.630
to do it for five.
No,
no,
no,
no.

2374
02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.560
<v 0>Okay.
Now because of this video,</v>

2375
02:14:45.561 --> 02:14:47.540
I'm on the side of the people trying to get him out of office.

2376
02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.010
<v 3>Wow.</v>

2377
02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:51.130
<v 0>Because that video officially think he's out of control.</v>

2378
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:52.840
I didn't think he was out of control before.

2379
02:14:52.841 --> 02:14:54.160
I thought he was just being silly man.

2380
02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:57.680
<v 3>Somebody from Toronto that I know says actually he knows that this drug dealer</v>

2381
02:14:57.681 --> 02:15:02.510
that's friends with him and that's he not calling into the podcast on now.

2382
02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:05.840
I think they already have talked to drug dealers and I think this is like known

2383
02:15:05.841 --> 02:15:07.390
in Canada that like this is just ridic.

2384
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:10.190
<v 0>The problem is a fat guy that dom is dangerous.</v>

2385
02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.420
Like thinking he can actually beat up Mike Tyson and then it only needs this 15

2386
02:15:14.421 --> 02:15:18.200
minutes and I'll have him down,
rip his eyes out like,
oh,
okay,

2387
02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:22.670
you're too stupid.
You're like delusional.

2388
02:15:22.671 --> 02:15:23.900
That's why you're so confident now.

2389
02:15:23.901 --> 02:15:26.260
I understand because that's the dumbest shit ever.

2390
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:30.350
<v 3>Veronica.
Most politicians,
the mood,
like the decisions they make in their lives,</v>

2391
02:15:30.351 --> 02:15:34.130
that fucking balls that they just cheating while in office.

2392
02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:36.440
When you think that everything's being examined,

2393
02:15:36.441 --> 02:15:39.040
this camera's on the all the time and you're going to fucking cheat and you

2394
02:15:39.041 --> 02:15:40.250
think you're not going to get caught.

2395
02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:43.520
<v 0>I think they've always done it.
I think guys like,
like the,
the,</v>

2396
02:15:43.570 --> 02:15:47.480
the Clinton types are the JFK types that,
you know,
have this like lust for it.

2397
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:50.660
I think it's always been what they got away with.
It's always been a part of it.

2398
02:15:50.661 --> 02:15:52.820
Someone's always swept it under the rug and so they,

2399
02:15:52.821 --> 02:15:55.850
they've always kept going and like they like it so much they don't want to stop.

2400
02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.350
<v 3>They liked the power of it,
but no one's ever been like,
no,
that's crazy.</v>

2401
02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:05.260
Yeah.
Well,
the guy down in San Diego gave us a pretty good run.
Right.

2402
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:10.240
He was liberal like dozens of Leche lecturers.
Yeah.

2403
02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:11.250
He was a latch.

2404
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:15.600
<v 0>Yeah.
That guy was,
uh,
he's,
he's been sued by a gang of them too.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

2405
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:19.670
<v 3>Yeah.
What's so sad about him is he didn't even get any pussy.</v>

2406
02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:24.320
I think he was just grabbing acids.
So amateur,
it's eighth grade.

2407
02:16:24.430 --> 02:16:27.130
<v 0>Let's seeing that guy say that he would beat up Tyson.
He's like,</v>

2408
02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:31.000
do you have any idea how fun that would fight?
That fight would be for Tyson.

2409
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.450
Tyson would literally right now you can wake them up and tell him he has to

2410
02:16:34.451 --> 02:16:36.190
fight this guy.
It can be taken a nap.

2411
02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:39.760
And he would get in there and he'd be laughing the whole time.
Like laughing,

2412
02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:41.950
like,
oh,
come on big guy.
You're going to kill me.

2413
02:16:42.170 --> 02:16:44.860
Going to put my eyes out when you going through,
he gonna hold me down.

2414
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:47.080
What's going to happen here?
You're going to rip my throat out.

2415
02:16:48.510 --> 02:16:51.070
Well to me from my provision,
that's a ludicrous,

2416
02:16:51.071 --> 02:16:54.070
but I'm willing to engage you in this contest that she,
so Juan,

2417
02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:58.330
if you thought Jews have the dude chasing him around party hard,

2418
02:16:58.331 --> 02:17:03.190
like that's a great shirt.
Where can I buy that?
Uh,
please tell me it's for sale.

2419
02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:08.180
<v 6>It is Andrew Wk is rob Ford parties.
Andrew Wk is that,</v>

2420
02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.810
it's the guy.
It's about saying you're a millionaire before Christmas.

2421
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:12.610
<v 0>I'm buying one.
I'm going to buy one right now.</v>

2422
02:17:12.611 --> 02:17:15.670
Party hard with blood pouring out of his nose.
I fucking love it.

2423
02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:18.790
<v 6>It's on Andrew's official party store.
If you want to make some money,</v>

2424
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:21.220
promote the fight Tyson versus him.

2425
02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:22.173
<v 0>No,</v>

2426
02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:26.150
he got to give him cook first and then you've got to have like 10 dudes outside

2427
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:30.310
the ring at all corners with the,
the,
the fucking defibrillators.

2428
02:17:30.311 --> 02:17:32.850
Just ready to go.
No,
that guy is going to have a heart attack.

2429
02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.250
Like you see him pacing.
Like how does a fat guy,

2430
02:17:36.251 --> 02:17:40.690
that old Duke coke like that's fucking dangerous.
Cold said Dude.

2431
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.393
How old's Rob Ford?

2432
02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:44.170
<v 6>I think he's four.</v>

2433
02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.500
He looks older than 54 I can remember being on being on a coke Jag and pacing

2434
02:17:49.501 --> 02:17:51.840
like that.
I'm saying Shit like I'm a bad mother.

2435
02:17:51.841 --> 02:17:55.890
Felt like I remember being in that space.
Okay,
let me stop you.
You were 19 right?

2436
02:17:56.070 --> 02:18:00.510
Big Fuck right,
right.
44 44 44 Jesus Christ.

2437
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:01.630
It looks like shit.
Yeah,

2438
02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:07.410
he's deep in his 15 so what happens to rob forward over the next year?

2439
02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:08.593
Well,
at

2440
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:10.480
<v 0>different,
yeah,
most likely.
Right.</v>

2441
02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:14.470
But Canada is different when it comes to their ability to get people out of

2442
02:18:14.471 --> 02:18:15.040
office.

2443
02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.550
You can't just pull something out of office for conduct if they don't violate

2444
02:18:18.551 --> 02:18:23.170
any of the state laws.
If they don't get in trouble,
steal money.

2445
02:18:23.290 --> 02:18:26.500
It's like a lot of things that you have to have done to get them out of office.

2446
02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:29.710
So right now they're just sort of taking away his power.

2447
02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:33.270
They're just slowly but surely making him a puppet mayor.

2448
02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:34.600
They were moving his power.

2449
02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:39.810
So that gets weird because then you're sort of like crippling your own sort of

2450
02:18:40.091 --> 02:18:44.020
economy and you're,
you're crippling your own government.
Like,
I don't know.

2451
02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:47.540
<v 6>No.
The idea is that most people would quit,
but this guy's not</v>

2452
02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:49.600
<v 0>so I gotta quit.
He'll never quit.
He's suing them.</v>

2453
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:51.490
He's going to sue them to keep his job,

2454
02:18:51.491 --> 02:18:55.270
but they should show that video and then have an expert come in and you're like

2455
02:18:55.271 --> 02:18:56.021
a teddy atlas.

2456
02:18:56.021 --> 02:19:00.070
And explain what would happen if Mike Tyson and him got into an actual ring

2457
02:19:00.071 --> 02:19:00.904
together.

2458
02:19:01.330 --> 02:19:06.100
Does this make sense or would you categorize a person that's 44 years old?

2459
02:19:06.101 --> 02:19:08.680
It looks like there's 60 that's clearly coked out of their mind.

2460
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:11.070
It looks like they ate a beach ball.
Do you,

2461
02:19:11.350 --> 02:19:16.350
would you categorize that as delusional to the utmost?

2462
02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:20.380
Bring in Dr drew.
You'd have to just bring in a few fight experts,

2463
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:24.940
just bringing the Teddy Atlas and Jim Lampley and have them describe and then

2464
02:19:24.941 --> 02:19:27.800
have Mike Tyson and then tell him the theory,
Lee.
He said,

2465
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.780
<v 6>yeah,
have him laugh and slap it.
You know,</v>

2466
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:32.450
it was a great show that I wished was still on.

2467
02:19:32.451 --> 02:19:36.230
Was that a celebrity death match where you could put rob for it in the,

2468
02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:41.090
in the ring with Tyson and chainsaws and shit?
That was fucking great.

2469
02:19:41.091 --> 02:19:44.960
What happened to that show?
I think they tried to bring it back a few years ago,

2470
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:48.530
but,
uh,
I was working on a show and they were doing it in the next studio,

2471
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:50.330
but I obviously didn't go,

2472
02:19:50.390 --> 02:19:52.670
<v 0>why am they had a celebrity MMA show?</v>

2473
02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:56.150
Like w I would thought that someone like Fox would have tried to do that
already.

2474
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.871
They had slept.

2475
02:19:56.871 --> 02:20:01.490
Remember how that celebrity boxing like scratch from saved by the bell and Todd

2476
02:20:01.491 --> 02:20:05.300
bridges was on it probably for that reason.
I think it did well

2477
02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:09.280
<v 6>select.
I mean they've got that die.
If you can get celebrities to dive in,</v>

2478
02:20:09.281 --> 02:20:13.600
bathing suits on TV,
mixed martial arts,
fuck diving,

2479
02:20:13.601 --> 02:20:14.650
you think it would be better?

2480
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:19.910
I just think in terms of being exposed and embarrassed on TV diving and you

2481
02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:21.910
think it's embarrassing and we have to earn your bathing suit.
Oh,

2482
02:20:21.911 --> 02:20:25.740
you're hilarious.
More than getting the fuck.
I don't like my body though,

2483
02:20:27.610 --> 02:20:31.760
<v 0>Dude.
I would relish the opportunity to show you my package.
Excellent.</v>

2484
02:20:31.761 --> 02:20:36.650
Top where the board,
he would go over to swan dive.

2485
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:40.220
Uh,
I don't think people would find that so gross.

2486
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:43.560
I think fighting is be way more embarrassing guys.
Get the fuck beat out.
Yeah.

2487
02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:48.000
<v 6>Yeah.
I guess the ultimate,
it's the ultimate loss of dignity for a man on TV.</v>

2488
02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:51.370
<v 0>Yeah.
There was,
uh,
a lot of those,</v>

2489
02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:55.240
those ones where it was really sad.
What do you,
what are you putting on here?

2490
02:20:55.570 --> 02:20:59.710
<v 6>The diving.
Typing.
Shit I'll do,
we had to wait a minute.
There's a show.
Oh,</v>

2491
02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:03.340
I'm not kidding you.
It's called splash or something.
Oh,
wait,

2492
02:21:03.341 --> 02:21:05.910
him and that's doing it died.

2493
02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:16.580
Why is that chewy from the Chelsea handler show

2494
02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:21.760
<v 0>this room making that noise?
Or was that video?
Oh God.
We had listened to him.</v>

2495
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:26.160
<v 6>It was a,
yeah.
Chewy from um,
uh,</v>

2496
02:21:26.370 --> 02:21:28.470
Chelsea Chelsea handler.
I forget who else.

2497
02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:31.050
I think it's a decent name and they dive in the water,

2498
02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:34.200
but he's wearing Ryan boy Tana life jacket.
It's not even showing his body.

2499
02:21:34.201 --> 02:21:35.710
I know.
I think it,
yeah,
that's it.

2500
02:21:35.711 --> 02:21:37.560
That was his thing is he wasn't going to show his body.

2501
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:39.980
Other people are just wearing bathing suits.
Oh,

2502
02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:44.920
<v 0>so some people,
hmm.
He would do it if he's wearing a leopard,
essentially.</v>

2503
02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:49.130
Uh,
an outfit.
He's wearing a crazy,
oh,
it's not a,
okay,
wait a minute.

2504
02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:52.780
That's just his body.
That's not a life vest.
That's just his,

2505
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:57.610
<v 6>yeah,
like somebody not a one piece bathing suits.
Oh my God.</v>

2506
02:21:57.611 --> 02:22:01.130
That's horrifying.
He cries a lot on the show.
What's,
well,

2507
02:22:01.131 --> 02:22:04.870
it's more than like a couple of seconds and it's a whole show.
Oh,
it's a series.

2508
02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:08.500
Oh,
can't be,
it's a series called splash.
It's a reality show.

2509
02:22:08.501 --> 02:22:12.550
They get voted off standard.
Right,
right.

2510
02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:15.160
Every time I try to think of a joke for a reality show,

2511
02:22:15.161 --> 02:22:16.900
I find out that there actually was one.

2512
02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:21.040
I thought of this thing about what if like it was a illegal immigrants competing

2513
02:22:21.041 --> 02:22:25.980
for green card.
It already happened.
Oh yeah,
that's,
that's already happened.
Right?

2514
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:30.840
<v 2>What was that on?
Probably Fox.
No,
I forget.
I forget</v>

2515
02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:37.530
in a skin tight,
wet suit.
Why?

2516
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:41.920
Why shouldn't a wetsuit?
Maybe they all do.
Where

2517
02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:48.030
Chewy,
you guys got injured on that show.
On the typing.

2518
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:51.240
So where is it and where's it?

2519
02:22:51.241 --> 02:22:55.210
And Greg says the host of fear factor.
That's it started

2520
02:22:57.090 --> 02:23:00.800
without a fucking hint of irony.
Radicular ridiculous

2521
02:23:02.730 --> 02:23:05.520
hunger games,
man.
Hunger Games.
Yeah,
maybe.
Right.

2522
02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:09.270
Well that's what everyone's always said about the fall of humanity is that if

2523
02:23:09.271 --> 02:23:12.510
you look at the Roman Empire,
for example,

2524
02:23:12.511 --> 02:23:16.770
or look back at all the various empires that have fallen before they fell,

2525
02:23:16.771 --> 02:23:20.700
they were filled with great access and ridiculous wealth and you know,
fat.

2526
02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:25.530
And although vomitorium is a misnomer,
you know what the vomitorium is,

2527
02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:29.340
it's actually the,
the shape of these arenas.

2528
02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:33.300
Like it's about how they,
the people spill out into the arena.
Oh,

2529
02:23:33.301 --> 02:23:38.160
there wasn't a bathroom?
No,
no,
no,
no.
That does not what vomitorium means.
Got It.

2530
02:23:38.370 --> 02:23:41.550
I think people just heard that and sort of,
it might have happened.

2531
02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:45.540
Most likely it did that people threw up on purpose in order to keep eating.
Sure.

2532
02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:49.080
But it wasn't like there was the name of an arena.
They would go on,
throw up

2533
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:51.230
<v 3>vomitorium that's a good name.</v>

2534
02:23:51.231 --> 02:23:55.460
Somebody should come up if you're putting one in Dallas and new MMA ring called

2535
02:23:55.461 --> 02:23:56.600
the vomitorium.

2536
02:23:56.980 --> 02:24:01.300
<v 2>Yeah.
I think it's,
um,
it's just the way it's designed to make,
uh,</v>

2537
02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:05.320
make them flow,
uh,
the audience flow.
Yeah.
You know,

2538
02:24:05.321 --> 02:24:09.610
like when they're being seated in shit.
Yeah.
It's a,
but it's been sort of,
uh,

2539
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:13.030
over the years it's been turned into some,
you know,

2540
02:24:13.031 --> 02:24:15.520
it's one of those things where you're sitting around with your friends,
you know,

2541
02:24:15.521 --> 02:24:18.100
they used to have this thing called the vomitorium where everybody was forced to

2542
02:24:18.101 --> 02:24:20.080
throw up and I'm like,
Whoa,
really?

2543
02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:24.670
It actually is where big crowds can exit rapidly at the end of it performance.

2544
02:24:24.671 --> 02:24:26.680
It's like a,
an entrance like this is,

2545
02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:31.700
<v 3>you can just be vomited out of that Obama.
Right?
Yeah.</v>

2546
02:24:31.701 --> 02:24:36.170
I think that of course under,
I think that that kind of,
uh,
access,

2547
02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:38.630
we're definitely there were there,
you know what I mean?

2548
02:24:38.631 --> 02:24:43.631
Brian was just talking about how he can command his playstation four to go to

2549
02:24:44.001 --> 02:24:44.900
comedy central.

2550
02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:48.830
Like the idea that having a remote in your hand and using your thumb,

2551
02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:54.340
there were scientists and engineers that worked for years to come up with this.

2552
02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:57.110
Meanwhile,
like we're talking about trying to,
you know,

2553
02:24:57.111 --> 02:25:01.580
change agriculture to feed poor people in Third World nations.
That's getting,

2554
02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:03.670
yeah,
we gave 100,000 led.

2555
02:25:03.730 --> 02:25:06.560
The U s government gave 100,000 for research on that last year.

2556
02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:09.300
<v 2>Yeah.
But I don't think that's like a fall of humanity type thing.</v>

2557
02:25:09.570 --> 02:25:14.340
I think that's just a technology making lives simpler and making things more and

2558
02:25:14.341 --> 02:25:17.970
more accessible and more and more complex.
I think that's inevitable.

2559
02:25:18.090 --> 02:25:21.780
But I think when you see in things like this or when you see things like fear

2560
02:25:21.781 --> 02:25:23.980
factor,
we see things like where people are.

2561
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.250
<v 0>Look,
I mean there's a certain aspect of that to mixed martial arts as well.</v>

2562
02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:29.500
There's a lot of people that look at mixed martial arts and they say,

2563
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:32.800
even though I look at it very differently because I'm deeply involved in it,

2564
02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:36.520
and to me it looks like the most intense form of competition and the the

2565
02:25:36.521 --> 02:25:39.480
greatest challenge and a way where people find out what they're made of.

2566
02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:42.520
They find out what their character,
what lies inside their,
their,

2567
02:25:42.521 --> 02:25:44.860
their will and their courage and their physical abilities.

2568
02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:48.790
But some people look at it like it might as well be gladiators.
I mean,

2569
02:25:48.791 --> 02:25:52.210
these people are there.
They're doing that for the pleasure of the audience.

2570
02:25:52.211 --> 02:25:54.970
We screams and booze and turns their thumb down.
I mean,

2571
02:25:55.420 --> 02:26:00.420
it's these ideas that when your civilization gets to a low point is when war

2572
02:26:01.961 --> 02:26:06.710
becomes much more accepted.
People just randomly,
you know,
except or,

2573
02:26:06.711 --> 02:26:11.230
or easily accept rather that we have to kill certain amounts of people and then

2574
02:26:11.231 --> 02:26:14.860
easily accept that sometimes entertainment is this,
you know,

2575
02:26:14.861 --> 02:26:17.230
this is kind of a crazy chaos,

2576
02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:20.360
<v 3>right?
Well it's,
it's being distanced from like drones.</v>

2577
02:26:20.361 --> 02:26:22.160
When you think about the idea,
I mean,

2578
02:26:22.161 --> 02:26:26.450
I dunno what percentage of Americans think that drones are fine is,

2579
02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:28.970
I don't know what the number is,
but it's way higher than it should.

2580
02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:30.580
<v 0>There's friend,
my friend who were,</v>

2581
02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:32.830
I was talking to this week and those words disappointed it didn't care about the

2582
02:26:32.831 --> 02:26:35.200
NSA was also talking about how great drones are.

2583
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:40.110
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean you're talking about the execution of people that don't have a it,</v>

2584
02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:43.800
we're not at war with them.
They're not the enemy and they're not.
I mean,

2585
02:26:43.801 --> 02:26:46.650
technically these are,
you know,
people in different countries,

2586
02:26:46.651 --> 02:26:51.600
there's no war against them and they're being tried and executed on the spot,

2587
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:55.470
not even by a human being.
And we're sitting at home going like,
well,

2588
02:26:55.471 --> 02:26:58.560
that's good because we don't put a,
we're not putting American soldiers at harm.

2589
02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:00.240
Yeah,
but we're putting our nation.

2590
02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:03.630
How would you feel a fucking robot showed up in your country and started killing

2591
02:27:03.631 --> 02:27:05.310
your people?
Chinese robots.

2592
02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:10.420
Do you think that would start to get people rallied to go attack the United

2593
02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:13.670
States?
I mean,
it's going to cost us lives one way or the other.

2594
02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:15.580
<v 0>They're not surgical,
you know?</v>

2595
02:27:15.581 --> 02:27:18.700
And he was talking about surgical strikes like drones doing surgical strike them

2596
02:27:18.701 --> 02:27:20.500
all four.
I'm like,
do you understand the numbers?

2597
02:27:20.501 --> 02:27:22.990
Like if you ever read the numbers,
like even the good spin on the,

2598
02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:27.100
the numbers show shocking amounts of civilian casualties.
Weddings,

2599
02:27:27.130 --> 02:27:30.700
the good spins.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's bad.
It's bad stuff,
right?

2600
02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:33.340
A lot of innocent people,
a lot of accidents,

2601
02:27:33.341 --> 02:27:36.310
a lot of people mistaken for the rent,
for the enemy that weren't the enemy.

2602
02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:39.950
There's a lot of bad shit that happens when you shoot rockets from flying space.

2603
02:27:39.951 --> 02:27:40.690
Ships

2604
02:27:40.690 --> 02:27:44.910
<v 3>now are desensitized to that being an actual killing of a human being because</v>

2605
02:27:44.911 --> 02:27:46.470
it's in another country and,

2606
02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:49.230
and for the most part people see the whole Middle East is our enemy.

2607
02:27:49.310 --> 02:27:52.490
<v 0>I feel like it could get to a point where it could be real and effective.</v>

2608
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:56.000
I can get to a point where they can have something that's like the size of a

2609
02:27:56.001 --> 02:28:01.001
bird that can fly across the world and literally is attracted to the DNA of the

2610
02:28:01.461 --> 02:28:02.660
greatest terrorist on earth,

2611
02:28:02.661 --> 02:28:06.230
finds him and shoots one through his heart and there's nothing he can do to stop

2612
02:28:06.231 --> 02:28:07.280
that.
That's surgical.

2613
02:28:07.310 --> 02:28:10.250
And I'm so I would support the fuck out of something like that.
No Sir.

2614
02:28:10.310 --> 02:28:11.450
Soldiers have to be involved.

2615
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:14.940
You take a crazy radical and extremist who's a a warmonger.

2616
02:28:14.941 --> 02:28:18.080
He take them one of these,
you know,
death to the Great Satan guys.

2617
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:19.350
Take them off the face of the planet.

2618
02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:23.120
We don't have to worry about planes flying buildings anymore.
I get that,

2619
02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:25.620
but that's not what we're dealing with.
We're dealing with some,

2620
02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:29.000
some thing that's not ready yet.
It's like using windows 90 yeah.

2621
02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:32.790
<v 3>You just said planes running into buildings and you're talking about sending
out,</v>

2622
02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:37.410
you know,
and that way sort of those are drones.
If you can get a person to do it.

2623
02:28:37.411 --> 02:28:37.820
Sure.

2624
02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:41.460
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's very similar,
but those people died,
you know?</v>

2625
02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:43.910
That's the thing.
People are like,
we got to take revenge.
Well,

2626
02:28:43.911 --> 02:28:46.580
the people that actually did that are dead.
They were on a plane.

2627
02:28:46.581 --> 02:28:47.600
They flew up to see they died.

2628
02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:48.960
<v 3>Yeah.
There's something,</v>

2629
02:28:48.961 --> 02:28:52.950
there's an investment on that end that I believe in this cause enough that I

2630
02:28:52.951 --> 02:28:56.070
will put my life on the line to carry out this killing.

2631
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:59.830
<v 0>And that sounds like you're very pro nine 11 and it was supporting the
terrorist.</v>

2632
02:28:59.831 --> 02:29:02.560
Greg,
it sounds like you're,
you're one of them.

2633
02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:04.610
You're either with us or you would.

2634
02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:06.910
<v 3>Then I support nine 10 and let me explain.</v>

2635
02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:13.470
<v 0>I know what you're saying.
You know,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't respect it.</v>

2636
02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:15.180
I think it's a fucking horrible decision,

2637
02:29:15.390 --> 02:29:17.640
but it's a much bolder move is what you're saying.

2638
02:29:17.970 --> 02:29:20.610
Then then being a guy with a remote control,

2639
02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:24.840
<v 3>well,
you know,
look,
we're the ones that we invented guerrilla warfare here.</v>

2640
02:29:24.841 --> 02:29:28.500
I mean the revolutionary war,
not us,
but our,
our four founders,

2641
02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:32.490
the fine man that hid behind bushes and shot the stupid British as they walked

2642
02:29:32.491 --> 02:29:35.180
in red coats and snare drums up the street.
You know,

2643
02:29:35.190 --> 02:29:38.070
we were the first ones to fucking try it out.
Well,
not really.

2644
02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:41.380
We were just the first ones to do it in the Western world.
He did it well.
Yeah.

2645
02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:45.990
<v 0>The Mongols had done it much better.
Right?
Thousand years before,
you know,</v>

2646
02:29:45.991 --> 02:29:49.390
close to 800 years before whatever the fuck it was.
The,

2647
02:29:49.450 --> 02:29:53.730
the idea that these dummies would wear these fucking white and red suits with a

2648
02:29:53.731 --> 02:29:55.440
big cross.
We were supposed to shoot

2649
02:29:55.860 --> 02:29:57.370
<v 3>guys got a teapot behind them.</v>

2650
02:29:57.990 --> 02:30:01.810
<v 0>Hard.
It was the idea of this proper way to do war boy.</v>

2651
02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:03.190
What a stupid idea.

2652
02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:05.660
<v 3>But I mean,
it goes to what we're talking about right now.</v>

2653
02:30:05.661 --> 02:30:09.740
Is it proper to send a drone in or not?
Maybe I am backward by saying like,

2654
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:10.461
this is the,

2655
02:30:10.461 --> 02:30:15.461
just the next step in military action is to not involve human beings and by me

2656
02:30:15.621 --> 02:30:16.371
saying,
well,

2657
02:30:16.371 --> 02:30:19.280
you should have to have a human being killing a human being to make it morally

2658
02:30:19.281 --> 02:30:22.790
right.
Maybe that's naive.
I mean obviously like you said,
if we can,

2659
02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:24.980
if we can target somebody specifically,

2660
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:27.260
then there's no doubt that that's the way to go.

2661
02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:30.650
But I think the further you are physically from the enemy,

2662
02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:35.090
the further you are emotionally and easier it is to objectify that person

2663
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.920
without giving them due process.

2664
02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.900
<v 0>It comes right back to youtube comments.
It's the same thing,
right?</v>

2665
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:44.610
Using a drone and commenting on youtube and being a con kind of the same thing.

2666
02:30:44.611 --> 02:30:45.900
You don't have to feel the repercussions.

2667
02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:50.100
You don't have to be there and actual shoot the baby in the face because the

2668
02:30:50.101 --> 02:30:51.900
baby is standing in front of the terrorist.

2669
02:30:52.170 --> 02:30:56.100
You don't have to be there and blow the building up and watch the children crawl

2670
02:30:56.101 --> 02:30:59.790
out with no legs.
Right.
You don't have to be there,
but that happens.

2671
02:31:00.060 --> 02:31:02.380
It happens whether you like it or not.
There's plenty of videos,

2672
02:31:02.381 --> 02:31:06.570
there's plenty of photographs is plenty of real disturbing evidence that people

2673
02:31:06.571 --> 02:31:07.890
that were fucked up by drones.

2674
02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:09.160
<v 3>Well,
I'll look at Vietnam.</v>

2675
02:31:09.161 --> 02:31:12.550
The war ended because we had news coverage of it for the first time.

2676
02:31:12.551 --> 02:31:16.930
We actually had cameras photographing napalm and you know,
children being,

2677
02:31:16.931 --> 02:31:21.140
you know,
burned in their homes and all of a sudden there was an outcry that,
uh,

2678
02:31:21.180 --> 02:31:24.420
hey,
this is wrong.
We shouldn't be doing this.
It would have gone on a lot longer.

2679
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:28.880
<v 0>And that is absolutely why George Bush wouldn't let people photograph coffins</v>

2680
02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:33.890
during the Iraq war.
They put the actually stopped information,

2681
02:31:34.310 --> 02:31:37.100
they stopped photograph.
You could take photographs of the war,

2682
02:31:37.310 --> 02:31:40.790
but only favorable photograph.
You couldn't show anybody wounded.

2683
02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:43.130
You couldn't show anybody that was doing anything fucked up.

2684
02:31:43.310 --> 02:31:46.760
And you couldn't show any bodies that were,
you know,
being shipped back home.

2685
02:31:46.761 --> 02:31:51.140
Two mothers and fathers realized that here's where your children die.

2686
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:54.800
Your children died for a lie.
Right?
It shows you,
oh,
weapons of mass destruction.

2687
02:31:56.270 --> 02:32:00.020
We thought they were here,
but let's keep sending your kids over.
Yeah.

2688
02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:04.600
<v 3>And then,
and then,
yeah,
the,
the only reporters were embedded,
embedded like you,</v>

2689
02:32:04.610 --> 02:32:08.570
here's your fucking tour guide.
He's going to show you what we want you to see.

2690
02:32:08.810 --> 02:32:10.880
And there's no report is just like in Vietnam,

2691
02:32:10.881 --> 02:32:13.070
they were staying in a hotel downtown,

2692
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:16.310
wandering around and looking at whatever they want,
shooting whatever they want.

2693
02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:20.840
And I think they still had to encrypt and send stuff back because they were

2694
02:32:20.841 --> 02:32:22.860
trying to stop it.
Uh,
they,

2695
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:25.670
they were going through stuff that was being mailed back.

2696
02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:27.380
You gotta remember there's no fucking Internet back then.

2697
02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:30.470
They were sending hard pictures back to,
you know,

2698
02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:33.860
the Washington Post or wherever and the,
those packages were being looked at.

2699
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:38.270
So they started taking,
um,
the,
um,
negatives and putting them,

2700
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:40.470
hiding them inside of other stuff and shipping them back.

2701
02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:46.650
<v 0>Wow.
That's their way of encrypting.
That's fascinating.
Wow.</v>

2702
02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:47.633
That's nuts.

2703
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:52.970
<v 3>Yeah.
So it's,
it's,
I mean,
what is the moral,
where is that,</v>

2704
02:32:52.971 --> 02:32:56.060
what's the high watermark on when,
when you can take a human life,
first of all,

2705
02:32:56.210 --> 02:32:59.180
you have to declare war.
I think it's pretty senseless that we can,

2706
02:32:59.390 --> 02:33:03.560
that you can continue to kill people without a trial and another country without

2707
02:33:03.561 --> 02:33:05.510
declaring war on that place.
You have to,

2708
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:08.990
there has to be an investment that that causes accountability.

2709
02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:13.310
<v 0>Yeah,
they're really does.
There has to be an investment.
Yeah,
that's a,</v>

2710
02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:16.970
that's a really good way to put it and know they're also,
you know,

2711
02:33:16.971 --> 02:33:21.530
there's this reality of detachment that it's sort of contrary to the very idea

2712
02:33:21.531 --> 02:33:23.750
of technology in the first place.
What's what,

2713
02:33:23.751 --> 02:33:28.520
what's fascinating about technology and ultimately enriching about technology is

2714
02:33:28.521 --> 02:33:32.270
a connection thing.
It's not a detachment thing.
So this is almost like,

2715
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:36.230
like a preliminary stage before it's done.
Right?

2716
02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:39.880
Sorta like the model t sucks for racing.
He tried,

2717
02:33:39.881 --> 02:33:41.630
tried to take a model t out on a race course.

2718
02:33:41.631 --> 02:33:44.480
It's a fucking disaster thing will fly off the side of the road.

2719
02:33:44.481 --> 02:33:45.320
The first turn you hit.

2720
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:49.910
Then they figured out somewhere along the line how to make a corvette and then

2721
02:33:49.911 --> 02:33:53.690
all of a sudden it's hugging and Graham blom blom going around corners or like,

2722
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:56.360
oh,
they got it better.
Right.
I figured it out.
They got it better.

2723
02:33:56.540 --> 02:34:01.340
And that's where we're at when it comes to this with the benefits of this kind

2724
02:34:01.341 --> 02:34:04.640
of technology.
I think ultimately the benefits of this technology,

2725
02:34:04.641 --> 02:34:07.700
if you look at the trends,
the trends being that it's,

2726
02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:12.170
it dissolves the boundaries between people and information that's got to make

2727
02:34:12.171 --> 02:34:15.710
more accountability and that's gotta make people more aware of their actions.

2728
02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:17.920
Ultimately it's just not there yet.

2729
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.880
And so when you have technology that's being used to do the exact opposite
thing,

2730
02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:26.470
like a youtube comment or a drone,
like something where you're not,
there's,

2731
02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:29.710
there's,
there's a disconnect.
If fact you fat can't kill yourself,

2732
02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:33.220
clicks and walk out of the house had no repercussions whatsoever.

2733
02:34:33.310 --> 02:34:34.240
Wave to your neighbor,

2734
02:34:34.241 --> 02:34:38.700
pretend you're a nice guy and no one knows cause you're 69 POC and you to

2735
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:41.880
whatever fuck it is.
Yeah.
There's the,
that's,

2736
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:44.020
that's like that can't keep going on.

2737
02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:47.410
It's contrary to the very benefit of the technology itself.

2738
02:34:47.470 --> 02:34:49.890
<v 3>It's the KKK online.
Yeah.</v>

2739
02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:53.740
And it's also putting a fucking mask over your hand instead of having the balls

2740
02:34:53.741 --> 02:34:54.290
to,

2741
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:57.800
<v 0>yeah,
it is in a lot of ways.
Yeah.
And it's also,
it's like,</v>

2742
02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:01.130
you know it ain't right.
You know,
it's like you're getting away with it.

2743
02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:02.800
You getting away with it because it's open,
right.

2744
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:05.900
It's like people that have gotten away with various loopholes that have existed

2745
02:35:05.901 --> 02:35:08.870
throughout time that don't exist anymore.
People found holes through it.

2746
02:35:08.871 --> 02:35:11.300
They got away with it and now you can't do it anymore.

2747
02:35:11.450 --> 02:35:14.390
You used to be able to compete in the Olympics while you're on steroids and then

2748
02:35:14.391 --> 02:35:16.520
someone said,
hey,
why did these women look like men?

2749
02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:21.590
What the fuck is going on and why are their world records still being held
today?

2750
02:35:21.591 --> 02:35:23.900
Do you know that like the eastern bloc women,

2751
02:35:23.930 --> 02:35:26.480
they did a lot of track and field records.
It's still can't be broken.

2752
02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:27.810
<v 3>No asterisk on that.</v>

2753
02:35:29.770 --> 02:35:32.860
<v 0>With most of the people that are involved in sports science,</v>

2754
02:35:33.130 --> 02:35:36.910
there's a lot of asterix,
but we had Victor Conte on the podcast.

2755
02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:39.850
He was the guy from [inaudible].
Do you know what that is?
The Guy,

2756
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:44.910
he's the guy who provided all the various untraceable steroids to all these

2757
02:35:45.011 --> 02:35:49.090
professional athletes.
And then it became a big scandal and he actually went up,

2758
02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:52.730
wind up going to jail.
But uh,
he's now a car.

2759
02:35:52.770 --> 02:35:56.950
A guy who openly criticized is like all the various people that are doing

2760
02:35:56.951 --> 02:36:00.820
steroids and shows how they're getting away with it and tries to,
you know,

2761
02:36:00.821 --> 02:36:02.440
clean up sports and a lot of ways.

2762
02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:04.090
But one of the things that he pointed out was it,

2763
02:36:04.091 --> 02:36:08.080
this world records that women made that women can't even touch today.

2764
02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:13.620
They can't,
they just can't because they can't be on Anna drawl 60 and

2765
02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.920
<v 3>whatever the fuck that,</v>

2766
02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:18.200
I mean I always think about it like I'm not a jock and I don't like jocks in

2767
02:36:18.201 --> 02:36:22.490
general.
Yeah.
I feel,
I feel like athletes are,
you know,

2768
02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:25.250
they're supposed to do the best they can do,

2769
02:36:25.251 --> 02:36:28.440
whether it's exercise and nutrition or training.
And if,

2770
02:36:28.490 --> 02:36:32.060
I mean you've talked about how there's certain steroids that are not bad for
you,

2771
02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:35.840
so shouldn't it just be a part of the sport getting better?

2772
02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:37.670
<v 0>Well,
here's an argument.</v>

2773
02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:43.030
One of the arguments is that in order to be to really do your best as a mixed

2774
02:36:43.791 --> 02:36:48.410
martial artist,
it's very much like in order to do your best as a cyclist,

2775
02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:53.750
you almost can't do it without some form of help.

2776
02:36:53.930 --> 02:36:57.470
And then the question becomes,
well what is that form of health?
Well,

2777
02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:01.550
the form of health was some athletes can be really good nutrition,

2778
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:04.920
really good supplementation that's legal and uh,

2779
02:37:04.970 --> 02:37:08.540
going to a very good sports doctor who can monitor your blood and make sure

2780
02:37:08.541 --> 02:37:09.860
you're getting the proper nutrients.

2781
02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:13.970
But if you try to do that on the average diet that like a poor person's on,

2782
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:17.330
most likely you're going to short.
Of course there's exceptions to the rule.

2783
02:37:17.331 --> 02:37:18.530
Does genetic specimens,

2784
02:37:18.531 --> 02:37:22.310
they can eat cheeseburgers and I can run five hours a day and not never have a

2785
02:37:22.311 --> 02:37:24.470
problem.
There's people are not created equal

2786
02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:26.570
<v 3>when it comes to keeping it accessible to every</v>

2787
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:28.360
<v 0>well it's that,
I mean it's,</v>

2788
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:33.080
but I've heard it argued that took tour de France privy example,

2789
02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:38.230
you literally cannot do it correctly unless you're on drugs.

2790
02:37:38.810 --> 02:37:40.410
That in order to do,

2791
02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:43.910
to compete at the world championship levels that we saw Lance Armstrong reach

2792
02:37:43.911 --> 02:37:46.400
and all these other people reach you,

2793
02:37:46.430 --> 02:37:51.430
your body is actually healthier if you're taking drugs that you have to dope

2794
02:37:51.501 --> 02:37:52.280
your blood,

2795
02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:55.850
you had to do it without the EPO and the testosterone without adding to your

2796
02:37:55.851 --> 02:37:56.390
system.

2797
02:37:56.390 --> 02:38:00.950
You're putting a great strain on your system in a point where it might not

2798
02:38:00.951 --> 02:38:04.460
really be able to do that.
You might read line your whole shit and break it.

2799
02:38:05.550 --> 02:38:08.430
<v 3>So,
but for people to be able to get into the Tour de France that don't have</v>

2800
02:38:08.431 --> 02:38:12.630
sponsors and don't have a,
you know,
an an arsenal of money from past wins,

2801
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:15.540
how do they get to that level to compete?

2802
02:38:16.170 --> 02:38:16.321
<v 0>Well,</v>

2803
02:38:16.321 --> 02:38:20.910
it becomes a problem because there's certain things like endurance athletics or

2804
02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.810
are real.
It's a real issue.
The threshold you endurance threshold.

2805
02:38:25.050 --> 02:38:29.040
Some people are born with a higher endurance threshold and there's nothing you

2806
02:38:29.041 --> 02:38:31.080
can do about that.
They have larger hearts.
They've,

2807
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:34.980
they processed blood more easily.
Whatever the fuck it is,
whatever it is,

2808
02:38:35.310 --> 02:38:36.720
all people are not created equal.

2809
02:38:36.721 --> 02:38:39.720
Just like some people don't have a big juicy Dick like yours.
Oh my God,

2810
02:38:39.721 --> 02:38:41.430
I just went to the bathroom and enjoyed it again.

2811
02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:44.880
So a regular person with a regular deck has to just deal with that in life.

2812
02:38:44.881 --> 02:38:48.150
Just like a regular person doesn't have the lungs of a guy like King Velasquez.

2813
02:38:48.210 --> 02:38:51.720
Cain,
Alaska is who's the UFC heavyweight champion.
They did his vo Max.

2814
02:38:51.721 --> 02:38:55.200
They tested it.
It's like fucking high level triathlete.
He know.

2815
02:38:55.201 --> 02:38:58.890
He's Kinda like a 38 beat per minute heart rate.
I mean,
he's a freak.

2816
02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:00.480
<v 3>Great.
So then how do you feel about it?</v>

2817
02:39:00.481 --> 02:39:05.100
Do you think there should be absolutely no,
uh,
steroids and drugs?

2818
02:39:05.101 --> 02:39:09.120
No Blood doping or you think that with the Tour de France it's okay,

2819
02:39:09.121 --> 02:39:10.440
but not with mixed martial arts.

2820
02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:15.520
<v 0>I think that it becomes a real issue with mixed martial arts because it's not</v>

2821
02:39:15.521 --> 02:39:18.070
just about winning a race.
It's about beating the fuck out of someone.

2822
02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:21.640
And if a guy takes something that's illegal and because of that is able to

2823
02:39:21.641 --> 02:39:25.990
perform much better and much longer and do more damage to his opponent,

2824
02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:30.100
I'm against it.
I'm against it.
But I'm also against,

2825
02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:31.450
this is where it gets really tricky.

2826
02:39:31.451 --> 02:39:35.080
There's a thing they're doing called testosterone use exemptions where they're

2827
02:39:35.081 --> 02:39:39.130
giving people medically approved testosterone injections that are competing.

2828
02:39:39.610 --> 02:39:44.110
I'm against that.
I'm against that for two reasons.
One,
because,
um,

2829
02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:46.810
I've talked to a,
this guy,
a Dr. Mark Gordon,

2830
02:39:46.811 --> 02:39:51.400
who's a traumatic brain injury specialist and he specializes in helping people

2831
02:39:51.401 --> 02:39:56.320
with Tbi and um,
and,
and helping them recover from brain injuries.

2832
02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:00.610
And one of the things that's damaged in brain injuries is your endocrine system,

2833
02:40:00.611 --> 02:40:04.420
your pituitary gland stops producing testosterone correctly and he can fuck with

2834
02:40:04.421 --> 02:40:07.450
your hormonal balance.
That can happen with bad concussions.

2835
02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:09.850
So then the question becomes,

2836
02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:14.880
if someone is 30 years old or even younger and medical testosterone because

2837
02:40:14.881 --> 02:40:18.270
they've taken too many blows to the head,
should they be allowed to fight?

2838
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:23.340
That becomes a real issue is are we just sort of putting a bandaid on a much

2839
02:40:23.341 --> 02:40:26.210
greater threat to this person's health that

2840
02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:28.790
<v 3>like that might be nature's way of saying,
stop fighting,</v>

2841
02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:33.640
<v 0>dude,
I watched videos today.
You know,
and I don't talk about this too much.
Uh,</v>

2842
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:37.100
because um,
I really didn't fight that long.
I mean,

2843
02:40:37.101 --> 02:40:38.620
I fought a lot when I was a kid,

2844
02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:42.550
but I didn't really take too many blows to the head until I started kickboxing.

2845
02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.800
Kickboxing was much more,
I,

2846
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:48.550
I definitely got hit in the head many times as a young man training and
sparring,

2847
02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.880
but the kickboxing was much more brutal and I used to have pretty significant

2848
02:40:55.241 --> 02:40:57.190
headaches when I would lie in bed at night.

2849
02:40:57.191 --> 02:41:01.630
And it was one of the main reasons why I was pretty desperate to stop doing it.

2850
02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:04.930
I was pretty desperate to like make this choice between standup comedy and

2851
02:41:04.931 --> 02:41:09.010
fighting and ultimately fighting one out or comedy rather one out without any

2852
02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:10.270
debate whatsoever.

2853
02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:15.280
But the idea that I was ruining my brain was really fucking scary to me.

2854
02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:18.220
And then you got the,
also the idea that those shots that I took to the head,

2855
02:41:18.490 --> 02:41:19.840
which was,
you know,
many,
many,

2856
02:41:19.841 --> 02:41:23.370
many rounds of sparring with guys who are better than boxers in me,

2857
02:41:23.371 --> 02:41:27.250
many jabs to the face.
Many times my dome got jolted with head kicks,

2858
02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:28.690
all that shit was going on.

2859
02:41:29.290 --> 02:41:33.130
But nothing compared to what these professionals have to deal with.

2860
02:41:33.140 --> 02:41:34.900
And for 10 years and for yeah,

2861
02:41:34.930 --> 02:41:38.500
and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of documented shots to the head in

2862
02:41:38.501 --> 02:41:41.530
competition.
Forget about what's going on in training.
You know,

2863
02:41:41.531 --> 02:41:46.390
I only had three fights as a kickboxer,
as a taekwondo,
taekwondo,
tournament's,

2864
02:41:46.391 --> 02:41:49.450
and karate terms.
I had,
it might have been a hundred,

2865
02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:52.510
it was probably way over 50 I don't know how many times I competed,

2866
02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:55.330
but that was over a course of like six years.

2867
02:41:55.660 --> 02:42:00.130
But for kickboxing it was just three.
And those three were rough,
you know,

2868
02:42:00.131 --> 02:42:03.670
it was the,
the,
those,
those,
that feeling of getting,
you know,

2869
02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:07.840
fucking punched in the face and seeing stars that has not good for you.

2870
02:42:08.370 --> 02:42:11.700
<v 3>But so there was a part of you that just knew with common sense,</v>

2871
02:42:11.701 --> 02:42:15.240
like your body was saying you should not continue to do this,

2872
02:42:15.241 --> 02:42:17.580
but there's guys that somehow don't have that,

2873
02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.350
that governor and their head that says move away from,

2874
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:25.350
<v 0>it's not just that it's trainers,
trainers want,
like I came,</v>

2875
02:42:25.390 --> 02:42:28.920
the guy that I was training with and the gym that I was training with when I was

2876
02:42:28.921 --> 02:42:33.420
learning how to box,
it was a very blood and guts,
Boston gym.

2877
02:42:33.630 --> 02:42:38.250
I mean these are the guy who was the head coach was a fucking savage and he grew

2878
02:42:38.251 --> 02:42:41.340
up with savages and when guys got knocked down in the gym,

2879
02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:44.610
they dusted those motherfuckers back off and throw them right back in the ring

2880
02:42:44.611 --> 02:42:48.630
again.
And I saw it over and over again.
Guys got slammed on the Chin there,

2881
02:42:48.631 --> 02:42:49.470
legs gave out.

2882
02:42:49.471 --> 02:42:52.800
They fall flat on their back and then five minutes later they're sparring again.

2883
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:56.820
You're not supposed to do.
You're just not,
not only not supposed to do that.

2884
02:42:56.880 --> 02:43:01.380
You're not supposed to spar for months after that.
Not Five minutes later,

2885
02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:04.860
not even five days later.
It's supposed to be a long time off.

2886
02:43:04.861 --> 02:43:07.790
We give your brain a chance to heal like some shit went down.

2887
02:43:08.010 --> 02:43:09.590
<v 3>Did they know that shit back then?
Okay.
Oh</v>

2888
02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:11.260
<v 0>No.
That's the problem.
They didn't know.</v>

2889
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:15.940
But now we could to see like real up close first of all now because of the

2890
02:43:15.941 --> 02:43:18.850
Internet,
because of Twitter and Facebook and the like.

2891
02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.190
People will share articles with each other.

2892
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:25.420
Like I get way more information now than I've ever gotten in my life and now

2893
02:43:25.421 --> 02:43:28.000
being in the position where I am as a,
as an MMA commentator,

2894
02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:31.540
people are always sending me things on the dangers of traumatic brain injury,

2895
02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:34.390
whether it's MMA or football or even soccer man.

2896
02:43:34.570 --> 02:43:37.540
A lot of dudes in more concussions in soccer than football.

2897
02:43:37.690 --> 02:43:42.040
Well not just concussions,
just heading the ball.
It's not concussions.

2898
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:44.910
It's the problem.
It's,
it's also the,
the,

2899
02:43:44.911 --> 02:43:47.910
the slightly less than concussive impact.
Yeah.

2900
02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:51.850
The ones that don't give you a concussion,
but just thumps to the head,

2901
02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:54.880
the jarring of your brain.
They're all bad.

2902
02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:56.390
<v 3>Yeah.
I played soccer yesterday.</v>

2903
02:43:56.450 --> 02:43:58.970
Every thanksgiving I put together this soccer game for everybody in our

2904
02:43:58.971 --> 02:43:59.750
neighborhood.

2905
02:43:59.750 --> 02:44:04.750
And it's like yesterday we had 18 on 18 giant field and Vantis and uh,

2906
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:08.450
so it's like a lot of kids.
And it started out when we started out,

2907
02:44:08.451 --> 02:44:11.720
the kids were little and we used to split off into an adult game and a kids
game.

2908
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:15.140
And as the adults have gotten older,
all our kids have been in club soccer,

2909
02:44:15.141 --> 02:44:16.280
getting better and better.

2910
02:44:16.460 --> 02:44:20.000
And now it's really getting to the point where they're as good as we are.

2911
02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:24.320
So my son is in the corner.
My,
my son is a captain of his club soccer team.

2912
02:44:24.321 --> 02:44:28.130
They were undefeated this year.
He's got a fucking strong leg,
kicks,

2913
02:44:28.131 --> 02:44:30.950
a corner kick at me.
I'm in front of the goal.
And I mean,

2914
02:44:30.951 --> 02:44:34.900
the thing has got a beeline from a head,
this screams fucking goal.

2915
02:44:34.901 --> 02:44:38.690
And all I gotta do is,
but it's coming to my head.
Come in my head last second.

2916
02:44:38.691 --> 02:44:43.100
I fucking duct 10 kids started laughing at me for like a minute.
I was like,

2917
02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:47.510
something in my head went,
no,
you did.
This is not a good,

2918
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:53.680
that's called smarts.
I signed,
gave me so much shit.
Well,

2919
02:44:53.810 --> 02:44:55.520
he's wrong and you're right.

2920
02:44:55.850 --> 02:44:59.900
You should want to kick your dad the head with a ball.
That's shit's ridiculous.

2921
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:01.360
Well,
one,

2922
02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:03.010
<v 0>well,
I wanted to bring the subjects I was watching,</v>

2923
02:45:03.011 --> 02:45:06.260
so I spent some time today going over these videos.
I'm,

2924
02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:08.900
one of them is Meldrick Taylor.
Do you remember Meldrick Taylor?
Yeah,

2925
02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:09.950
Olympic gold medalists.

2926
02:45:09.951 --> 02:45:12.250
One of the greatest boxers to ever come out of the amateur system.

2927
02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:13.360
Amazing fighter.

2928
02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.040
But I want you to pull up Meldrick Taylor now and then go to the,

2929
02:45:17.041 --> 02:45:19.180
the first video that pops up on Youtube.

2930
02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.790
Meldrick Taylor fought Julio Cesar Chavez,

2931
02:45:21.791 --> 02:45:23.920
like one of the greatest Mexican boxers of all time,

2932
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:25.430
and they had this incredible war,

2933
02:45:25.570 --> 02:45:30.370
fucking 12 round war where Chavez knocked him down like the last few seconds of

2934
02:45:30.371 --> 02:45:32.710
the fight and they stopped the fight.
He was winning the fight.

2935
02:45:32.711 --> 02:45:35.410
Up until that moment Chavez has got to him,
but it was a brutal,

2936
02:45:35.411 --> 02:45:39.220
brutal beating that he took.
And now when you talked to him,
he's younger than me.

2937
02:45:39.250 --> 02:45:42.130
Listen to him talk.
She's interviewing him.

2938
02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:50.350
<v 3>As soon as Brian,
he can barely even hear him all fucked up,</v>

2939
02:45:50.510 --> 02:45:54.140
<v 0>Brian.
I don't know what's going on here.
How about you turned the volume up,</v>

2940
02:45:57.870 --> 02:46:00.720
put out the volume on youtube.
What about of the volume on the input?

2941
02:46:02.310 --> 02:46:03.160
I'll figure it out.
Okay.

2942
02:46:04.270 --> 02:46:06.810
<v 3>Well it's like with Mohammed Ali,
I mean,
no,
no,
no,</v>

2943
02:46:06.810 --> 02:46:11.240
<v 0>no.
This is way different because he's way,
yeah,
this guy's way,
way younger.</v>

2944
02:46:11.310 --> 02:46:15.180
<v 3>No,
but I think with Molly though,
the mainstream,
and I'm not a huge boxing fan,</v>

2945
02:46:15.181 --> 02:46:19.170
but I saw it and you just go like,
wow,
this is fucking sad.

2946
02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:20.400
This leads to this.

2947
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:23.390
<v 0>Well,
and it does,
by the way,
Terry Norris also has it.</v>

2948
02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:27.390
Who's another great champion from the 90s and Terry Norris a,
there's a,

2949
02:46:27.391 --> 02:46:31.320
a thing that he put out a video.
If you go to Terry Norris today,

2950
02:46:31.321 --> 02:46:35.180
you'll get it too.
So is it the video itself that's fucking up?
Yeah,

2951
02:46:35.181 --> 02:46:37.290
I'm gonna try a different brand.
It can't be,
I listened to it today.

2952
02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:39.720
It might just be the browser.
Let me try a different browser.
HSP.

2953
02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:44.470
Brian Terry Norris is another one who was,
uh,

2954
02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:49.580
he's my age and I listened to him talk now and it's this massive labor and his

2955
02:46:50.851 --> 02:46:53.850
wife is in this interview and she's talking about how he has Parkinson's.

2956
02:46:53.851 --> 02:46:56.550
So He's,
his body is taught in lean still,

2957
02:46:56.551 --> 02:46:59.310
but it's because his muscles are always stiffening up.

2958
02:46:59.770 --> 02:47:03.360
Like his muscles are constantly stiff,
like,
and he can't talk.

2959
02:47:03.450 --> 02:47:06.120
He can't form sentences.
You can't understand it.

2960
02:47:06.290 --> 02:47:08.690
<v 3>Did I?
I went to school with this kid.
He got in a bar fight,</v>

2961
02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:11.150
punched the wrong way,
landed the wrong way.

2962
02:47:11.151 --> 02:47:15.470
And to this day he's a fucking mumbling.
Halfwit wow.

2963
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:19.250
One Punch.
You know,
people think about Barre fight.
Oh,
you're a bar fight.

2964
02:47:19.251 --> 02:47:22.340
It was funny last night.
Jim got it.
That's it man.
This kid is like,

2965
02:47:22.341 --> 02:47:25.340
he was a promising kid.
Smart.
And then he,

2966
02:47:25.370 --> 02:47:28.010
now he's like getting arrested all the time.
He can't,
you know,

2967
02:47:28.011 --> 02:47:31.820
he's self medicating and it's fucking 25 years ago.

2968
02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:32.131
<v 0>Well,</v>

2969
02:47:32.131 --> 02:47:34.620
it's just like the story that you were talking about before the podcast even

2970
02:47:34.621 --> 02:47:38.550
started about the guy would add and he shot himself,

2971
02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:41.690
right?
Yeah.
What was that story?

2972
02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:46.590
The guy had something he told Jamie.
That's right.
Jamie told it that a guy had,

2973
02:47:46.591 --> 02:47:50.910
what did he have?
He had OCD shot himself,
didn't kill himself,

2974
02:47:50.911 --> 02:47:55.320
but shout out the part of his head that was fucking with OCD and now he doesn't

2975
02:47:55.321 --> 02:47:59.720
have it anymore.
He fixed himself.
Uh,
the human brain.

2976
02:47:59.721 --> 02:48:02.670
There was another story that I was telling about a guy who got a head injury and

2977
02:48:02.671 --> 02:48:06.390
all sudden became a musical genius.
Yeah.
Never had any musical talent whatsoever.

2978
02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:10.530
Had a head injury and then all of a sudden it had this new found thing.

2979
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:15.110
<v 3>Right.
No,
I've heard of that shit happening with music before.
You know,
it orders,</v>

2980
02:48:15.111 --> 02:48:18.090
somehow it orders your brain and you're able to express yourself still.

2981
02:48:18.091 --> 02:48:21.510
But you know,
um,
I,
I think that,
uh,

2982
02:48:22.110 --> 02:48:26.010
not being hit as a kid is pretty big too.

2983
02:48:26.310 --> 02:48:29.310
I think that a lot of kids got beat a lot by their dads.

2984
02:48:29.311 --> 02:48:32.190
And I think when your brain is really young,
kids like five,

2985
02:48:32.191 --> 02:48:34.620
six years old to get knocked around all the time,

2986
02:48:34.650 --> 02:48:37.260
you wonder why kids get fucked up as they're older.

2987
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:42.470
<v 0>Yeah.
That's also this intense feeling of betrayal or your parents or your,</v>

2988
02:48:42.471 --> 02:48:45.070
your dad abuses you like that where your dad is,

2989
02:48:45.071 --> 02:48:48.240
this big person hits this little person and hits you hard.
Right.

2990
02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:50.390
I have friends that their dad's knocked them out,

2991
02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:54.060
dad knocked him out like they had the balls to stand up to their dad.

2992
02:48:54.061 --> 02:48:56.390
So the dad punched him in the face and knocked him unconscious.

2993
02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:00.170
He imagined like standing over your five year old out cold cause you just

2994
02:49:00.171 --> 02:49:04.490
slugged him.
That's a lot of people man.
And that's also a repeating cycle,

2995
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:05.690
just like abuse.

2996
02:49:05.691 --> 02:49:09.900
Like sexual abuse tends to a repeating cycle for whatever reason.

2997
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:13.690
The human brain is like very strange and w w the,

2998
02:49:13.691 --> 02:49:17.820
the patterns that it follows,
even abusive patterns,
you know?

2999
02:49:17.850 --> 02:49:20.790
And there's a few people that can figure it out and break the code.

3000
02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:23.130
And that's one of the things that I admire about you

3001
02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:25.050
<v 3>of risk repeating it.</v>

3002
02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:29.250
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
one of the things I admire about you is like,
we were like 21,</v>

3003
02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.970
you just fucking quit drinking.
You're like,
fuck this.
You know,
like,

3004
02:49:32.971 --> 02:49:36.030
I know what I'm doing.
I know this is a mass.
I knew my dad.
Fuck this up.

3005
02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.150
Fuck I'm fucking done.
And you were just done.
Right.
You know,

3006
02:49:39.151 --> 02:49:42.750
you were done then you never,
and you just,
you never made a big deal about it.

3007
02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:44.220
You're just done.
You know,

3008
02:49:44.221 --> 02:49:46.650
when people would ask you if you want to be or you're like,
Nah,
I don't drink,

3009
02:49:46.651 --> 02:49:51.090
I can't drink.
But it wasn't like some woe is me.
Hey,

3010
02:49:51.091 --> 02:49:55.740
I'm fucking 2000 days sober,
here's my new chip.
All that stupid shit.

3011
02:49:55.770 --> 02:49:58.470
It was none of that.
It was just like,
you know,

3012
02:49:58.471 --> 02:50:01.020
you just recognize a bad pattern that you weren't going to repeat.

3013
02:50:01.021 --> 02:50:03.260
You're not a dummy and you're like,
fuck this.

3014
02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:07.890
<v 3>Well,
I think it's what's difficult with recovery for some people is that,
um,</v>

3015
02:50:08.090 --> 02:50:12.100
there's chemical,
and I think what you're talking about is traumatically,

3016
02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:14.920
you know,
repeating that cycle.
And I think for me,

3017
02:50:14.921 --> 02:50:18.850
I don't know if it was this chemical because I was able to stop without Rehab

3018
02:50:18.851 --> 02:50:20.740
and a program and stick with it.

3019
02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:24.280
And I think when it's traumatic it's about like anything,

3020
02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:27.320
a new habit they say takes 90 days,
you know,
if you can,

3021
02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:31.060
and that's a big part about Aa is stopped for 90 days because then you can

3022
02:50:31.210 --> 02:50:36.010
change the neurons in your brain to start to feel good about what you're getting

3023
02:50:36.011 --> 02:50:39.610
from this new behavior.
It's not just about leaving it behind,
it's like,
wow,

3024
02:50:39.611 --> 02:50:40.720
when I don't do that,

3025
02:50:40.721 --> 02:50:43.870
I feel all these great things and the reason I don't drink anymore,

3026
02:50:43.871 --> 02:50:48.260
it's just that I treasure how lucid I am all the time.
You know,

3027
02:50:48.430 --> 02:50:49.660
like last night I met this,

3028
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:54.160
this party and there's like a bunch of people I love that I don't get to see

3029
02:50:54.161 --> 02:50:57.760
enough where it's like I would love to spend two hours with each one having a

3030
02:50:57.761 --> 02:51:00.580
deep conversation.
And you're only getting like 15 minutes each,

3031
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:02.800
but at least I'm like in it for each.

3032
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:05.860
I'm not like fucking fuzzy and putting my arm around her.

3033
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:08.350
<v 12>Hey Man.
Yeah,</v>

3034
02:51:08.750 --> 02:51:10.880
<v 3>I don't,
I just know I don't want that.</v>

3035
02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:12.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Well you know,</v>

3036
02:51:12.361 --> 02:51:16.470
you recognize when things are positive and beneficial or not and just go that

3037
02:51:16.471 --> 02:51:19.830
way.
Go the good way.
Right.
Yeah.
Some people though,
you know,
I,

3038
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:23.940
I definitely agree that the,
the abuse thing is a lot more difficult to overcome.

3039
02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:28.230
It seems like whatever these patterns are that get carved into someone's,

3040
02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:32.580
someone's personality and brain is that 90 days things up science.

3041
02:51:32.810 --> 02:51:36.680
<v 3>Yeah.
I've heard that again and again at 90 days if you start exercising,</v>

3042
02:51:36.681 --> 02:51:39.710
if you quit eating a certain thing that after 90 days,

3043
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:43.760
and it's not that it's physiologically your body is kicking caffeine or whatever

3044
02:51:43.761 --> 02:51:44.451
for 90 days,

3045
02:51:44.451 --> 02:51:48.520
it's just psychologically that they say that that's about where you do.

3046
02:51:48.521 --> 02:51:51.950
You develop a new way of being conditioned to,

3047
02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.870
to not need that thing as much.

3048
02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:55.920
<v 0>That's fascinating.
And it totally makes sense.</v>

3049
02:51:56.250 --> 02:51:59.180
It seems like we were completely creatures of habit and if you could just force

3050
02:51:59.181 --> 02:52:02.130
something to become a habit,
then it just becomes your everyday thing.

3051
02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:06.210
You figure out how to work this yet.
It's the video.
That's

3052
02:52:06.210 --> 02:52:09.220
<v 6>right.
We tried it on three different browsers and an iPad doesn't work.</v>

3053
02:52:09.221 --> 02:52:12.290
We just try a different video of random video and there's interest.

3054
02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:14.080
<v 0>Okay,
well pull up uh,</v>

3055
02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:18.220
Terry Norris then or see if there's another version of that video.
Um,

3056
02:52:18.221 --> 02:52:21.430
if there's not enough of our version of that video,
pull up Terry Norris today.

3057
02:52:21.730 --> 02:52:26.620
Let me find the one that the video and o r r I.

3058
02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:29.350
S today.
It's fucking sad dude.

3059
02:52:29.810 --> 02:52:32.280
<v 13>On the show.
This one,
maybe</v>

3060
02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:40.913
<v 8>my husband,</v>

3061
02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:48.010
WPC and boxing hall of Famer.

3062
02:52:49.140 --> 02:52:52.500
We are together and we have a reality show.

3063
02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:55.060
<v 6>I pause that for a second.
Let me see if I can get this video to work over here.</v>

3064
02:52:55.090 --> 02:52:56.380
He's got a reality show,

3065
02:52:57.430 --> 02:53:02.210
two time world shit and it'll pick the gold medalist.
This is worked in there.

3066
02:53:02.450 --> 02:53:03.283
I don't know.

3067
02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:08.930
<v 14>Listen to us saying that Obama phone game falafel,</v>

3068
02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:11.850
that's what's about to say personnel to dilute portion.

3069
02:53:12.330 --> 02:53:16.910
But it turns out tomorrow,
but before 12 the scope portion,

3070
02:53:17.350 --> 02:53:20.480
the fights,
he'll fight cost [inaudible] power.

3071
02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:26.340
<v 6>Yeah,
that's enough.
Is that a speech impediment or is that no cute drama?</v>

3072
02:53:26.410 --> 02:53:26.861
<v 0>No,
no.</v>

3073
02:53:26.861 --> 02:53:31.540
It's just being punched in the head and this what they call pugilistic dementia.

3074
02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:33.730
It's just being punched drunk.

3075
02:53:33.790 --> 02:53:37.420
They call it punch drunk because when you've been hitting the head so long or so

3076
02:53:37.421 --> 02:53:38.560
many times you're,

3077
02:53:38.650 --> 02:53:42.760
you sound like you're drunk and you labor over your words like you're drunk.

3078
02:53:43.150 --> 02:53:46.210
And I've seen that in fighters.
I've seen that in people that I personally know.

3079
02:53:46.211 --> 02:53:50.170
I've seen that from guys that I knew when I was a young man that they were lucid

3080
02:53:50.171 --> 02:53:54.550
and smart when I was a kid and they kept fighting when I stopped and I talked to

3081
02:53:54.551 --> 02:53:59.320
them today and I see them talking like they're drunk when there stone cold
sober,

3082
02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:00.160
this guy.

3083
02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:02.050
<v 6>Are they not intelligent anymore?</v>

3084
02:54:02.340 --> 02:54:04.770
<v 0>They're missing something.
I mean,
they're definitely,</v>

3085
02:54:05.170 --> 02:54:07.630
they're definitely cognitively compromised.
Right.

3086
02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:10.920
And for anybody to try to protect.
Oh,
he's sharp on the inside.

3087
02:54:11.010 --> 02:54:12.510
He just has a hard time.
Can we,

3088
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:15.450
is that why he's telling the same story every five minutes,
right.
No,

3089
02:54:15.451 --> 02:54:17.940
this is bullshit.
You're trying to make a positive spin on something.

3090
02:54:18.330 --> 02:54:21.330
Maybe he can keep going,
you know,

3091
02:54:21.331 --> 02:54:23.370
and he can write books and just can't talk.

3092
02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:26.640
But there's other people that don't know where the keys are.
Right.
You know,

3093
02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:30.600
there was an article in sports illustrated about Joe Montana and about a Joe,

3094
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:32.820
not Joe Montana.
Uh,
Jim Mcmahon from the

3095
02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:37.500
<v 6>bowls is the bears.
Yeah.
The fuck they are.
Cargo bears.
Remember the last?
Yeah.</v>

3096
02:54:37.501 --> 02:54:41.250
The whole,
the whole fucking the Superbowl shuffle.
Shuffle.

3097
02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:42.580
<v 0>That guy fucked.
Yeah.</v>

3098
02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:44.890
Like that guy sometimes is standing in the middle of his kitchen.

3099
02:54:44.891 --> 02:54:48.340
He doesn't know where he is.
Like he can't remember what he was going to do.

3100
02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:51.370
He was about to leave.
He's holding his keys.
He has no idea where he's going.

3101
02:54:51.890 --> 02:54:55.270
<v 6>He's starting his all rap is because he used to,
he used to run too much.
Yeah.</v>

3102
02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:57.130
And he used to get his fucking cage rattled.

3103
02:54:57.510 --> 02:55:00.380
<v 0>Yeah.
All of them.
All of them.
The,
the,
the dude,
uh,</v>

3104
02:55:00.450 --> 02:55:04.250
Brett Farve he's talking about he forgot an entire of his daughter

3105
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:07.520
<v 6>playing soccer.
Like he forgot she played soccer.
Like it's gone.</v>

3106
02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:08.780
It's not in his head any more.

3107
02:55:08.820 --> 02:55:11.280
<v 3>You think about all the money you've got and all that,</v>

3108
02:55:11.281 --> 02:55:15.030
but you don't have your fucking mind.
I'll give up a leg,

3109
02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:20.320
<v 6>dude.
It's dangerous.
You know Dick though I'd keep my Dick Harlow.</v>

3110
02:55:21.090 --> 02:55:22.430
Yeah,
we do.
Sweet Dick.

3111
02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:25.460
Put it up on the screen Brian and beat your Dick all day and look at it.
No,
no.

3112
02:55:25.461 --> 02:55:28.370
Pugilistic dementia.
Think straight.
Um,

3113
02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:31.400
but the thing about my penis is that it doesn't bruise.
And I believe me,

3114
02:55:31.401 --> 02:55:35.330
I've put some beatings on it.
If people want to buy your,
uh,
your Special Gregory,

3115
02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:37.660
tell him where to get it and what it's called.
I believe you go to Amazon

3116
02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:40.460
<v 3>[inaudible] dot com but I know if you got to fits dog.com,</v>

3117
02:55:40.461 --> 02:55:43.700
there's a link on there to pick it up.
It's uh,
you know,

3118
02:55:43.701 --> 02:55:46.880
I don't know what it cost,
but I think it's,
I think it's pretty good.
And then

3119
02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:50.330
<v 6>it's hilarious.
Thank you.
Enjoyed it.
Thanks for listening,
by the way.</v>

3120
02:55:50.331 --> 02:55:52.110
I appreciate a lot of comics.
Say,
you know,

3121
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:54.130
they ain't gotta check it out and they never fucking do.
Yeah,

3122
02:55:54.131 --> 02:55:58.080
those guys are cunts.
Shitheads any favor?
Edo.

3123
02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:07.160
And if I can promote again,
December five through seven Boston Laugh Boston,

3124
02:56:07.161 --> 02:56:09.020
I'm coming up as a great new room.
And uh,

3125
02:56:09.021 --> 02:56:11.420
I'm going to do a podcast the first night,
Thursday,

3126
02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:14.680
the fifth live podcast at the club piss.

3127
02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:19.330
[inaudible] live on stage.
That's what it's called.
Life on stage.

3128
02:56:19.710 --> 02:56:23.290
Oh,
life.
Life,
life.
Not Live life on stage.
Uh,

3129
02:56:23.291 --> 02:56:27.740
I got it off of Amazon because I switched over to a so you can hear it.
Oh,

3130

Go buy it.
Fucks.
That's good.
It's excellent.

3132

3135
02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:49.690
<v 6>Fort Lauderdale,
Chicago.
No,
I'm doing the big one in the mall.</v>

3136
02:56:49.870 --> 02:56:51.100
Oh,
okay,

3137
02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:53.510
<v 3>And,

I dunno,</v>

3138
02:56:53.550 --> 02:56:58.050

3139
02:56:58.051 --> 02:57:01.710
you just came on recently.
I was fucking great.
I was off that night.

3140
02:57:01.711 --> 02:57:05.260
I felt bad that I don't know what it was.
You came as some,

All right,
good.
I had a wonderful time.
All right.</v>

3143
02:57:11.180 --> 02:57:13.340
I don't even use the word wonderful.
Um,

02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:15.670
<v 0>so,
uh,
