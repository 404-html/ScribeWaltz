<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of the company,</v>

26
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>but they're still around in some form that hired him to sell more pork.</v>

27
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And so he came up with this idea like bacon and eggs.</v>

28
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>What's for breakfast?</v>

<v Speaker 1>So congratulations.</v>

00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:04.311
<v Speaker 1>So he was also behind the fluoridation of the water supply hired by Alcoa</v>

35
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>because they had all this,</v>

36
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>

37
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a byproduct of making aluminum,</v>

38
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>which is this fluoride.</v>

39
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>And they wanted to like,</v>

40
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do with all this stuff?</v>

41
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:14.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who could we sell it to?</v>

44
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:16.890

64
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Like how much kills you?</v>

65
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

71
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.560

72
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>hygiene,</v>

73
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>dental hygiene.</v>

74
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It's made the difference in tooth decay and people.</v>

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Bacon.</v>

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>He also was behind the Virginia slims thing.</v>

112
00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

113

114
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a feminist cigarette.</v>

115
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.291
<v Speaker 1>Come a long way,</v>

116
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I bet that guy got laid like crazy.</v>

118
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I bet he was just a fucking maestro.</v>

119
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And he was Freud's nephew.</v>

120
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

121
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So he had the benefit of psychological examination under his uncle.</v>

122
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>He's proud of himself like he doesn't.</v>

123
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>He just died like 10 years ago.</v>

124
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.911
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

125
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:22.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

126
00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I did all this shit,</v>

127
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's happy.</v>

128
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>His success ratio was amazing,</v>

129
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

131
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>he hit every one out of the park.</v>

132
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I've said there's more,</v>

133
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.271
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean this.</v>

134
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:36.271
<v Speaker 1>There is more intellectual debate in one hour of twitter than there is a four</v>

135
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:37.264
<v Speaker 1>years of college.</v>

136
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's far more conflict of ideas on social media now than there isn't a</v>

137
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>college classroom because college classrooms are dominated and have been for</v>

138
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>decades by left liberals.</v>

139
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the discourse that goes on in there.</v>

140
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear conservative ideas,</v>

141
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear libertarian ideas,</v>

142
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't even hear some radical left wing ideas.</v>

143
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>It's this very narrow discourse that is pretty much only allowed in the college</v>

144
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>classroom and that's to me the most.</v>

145
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>The biggest problem with the modern university,</v>

146
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>there is no diversity of ideas.</v>

147
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's obsessed with diversity of color,</v>

148
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.933
<v Speaker 1>skin color,</v>

149
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but no one cares about a diversity.</v>

150
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Diversity of ideas about real debate.</v>

151
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I want in my university to have a real debate about big ideas.</v>

152
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I want the best minds from conservatism and liberalism and socialism and</v>

153
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism to have it out to.</v>

154
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the big ideas and let's go for it and have the best people</v>

155
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>argue the points on their merits against each other.</v>

156
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that there's such a narrow path of ideas that exist right now in</v>

157
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>college is why is it just this tenure track tenure?</v>

158
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

160
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:59.461
<v Speaker 1>so what happened was conservatives basically dominated colleges until the 19</v>

161
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:04.621
<v Speaker 1>sixties and then the 19 sixties generation of radicals had nowhere to go when</v>

162
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>they went into their twenties and thirties,</v>

163
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>so they decided to move into the academy,</v>

164
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>so they all got phds and they became professors and they've dominated ever</v>

165
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.524
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>

166
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>There's also the system of tenure in universities,</v>

167
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to protect academic freedom,</v>

168
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>and what it actually does is it enforces intellectual conformity,</v>

169
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Because you have a lifetime appointment and you and you control hiring,</v>

171
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>The faculty controls hiring.</v>

173
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

174
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Who are you going to hire?</v>

175
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>You're going to hire somebody who agrees with you.</v>

176
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Who says what you think should be said?</v>

177
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem with tenure,</v>

178
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

179
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>It sort of protects academic freedom,</v>

180
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>but mostly it enforces intellectual conformity.</v>

181
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>That's disturbing.</v>

182
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>It's disturbing because you see it's a priesthood.</v>

183
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.230
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>

185
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

186
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

187
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.220
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

188
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a priest for life.</v>

189
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And who are you going to recruit into the priesthood.</v>

190
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>A true</v>

191
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 2>believer.</v>

192
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what goes on in universities.</v>

193
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.940
<v Speaker 2>You know why they didn't go to that?</v>

194
00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

195
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Why is it not go that way?</v>

196
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Because I would have gone off on him that he would have beat up Jack,</v>

197
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

198
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Luke and the one that would be in that room that night.</v>

199
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I know how to motivate Cubans or with religion,</v>

200
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>that radicals you would do.</v>

201
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>You would just start talking about God,</v>

202
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I just told them about.</v>

203
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

204
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.130

00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:23.540

209
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And he used the one that he.</v>

210
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.661
<v Speaker 2>The metal worker.</v>

211
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 2>He's the fucking built.</v>

212
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>And when you go on Youtube,</v>

213
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:32.820
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

214
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 2>throat ghoulies is always a big yield.</v>

215
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Black Guy lives in the jungle and he only comes out.</v>

216
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 2>The only comes out when there's a problem,</v>

217
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.910
<v Speaker 2>so if I would've seen Yoel Romero that day,</v>

218
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:45.630
<v Speaker 2>I would have said Google and I would have got a gun.</v>

219
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Like God love going,</v>

220
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Shit Dog.</v>

221
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I started doing that to end this and silver when I first met him and I remember</v>

222
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 2>one day in the hallway he couldn't take his eyes off of me.</v>

223
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 2>People talking to him.</v>

224
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:56.854
<v Speaker 2>They kept looking back,</v>

225
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.280
<v Speaker 2>fuck the sand because it's big in Brasilia,</v>

227
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.470

<v Speaker 2>and then I would have started saying who my mother is whole lot.</v>

232

<v Speaker 2>You see my periodic golden eat that leg</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll get you fired up at all before.</v>

242
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>This is huge in Cuba.</v>

243
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It was this guy,</v>

244
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.910
<v Speaker 2>this guy right here,</v>

245
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

246
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.640
<v Speaker 2>So there's like a series of black porn films.</v>

247
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 2>These guys shirtless,</v>

248
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 2>six pack covered in oil.</v>

249
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 2>This is the price of the jungle.</v>

250
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.520
<v Speaker 2>And he is in charge of machinery when you,</v>

251
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 2>when machinery goes bad and shit like that,</v>

252
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 2>you have to pray to him.</v>

253
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 2>He has all the weapons of metal.</v>

254
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 2>He just shows up in metal and stuff.</v>

255
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 2>He has a metal,</v>

256
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Speaker 2>acts metal,</v>

257
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.260
<v Speaker 2>fucking everything that.</v>

258
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I would have busted him with that I would've just.</v>

259
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I would've gotten through his head without going.</v>

260
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.641
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>

261
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>That takes over Jesus and Cuba.</v>

262
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>That's what you were brought up on.</v>

263
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>You heard that grown up.</v>

264
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>So even if you converted to Christianity later on,</v>

265
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 2>that will still get under your skin,</v>

266
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>like your cage and shit profile to stop saying that shit.</v>

267
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Everybody I there,</v>

268
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

269
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 2>John Mccarthy?</v>

270
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>It would have been an episode of curly and the little rascals when they fund</v>

271
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 2>that little rascal three stooges,</v>

272
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 2>they want to currently wrestle for a benefit.</v>

273
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 2>But the problem was whenever curly smelled wild license,</v>

274
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.630
<v Speaker 2>she went fucking nuts.</v>

275
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.290
<v Speaker 2>So he's on the bottom of the pile.</v>

276
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 2>The guys beating them and all of a sudden what comes over and makes them sniff</v>

277
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:49.320
<v Speaker 2>the fucking thing currently pushes him off.</v>

278
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.211

279
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:51.044
<v Speaker 2>Wild Heisei,</v>

282
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>this is like in the forties it was made and all of a sudden you flashback and</v>

283
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.860

285
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 2>people coming up and then he gets a little bit belt.</v>

286
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 2>At least starts clocking people with the bell from the wild licensed and they</v>

287
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.620
<v Speaker 2>flip over the curly hitting people with the Bow Austin,</v>

288
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 2>they flip over to the middle of the ring and they're all piled on top of each</v>

289
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 2>other though 18 people with that fucking.</v>

290
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would have done through the yellow metal that day.</v>

291
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.680
