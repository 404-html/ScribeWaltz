<v Speaker 1>He's our trainer.</v>

12
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was going up there to train.</v>

13
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.653
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was on.</v>

14
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Got a hopeful you don't have that I know of.</v>

15
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Not that I know of,</v>

16
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but you know what they're trying to do.</v>

17
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.903
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do.</v>

18
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Aldo and Norma Madoff for a fucking interim.</v>

19
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>One 55 and I'm like how do you have a one 55 interim when Connor?</v>

20
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Just one the one 55 a week ago.</v>

21
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>What about Max though?</v>

22
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>What about Max Holloway?</v>

23
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>He and Max Holloway.</v>

24
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Well he's the got the intern one 45 such a shit show and Holloway interim cause</v>

25
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>all over Nigga Murdoch is sick.</v>

26
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Sick.</v>

27
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fight.</v>

29
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.033
<v Speaker 1>Although versus,</v>

30
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>especially when you see what,</v>

32
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>what happened with Michael Johnson.</v>

33
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson stunned Habib,</v>

34
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.234
<v Speaker 1>he stung him.</v>

36
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>He hit him and stunned them.</v>

37
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.281
<v Speaker 1>And Michael Johnson,</v>

38
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>with all due respect,</v>

39
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>is nowhere near the striker that Josie Aldo is Jada,</v>

40
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Josie,</v>

41
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>all those on a totally different level,</v>

42
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Josie is as powerful as Johnson exposes the question because he's not as big.</v>

43
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>He's been fighting at one 45 his whole career and he's going to be fighting a</v>

44
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking go.</v>

45
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Rilla mean they ain't no rushing go.</v>

46
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Really the difference between Johnson's bottom game and all those bottom 100%</v>

47
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>100% all those will be way better ways.</v>

48
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.490
<v Speaker 1>So all those kicks there a giant factor because if you,</v>

49
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>if all though who has amazing takedown defense,</v>

50
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking amazing,</v>

51
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>some of the best take down defense.</v>

52
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So he's also gotten fucking nasty lick kicks.</v>

53
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>So if number come in off moves at him.</v>

54
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.121
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

55
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:42.611
<v Speaker 1>Who is this?</v>

56
00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Who is this?</v>

57
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Will you show me here how beam number coming off slams UFC for lying to the fans</v>

58
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>about Josie?</v>

59
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Aldo demands relevant fight against her.</v>

60
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Why is he saying he's lying to the fans?</v>

61
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

62
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.363
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what he says here.</v>

63
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back on this.</v>

64
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>This God damn screen dude.</v>

65
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.671
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's clear to everyone that you hiding Connor from me,</v>

67
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>but stop lying to your fans.</v>

68
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want fight with Aldo.</v>

69
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to fight with anyone in my division.</v>

70
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Give me relevant fight so you won't preserve all.</v>

71
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Take your phone away from your sister cause somebody,</v>

72
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>somebody got this phone then making no,</v>

73
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely doing it.</v>

74
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's right in broke even though she's sell routes,</v>

75
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.824
<v Speaker 1>but I love it.</v>

76
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>It makes it more gangster.</v>

77
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>You've never matched up.</v>

79
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:19.891
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>

80
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't see that Jamie,</v>

81
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:21.451
<v Speaker 1>this thing is in front of it.</v>

82
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:21.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

83
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>he never matched up two guys with the nine and eight win streak in UFC.</v>

84
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Never in UFC history.</v>

85
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

86
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

87
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean anything.</v>

88
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.861
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

89
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem is too expensive.</v>

90
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I see what he's saying,</v>

91
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but let me explain why he's wrong.</v>

92
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>They need big relevant fights to sell paper views.</v>

93
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:39.061
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

94
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:39.894
<v Speaker 1>And that's all they care about.</v>

95
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.763
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

96
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>The UFC was purchased for $4 billion.</v>

97
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>

98
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.750

99
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.550

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.803
<v Speaker 1>You own your house.</v>

103
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what a mortgages,</v>

104
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>mortgages are pretty conti.</v>

105
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>You'll look at them every month.</v>

106
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:55.771
<v Speaker 1>He'd go,</v>

107
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.604
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

108
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know now if you have a mortgage for a nice house and you spend 1 million</v>

109
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>bucks as a fucking nut,</v>

110
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you've got to make every month,</v>

111
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.311
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

112
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think about it.</v>

113
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.661
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go,</v>

114
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:04.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

115
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>we've got the mortgage is covered.</v>

116
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:06.761
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

117
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>And then you move on with all the other bills.</v>

118
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:08.951
<v Speaker 1>Write me about it.</v>

119
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>So then June a $4 billion house,</v>

120
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.730
<v Speaker 1>what kind of fucking mortgage and how do we pay the bills by doing huge fights?</v>

121
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.031
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

122
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>So we got to figure some shit out.</v>

123
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Interim,</v>

124
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.491
<v Speaker 1>interim,</v>

125
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>interim,</v>

126
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the belt.</v>

127
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>The reality is John Jones is suspended and Jon Jones isn't even the champ right</v>

128
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

129
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So when he comes back,</v>

130
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>he's not even fighting for a world title and less he fights for the world title.</v>

131
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>So you got to have DC has gotta be healthy or you got to have John Fight for an</v>

132
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>interim because they're just throwing interims out like they're fucking fliers</v>

133
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.720
<v Speaker 1>that they put on your car when a dude's trying to like sell car washes and my</v>

134
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

135
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>if they don't start getting these fucking cars selling,</v>

136
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.170
<v Speaker 1>they've got to be another season to fifth factor is going to be added on.</v>

137
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

138
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>there's not.</v>

139
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

140
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>there's not even a CCM [inaudible] some Brad pitch just to sell papers.</v>

141
00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>These are some shit up you something Doug.</v>

142
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're going to do.</v>

143
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

144
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>who knows if I'll be there for it.</v>

145
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at,</v>

146
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>when you look at like the,</v>

147
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

148
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.301
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

149
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>the title picture,</v>

150
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>who like that card that they have in Brooklyn,</v>

151
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is,</v>

152
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a paper view card and it looks like an fs one car right now.</v>

153
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're going to juice it up.</v>

154
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.913
<v Speaker 1>They'll get more,</v>

155
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be a die hard fan.</v>

156
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Pay 60 bucks for that shit.</v>

157
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

158
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make those cards.</v>

159
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

160
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I think we kind of nailed it when we were talking about it earlier,</v>

161
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like what guys sell paper views.</v>

162
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I think Woodley's a bigger star now that he'd be Wonderboy,</v>

163
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but he still wants that a paper,</v>

164
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>like Dana and I were having this conversation.</v>

165
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.701
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

166
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't have Nick Diaz.</v>

167
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:37.871
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

168
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:38.351
<v Speaker 1>nick and says,</v>

169
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight since 2011 he can't have him step in and just go right up</v>

170
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:43.174
<v Speaker 1>to the title and tell.</v>

171
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said.</v>

172
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:44.891
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

173
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>but I want to see it,</v>

174
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.241
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

175
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:46.901
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it too.</v>

176
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:47.291
<v Speaker 1>But you can't.</v>

177
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.124
<v Speaker 1>You can't sell it.</v>

178
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Well you will.</v>

179
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to take the sports series.</v>

180
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>If you give a guy who hasn't won since 2011 or 12 give him a title shot.</v>

181
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:54.761
<v Speaker 1>People at fancy.</v>

182
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:54.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

183
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.804
<v Speaker 1>come on Bro.</v>

184
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>But I think they missed the boat if they wanted to make the fucking big money.</v>

185
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It's Nick Diaz versus Conor McGregor is too big brother.</v>

186
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fight at one seven come on.</v>

187
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

188
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.490
<v Speaker 1>his [inaudible] his brother was too big for him.</v>

189
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>He's too big,</v>

190
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>way too big.</v>

191
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that talk is nonsense because Connor is the one 55 pound champ.</v>

192
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Nate fought at one 55 most of his career.</v>

193
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>He fought at one 70 a couple of times and he's undersized.</v>

194
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Don Young can beat him at one 70 he's a,</v>

195
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit one 70 or though,</v>

196
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>especially Donald,</v>

197
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>he's even won 70 maybe,</v>

198
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.230
<v Speaker 1>but he fights one 55 easy look great against Michael MacDonald at 55 Tyron</v>

199
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.313
<v Speaker 1>Woodley,</v>

200
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>if his fucking life depends on it,</v>

201
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Tyron Woodley is not gonna make it 55 so the naming the champ can't make one 55</v>

202
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.520
<v Speaker 1>at one 70 Nate can.</v>

203
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>So Nate is not a real one.</v>

204
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>79 here's to your point,</v>

205
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:47.681
<v Speaker 1>in Dana's point,</v>

206
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to fight since 2011 and you don't have common your cash cow</v>

207
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:52.031
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

208
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>This monster hasn't one forever talk.</v>

209
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Great Story.</v>

210
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.521
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

211
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:57.354
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

212
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Big Brother's steps in cut my,</v>

213
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.463
<v Speaker 1>I would watch it,</v>

214
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch him in,</v>

215
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>but to your,</v>

216
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.751
<v Speaker 1>to your point,</v>

217
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>they have to figure something out to get these stars.</v>

218
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because you can't do it overnight.</v>

219
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.641
<v Speaker 1>To me it doesn't matter.</v>

220
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You put Nick Diaz for what he's done out of respect.</v>

221
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to complain?</v>

222
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

223
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Well apparently they thought for it.</v>

224
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:12.861
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz,</v>

225
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler and uh,</v>

226
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>nick passed on it.</v>

227
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.663
<v Speaker 1>That's the word.</v>

228
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the word behind the scenes.</v>

229
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.123
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

230
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm not supposed to say that,</v>

231
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.931
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

232
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see that fight.</v>

233
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see that rematch.</v>

234
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>But I think nick wants a fucking title fight.</v>

235
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

236
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I think nick is like,</v>

237
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.021
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

238
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.591
<v Speaker 1>I want a big,</v>

239
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>big name or a title fight.</v>

240
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I love how they make these demands.</v>

241
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.143
<v Speaker 1>Scam money.</v>

242
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Make Nick made some money.</v>

243
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>He's not ridiculous.</v>

244
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't spend it all.</v>

245
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

246
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Speaker 1>how about Nate?</v>

247
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

248
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not answering the call.</v>

249
00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>And this is 20 million.</v>

250
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

251
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:39.404
<v Speaker 1>we talked about,</v>

252
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that recently in the podcast,</v>

253
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:41.901
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

254
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

255
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>let's break this down because like,</v>

256
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say they do a million pay per view buys,</v>

257
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>which is like top end,</v>

258
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

259
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few people that have ever sold a million.</v>

260
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.814
<v Speaker 1>It's like Brock,</v>

261
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Conner sit.</v>

262
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

263
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>1 million is top of the food chain,</v>

264
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 1>so a million pay per view buys at 60 bucks.</v>

265
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>That's you're taking one third right off the bat.</v>

266
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>For Nate,</v>

267
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.180
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to justify giving someone $20 million for something.</v>

268
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>

269
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real hard and then obviously on or could demand that Connor's</v>

270
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.660
<v Speaker 1>like one of the only guys that can get that kind of money.</v>

271
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>He's the only one of you guys you think eventually guys would just start doing,</v>

272
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so big like Connor,</v>

273
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>he just does his own show and and he gets his own.</v>

274
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>People know the EOC.</v>

275
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Lawyers are too good to let you get out of your contract.</v>

276
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.980
<v Speaker 1>They realize that if,</v>

277
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>if Nate had a legit fight with someone other than Connor,</v>

278
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 1>that was exciting.</v>

279
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's no one else in the division that's got that kind of</v>

280
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>marquee value.</v>

281
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.580
<v Speaker 1>55 yeah.</v>

282
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It was no one in the division that has the kind of marquee value that if you had</v>

283
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 1>a look,</v>

284
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I think Nate is a fucking huge star,</v>

285
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>but in less than,</v>

286
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>especially now.</v>

287
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

288
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:42.351
<v Speaker 1>after he beat Conor,</v>

289
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the biggest stars outside of that upper echelon paper view,</v>

290
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.323
<v Speaker 1>like level.</v>

291
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

292
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a world title holder right now.</v>

293
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanted to really have a big fight for Nate,</v>

294
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I would have to have him that would work.</v>

295
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Fight all day.</v>

296
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I would work.</v>

297
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.633
<v Speaker 1>That would work</v>

298
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
