1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.640
And four,
three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.020
Hello.
Hello John.
Thanks for doing this,
man.
I really appreciate it.
Oh,

3
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:11.831
this is exciting.

4
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:14.380
I don't think I've ever had a conversation as long as we're about to.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.750
<v 1>I've been listening to the happiness hypothesis over the last few days and I</v>

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.290
really,
really enjoy it.
I'm really enjoying it.
It's really fascinating stuff,
man.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.720
Um,
but one thing I wanted to talk about because we were talking about it right

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.340
before we got started was what's happening with Peter [inaudible] at Portland

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
State University.
For folks who don't know the story,
he and,
um,

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
I forget his two colleagues,
uh,
Challenge Bros and James Lindsey.
Yeah.

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
They released these fake papers,
um,
on,
uh,

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.240
like Homo eroticism and rape culture and dog parks and just really proposed your

13
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:53.520
stuff,
papers that almost like an article from the onion.
And some of them,

14
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.490
not only did they get peer reviewed and accepted into these journals,

15
00:00:56.491 --> 00:01:01.020
but they got loud it as being these amazing places of one did one guy

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.650
and now he's getting in trouble.
That's right.
Yeah.
And,
um,

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.180
we were just talking about it and I just would love to know your thoughts as a

18
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.090
professor.
Like what?

19
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.910
<v 0>Oh,
sure.
Yeah.
So you know,
for those who don't know,</v>

20
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:15.490
I guess most of your listeners probably do,
but,
uh,
you know,

21
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:19.830
it was called the grievance studies hoax because,
and,
and,

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.200
and this is one of the big issues going on in the academy to help,

23
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.040
we'll talk about,
uh,
is,
um,
you know,
what does it take to have good scholarship?

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.500
And,
and the argument is that in some fields,

25
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.840
as long as you hate the right things and use the right words,

26
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.420
you'll get published.
And that's not scholarship,
that's activism.

27
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.380
And so these three,
these three people who did this hoax,
um,

28
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.500
they were trying to show that that's the case.
And so they wrote these papers.

29
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.680
One of them was actually a section of mine comp and they just substituted in

30
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:50.620
something about feminism for Nazi-ism,
something like that.
And,
um,

31
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.710
I don't remember that that one actually got pubmatic at it.
At any rate.

32
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:57.030
The point is they were trying to show that this is some of these fields in the

33
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.440
academy or not really about scholarship.

34
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.670
They're just about showing that you hate the right things.
They're activists.

35
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.160
And so,
uh,
there's no way to break in within those closed world.

36
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:10.220
So they did a time honored thing.
They did a hoax,
they published the date,

37
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:12.420
submitted these papers,
they made up fake names and,

38
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:16.690
and a lot of them got accepted.
And now what's happening is that a,

39
00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:20.470
the university Portland State University,
which is only one of the three is at a,

40
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.360
is a,
is a professor,
he's a,
uh,
assistant professor,
so he's not tenured.
Um,

41
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.350
you know,
of course he has a lot of enemies.
And uh,

42
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.010
of course I don't know what's going on behind the scenes,

43
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.840
but it looks like some of them wanted him investigated for violating the Irb,

44
00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:35.860
the internal review board,

45
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
because the claim is they fabricated data because one of the papers says,

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.460
I inspected the genitals of 10,000 dogs and the dog park,
you know,

47
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:49.850
it's like obviously absurd.
And he said,
you know,
in 63% of the,

48
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.980
of the attempted hump it,

49
00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:53.950
cause the thing that I think of the article was that the idea that,
you know,

50
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:56.500
you go to a dog park and you see dogs humping each other and they were

51
00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:59.890
interpreting this as rape,
as doggy rape and so

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 2>he's got all these nuts,
you know,
fake numbers in there.
So is that fraud,</v>

53
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.180
is that data fraud?
And if you read,
so I'm,

54
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.160
I'm writing a letter for a lot of us are not writing letters in support of,

55
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.390
of Ian.
Thank you for doing that.
Um,
but if you read the,

56
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.460
they at his university committee was in paneled and they looked at the literal

57
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.080
definition of data fabrication and it's possible that he does fall under that.

58
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.040
But the point of,
of,
of this whole thing,
so it's not,

59
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.670
I can't weigh in on whether or not technically,
um,
but,

60
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.060
but these rules are put in place to prevent the corruption of the scientific

61
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.300
record.
And what he was doing was not going to corrupt.

62
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.540
The scientific record was done to correct it when you were doing it to show that

63
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.960
there's a huge problem and then they were going to unveil it.
So the question is,

64
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:50.320
is the university going to interpret it this in the worst possible way,

65
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.580
in the narrowest possible way,

66
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.720
and thereby make fools of themselves look like laughingstocks.
Um,

67
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.990
or are they going to use some common sense and recognize this for what it was?

68
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:03.970
It wasn't data fabrication.
It wasn't a fraud yet was an expo say.
That's right.

69
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.010
And I hope that they come to their senses and they do have a point,

70
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.090
if I'm going to be completely objective about data fabrication,

71
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.380
I mean technically,

72
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.500
I mean maybe they could have written that paper without saying that they

73
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.010
actually tested 10,000 genitals.

74
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.200
But what's really important,
I think,

75
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:27.520
is that they recognize that regular people are paying attention to this now.

76
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.320
People that aren't involved in this very insulated world and they're going,

77
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.230
this is crazy.
Like imagine if your children are going there and your children,

78
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.250
children are being taught at this school that's willing to accept this kind of

79
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.430
nonsense like this.

80
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.340
What happened at Evergreen state universities and another example of that.

81
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.540
It's right.
It's incredibly damaging to them as a university.

82
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:56.960
I mean their enrollment is sensitive on it down.
That's right.

83
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.470
Their funding is in real big trouble and they're there.

84
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.760
It's a real bad situation for them.
And if you talk to Bret Weinstein,

85
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.640
it was a wonderful place just a few years ago when he was teaching there.

86
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.150
That's right.

87
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.770
And it's gotten crazier and crazier on these campuses to the point where

88
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.220
nonsense is never being,
is not being questioned at all.

89
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:18.820
It's just being accepted as just some,
some it's,

90
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.160
it's almost like some religious dogma that you have to follow.
That's right.

91
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.170
So the weight,

92
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.880
I think the way to make sense of all of this is you have to always look at what

93
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:29.500
game is being played.

94
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.310
So human beings evolved in small scale societies.

95
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.850
We have all kinds of abilities to function in those small scale societies.

96
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.560
One of those is religious worship.

97
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:41.410
We're very good at making something sacred and circling around it.

98
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.520
Another is war.
We're very good at forming teams to fight the other side.

99
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.250
And we love that so much.
We create sports and you know,

100
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:50.170
video game battles with team versus team.

101
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.180
So there's all these different games you can play.

102
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.040
And the truth seeking game is a,

103
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.070
it was a really special one in a weird one and we're not very good at

104
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.100
<v 0>it as individuals.
And in my view,</v>

105
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.430
the genius of university is that it takes people and puts them together in ways

106
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.090
where each person,

107
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.410
each like scientists aren't the super rational creatures that are,
you know,

108
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.870
looking to disconfirm their own ideas.
No,
we're not looking.

109
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.970
We want to approve our ideas,
we love our ideas,

110
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.270
but a university puts us together in a way in which you are really motivated to

111
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.630
disprove my ideas and I'm motivated to disprove yours.
You put us together,

112
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:30.830
we cancel out each other's confirmation biases.
So the truth seeking games,

113
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.280
a very special game that can only be played in a very special institution with

114
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:36.230
special norms.
Okay.

115
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.940
So we're doing this for my whole time in academia.

116
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.950
I started Grad School in 1987 at the University of Pennsylvania.

117
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.080
And then just in the last few years,

118
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:49.190
it's like some people are playing this really different game and it's like,
if,

119
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.170
you know,
if I'm playing tennis and I hit the ball to you,

120
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.440
like we're in a seminar class,
I give you a question,

121
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:55.760
I challenge challenging you come back.

122
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.090
And we go back and forth and in the process we learn.

123
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:01.070
So that's like kind of like playing tennis.

124
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.360
So I'm doing this and then suddenly like someone tackles me like,
what?

125
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.350
That you don't do that in tennis?
No,
no,
but they're playing football.
You see,

126
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.900
and in football it's a much rougher game and you're trying to destroy the
others.

127
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.460
I mean,
not really in football,
but I'm saying it's,
you know,
it's,
um,

128
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.950
and so as norms of combat come in,

129
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:23.951
and what I mean by that is political combat as some people within universities

130
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.470
see that what we're doing here is not seeking truth.

131
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.610
We're trying to fight fascism or we're trying to defeat conservatism or we're

132
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:35.420
trying to fight racism or whatever.
Some sort of a political goal.

133
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.000
And these games are completely incompatible.

134
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.260
And so that's why this madness has erupted where you see professors saying

135
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.650
something,
maybe it's a little provocative.
I mean going back to Socrates,

136
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:48.520
that was kind of the point was to provoke,
um,

137
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.300
and you see these bizarre reactions,
emotional reactions,
uh,

138
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.680
groups organize to demand that a professor be fired because we're playing

139
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:02.600
different games.
Yeah.
How did this start?
How did it start?

140
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.280
Um,
cause it seems like there,
there has to be an event or something or,
yeah,

141
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.860
the trend.
Well,
so,
so the,
you know,
the book that a,

142
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:13.460
I'm the book that I just put out in September,
uh,

143
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.950
with Greg Lukey on off the coddling of the American mind.
Um,

144
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.520
I read the first chapter of that as well.
Okay.

145
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:21.200
Well thank you for admitting that it was only one chapter.

146
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:26.060
Usually I'll delve into that one because,
uh,
unfortunately,
uh,

147
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:26.510
I was,

148
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.720
I was reading that and then I got on a flight and I just wanted to zone out.

149
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:33.530
So listen to this one on tape.
Okay.
All right.
Well I'll tell you all about it.

150
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.200
But the key thing is that that book,

151
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:39.350
the calling the American mind was something that we wrote because Greg began

152
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:43.270
observing this weird stuff happening in universities in 2014.

153
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.260
It all starts in 2014.
Um,
most of your listeners have heard about safe spaces,

154
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:52.220
microaggressions,
bias,
response teams,
trigger warnings,
all that stuff.

155
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.640
That stuff didn't exist before 2014.
It just begins creeping in then.

156
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.530
And then it kind of blows up in 2015.

157
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.490
And so our whole book is an explanation of why,
why did this happen?

158
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.280
And so to your question about was there an event,

159
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.480
our answer is there are six different causal threads.

160
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.240
There's like all these social trends,

161
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.230
some going back to the eighties and nineties that came together around 2014 so

162
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:18.330
that students are a little different.

163
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.660
And then there are certain forces acting on them that are different.

164
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.350
And so you get this weird new game,
you get this explosive mix.

165
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:29.940
You get some students who are actually very drawn to grievance studies.

166
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.800
Uh,
and so,
um,
very briefly like the,
it's things like,

167
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.490
um,
rising political polarization.
So left and right.

168
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:41.700
Never particularly liked each other,
but in the seventies and eighties,

169
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.850
if you look at surveys done of how much you hate people,
the other side,

170
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.020
it's not that intense.
It begins going up in the,
in the 80s,

171
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:53.680
and then especially after 2000,
it's going up very steeply.
Uh,

172
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.930
at the same time,

173
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.720
university faculty who've always leaned left throughout the 20th century,
uh,

174
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.920
but it was only a lien and in the 90s,

175
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:05.370
it begins shifting much further left so that now faculties,

176
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:08.840
especially in the social sciences and humanities are pretty purified.

177
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.050
They're overwhelmingly on the left,

178
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.790
so you have a more left leaning a university at a time when left,
right.

179
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.070
Hostility is getting more and more intense.

180
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.040
And so any question that has a political valence,

181
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.620
now there's a lot more people who want to do the football game,

182
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.620
not the truth seeking,
but then we got to defeat the other side.

183
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.690
Don't give me nuance,
don't give me data.
We know what we believe and dammit,

184
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.780
we're going to,
you know,

185
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.910
so she had got this it changing political situation and then you've got a couple

186
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:40.480
of threads about what we've done to kids.
So,
um,
uh,
and to have,
God,

187
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.270
this is a whole nother area conversation for us,

188
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:46.630
but we basically took away free play and gave them social media the same

189
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.630
basically kids who were born in 1995 and after Gen z they had really different

190
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:56.631
childhoods and they're not as prepared for conflict and college and we'll get

191
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.520
into that later.
But you put all these things together,

192
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:04.320
you get kids who are much more anxious and fragile,
much more depressed,
um,

193
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.320
coming on to campus at a time of much greater political activism.

194
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.820
And now these grievance studies ideas about America is a matrix of oppression

195
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:15.750
and look at the world in terms of good versus evil.
It's more appealing to them.

196
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.640
And it's that minority of students.

197
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.090
They're the ones who are initiating a lot of the movements.

198
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.010
<v 1>It's such a strange time to be on the outside and watched this because a person</v>

199
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:30.000
like myself is always counted on intellectuals and professors and people like

200
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:35.001
yourself to sort of make sense of things and to reinforce the idea that freedom

201
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:42.120
of speech and free debate are critical aspects to knowledge.

202
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.590
And one of the things that's most disturbing you see in schools is people that

203
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.130
are even marginally right leaning or centrist being called Nazis being silenced

204
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.740
<v 2>and they're pulling fire alarms when they're speaking.</v>

205
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.300
And even people like Christina Hoff summers who's a feminist gets shouted down

206
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.080
and,
and people yelling at her and calling her a fascist.
It's just very strange.

207
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:06.730
It's very strange to watch from the outside.

208
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.450
And it's also very strange to not see any pushback by the professors.

209
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.290
So sitting here and seeing this happen and thinking,
well,
these poor kids,

210
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.440
they're,
they're going to have to go into the workplace.
They're going to have to,

211
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.110
they're there right now.
They're in this very insulated environment.

212
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.330
They're going to escape that environment when they graduate.

213
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.710
And then they're either going to push this ideology into the workforce,

214
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:31.460
which you do see now,
especially with 10 classmates.
Yeah,
that's right now.

215
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:34.630
That's right.
I know it's strange to look at it from the outside and believe me,

216
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:37.810
it's stranger from the inside.
But one thing I can say that,
um,

217
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.140
that might be helpful here is that from the outside,

218
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.940
what you see is the news reports and the news reports are going to be very

219
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:49.810
selective.
And so especially what happens is because you know,

220
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:53.440
universities have always leaned left and so the right leaning media have always

221
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:54.310
been suspicious.

222
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.820
So the right leaning media has huge coverage of every little thing.

223
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.130
And sometimes it's,
it's exaggerated.

224
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.880
Sometimes it's misinterpreted the most time there was something there,

225
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.070
left leaning media tends to ignore it.

226
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.090
And so I go around the country and you know,
people in the right expect that,

227
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:13.600
oh my God,
it's chaos and mob violence on campus,
which isn't true.

228
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:16.510
That's an exaggeration.
And the left is like,
problem,
what problem?

229
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.030
There's nothing changing.
Um,

230
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.450
and so I think the key thing to keep in mind here is that there's about 4,500

231
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.550
institutions of higher education in this country.

232
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.460
Most of them are not selective schools.
They'll take anyone who comes,
um,

233
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.000
and in those schools,
not much is happening.
Um,

234
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.640
but if you go to the elite liberal arts colleges in the northeast and the west

235
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:40.530
coast,
then usually something is happening.
And so,
uh,

236
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.650
at Heterodox Academy,

237
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:44.170
it's a group that I cofounded of professors that are pushing back.

238
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.920
It's bipartisan.
We have as many people on the,
on the left is on the right.
Um,

239
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.270
we created a map of where all the shutdowns have taken place and they're all

240
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:55.930
right in the northeast or along the Pacific coast,
like from,
you know,
evergreen,

241
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.480
you know,
down to Berkeley and all that.
Uh,
and then a couple in Chicago.
So from,

242
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.490
in most of the country,
this stuff is not happening.
In most schools,

243
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:08.080
the culture hasn't really changed much,
but at the top schools in general,
it has.

244
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.240
Um,
so that's one thing to just keep in mind.

245
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:13.210
There is a moral panic on the right about this,

246
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.860
which doesn't mean that there's not something real,

247
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:16.630
there really is a huge problem,

248
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.060
but it's not as pervasive as it sometimes made out to be.

249
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.300
So is it akin to looking at violence in the news media like you,

250
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:28.840
your,
when you read about violence in terms of robberies and murders in general,

251
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:33.250
you're not going to encounter much in your life.
The world is a large place,

252
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.700
but we concentrate on these really bad moments.
Yeah,

253
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:41.230
it's a little bit like that except that,
um,
you know,
um,

254
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.820
one of the reasons that we took child,

255
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:46.780
we took free play away from kids is that we were afraid that they'd be abducted

256
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.060
and that almost never,
and that was so rare.
Uh,
and,

257
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.700
but we got a lot of coverage of that in the eighties and nineties

258
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 0>and we change our behavior because of that.
And that was a gross overreaction.</v>

259
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.240
The situation on campuses is not like that.
It's,

260
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:03.740
it's your odds of being nailed are much higher than that.
Um,
and so,
you know,

261
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:04.640
I hear every day,

262
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.880
or at least every week I get an email from a professor who says,
you know,
I,

263
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.680
I used a metaphor in class and somebody reported me.
And like,
you know,

264
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:15.470
and so once this happens to you,
you,
you,
you pull back,

265
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:16.730
you change your teaching style.

266
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.010
What we're seeing on campus is a spectacular collapse of trust between students

267
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:26.050
and professors.
And when we don't trust each other,
we can't do,

268
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.860
we can't do our job.
We can't,

269
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.180
we can't risk provoking being provocative,

270
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:35.450
raising new ideas,
raising uncomfortable ideas.
We have to play it safe.

271
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.720
And then everybody suffers.
Is social media partially to blame because it's huge.

272
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.790
Social media's a huge part of this problem.
So,
um,
uh,

273
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.500
in a couple ways.
So one is the generational thing that we have,
um,

274
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.720
kids born after 1995 got this in middle school.

275
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.250
It had a variety of effects on them.

276
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.450
So kids coming in are more conversant with call out culture.

277
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.400
And so that's a big part of this.
Um,

278
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.810
the other thing though is that we used to have what you would call a reasonable

279
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:10.730
person standard.
So,
uh,
you know,
so,
um,
you know,
for professor,
uh,

280
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:13.760
what's one,
so professor just wrote to me recently,
he said he,
you know,

281
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:16.910
he got frustrated while trying to explain something and he said,
oh,
shoot me now.

282
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:17.960
Um,

283
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.140
and student was offended by this because are you making fun of people committing

284
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:25.280
suicide and okay,
you know,
add,
she come to him and said,
you know,
professor,

285
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:27.720
I know you didn't mean anything,
but that was kind of insensitive.
Okay,

286
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.110
that would have been great.
Like that's the way to handle it.

287
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.030
But for this generation raised with call out culture and social media,

288
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.890
you almost never hear of a student coming to someone else in private because you

289
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:40.940
don't get credit for that.

290
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.880
So you only get credit when you call them out publicly.

291
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.330
And so that's why we're all walking on egg shells because most of our students

292
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:50.840
are great.
Most of them are fine.
But if I have a class of 300 students,

293
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.770
a lecture class,

294
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.360
I know that some of them subscribe to this new call out culture safety as a

295
00:16:56.361 --> 00:17:00.560
morality.
And so if I say one thing,
it's not a reasonable person standard.

296
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.810
It's a most sensitive person standard.

297
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.660
I have to teach to the most sensitive person in the class.

298
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.520
It's also that person has the opportunity to score right there.
Exactly.

299
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.450
Throw up that virtue flag.
Like I've got one on the board here.
Look what I did.

300
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:19.451
I nailed the professor on saying shoot me now and now I'm a hero and exited this

301
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:22.220
a safer space for everybody else that that's right.

302
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.180
And so and so that's really what is messing us up at so many levels of society

303
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.860
and the fact that a lot of these problems,
the difficulties of democracy,

304
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:33.300
the rise of authoritarian populism,
that there,

305
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.190
there are a lot of weird trends that are happening in multiple countries and I

306
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:41.840
think it's the rise of of devices and social media is the main way we can

307
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:43.850
explain why it's so similar across countries.

308
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.040
Do you think that this is us?

309
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:51.120
Is this some sort of a trend that will eventually correct itself when these kids

310
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:54.450
get out into the real world and then go through a whole generation of that and

311
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:58.800
then people realize the error of their ways and the disastrous results of having

312
00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:02.070
these unprepared or emotionally unprepared kids?
No,

313
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:04.320
I'm not confident that it will not correct itself.

314
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:07.080
I think that once we understand it,

315
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.480
I think they were writing things we can do to change it.

316
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.710
But here's the way to understand it and why it's not going to change itself.
So,

317
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.390
so I'm a,
I'm a social psychologist,
is my main,
my main area.
Um,
but I,

318
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:20.010
I love all of the social sciences.

319
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:24.570
I love thinking about complex systems and systems composed of people are really

320
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.930
different from systems composed of stars or neutrons or anything else.

321
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.580
And so if you have a complex system composed of people,

322
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.920
these people are primarily working to increase their prestige.

323
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.200
So,
I mean,
once we have our needs for,
you know,
food and things like that are set,

324
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.380
we're,
we're always interacting in ways to make ourselves look good.
Uh,

325
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:50.490
and to protect ourselves from being nailed or accused of something.

326
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.240
So we're always doing reputation management.
Now.
Um,

327
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.270
think about in any group,
what gives you prestige.

328
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.040
And so if you look in a group of teenagers,
you might have a group,
uh,

329
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.740
in which it's athletics.
And so if that's how you get prestige,

330
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.280
then all the kids are going to be working out and training and practicing.

331
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.680
And that doesn't hurt anybody.

332
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.680
That doesn't impose an external cost on anyone else.

333
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.620
But you can have some really sick prestige economies.
Uh,
and so there's a,

334
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.330
there's an ethnography about a fill a,

335
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:24.900
I'm an indigenous population in the Philippines,
uh,

336
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.180
by Shelly resolve though was the anthropologist,

337
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:30.090
I think it's called knowledge and passion about the along good,

338
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:33.060
which is a name for a,
a tribe in the Philippines.
And in this tribe,

339
00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:37.530
it's a headhunting tribe.
They find people and cut off their heads,

340
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.510
not just for fun,
for prestige.
So in a lot of societies,
um,

341
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.140
you have a lot of male initiation.
Boys have to do something to become a man.

342
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.100
And if the thing you have to do to become a man is you have to cut off someone's

343
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:51.570
head.
Okay?

344
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.980
So that imposes rather a heavy cost on outsiders.
All right?

345
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:58.590
So this is a sick culture.
This is not one where we can say,

346
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.360
oh well that's just the way they do things.
Okay,
this has to stop.
Um,

347
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.310
and ideally they would cut off a stranger's head.

348
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:07.520
Like they find someone from another tribe or someone you know,

349
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.560
from a government agency,
they're just cut off his head.
Um,
uh,

350
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.840
but if necessary,

351
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:15.960
if there's a fight or if there's somebody within their larger community that can

352
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:18.330
also get you points.
So this is a really sick culture.

353
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.460
Now head call it culture is not quite that bad,
but it's the same logic.

354
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.360
Okay?

355
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.360
So if you have a group of teenagers or college students who are all struggling

356
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:30.750
for prestige as we all are,

357
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:36.230
and if you get a sub culture in which the way you get prestige is by calling

358
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:39.630
someone out,
showing that they're racist,
sexist,
homophobic,
transphobic,

359
00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:43.620
Islamophobic,
whatever it is.
If you can catch them,
you get the points.

360
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.770
What you're doing here is your imposing an external cost,
others.

361
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.010
And that's what makes you so insufferable because you are playing your game.

362
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.290
But I'm paying the cost of your game.
And so that,

363
00:20:56.291 --> 00:21:00.610
I think it's hard to,
people aren't going to break out of that themselves.

364
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.620
But once we understand what's happening,

365
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.440
I think in a sense we can all come together and call out,

366
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:08.920
call out culture and say,
stop,
stop imposing these costs on us.

367
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.230
<v 1>But how are we going to reach those kids if professors are so terrified to speak</v>

368
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:17.800
out and to cause controversy in class and no one wants to criticize them?

369
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:22.000
Because if you do,
you risk your job,
you risk them organizing against you.
It

370
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.150
<v 0>the shift.
So the,</v>

371
00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:28.740
so I'm hopeful that we can shift it because most people hate it.

372
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.500
So even the people who do it recognize that they're always on eggshells.

373
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.560
They can be next.
Um,
there's the tendency of people in this culture to,
you know,

374
00:21:37.561 --> 00:21:40.840
as we say,
they eat their own.
They eventually turn on each other.
Um,

375
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.200
and the mental health costs of it.
I mean,

376
00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:46.620
there are a number of essays that have been written by people who sort of left

377
00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:50.870
that.
And it sounds miserable to be inside that you're always your,
you know,

378
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.680
there's no humor,
there's no fun.
It's always,
you know,
hyper serious,
angry.

379
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.850
Um,
and so,
um,
so I think that,

380
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.650
I think if we can,
uh,

381
00:22:01.651 --> 00:22:05.640
if we can raise kids or encourage them to see the games that social media makes

382
00:22:05.641 --> 00:22:08.220
them do and give them a vocabulary,

383
00:22:08.221 --> 00:22:10.380
I don't know what we should come up with some catchy terms for it,

384
00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:14.760
but give them a vocabulary so that they can,
they cannot be like,
oh,
you're,

385
00:22:14.761 --> 00:22:16.830
you know,
you're a calling out,
or I don't know,
that's a clunky,

386
00:22:16.831 --> 00:22:21.170
but we can help them label this behavior as mocket.

387
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.043
Exactly.

388
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.180
<v 1>There's patterns that you see in,
in people that</v>

389
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.100
from a distance,
like a,
if I look at it,
when I look at them objectively,

390
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:33.820
there's like these,
these patents,
I go,
oh,
that's one of those Mager guys.

391
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.260
He's one of those,
uh,
you know,

392
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:39.100
he's got an American flag with an eagle and his avatar on Twitter rant.

393
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:40.450
If you go through his page,

394
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.600
it's all like talking great about POTUS and criticizing anyone.

395
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:49.900
It talks about about trumpets.
It's strange.
It's like these patterns of behavior,

396
00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:52.420
these predetermined pattern,
there are stereotypes,

397
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.750
not just stereotypes like they've fallen into a well oiled slick groove that's

398
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.760
very easy to predict.
If you are one of those people,
it's,

399
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.060
it's super easy to predict that you're going to be pro second amendment.

400
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.240
It's super easy to predict that you're probably going to be skeptical about

401
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:11.260
climate change.

402
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.180
There's all these different things that go along with these patterns of behavior

403
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.750
and you see them on the right.
You see him on the left and the it's,

404
00:23:19.751 --> 00:23:22.960
it's weird to watch.
It's weird to watch on the outside is like,
well,

405
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.040
this is such an,
an easy pattern to slip into.

406
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.200
<v 0>Yeah.
Well that's right.
Um,
so,
uh,</v>

407
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.270
there's data from the Pew surveys.

408
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:35.410
They've been measuring attitudes of Americans since the eighties or nineties,
uh,

409
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.620
but they've been publishing this series on polarization in which they show that

410
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:42.280
in the 90s,
if you knew somebody that attitude on,
say,
gun control,

411
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.860
that would only predict their attitude on abortion a certain percent.

412
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.470
And a lot of people on the left,
let's say,

413
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.280
would hold six of the 10 leftist attitudes and same on the right.

414
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.310
But gradually by the time you get to around 2010,

415
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.950
it's like if you know one attitude,
you know them all.

416
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.770
And that's in part just because if you turn up the volume.

417
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.810
So we evolve to do us versus them.
And the more we see,

418
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.010
you know,
if it's us,
America versus them communist Russia or Nazi Germany,

419
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:11.480
what then,
you know,
then we all come together.

420
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:14.340
And that's great for social cohesion and trust.
Um,

421
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.010
but as that fades away and as us versus them became increasingly left versus

422
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:19.844
right,

423
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.380
and as we lost the liberal Republicans and the conservative Democrats,

424
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.890
those used to exist until the eighties or nineties,
um,

425
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.070
as we lost them once it becomes us versus them is left versus right now,

426
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:34.550
if you only hold your team's position on six out of 10 items,
you're a trader.

427
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.720
And so you better get with the program.
And so the pressures for conformity,

428
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:42.920
the pressures to agree with your team on everything had been steadily rising.

429
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.280
And that means there's no nuance and we can't do higher education without

430
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:53.450
nuance.
We can't do college without free thinking and the ability to say,
well,

431
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:56.870
you know what,
wait a second.
Maybe they do have a point on this,
on this thing.

432
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.260
And that's one of the reasons why it looks so weird from the outside and why

433
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:02.060
it's getting so unpleasant from the inside

434
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.800
<v 1>when you're teaching classes and a subject comes up that may be controversial.</v>

435
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:10.510
Do you,

436
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.080
do you have like this overwhelming feeling that you're treading on dangerous

437
00:25:17.651 --> 00:25:18.484
ground?

438
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.470
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
um,
I,</v>

439
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:24.410
I taught psych one on one at the University of Virginia and I would do all,

440
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.110
I would take them into,
you know,
sex differences,
origin of sex,

441
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.000
sexual orientation.
I would even do race differences.
Um,
and Eh,
you know,

442
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.450
because there was a reasonable person standard and I trusted my students and

443
00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:41.140
they trusted me and we had a great time and we covered a lot,
a lot of stuff.
Um,

444
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.320
but now and then I moved to New York University in 2011.
Um,
uh,

445
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.090
when my last previous book,
the righteous mind came out.
And it's not a,

446
00:25:48.091 --> 00:25:51.840
it's not about Uva versus Nyu is just about the changing time.
Um,

447
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:55.980
now as I said,
I have to teach to the most sensitive students.

448
00:25:55.981 --> 00:25:59.190
So I teach a course on business ethics,
on professional responsibility,

449
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.590
and we have a section on,
um,
uh,
on discrimination and employment law.

450
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.830
It's important to cover it.
We have to cover it,
you know,

451
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.870
Mba students have to know where the lines are,
what the lawyers.
Um,
and yeah,

452
00:26:09.871 --> 00:26:12.720
I'm kind of scared when I teach that.
Uh,
because you know,

453
00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:16.710
I'd like to get into all sorts of things.
Um,
I'd like to get into,
well,
you know,

454
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.780
what to numerical disparities mean if there's a gender difference in,
you know,

455
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.020
in the percentage of tech,

456
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.980
but not in the percentage of non tech employees in Silicon Valley.

457
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.560
Well what does that mean?
I would like to talk about that.

458
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.980
But if a single student thinks that I am denying the existence of sexism,

459
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.300
they could be offended by that.
And in every bathroom at Nyu,

460
00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:44.130
there's a sign telling them how to report me anonymously and they put these up

461
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:47.400
in 2016 in response to student requests.
Um,

462
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.180
and that means that all professors are on notice that they can be reported

463
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:55.270
anonymously at any moment.
But children,
well,
these are,
well,
uh,

464
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.530
I'm not going to call them children.
I mean my students are Mba students,
but uh,

465
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.550
but the undergrads,
1717 to 21 year olds for the undergrads.
Yes,
that's right.

466
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.960
Barely not children anymore.
That's right.
And there's an incentive to this,

467
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.560
this what we're talking about before.

468
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.750
There's this incentive that gives them attention.

469
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:16.350
They get prestige.
They get value from it.
And this,

470
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.050
that this culture encourages these things.
That's right.

471
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:22.650
And this is a terrible lesson to teach them.
Um,
so,
you know,

472
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:25.530
the subtitle of our book,
it's called the coddling,
the American mind,

473
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.510
how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.

474
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.990
And so these microaggression reporting system,
that's basically what it is.
Um,

475
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.780
a microaggression reporting system.
It has a good intention behind it.

476
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.470
Um,
there are cases of professors who make ethnic jokes.
Okay.

477
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:46.620
They should stop doing that.
I mean,
maybe that was okay 30 years ago.
You know,

478
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:50.460
there are,
there,
there are legitimate complaints and faculty do,

479
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.480
there should be some accountability,
some responsibility.

480
00:27:52.481 --> 00:27:53.730
So there's a good intention behind it,

481
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.180
but it's usually based on no empirical evidence.

482
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.900
And because it's based on pressure applied to a bureaucracy,

483
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.310
not by a committee thinking,
hmm,
how can we improve the climate for everyone?
No,

484
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:05.461
no.

485
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:08.910
It's like we make these demands and we demand 10 things and the administration

486
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:12.020
says,
okay,
we'll give you five of them.
Um,
um,

487
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:17.150
there's not thought put into what would happen if we give the students in East

488
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.320
German style anonymous reporting system.

489
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:22.590
And so everybody's on notice that they can be reported any point what might

490
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:27.210
happen to the social dynamics,
like nobody thought that through.
So the net,

491
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.590
the net effect again,

492
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:33.480
is the spectacular collapse of trust on campus to be in the middle of that.

493
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.230
It's gotta be so bizarre having taught for so many years before that and to

494
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:41.610
watch almost like this virus overtake the institutions,

495
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.800
that's what it felt like.
Um,
and that's why,
so,
you know,

496
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.820
Greg [inaudible] came to me in 2014 so Greg,

497
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:50.070
I'll just touch briefly tell this story of the book.
Um,

498
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.320
Greg is the president of the foundation for individual rights in education.
Um,

499
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:59.570
he fired and they defend free speech rights on campus and they were always

500
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.330
pushing back against administrators who would say,
Oh,
you know,

501
00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:07.530
we need a free speech zone.
And they're always afraid of liability.
And so,

502
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.080
but suddenly,
suddenly in 2014,

503
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:14.850
Greg start seeing students pushing back on,
on speech rate saying,
we want,

504
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:18.120
you know,
Bam,
that speaker,
you know,
uh,
uh,
we need,
you know,

505
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.350
a safe space if their debate is going to be held.
Uh,
new stuff,
weird stuff.

506
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.800
And Greg,
who is prone to depression,
um,

507
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.980
he had a suicidal depression in 2007.

508
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:32.970
He's hospitalized when he gets out of the hospital.
He learns CBT,

509
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.260
cognitive behavioral therapy.

510
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.600
And in that you learn these like 15 or so cognitive distortions like

511
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:44.140
catastrophizing.
Um,
I'm overgeneralizing black and white thinking.

512
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.520
So Greg learns to not do those himself.
And then he goes back to record fire.

513
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.760
And then in 2014 he sees students saying,
Oh,
if,
you know,

514
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:53.830
if Christina Hoff summers comes to campus,
you know,

515
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:58.570
people will die or there'll be,
you know,
people will be harmed,
injured.
Um,

516
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.370
and so there's this,
uh,
this new way of thinking and Greg thinks,
wow,

517
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.850
how are students learning to do this?
Like are,

518
00:30:05.851 --> 00:30:10.240
are we teaching them on campus to think in these distorted ways?
And if we are,

519
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.800
isn't that going to make them depressed?

520
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.250
So Greg comes to talk to me in May of 2014 to tell me this idea and I think it's

521
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:22.810
really brilliant.
I think it's a great idea cause I'd be going to see this,

522
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:26.170
you know,
the safe spaces that microaggression is,
the trigger warning requests.

523
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.400
Um,
so we,
we wrote up our,
our essay,
uh,

524
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.600
submitted to the Atlantic.

525
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:35.440
It came out in August of 2015 and it was like we were just seeing the first

526
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:39.580
outbreaks of a,
of a virus.
And then in the fall of 2015,
it's,

527
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:40.570
it becomes an epidemic.

528
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.650
And so many of your listeners will have heard of or seen the videos of what

529
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:48.580
happened at Yale,
um,
in,
in,
in,
uh,
November,

530
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.840
2015 when Erika Christakis wrote an email saying,
now wait a second.

531
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.420
Yale is telling you how to do your Halloween costumes.

532
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.280
Maybe we should think this through ourselves.

533
00:30:57.281 --> 00:31:00.430
Maybe you're old enough to make your own decisions.
Some students get very upset.

534
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.890
They protest,
they bring demands to the president.

535
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:04.840
They are screaming at her husband.
Uh,

536
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.080
so it was then when that protest was successful,

537
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:13.210
when the president of Yale basically said,
you know,
we,
we're wrong.

538
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:13.810
You're right.

539
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.190
We validate your narrative will give you as much as we can have your demands.
Um,

540
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.840
when,
when that happened,
then the protest went national.
And so throughout 2016,

541
00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:25.960
you have,
um,
you have groups of students making these demands,

542
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:27.730
demanding microaggression reporting systems.

543
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.810
So that's when Nyu put in its systems,
it's microaggression reporting systems.

544
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:36.040
So that Yale event wasn't just an isolated incident.
It really was the spark.

545
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.060
I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there's all these tree threads coming together.

546
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:42.220
It didn't come out of nowhere.
All these things are happening.

547
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:43.570
It's almost like the,
you know,
the whole,

548
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.080
the whole room is like almost at combustion temperature.

549
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.360
And then Yale was the spark that sent a national,

550
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.240
what's crazy about Yale is anybody that's objective that's watching from the

551
00:31:52.241 --> 00:31:54.250
outside.
It's like these students are out of control.

552
00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:56.140
They're screaming at this professor like,

553
00:31:56.141 --> 00:32:00.310
this is supposed to be a safe place and you know,
you fucked this up.
And they're,

554
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:03.610
they're,
they're being incredibly hostile and aggressive towards him.

555
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:06.660
And surrounding him.
And when you,

556
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.830
when you watch that from the outside you think,

557
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:11.500
well obviously they've got to punish these,
these students.

558
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.890
I mean I didn't know they did the opposite.
Yeah,
that's right.

559
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:17.980
The Mans that's well,
well it doesn't make sense from the outside,
but again,

560
00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:22.180
you have to look at different games being played.
So,
um,
so I went to Yale.

561
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:25.330
I graduated from there in 1985.
I loved it.

562
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.590
I was in Davenport College is one of the 12 residential colleges and there were

563
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:32.170
a lot of intellectual events that would happen in the colleges.

564
00:32:32.171 --> 00:32:35.830
Like the master of the college or the dean of the college would bring in all

565
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:36.820
kinds of people to speak.

566
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.080
So they were intellectual spaces as well as sort of home like,

567
00:32:41.081 --> 00:32:44.090
or not exactly home,
like,
like transitional places where they were,

568
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:45.200
they were places that you lived.

569
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.600
So the yield that I knew was a place that taught me to think in lots of

570
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:53.720
different ways and it just was constantly blowing my mind.

571
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.770
Like my took my first economics course.
It was like,
wow,

572
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:02.030
here's a new pair of spectacles that I can put on.
And suddenly I see all these,

573
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.760
you know,
prices and supply.
And like I never,

574
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.480
I never learned to think that way where I learned about Freud in psychology or

575
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:09.314
sociology.

576
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:14.710
So a good education is one that lets you look at our complicated world through

577
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:18.860
multiple perspectives and that makes you smart.

578
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:21.200
That's what a liberal arts education should do.

579
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.100
But what I see increasingly happening,
especially at elite schools,

580
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.160
is the dominance of a single story.

581
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.520
And that single story is life is a battle between good people and evil people or

582
00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:38.960
rather good groups and evil groups.
Um,
and,
uh,
it's a zero sum game.

583
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:43.000
And so if the bad groups have more,
it's because they took it from the,

584
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.030
the good groups.

585
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:49.370
And so the point of everything is to fight the bad groups,
bring them down,

586
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.260
create a quality.
Um,
and this is a terrible way to think in a free society.

587
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.880
I mean,
that might have worked,
you know,

588
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:59.210
in Biblical days when you got the mower bites to killing the Jebusites or

589
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:01.460
whatever.
Um,
but you know,
we,

590
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:06.461
we live in an era in which we've discovered that that the pie can be grown a

591
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:08.444
million fold.

592
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.900
And so to teach students to see society as a zero sum competition between groups

593
00:34:15.201 --> 00:34:18.400
is primitive and destructive.
Now in your book,
you,

594
00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:23.401
you actually identify the moment where these microaggressions sort of made their

595
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.920
appearance and they were initially a racist thing.
So yeah,

596
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:32.630
so the idea of a microaggression,
it goes back to,
um,
I forget the,

597
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:36.470
it's an African American sociologist in the seventies first coined the term,

598
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.800
but it really becomes popular in a 2007 article,
uh,

599
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.640
by Derald wing sue at teachers college.

600
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.300
And so he talks about this concept of microaggressions.

601
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.410
And there are two things that are good about the concert that are useful.

602
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.620
And so one is as racism as explicit racism has clearly gone down by any measure,

603
00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.490
explicit racism has plummeted in American across the West.
Um,

604
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.380
but you know,
there could still be subtle or veiled a racist claims.

605
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:09.580
So perfectly legitimate.
I want to find the difference between explicit racism.

606
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.590
Well,
explicit racism.
It is,
you know,
calling someone a racial slur.

607
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:14.640
I hate you because x,
um,

608
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.680
they're identified because of they've been reported as crimes or,
well,

609
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.720
I would just say that,
um,
if you are a member of a culture,

610
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.020
you can tell when someone is saying something to insult,

611
00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:30.260
to put down or to express hostility and that's something that judgment we can

612
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:34.910
make.
And as that's become socially unacceptable in most circles,

613
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.010
so explicit racism is way,
way down.
Right.

614
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.460
<v 2>But how,
I'm sorry,
but the,
my only question is how are they measuring us?</v>

615
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.590
Um,
that,
well,
how do you measure microaggression?

616
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.420
How do you measure even explicit racism?
How do you say it's down?
Um,

617
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.330
certainly attitude measures.
So there,
so surveys done in private.

618
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.070
How would you feel if a,
if a black family moved in next door,

619
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:02.850
if a Filipino family moved now?
So how would you feel if your child married a,

620
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:07.620
you know,
a Jew,
a Muslim?
So explicit surveys show it.
Um,

621
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:12.150
certainly,
um,
I mean if,
if,
when you do surveys of people's experience,

622
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.870
people have of race of every race when they report,

623
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:19.890
how often this happens to me every year the numbers are actually fairly low.
So,

624
00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.520
uh,
there are ways of measuring experiences of racism,
right?

625
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.260
How accurate are these?
Cause they're like,

626
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:30.140
first you start with a joke about this,
but the idea of the problem services,

627
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.150
you're only getting information from people.
So stupid.

628
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:35.790
They take surveys like who's taking servers?

629
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:39.780
So some surveys are subject to that.
But in general,

630
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.861
if you,

631
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:44.580
if you approach a question from multiple perspectives and say in one condition,

632
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:46.890
you pay them for an accurate answer or not.

633
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.540
When my condition they're anonymous or they're not.
Um,

634
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.550
so you can get a sense of how much the answer moves around depending on external

635
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:56.450
conditions.
Um,
and so anyway,

636
00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.380
the point I just wanted to make is that the acceptability of using the n word or

637
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:03.930
other things,
you know,
if a bunch of white people are talking,

638
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:07.350
the acceptibility using the n word,
I think has gone way down in general.

639
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.230
Would you agree with that?
Yes.
Yes,
tremendously.
I mean,
I,

640
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.120
I agree with the sentiment and I agree with the,
um,

641
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:20.160
the trend that there is absolutely a trend,
uh,
away from racism.

642
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.710
But I was just curious as how they measured it.
Yeah.

643
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.180
I'm not an expert in that area,

644
00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:29.181
so I'm assuming it's surveys and analysis of discourse ultimately for everyone's

645
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:30.751
sake.
I mean,

646
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:34.980
even for the sake of the people that are embroiled in all this controversy in

647
00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:39.600
chaos,
it would be fantastic across the board if there was no more sexism,

648
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.610
there was no more racism,
there was no more,

649
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:44.010
any of these things me would be wonderful.

650
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.750
Then we could just start treating puments as just humans.

651
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.040
Like this is just who you are.
You're just a person.
No one cares.

652
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.040
That would be what a wonderful world we would live in.

653
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:59.760
If this was no longer an issue at all.
Beautifully put it.
How does that get,

654
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.970
how does that ever get through?
So we were getting there again,

655
00:38:02.971 --> 00:38:06.330
that's what the 20,
I mean that's what the 20th century was about.

656
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.870
So you and I are shaped by,
I don't know how old you are,
but I'm the fun one.

657
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.530
Okay.
I'm 55.
Um,

658
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.730
we were shaped by the late 20th century and the late 20th century was a time in

659
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:20.340
America in which,
you know,
earlier on there was all kinds of prejudice.
I mean,

660
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:23.010
when I was,
so when I was born,
just right before you were born,

661
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.910
it was legal to say you can't eat here because you're black.
And so,
you know,

662
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:30.600
that changed in 1964 65.
Um,
but,
um,

663
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.980
it used to be that we had legal differentiations by race and then those

664
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.510
<v 0>were knocked down,
but we still had social.</v>

665
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.780
And it used to be that if you were gay,
there was something humiliating.

666
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.760
It had to be hidden.
And you,
you know,
I mean,

667
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.630
so if you look at where we were in 1960 or 63 when I was born,

668
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.330
and then you look at where we got by 2000,
I mean,

669
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:53.380
the progress is fantastic on every front.
So that's all.

670
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:58.060
I mean when I say we were moving in that direction and to your point about,

671
00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.680
you know,
wouldn't it be great if there was none of this?

672
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:02.230
We just treat people like people.
Okay.
Yeah.

673
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.540
That was the 20th century idea is let's,

674
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.600
let's get past these tribal identifications and what is so alarming to me now is

675
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:14.670
that on campus it began on campus but it's spreading elsewhere there and against

676
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.100
not everywhere on campus.
It's mostly in the grievance studies departments,

677
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.460
they're teaching students the opposite.

678
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:24.460
They're teaching students don't treat everyone like a person.

679
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.360
People are their identities and you can tell somebody's identity is by looking

680
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:30.280
at people and so you know if they're good or bad.

681
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:34.060
This I think is the opposite of progress.
Well it's,

682
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.830
<v 1>it's also the differences between us are really fascinating.</v>

683
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:42.450
The differences between men and women I think are some of the more interesting

684
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:48.090
explanations for human behavior and it,

685
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:53.210
and I'm not meaning that people must be defined by their gender are defined by

686
00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:57.900
their sacks.
And,
but it is interesting when you look at these gigantic groups,

687
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:03.000
like why certain people tend to gravitate towards certain occupations or certain

688
00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:06.180
types of behavior or certain hobbies.
It is really fascinating.
Yeah,

689
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.710
<v 0>that's right.
And if we were playing the truth seeking game,</v>

690
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:10.720
if all we cared about is trying to understand things,

691
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.910
we would do the research and we'd figure out what to people like in a,

692
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.010
and do lefthanders versus right handers have different preferences?

693
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.300
Probably not as far as I know.
Do Boys and girls have different preferences?
Yeah,

694
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:24.850
they're really big.
Uh,
do men and women have different,

695
00:40:24.851 --> 00:40:27.100
do they enjoy different things?
Yeah.
Um,

696
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.850
so we could take that and we could say our goal is to create a free society.

697
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:33.370
This is,
this is what the word liberal traditionally meant.

698
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.970
A society which people are free to construct a life that they want to live.

699
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.370
And so if you're born one race or another,

700
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.830
that should not in any way be a limitation.

701
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.830
And in the 20th century we made a lot of progress towards that ideal,

702
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.813
same painful

703
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.610
<v 1>saying we did.
Meaning that you,</v>

704
00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:52.000
you're implying that it ended but the progress hit a wall.

705
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.360
<v 0>Um,
yeah,</v>

706
00:40:53.361 --> 00:40:57.330
I shouldn't imply that because overall I think the trends are unstoppable.
Right.

707
00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:58.660
So I don't want to say that things are working.

708
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.040
<v 1>Yeah,
I agree.
But you feel like there is a slow down or</v>

709
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:06.960
<v 0>which,
yeah,
I think that,
so,
um,
so in chapter three of the coddling,</v>

710
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:11.340
Greg and I look at identity politics and one thing we really try to do is

711
00:41:11.341 --> 00:41:13.650
there's all these loaded terms and you know,

712
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.190
if somebody says social justice warrior,
okay,
you know a lot about them.

713
00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:19.920
If they said that,
like they're going to come at it and say,
oh,

714
00:41:19.921 --> 00:41:24.570
those SJWs and we don't do any of that.
We,
we say,

715
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.760
um,
um,

716
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.570
there are people on campus who are very focused on identity issues and on

717
00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:33.440
injustices based on identity.
And that's great.

718
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.110
And there's a lot to be concerned about.
And their right to do that.

719
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.670
Now how do they do it?

720
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:42.290
And there's two different ways you can either do what we call common enemy

721
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:43.520
identity politics,

722
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.840
which is where you say life is a battle between good grips and evil groups.

723
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.700
Let's divide people by,
you know,
by race.

724
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.070
So it's basically the straight versus everyone else.

725
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.280
Men versus all the other genders,
um,

726
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.970
and a white versus everybody else.
And so you look at,
you know,

727
00:41:58.971 --> 00:42:00.920
the straight white men,
they're the problem.

728
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.860
All the other groups must unite to fight the straight white man.

729
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.230
So that's one of the core ideas of intersectionality.

730
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.250
And so we say in the book is that leads to eternal conflict.

731
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.320
Much better is to,
is an identity politics based on common humanity.

732
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.440
So we don't say,
Oh to hell with that entity politics.

733
00:42:18.441 --> 00:42:21.920
We say you have to have identity politics until you have perfect justice and

734
00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:26.450
equality.
You have to have a way for groups to organize,
to push back on things,

735
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:27.620
to demand Jess,
that's fine.

736
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.580
But if you do it by first emphasizing common humanity,

737
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:33.950
that's what Martin Luther King did.
That's what Pauli Murray did.

738
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:38.240
That's what Nelson Mandela did.
This wonderful woman,
Pauli Murray,

739
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:41.300
she was a gay black,
um,
possibly trans,
um,

740
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:46.210
civil rights leader in beginning of the forties.
She says,
when my,
uh,
you know,

741
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.430
when my opponents draw a small circle to exclude me,

742
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:51.980
I shoulder a larger circle to include them.

743
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.340
I shall shout for the rights of all mankind.
And this is again,

744
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:56.270
when Martin Luther King did,

745
00:42:56.271 --> 00:43:00.320
he's relentlessly appealing to our white brothers and sisters.

746
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.230
He's using the language of America of Christianity.

747
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.520
Start by saying what we have in common and then people's hearts are open.

748
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:10.880
Where within a community now we can talk about our difficulties.

749
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:16.270
So it's the rise of common enemy identity politics on campus,

750
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.390
in the grievance studies departments especially that I think is an alarming

751
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:21.224
trend.

752
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.530
<v 1>Another thing that's alarming to me is the redefining of terms like sexism and</v>

753
00:43:25.531 --> 00:43:28.950
racism or sexism against men as impossible.

754
00:43:28.951 --> 00:43:31.020
Racism against White People's impossible,
right?

755
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.320
This redefining as these prejudices only exist if you're coming from a position

756
00:43:36.661 --> 00:43:40.710
of power that's really weird.
And it also,

757
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.730
it opens up the door to treating people as an other,

758
00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:50.210
literally the people that are the victims of racism are now using racism against

759
00:43:50.941 --> 00:43:55.220
other people and feeling justified because of it and it,

760
00:43:55.221 --> 00:43:59.190
and having a bunch of people that will agree with them that this is in fact not

761
00:43:59.191 --> 00:44:00.000
racism.

762
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.110
And this is pushing back on white privilege and saying all these different weird

763
00:44:04.111 --> 00:44:08.910
things that,
you know,
and,
and they feel really comfortable in saying these open,

764
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.350
racist,

765
00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:15.300
generalizing things about white people or about white men or about,

766
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:18.630
you know,
fill in the blank.
But whatever group that you're a,
you're attacking.

767
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.720
And it's,
it's really strange.
It's really strange to see.

768
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:24.720
<v 0>But again,
it makes sense if you look at the different games.
Yeah.</v>

769
00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:28.680
So if you're on university and you think you're playing the truth game and

770
00:44:28.681 --> 00:44:31.080
philosophers are great at this,
they're always unpacking terms.

771
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.940
And so you might try to define racism of our,

772
00:44:33.941 --> 00:44:36.760
or any sort of ism and you a common sense view.

773
00:44:36.761 --> 00:44:41.160
It would be an expression of hostility or resentment or limitation on a group

774
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:45.390
based on their identity.
Um,
but that's if you're playing the truth seeking game,

775
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:50.130
if you're playing the politics game or the warfare game,
um,

776
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.030
you want to define the terms to give your side maximum advantage.

777
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.990
So there's a wonderful social psychologist named Phil Tetlock at Penn,

778
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:01.620
at Wharton,
and he talks about these different mindsets we get into.

779
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:05.700
And one of them,
he calls the intuitive prosecutor.
So if,
if I'm,

780
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:10.701
if my goal as a scholar is to prosecute my enemies and maximally convict them,

781
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.380
and I am always trying to defend,
you know,

782
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:16.940
seven different identity groups against the straight white men,
they're the,

783
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:18.000
they're the accused.

784
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.010
I want to define my terms to make it maximally easy to convict.

785
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.520
And so I am going to say racism and microaggressions.

786
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.520
It doesn't matter what the intent was,
all that matters is the impact.

787
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.880
All that matters about the person felt that way.
As long as someone's offended,

788
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.590
I get to charge you with a crime.
So,
uh,
and also on racism,
um,

789
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.330
you can say as,
as you know,

790
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:46.620
a lot of kids are learning in high school that these days racism is prejudice

791
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.740
plus power.
So by definition,

792
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.800
a black person or a gay person or whatever,
any,
you know,

793
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.900
cannot be racist or whatever other term because they don't have power regardless

794
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:02.610
of their social class being taught.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So their professors are,

795
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:03.840
this is kind of their mouth.

796
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.390
This is taught in a number of high schools.
Uh,

797
00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:13.160
at my nephews went to Andover.
Uh,
they learned this offensive thing.
Yes.

798
00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.730
It's deep defensive children.

799
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.270
It's not just that it's offensive and obviously hypocritical.

800
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.280
It's that it's crippling.
Yes.
I mean,
can you imagine,
can you,
so look,
you've,

801
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.060
you've got kids,
right?
You have two,
two daughters,
right?

802
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:25.463
Because you have three daughters.

803
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:30.390
Can you imagine giving your daughter's a cloak of invulnerability where you say

804
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:34.110
you put this on,
now you get to attack others,

805
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.190
but no one can touch you.
Like this is going to warp their development,

806
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:42.270
power corrupts and even moral or rhetorical power corrupts as well.

807
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.120
How is this being taught though?
I mean,
how,

808
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.670
how is this because this different houses except as a part of a curriculum.

809
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.620
So because the goal is not truth,
the goal is victory over racism,
let's say.

810
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.210
And so if that's the case,

811
00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:59.211
you're going to focus on educating kids about their white privilege and um,

812
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.250
making end.
So that's what a lot of these privilege exercises are.
You know,

813
00:47:03.251 --> 00:47:05.500
you line kids up by their privilege and you and your,

814
00:47:05.501 --> 00:47:10.501
your goal is to make the straight white boys feel bad about their privilege and

815
00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:13.530
therefore talk less,
take up less space,

816
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:14.330
<v 1>their privilege.</v>

817
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.380
This is what we were talking about earlier about the goal is no racism.

818
00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:20.260
The privilege only exists if there's racism.

819
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.370
Like instead of concentrating on the privilege,

820
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:28.390
it only exists if people do preferentially treat certain preferential towards

821
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:30.160
certain races.

822
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.160
<v 2>If that doesn't exist at all,
then white privilege doesn't exist.
I'm actually,</v>

823
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.090
I'm not sure I'd agree with you on that.
So we also,
well,

824
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:41.710
so we had a funny episode last night and so my wife and I were out in La.

825
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:45.910
We were invited to the Golden Globes by,
by a friend.
And so we're here in la.

826
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.260
So we,
we,
um,
uh,

827
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.730
we go to bed in the hotel room and at two in the morning,

828
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.510
the guys pounding on the door saying,
come on,
let me in.
It's me,
it's me.

829
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.750
And you know,
I wake up and I go to the door and I,
and I say,

830
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.100
wrong room and he can't hear me.
So I opened the door a crack and just show him,

831
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.370
you know,
like,
look,
I don't know,
I don't know who you are and you know,

832
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:10.510
some drunk,
some drunk guy.
And uh,
and I said,
you know,
you've got the wrong room.

833
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.020
And I went back to bed and breakfast this morning.
My wife says,

834
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.160
why did you open the door?
Like,
how could you have done that?
I said,
you know,

835
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.200
we're in a nice hotel.
I mean,
what's,
you know,
what's gonna Happen?

836
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:23.620
And she made it clear like a woman would never have done that.
Like he was like,

837
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:24.700
you as a man,

838
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.850
you have the ability to go out in the world and engage with in a certain way

839
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:30.340
that I don't have as well.
I,
that's a great example.

840
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.050
So there is a kind of male privilege.
Sure exists.
Even if there's no sexism.

841
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:40.240
Yeah,
that's an interesting,
that's an interesting example.
Um,
that's a,

842
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.650
that's a sexism one,
but that's also a physical danger one.
Yeah,
that's it.

843
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.021
There's a,

844
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:48.670
there is a difference between just the way women have to go out into the world

845
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.190
being vulnerable and also being the target of,

846
00:48:52.191 --> 00:48:57.070
of just a male sexual attention.

847
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.670
It's a very different thing.
It's an aggressive person.
Dangerous thing.
Yeah.

848
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.890
But I,
I think you could say the same thing about race in this way.
So,
um,

849
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.230
cause there's racism though.
Well,
okay.
Okay.
You're right.
If,

850
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.920
if there was absolute zero racism,
right.
Anywhere,

851
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.630
but we're never going to get to that.
But,

852
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.690
but the thing that we're worried about is the racism.

853
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:20.500
So like if you worried about if someone's,
if you say you have white privilege,

854
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:25.390
well that only exists if you're being dealt with in a racist manner.

855
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:30.570
So if you're a black person and there is racism that's being directed towards

856
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:33.820
you and it's not being direct towards me,
then you can say,
well,

857
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:37.300
I have white privilege.
But if there's no racism directed towards anybody,

858
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:41.590
that doesn't exist anymore.
But the kitchen was racism.
Yes.
Right.
Okay.

859
00:49:41.591 --> 00:49:42.880
But so look,
I think it's,

860
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.960
it's helpful to always try to look at it from the other person's point of view

861
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.270
and to listen to their arguments and stuff.
For example,

862
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.150
when you and I go into any social encounter,

863
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:55.250
it never occurs to me that something,
you know,

864
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.970
something's gonna come up and someone's going to call me a Kike,
let's say,

865
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.860
you know,
cause I'm,
I'm Jewish and it just,

866
00:49:59.861 --> 00:50:03.330
it just never crosses my mind that someone's going to humiliate me because I'm

867
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.140
Jewish.
Um,
um,
but if you're black,
even if you're in a very tolerant society,

868
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.340
at some point someone is going to make an assumption,
it might not be fast.

869
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.530
It might be.
So all I'm saying is you and I don't,

870
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.920
there are certain things we don't have to think about and that whereas if we

871
00:50:17.921 --> 00:50:20.920
were black or other identities or visibly gay or you know,

872
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:25.000
there would be the risk of spoiling of a social interaction.

873
00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:28.610
So I'm totally comfortable saying we should be telling our kids about this.

874
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:30.890
But what follows from it?
What follows from it?

875
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.860
Should we therefore be telling kids?
Okay,
so you know,
um,
you know,

876
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.240
judge people based on their appearance,
um,

877
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.340
be suspicious of people based on their race and gender.
That's where,

878
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.710
that's where I get off the bus,
the bus.
That's where I say,

879
00:50:45.711 --> 00:50:47.060
now we're really hurting kids.

880
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.810
We should be turning down the moralism and we're turning it up.
Right.

881
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.370
But what I'm getting at is pointing at someone and saying,

882
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:59.750
you have white privilege.
If they are not racist,
you're,
you're,
you're,

883
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.650
you're giving this person,
you're,
you're putting these PR,

884
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.600
this person in a category that really only exists in the face of racism where

885
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:10.490
the real problem is racism.
Yes.

886
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.160
Well the male female thing is a very different way.

887
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:16.700
That male privilege I think is way more slippery and wave cause it's

888
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:19.250
biologically based.
There's a creepiness to men.

889
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.180
And then there is as much as a nice guy as I'm sure you are,

890
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:27.080
and I try very hard to be a nice guy too.
Just kidding.

891
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.890
But every woman's encountered creeps.
Yes.
It's,
it's inevitable because it's,

892
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:35.720
there's a a game being played this pursuing of sexual pleasure or of,
of,

893
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:40.370
of sexual encounters.
This doesn't exist or it shouldn't exist with races.
Yeah.

894
00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:41.820
The just the,

895
00:51:41.821 --> 00:51:46.821
the real problem in my eyes is racism and if we could figure out a way to just

896
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:50.550
complete,
obviously it's not going to let people are flawed.
They're,

897
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.380
they're going to be in until there's some sort of new way that we interface with

898
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:58.400
each other that eliminates lies and deception and allows each other to

899
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:00.830
completely understand each other's feelings and appreciate them,

900
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.940
which may happen some day,
probably technologically driven till that happens.

901
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:09.080
There's going to be a certain amount of it,
but the real enemy is racism.

902
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:13.100
It's not white people just getting lucky.
Yeah,
I'm okay.

903
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:17.250
But I would say not that we shouldn't acknowledge it.
Yeah.
So you,

904
00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:20.610
you said earlier about how definitions change.

905
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.150
So we are evolving as a society.

906
00:52:23.151 --> 00:52:26.540
We're getting less sexist and racist and so our threshold for what counts as

907
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:29.060
sexist and racist is going down.
That's a good thing that should happen.

908
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.200
But I think what we need to call attention to is that when you,

909
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:36.020
if you lower the threshold faster than the reality changes,

910
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:40.700
then you make progress.
But yet people feel worse and worse.
And so,
um,

911
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:44.600
and so I think that's part of what's happening on campus that makes sense.
The,

912
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.280
the progress.
So the,
the,

913
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.040
the loudest protest tend to happen at the most progressive schools.

914
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:53.570
It's places like Middlebury and Yale and Berkeley.
Um,
and you know,

915
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.930
so I think that we are,
we are,

916
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.710
if you bring in a diverse student body and we're all trying to diversify,

917
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:01.311
we're all in,

918
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:05.000
every school I know of is trying very hard to create a very diverse student
body.

919
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:09.140
So if we do that and we bring people in and we give them a common humanity

920
00:53:09.141 --> 00:53:13.730
approach,
it's going to work great.
Diversity.
If you handle it well,
you,

921
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:17.960
it can confirm many benefits,
but if you handle it wrong,

922
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:22.280
if you try to make people see race and other groups more and you attach moral

923
00:53:22.281 --> 00:53:25.740
valence to it and you give them a lot of the stuff they get in the grievance

924
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:26.010
studies,

925
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.060
<v 0>of course they're going to be angry.</v>

926
00:53:27.061 --> 00:53:29.190
And of course they're gonna feel that people hate them.

927
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.850
It's a terrible thing to bring people into a university and to teach them,

928
00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:36.600
you know what this institution is white supremacist people have implicit bias

929
00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:39.480
against you.
Wherever you go,
people are going to hate you.
Like,
no,

930
00:53:39.481 --> 00:53:42.480
this is a really bad thing to do to create an open,
trusting,
inclusive,

931
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:43.314
diverse environment,

932
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:43.831
<v 1>right?</v>

933
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:48.690
The right thing to do would be to emphasize how foolish racism really is and

934
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:51.120
about how damaging it is,
not just to our culture,

935
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:54.660
but to use an individual to look at people in that way and not open your heart

936
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:56.160
and your mind to all these different races.

937
00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:01.550
And I think one of the worst examples of modern racism that's gone on checked is

938
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:07.551
what's going on at Harvard with Asian students or Asian students are instead of,

939
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:13.440
instead of being completely neutral in terms of how they approach all these

940
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:13.951
races,

941
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:18.000
Asian students actually have to try harder to get into Harvard and there because

942
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:20.590
there's so many of them and they're doing so well.
Yeah.

943
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:25.090
They're being punished for excelling,
which is really racist.
I mean you're,
it's,

944
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:29.340
it's racist against the people that are doing the best,
which is really crazy.

945
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:33.960
And there are minority,
which is even more crazy.
And because of their culture,

946
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:38.961
because they're so hard working and they're not in general than the,

947
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:42.890
not the type to be really loud and protests these things.
Right.

948
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.260
It's gone on the target targeted to the point where now they've had to have a

949
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:47.280
class action lawsuit.

950
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:52.140
<v 0>That's right.
That's right.
So,
you know,
my hope,
again,
I'm a 20th century person.</v>

951
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:54.440
My hope is that as time goes on,
we'll get past all of this.

952
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:59.010
You have to be a 21st century person.
Oh,
you have to.
Well,
okay.
But you know what,

953
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.690
the there are,
okay,
wait,

954
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:05.700
moral cultures evolve and they don't always evolve in a positive way.

955
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.290
And so I think the evolution late 20th century was incredibly positive.
Um,

956
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:12.300
and I think we are,

957
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:16.710
I think young people are losing touch with some of the hard one lessons of the

958
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:20.010
past.
Um,
so I'm not going to say,
oh,

959
00:55:20.011 --> 00:55:21.960
we have to just accept whatever morality is here.

960
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:26.580
I still am ultimately a liberal in the sense that what I dream of is a society

961
00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:30.300
in which people are free to create lives that they want to live and they're not

962
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:32.770
forced to do things.
They're not shamed.
Um,

963
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.280
there's a minimum of conflict and we make room for each other.

964
00:55:35.281 --> 00:55:36.480
If we're going to have a diverse society,

965
00:55:36.481 --> 00:55:40.620
we've really got to be tolerant and make room for each other.
That's my dream.
Um,

966
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.370
and I think in the last five or 10 years we've gotten really far from that.
Um,

967
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.550
I mean the,
you know,
my first book,

968
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:51.240
the happiness hypothesis was about 10 ancient ideas.
Um,
and you know,

969
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:55.300
ones that were too judgmental,
you know,
judge not lest ye be judged.
Uh,

970
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.650
but I think the new version of that,
if there was a 21st century Jesus,
he'd say,

971
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:01.920
judge a lot more judge all the time,
judge harshly,

972
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:04.980
don't give anyone the benefit of the doubt and don't let anyone judge you like

973
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.910
that is not going to be a recipe for a functioning society.
So No,

974
00:56:08.911 --> 00:56:11.760
I do not accept this aspect of 21st century morality.

975
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:16.530
<v 1>Well you're,
you're obviously much more entrenched in it than I am.
Um,
my hope,</v>

976
00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:17.760
and this might be naive,

977
00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:22.970
is that what these far left and far like the really extreme,

978
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.080
what it represents is the,
the,

979
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:31.110
the extreme poles of this shifting thing so that the whole thing is going to

980
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:35.290
move closer to a better place and you're always going to have really extreme,

981
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.860
but you're always going to have white supremacy and you always going to have

982
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:39.990
extreme social

983
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.530
<v 0>justice people.
You're suggesting it's a pendulum that I,</v>

984
00:56:43.531 --> 00:56:46.230
some things are pendulums,
some are not.
Yeah.
Okay.

985
00:56:46.231 --> 00:56:49.390
So there are problems of progress.
Um,

986
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:54.010
there are some things that are kind of one way.
So,
um,
you know,
so I'm Kinda,

987
00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.100
I'm often pessimistic about certain social trends,

988
00:56:56.101 --> 00:56:59.140
but I'm very influenced by Steve Pinker,
who I know you've had on the show.
Uh,

989
00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.260
and,
uh,
Matt Ridley and others who say,
look,

990
00:57:01.261 --> 00:57:05.040
the arc of progress is amazingly rapid,
is all good.
And you know,

991
00:57:05.041 --> 00:57:08.190
Nick Kristoff just had a column that last year was the best year in human

992
00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:11.720
history if you look at overall human welfare.
So that's all true.
Um,

993
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:17.780
but there are certain things that happened with progress that lead to certain

994
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:22.710
countervailing trends that are not like pendula.
Uh,
and so for example,

995
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.270
um,
okay,
here's one.
Um,
uh,

996
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:28.420
kids,
it's,
it,

997
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:33.360
it seems pretty clear that that human beings need a certain amount of hardship,

998
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:38.400
stress and challenge in order to develop basic human abilities.
Um,

999
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:43.240
kids who are neglected and abused are,
are damaged.
I mean,
if,
if,

1000
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.620
if it goes beyond certain limits,
uh,
you,
you have chronic stress,

1001
00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:49.140
you can have brain damage.
So we as we've,

1002
00:57:49.141 --> 00:57:52.110
as we've gotten rid of a lot of the worst things,
that's great,

1003
00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.740
but as we're making life better and better and easier and easier for kids is

1004
00:57:55.741 --> 00:57:58.500
we're protecting them from more and more.
We're,

1005
00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.420
we're preventing them from basically expanding their abilities and so it's

1006
00:58:03.421 --> 00:58:05.040
possible that as we,

1007
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:10.100
as we get wealthier and safer and more humane and more caring and as we have

1008
00:58:12.001 --> 00:58:13.890
smaller and smaller families,

1009
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.730
as we get richer all over the world so that you have two parents spending all

1010
00:58:17.731 --> 00:58:18.990
this time with one kid,

1011
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:23.730
it's possible that we are interfering with kids' development to the point where

1012
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:27.060
we might have an epidemic of anxiety and depression that could happen.

1013
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.270
Oh wait a second.
It has,
so you know,

1014
00:58:30.271 --> 00:58:35.070
I think that there are certain problems of progress that are not pendula.

1015
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:40.620
They change things and those changes have some negative repercussions that we're

1016
00:58:40.621 --> 00:58:43.260
going to have to actively fix.
It's not going to swing back by itself.

1017
00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:45.210
What concerns me

1018
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.960
<v 1>when you're talking about all these ideas is that there's a restriction on how</v>

1019
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:54.850
you are able to communicate to children or to students I should say,

1020
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:59.410
to young people,
um,
how their minds work and how they're there,

1021
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:04.090
how these patterns can form and how,
you know,
this,

1022
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.990
this pattern can be ultimately damaging to them,

1023
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:11.590
but yet it feels rewarding in the act of doing it.

1024
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:15.820
And that their own patterns that they're involved in right now might be

1025
00:59:15.821 --> 00:59:19.180
incredibly problematic for them in the future.
But if you bring it up,

1026
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:22.190
you're criticizing who they are,
who they are as a human,

1027
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.840
you're disregarding your white privilege,

1028
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:26.640
you're doing all these different things that you can't really do.
You,
you,

1029
00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:30.950
you're doing all these things that could run into these problems with this sort

1030
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:35.540
of new paradigm.
And w w what,
how do you,

1031
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:38.150
how do you mitigate that when you teaching kids?
Like how do you,

1032
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:42.260
how do you talk to them about the way the mind works when it's involving these

1033
00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:45.050
critical things that are like incredibly sensitive to discuss today?

1034
00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.070
<v 0>Um,
okay.
So let's,
uh,
you might be talking about like issues like race and sex,</v>

1035
00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.670
race and sex and gender and,
okay,
let's go back to the beginning.

1036
00:59:53.671 --> 00:59:58.260
Let's start with child development and let's,
let's,
let's start with,
um,

1037
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.520
what should we be doing with kids to make them tougher so that,
you know,

1038
01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:06.690
as they live in the world is a safer and safer cars are safer,

1039
01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.610
the death rate for kids is,

1040
01:00:08.611 --> 01:00:11.850
has been plummeting for all and we'll all causes other than suicide,

1041
01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:16.410
which has gone up.
Um,
so as kids live in a safer and safer world,

1042
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.120
they also have the internet,

1043
01:00:18.121 --> 01:00:21.120
which is going to expose them to virtual insults for ever and ever.

1044
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:26.280
So how are we going to raise kids to be maximally effective in this new 21st

1045
01:00:26.281 --> 01:00:30.510
century world,
which is physically very safe but virtually unsafe.
Okay.

1046
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.370
How are we gonna do that?
Um,

1047
01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:35.760
and I think the key idea that we need to put on the table here and that I think

1048
01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:40.590
everybody who works with kids needs to keep in mind every day is antifragility.

1049
01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:44.370
I know you've talked about that on this show before,
but I'll just,
I should,

1050
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.580
I can just give a very brief explanation of it cause it's such an important

1051
01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:49.580
concept.
Um,
so,
uh,

1052
01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:53.640
antifragility lot of listeners will know is a word coined by Naseem to lab.

1053
01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:55.380
The Guy who wrote the Black Swan,
um,

1054
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.300
because there are certain systems and he was,

1055
01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.940
I think he was motivated by the collapse of the banking system.

1056
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:04.680
So he had predicted the collapse because he said the banking system is really

1057
01:01:04.681 --> 01:01:08.880
convoluted and it's never been tested.
A system needs to be tested,
challenged,

1058
01:01:08.881 --> 01:01:11.850
shocked in order to then develop defenses against it.

1059
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.480
And our system has not been tested.
So if anything goes wrong,
it's all gone down.

1060
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:18.600
All right.
You reference him quite a few times.
Yes,
that's right.

1061
01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:21.620
He's really concept of venture,
fragile.
That's right.
It's a key idea in,

1062
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:24.720
in our book and if I find,
as I talk about this around the country,

1063
01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:26.700
once you explain this to people who work with kids,

1064
01:01:26.701 --> 01:01:29.010
like everybody gets it right away.
All right.
So,

1065
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:33.990
so to lab says there is no word for this property.
He says,

1066
01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.790
we,
we,
we know that some things are fragile.

1067
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:39.090
And so like if you have a glass of a wine glass on the table,
you knock it over.

1068
01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.620
It breaks.
Okay.
It doesn't get better in any way.
And so,
uh,
you know,

1069
01:01:43.621 --> 01:01:44.680
you don't give kids a wineglass.

1070
01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:47.730
You give them a plastic sippy cup because plastic is resilient.

1071
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:51.600
But if a kid knocks over sippy cup,
it doesn't get better in any way.

1072
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:56.580
And to let wanted to know what's the word for things that do get better when you

1073
01:01:56.581 --> 01:02:00.120
knock them over.
And the classic example is the immune system.

1074
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.180
So the immune system is an incomplete system.

1075
01:02:03.181 --> 01:02:08.120
It's a miracle of evolution that we have this system for making antibodies.
Um,

1076
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:10.920
but it doesn't know exactly what to be reactive to.

1077
01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.960
That has to be set by childhood experience.

1078
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.180
And so if you keep your kids in a bubble and you use bacterial wipes and you

1079
01:02:18.181 --> 01:02:21.630
don't let them be to bacteria,
you're crippling the system.

1080
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:24.540
The system has to get knocked over.
It has to get challenged,
threatened.

1081
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:28.920
It has to have,
uh,
and it has to learn how to,
uh,
expand its abilities.

1082
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.800
And so,
um,
so this is why peanut allergies are going up.
Yeah.

1083
01:02:32.801 --> 01:02:34.980
Those are really shocking part of your book.
That's right.

1084
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:37.980
It's stunning how fast this happened.
Please explain that to people.

1085
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:40.140
The whole peanut allergy thing.
Yeah.

1086
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:44.040
So peanut allergies used to be really rare and most of us,
you know,
older folk,

1087
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:46.850
we brought peanut butter sandwiches to school.
Uh,

1088
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:51.240
and when my son Max started preschool in,
uh,
2008,

1089
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.880
you know,
they went on and on about no nuts,

1090
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:55.810
nothing that touched and not nothing that looks like a nut,

1091
01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.120
nothing that has the word nutty.
I mean,

1092
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:01.440
it was crazy how defensive they were about nuts.
And as we write in the book,

1093
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:04.830
I thought back on that and I said,
wait a second,
like,
why?
You know,

1094
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:07.650
we're freaking out about nuts.
And the more we freak out about it,

1095
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.330
the higher the allergy rate goes.

1096
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:13.790
And it turns out there was a study done and published in 2015 where the

1097
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.800
researchers noticed that the allergy to nuts is only going up in countries that

1098
01:03:19.351 --> 01:03:23.790
tell pregnant women to avoid nuts.
And they thought,
well,
maybe that's why.

1099
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.100
And so they did a controlled experiment.

1100
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:31.101
They've got about 600 women who had given birth recently and ha and whose kids

1101
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:36.610
were at higher risk of an allergy cause they had eczema or some other,
you know,

1102
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:37.830
immune system sort of issue.

1103
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.900
So about 300 of them are told standard advice,
your kids at risk,

1104
01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:43.800
the peanut allergy,

1105
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.240
so you should not eat peanuts while you're lactating and keep peanuts weaken

1106
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:53.070
from your kid.
And the other half were told,
here is an Israeli snack food.

1107
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:57.330
It's a popcorn with a peanut,
a peanut powder dusting on the outside,

1108
01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.040
give it to your kids,
starting at,
you know,

1109
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:01.950
three or four months or whenever they're ready to eat.
And so,

1110
01:04:01.951 --> 01:04:03.980
and they monitor them,
they made sure that they weren't,
you know,

1111
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:08.460
fatal reactions or,
or,
or strong reactions.
And then,
uh,
at the age of five,

1112
01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:11.070
they gave them all a very thorough immunological test.

1113
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:16.200
And of the ones who followed the standard advice,
17% had a peanut allergy.

1114
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.720
They would have to watch out for peanuts for the rest of their lives.

1115
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.150
That's just such a high number because these were,

1116
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.440
because these were kids who are already predisposed and but the half that were

1117
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:28.230
predisposed,
but give him peanut powder,

1118
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:33.360
3% just 3% had a peanut allergy at age five.
In other words,

1119
01:04:33.361 --> 01:04:38.280
we could almost wipe out peanut allergies by giving peanut powder to kids and

1120
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:40.140
see it just a few months ago in science.

1121
01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:43.800
The front page article was on doing that.
And so again,

1122
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920
good intentions and bad ideas.
We're trying to protect her kids soap.
Oh,

1123
01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:47.760
keep them away from peanuts.

1124
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:51.750
But that's exactly the wrong advice because kids are antifragile and so we're

1125
01:04:51.751 --> 01:04:52.584
doing the same thing.

1126
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:56.640
The real issue was the people that have an actual severe allergy of what's your

1127
01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:59.910
child.
Yeah.
Yes.
But that's what the science article was about,

1128
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:05.130
was that a exposure therapies are being tested and they are the most effective.

1129
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:09.560
So you just,
you just have to start slow.
So you give them a very small,

1130
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.420
exactly.
Yeah.

1131
01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.490
Cause it was on a plane once and they informed us that they didn't want us to

1132
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:18.370
even eat peanuts on the plane because there someone on the plane that was so

1133
01:05:18.371 --> 01:05:22.420
allergic,
right.
That if you eat peanuts and you chew it and it's in the air,

1134
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.030
it could adversely affect that person.
Yeah.
And that could well be true.

1135
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:26.530
So I have no objection to that.

1136
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.370
But the reason we got to that point is because we started banning peanuts long

1137
01:05:30.371 --> 01:05:34.090
ago.
So this is one of these have,
I'm not sure if it's a problem of progress,

1138
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:37.510
but as we know it's not necessarily,
but,
um,

1139
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.880
but it's an example of antifragility.
Right.
Okay.

1140
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:43.360
So now let's bring this to the playground.
All right.
So,
um,
you know,
when,

1141
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:44.760
when you and I were kids,
you know,

1142
01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:47.890
boys and girls have different social interactions,
but boys tease each other,

1143
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:50.940
right.
And salt each other.
You throw around insults,
right?
Yeah.

1144
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.050
And that's part of developing to be a boy.

1145
01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:58.290
Now if it turns into bullying like a bunch of kids or why are after one kid day

1146
01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:02.440
after day?
Okay,
that's terrible.
We have to do something about that.

1147
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:04.150
I'm not saying bullying is okay,

1148
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:08.650
but as we've cracked down on bullying and as we've gotten more and more

1149
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.570
sensitive about harm in general,
we're cracking down on any kind of teasing,

1150
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:18.440
cruelty exclusion.
So my kids go to New York City public schools,
uh,

1151
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:21.490
which are generally pretty good.
Um,
but on the playground,
you know,

1152
01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:25.060
there's a monitor and the playground monitor,
you know,
if there's conflict,

1153
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:28.990
he comes and checks it out.
If a kid is crying,
he checks it out.
Um,
you know,

1154
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.340
seems like a good thing to do,

1155
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.580
but it's like treating kids like they're allergic to peanuts.

1156
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.520
Kids have to have thousands and thousands of conflicts.

1157
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:39.070
They have to be exposed to insults and exclusion and teasing.

1158
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.420
And if you can imagine,

1159
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:44.500
if you could keep your daughter in a protective tank when nobody would tease her

1160
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:48.940
or insult or hurt her feelings for 18 years,
would you do it?
Absolutely not.

1161
01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:53.260
It's not.
It's,
it's important that they do experience.
Some assholes,

1162
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:56.470
they just have to know.
But the,
on the flip side,

1163
01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:59.620
there are certain people that are damaged for the rest of their life,

1164
01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:02.620
by bullies and some like I have a friend,
um,

1165
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.210
and his brother used to beat him up when,

1166
01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.530
when they lived together and it still fucks with him to this day.

1167
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.210
And he's in his 50s.
He,

1168
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:14.010
I think he has a certain level of depression that's directly correlated.
Right?

1169
01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.870
I mean,
I can't say about your friend,
but the research shows,

1170
01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:21.700
the research does show that,
um,
bullying can leave permanent scars.

1171
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.820
So there are a couple of things we have to keep our eye on.

1172
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.930
Kids are antifragile yes,
but,
but,
um,
two things.

1173
01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:33.820
One is they need challenges that are graded to their level of ability.

1174
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:39.270
So if they're overwhelmed and if the suffering goes on day after day.

1175
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:42.760
So if kids are bay,
if their brain is bathed in cortisol.

1176
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:46.720
So cortisol is a normal stress hormone.
You have to experience stress,

1177
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:49.480
you have to have cortisol.
And then it drops goes up and down,
up and down.

1178
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:52.900
But kids who were raised either in an environment where they're bullied or

1179
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:55.930
they're abuse at home,
they don't have a secure attachment relationship,

1180
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:00.070
then they get brain damage,
then you,
you,
you're hurting kids if it's chronic.

1181
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.470
So I'm in no way saying bullying as,
okay,
I know you to keep,

1182
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.160
you got to keep the line right.
But,
but again,

1183
01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:10.570
you have to look at each institution.
So each school is not thinking,

1184
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:11.853
hmm,

1185
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:16.070
how can we carefully draw the line between bullying and valuable sorts of

1186
01:08:16.071 --> 01:08:21.030
conflict?
No.
They're thinking,
well,
if we do this well,
we get sued.
Right?

1187
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:23.450
And if we're not really careful that bullying,
we're gonna get sued.

1188
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:28.850
And so let's overreact.
Let's go this way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's unfortunate.

1189
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.740
Really.
Um,
but how do you decide how much bullying is accept?

1190
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:37.550
Like snake venom,
but giving them a little bit so they develop a tolerance?
Yeah.

1191
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:40.460
Well,
so there's,
um,
we,
so we did some research on bullying.

1192
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:44.330
We didn't put it in the book because while we suspect that anti bullying

1193
01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:47.660
policies that,
that go too far and that band conflict,

1194
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.030
while we suspect that those are harmful,
we couldn't prove that.

1195
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:51.710
So we didn't put this in the book,
but the,

1196
01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:55.400
the traditional definitions of bullying are actually pretty reasonable.
Uh,
I'm,

1197
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.080
I hope I can remember it exactly.
It's like there's a,
uh,

1198
01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:03.020
there's like a power differential and it's a chronic,

1199
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:07.250
you know,
it goes on for,
you know,
multiple,
multiple days.
Um,

1200
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:11.000
and originally there was a,
actually a threat of violence,
um,

1201
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:12.770
had to be at least a threat of violence.

1202
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:15.010
I think that was the original definition.
Uh,

1203
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:18.650
and then that was expanded gradually.
Um,
um,

1204
01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.050
so it doesn't have to be necessarily threat of violence,

1205
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:26.120
but it has expanded so far that like,
my kids use the term.

1206
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:30.470
If one kid is mean to another,
they'll call that bullying.
And that's too far.

1207
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.890
So I think you have to keep your eye on the key features too far.

1208
01:09:33.891 --> 01:09:38.660
If a kid is mean,
yeah,
you can't call it.
So,
um,
so,

1209
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.020
uh,
like on the,
on the playground for my daughter,

1210
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.510
the girls would form these clubs.

1211
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.170
And so my daughter was in the Kitty cat club that got what three girls called

1212
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:51.330
themselves and they'd be in a corner and they'd say,
Oh,
you can't,
you know,

1213
01:09:51.331 --> 01:09:53.950
you can't join us.
You're not in the Kitty cat club.
Um,

1214
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:58.790
that's mean that's exclusion,
right?
We can't have that.
Right.

1215
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.050
So the,

1216
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.960
so you don't have to like allow everyone in your group because you don't want to

1217
01:10:02.961 --> 01:10:07.070
be a bully.
That's,
yeah.
I don't know.
They called that bullying,

1218
01:10:07.071 --> 01:10:09.920
but her teacher had a conversation with them.
Now she didn't,

1219
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:12.200
I don't think she exactly ordered them.
Never exclude.

1220
01:10:12.201 --> 01:10:16.100
So I mean it'd be okay if you use it as a grounds for discussion but increased.

1221
01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:19.460
But some schools have even tried to discourage the existence of best friends

1222
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:23.030
because if you have best friends,
you're excluding others.
That's hilarious.

1223
01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.120
It is hilarious.
But again,

1224
01:10:24.121 --> 01:10:29.090
it's if you fail to understand that kids are antifragile and you think,
oh my,

1225
01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:29.331
you know,

1226
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:32.330
there's a rise of anxiety and depression in girls are cutting themselves at such

1227
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:35.480
high rates.
You know,
we've got it.
We've got to relieve them of stress.
Like no,

1228
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:39.230
that's not the right way to go about it.
And there really is an epidemic of,

1229
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:44.270
of kids that grew up in that error of participation trophies where everyone one

1230
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:50.450
and there,
there's a lot of parents that don't want to see their children lose.

1231
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:54.500
Yeah.
But that's a giant and learning opportunities.
Actually.

1232
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:57.650
If you think the goal is to cultivate self esteem directly,

1233
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:59.210
you're crippling the kid.

1234
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:04.670
I'm giving your kid self esteem is not beneficial.
Um,
in fact,

1235
01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:07.790
if kids have high self esteem but it's unstable,

1236
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.060
then they're actually more likely to be violent.
They have more problems.

1237
01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:14.610
You don't want to build self esteem,
which you to build his capacities.

1238
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.910
You want to give them abilities and skills that they do things that then

1239
01:11:17.911 --> 01:11:22.050
indirectly give them self esteem and compassion.
Right.
I mean,
how do you,

1240
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.450
how do you teach that?
How do you teach it?
Well,
there are lots and lots.

1241
01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.700
I mean it's one of the biggest things that is happening in schools is efforts to

1242
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:32.940
teach compassion.
I don't know.
I've not surveyed the research.

1243
01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:37.020
I don't know if they work.
I don't know.
Um,
so look in general,

1244
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.460
kids learn from experience,
but adults want to teach them directly.

1245
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:44.670
And so there's all these efforts to teach compassion.

1246
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.350
I have no idea if they work.
Um,

1247
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:52.380
but I would think that doing things together,
uh,
and um,
uh,

1248
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:56.620
this is a point made by Peter Gray and expert on play who co founded,
uh,

1249
01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.560
let grow.org a wonderful organization.
And I hope we can talk about,
um,

1250
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.630
one way that kids learn compassion is by playing with each other when there's no

1251
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:07.740
adults who can step in,

1252
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.530
where they have to look out for each other to keep the game going.

1253
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:13.950
But when there are adults present who are supervising,

1254
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.830
then if there's a conflict,
the skills that kids need to learn are,

1255
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.260
how do you make your case to get the adult to come in on your side?

1256
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.450
And this is called moral dependence.

1257
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:29.040
So one of the best ways that kids learn compassion,
cooperation,

1258
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:33.270
tolerance,
teamwork,
leadership is free play,

1259
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:35.880
unsupervised,
free play.

1260
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.630
And that's what kids did from time immemorial.

1261
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.530
Certainly throughout the 20th century up until the 1990s like when you,
so,
uh,

1262
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:46.350
Xos,
you,
how old were you?

1263
01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:50.000
<v 2>Where'd you grow up first of all?
Well,
I'll all over the place.
Honestly,</v>

1264
01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:51.380
I was born in New Jersey,

1265
01:12:51.381 --> 01:12:55.550
lived there till seven San Francisco from seven to 11 period.

1266
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:56.900
Seven Toilet Messa keep here.
Okay.

1267
01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.290
When you lived in San Francisco where you allowed outside?

1268
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.030
We were allowed to like go to a friend's house.

1269
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:05.750
Could you and your friends go places?
Yeah,
I was a latch key kid.
Okay.
Yeah.

1270
01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:09.290
My parents were gone all day and so they would be arrested if they did that

1271
01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.540
right.
When I was eight years old,

1272
01:13:11.541 --> 01:13:16.520
I did a magic show on fisherman's wharf by myself.
Fantastic.
What do you wait,

1273
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:19.360
what happened?
A dodged a bunch of bullets.
What do you mean have,

1274
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:24.240
I almost got molested.
Some guy tried to,
some guy tried to abducted me.

1275
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:27.440
Wait,
wait.
Literally tried to obtain,
yeah.
Was in a library.

1276
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.310
Some guy tried to get me to go out to his car with them to check out some books

1277
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:35.720
and some,
a lady librarian saved me.
She screamed out,
Joseph,

1278
01:13:35.721 --> 01:13:39.050
you get away from that man.
He just got out of jail.
I ran off.

1279
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:41.570
He was super creepy.
But you know,
I was eight.

1280
01:13:41.571 --> 01:13:44.300
I didn't understand what was going on.
I just thought he had some good books.

1281
01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.040
Okay.
Okay,
good.
Right.
So this is a nice example of how we've made progress.

1282
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.590
<v 0>Yeah.
So you know,
a lot of what I'm saying,</v>

1283
01:13:51.591 --> 01:13:55.030
we're saying the book is we have to let kids out now.
Yes,
there is.

1284
01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:59.080
There are dangerous out there.
And so kids have to learn.
Um,

1285
01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:00.890
you actually can talk to strangers.
It's not

1286
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.500
<v 2>talk to strangers.
Just never,
ever go off with them.</v>

1287
01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.680
Never under any circumstances.
But he,
you know,
he really,

1288
01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:09.230
the problem with talking to strangers is when you're eight,

1289
01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.980
you don't understand manipulation.
You,
you

1290
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.530
<v 1>think of adults as being someone who's got,
you can count on.</v>

1291
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:20.150
<v 0>Okay.
So,
so back then we were negligent in that we just,</v>

1292
01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.520
we sent our kids out and we didn't think about the dangerous.

1293
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.810
Now the dangerous are actually extremely low,
at least the danger of abduction.

1294
01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:27.650
Um,

1295
01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:31.940
the number of kids who were abducted in America each year is on the order of a

1296
01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:35.360
hundred.
Now many more are abducted by the noncustodial parent.

1297
01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:38.600
But what you're talking to as a stranger,
now there's,
there are creeps out there.

1298
01:14:38.601 --> 01:14:41.480
There are guys who masturbate.
I mean there's all kinds of creeps out there,

1299
01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:45.290
but abductions is extraordinarily rare.
And so yes,
we have to deal with,

1300
01:14:45.291 --> 01:14:46.124
we have to teach kids.

1301
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:50.210
But what happened was there was a crime wave when you and I were growing up,

1302
01:14:50.211 --> 01:14:53.060
there was actually a lot of crime in this country and the seventies and eighties

1303
01:14:53.061 --> 01:14:53.894
there was a lot of crime.

1304
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.080
And then the crime wave begins to end rapidly in the 1990s and just as it's

1305
01:14:59.181 --> 01:15:02.420
ending,
we changed our norms to say,

1306
01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.560
if a kid is outside and there's no adult watching him,

1307
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:09.740
that kid is likely to be abducted.
And therefore the parents are responsible.

1308
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:13.190
The parents can be arrested or at least child protective services should pay

1309
01:15:13.191 --> 01:15:15.470
them a visit.
So,
um,

1310
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:18.620
just as the crime rate was ending and rates of all kinds of crazy violence were

1311
01:15:18.621 --> 01:15:22.220
plummeting,
we locked our kids up and we said,

1312
01:15:22.221 --> 01:15:25.790
you're not going to be able to have the kind of experience that you most need in

1313
01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:27.920
order to become an independent functioning adult.

1314
01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:33.440
And so we don't know why depression,
anxiety and suicide are skyrocketing,
um,

1315
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:35.150
for teenagers,
especially teenage girls.

1316
01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.470
But the combination of overprotection and then social media seems to be the main

1317
01:15:39.471 --> 01:15:42.330
part of the example.
So I totally sympathize with the fact that yeah,
you know,

1318
01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.670
there are,
there are risks out there,

1319
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.140
but the risk of overprotection is kills a lot more kids.

1320
01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.680
<v 1>There was a story that I read about,</v>

1321
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.810
I want to say the kids were eight and 10 and they were walking home in New York

1322
01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:58.590
City and the police officer stopped them and talk to them and then eventually

1323
01:15:58.591 --> 01:16:03.240
interviewed their parents and said,
why are your children walking home?
He's like,

1324
01:16:03.241 --> 01:16:07.830
cause I taught him how to walk home.
I showed him how to get home.
Like this is a,

1325
01:16:07.831 --> 01:16:11.820
this is a valuable thing to give them the independence to leave school together.

1326
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:15.420
They look out for each other and then they go home together and you know,

1327
01:16:15.421 --> 01:16:19.020
the cops were making it like these people were negligent and criminal and they

1328
01:16:19.021 --> 01:16:21.630
were saying,
no,
I'm trying to prepare my child for the world.
So it's uh,

1329
01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:27.360
it's sort of a debate about the philosophy of raising human beings and exposing

1330
01:16:27.361 --> 01:16:31.080
them to a certain amount of independence and a certain amount of personal

1331
01:16:31.081 --> 01:16:31.914
sovereignty.

1332
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.740
<v 0>That's right.
And so this is,
this is,
um,</v>

1333
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.930
I think the most important lesson that Greg and I hope will come from our book

1334
01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.770
is that if you see the world is dangerous and threatening and you raise your

1335
01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:42.604
kids accordingly,

1336
01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.460
you're going to raise emotionally stunted kids who are at much higher risk of

1337
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:49.780
depression,
anxiety,
and suicide.
So stop doing that.
We got to stop doing that.

1338
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.130
Unfortunately,
it's hard to stop doing that because if we let our kids outside,

1339
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:56.650
we can be arrested.
Now,
that happens very rarely,

1340
01:16:56.651 --> 01:17:00.700
but it does happen or more concerning your kids.
Can Be harmed.

1341
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:03.130
That's extremely rare,

1342
01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:04.040
<v 1>but it can happen.</v>

1343
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:07.520
And through the people that does happen to the idea that it's extremely rare,

1344
01:17:07.521 --> 01:17:08.354
it's not comforting.

1345
01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.530
<v 2>Well that's,
so we think about probabilities in very ineffective ways actually.</v>

1346
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:17.360
Do we have those graphs?
I sent in some graphs of depression,
anxiety rates.
Um,

1347
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:18.620
so,
um,

1348
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.880
if we think that kids are at risk of harm from letting them out,

1349
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:25.900
but we don't see that there at risk of harm from keeping them in if we're going

1350
01:17:25.901 --> 01:17:27.740
to make the wrong decision.
Right.

1351
01:17:27.741 --> 01:17:32.741
So there's a silence secret sort of invisible harm of coddling them.

1352
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:33.771
Exactly.

1353
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:38.771
And then there's the small percentage of possible harm that you could get if you

1354
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:42.410
go out into the world.
Right.
So,
okay,
so you're raising your kids here.
What,

1355
01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:45.820
what's your policy on letting them out?
Man,
it's slippery.
Hello?

1356
01:17:45.821 --> 01:17:46.654
How old is your oldest?

1357
01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:51.780
A while I haven't grown one who's 22 and then I have a 10 and an eight.

1358
01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.780
Okay.
And it's hard,
man,

1359
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:58.640
because I don't even like when they go over on sleepovers over a friend's house.

1360
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.860
Scary.
Whose problem is that?
It's everybody's problem.
You know,
it's,
uh,

1361
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:08.180
well I mean the parents,
I mean we're,
we're pretty selective about the parents,

1362
01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:10.940
but there's a lot of parents that don't pay attention to their kids at all.

1363
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:13.580
Meaning they just tune out and they get on the phone.

1364
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:17.000
The kids are sticking forks into the fucking outlets.
And you know,
there's,

1365
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:21.680
there's a lot of weirdness when it comes to the styles of that people have been

1366
01:18:21.681 --> 01:18:25.250
raising their children.
What does this,
uh,
this graph he just pulled out?
So,

1367
01:18:25.251 --> 01:18:27.860
you know,
um,
depressive episodes.

1368
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.390
So I guess I'll just narrate it for people to listen to that watching video,

1369
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:32.421
you know,
so you said before,

1370
01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:35.360
it's like a virus came out of nowhere and that is sort of what it's been like.

1371
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:39.590
Um,
so what's happening in America and I know what's happening at the same in

1372
01:18:39.591 --> 01:18:41.870
Britain and Canada.
I haven't looked at other,
other places yet,

1373
01:18:41.871 --> 01:18:43.590
haven't dug into those stats.
Um,

1374
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:48.230
what's happening is that rates of depression and anxiety were fairly stable,
uh,

1375
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.670
from the nineties through the early two thousands.
And what you see here,

1376
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:55.370
and this is a graph that's in our book,
is that the,
uh,

1377
01:18:55.371 --> 01:19:00.371
the percentage of kids aged 12 to 17 in America who met the criteria for having

1378
01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:02.420
a major depressive episode.

1379
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.940
That is they're given a symptom checklist with nine symptoms.

1380
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:07.160
And if you say yes to five of them,
uh,
you know,

1381
01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:11.720
feeling hopeless and couldn't get out of bed.
Um,
if you say yes to five or more,

1382
01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.510
you're,
you're considered to have had a major depressive episode.

1383
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.050
And what you see is that the rate for boys is around 5%.

1384
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:21.740
And then around 2011 it starts going up and now it's around 7%,

1385
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.770
which is actually a somewhat substantial increase.
Uh,

1386
01:19:24.771 --> 01:19:26.060
but as you can see in the graph,

1387
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:30.620
the line for girls starts off higher cause girls have more mood disorders,

1388
01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:34.040
more anxiety,
depression.
Boys have more antisocial behavior,
alcoholism,

1389
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.610
crime and violence.
But girls turn it,

1390
01:19:36.611 --> 01:19:39.350
it's called an internalizing disordered girls basically make themselves

1391
01:19:39.351 --> 01:19:42.770
miserable.
Boys make other people miserable.
Uh,
the gross rate is higher,

1392
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:47.830
but it was stable from 2000 releasing that graph from 2005 through 2010 and then

1393
01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.190
right around 2011,

1394
01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:52.700
2012 starts going up and it goes way up to the point where it goes up from about

1395
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:57.701
12% to now about 20% of American teenage girls have had a major depressive

1396
01:19:57.831 --> 01:20:02.810
episode in the last year,
one in five.
So this is huge.
Okay,
next slide.

1397
01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.980
Now,
let's look just a college students.
So this is more selective.

1398
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.420
<v 0>These are kids who've made it into college.</v>

1399
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:14.660
And what we see is that in 2010 and 20 and 2012 when college students,

1400
01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:17.790
we're all millennials,
the rates were pretty low.
This is,

1401
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:19.740
do you have a psychological disorder?

1402
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:23.070
And they didn't specify they or they said such as depression.
Uh,

1403
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:27.630
and so we see about two to 3% of the boys,
uh,
the college men,

1404
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:32.400
and about 5% of a five to 6% of college women say yes to that question.

1405
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:37.560
That's when it was millennials.
But beginning of 2013,
Gen z begins arriving.

1406
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:42.330
That's kids born in 1995,
uh,
Gen z begins arriving.
And so by 2016,

1407
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:46.860
colleges are almost all gen z and the rates shoot up way up.

1408
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.430
<v 2>Yeah.
We're looking at these charts right now and folks who are just listening.</v>

1409
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:55.580
The,
it's like,
it's a,
like a jump ramp for a BMX racer.

1410
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:58.290
I mean,
it really is crazy for whim out of nowhere.

1411
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.000
And it hits at 2012 it goes on a very sharp upward angle.

1412
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:08.400
<v 0>Right?
It goes from six less than 6% to almost 15% in the space of four years.</v>

1413
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:11.290
<v 2>That's crazy.
It's crazy.
Uh,
oh,
you can't say that.</v>

1414
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.150
That's an [inaudible] can't say crazy fucking nuts.

1415
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:18.670
And I say that.
No,
because some people might have a nut allergy.

1416
01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:26.260
Oh boy.
Um,
ludicrous.
It's preposterous.
It's really frightening.

1417
01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:27.094
It's really frightening.

1418
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.340
<v 0>Yeah.
And so this has huge ramification.
Now let me just make clear,</v>

1419
01:21:30.341 --> 01:21:33.130
I think we have another,
another slide there who bring up the next one.

1420
01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:39.460
Okay.
So,
um,
some people say,
uh,
oh,
come on you guys.

1421
01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:43.810
Or catastrophizing.
The increased isn't real.
It's just that,
you know,

1422
01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:48.160
this generation,
they're really comfortable talking about mental illness.
Um,

1423
01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:52.060
and so the fact that they say they're depressed just means they're comfortable.

1424
01:21:52.061 --> 01:21:53.140
It doesn't mean that there's an epidemic.

1425
01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:55.030
<v 2>I've heard this argument that it's just a,</v>

1426
01:21:55.031 --> 01:21:57.460
an argument of recognition rather than have

1427
01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.620
<v 0>perfectly,
that's right.</v>

1428
01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:02.010
Diagnostic criteria changed perfectly reasonable argument.
Is it true?
Well,

1429
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:04.300
let's look at behavior.
So with this graph show is,

1430
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.320
is the number of boys out of 100,000 who are admitted to a hospital every year

1431
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:12.280
because they cut,
they deliberately harmed themselves.

1432
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:15.930
They had to be hospitalized.
And what you see here is that um,

1433
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:20.850
there is no change over time.
So boys,
these graphs from 2001 to 2015,

1434
01:22:20.851 --> 01:22:23.490
the lines are flat for all the different age groups.
Um,

1435
01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:28.610
and just notice that the highest rates are around 280 out of 100,000 per year.

1436
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.940
That's the situation for boys.
Next graph,
Bang.

1437
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.260
The situation for girls is really,
really different.
So the averages are higher.

1438
01:22:37.261 --> 01:22:41.130
So self harm has always been more of a girl thing than a boy thing.
Um,
you know,

1439
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:45.930
boys are except for suicide.
Exactly.
We'll get to that.
That's right.
That's next.

1440
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.790
So,
uh,
we look at self harm.

1441
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:51.630
What you see here is that the rates were fairly stable up until 2009,

1442
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.250
and then bang just isn't the same thing.
The rates for girls go shooting up.

1443
01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:01.430
So the rate for 15 to 19 year old girls is up 62% since 2009.

1444
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:06.160
Um,
now notice the rate the millennials,

1445
01:23:06.161 --> 01:23:10.330
that is the rate for the oldest girls age 20 to 24.
That's only up 17%.

1446
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:15.460
So whatever happened,
it's not effecting the millennials,
it's affecting Gen z.

1447
01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.600
I think ways there when it hit the advanced key cause I think there's one number

1448
01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:23.440
missing there.
Ah,
okay.
I'll just uh,
no go forward.
Okay.
The number of air it is,

1449
01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:25.930
there,
it is.
The rate for the youngest girls.
Check that out.

1450
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:29.840
Now the youngest scores,
these are 10 to 14 year old girls.
These are preteens.

1451
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.490
Okay.
They didn't use to cut themselves.
They used to have very low rates,

1452
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.430
but bang,
beginning in 2010 it shoots up,

1453
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:41.610
it's up 189% it is nearly tripled in the last five or six years.

1454
01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:46.810
Once they're gone,
we don't know for sure,
but the reason why,

1455
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.760
so because of the huge sex difference deleting candidate and the timing.

1456
01:23:50.761 --> 01:23:52.600
You look at that timing is social media.

1457
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:57.400
So if you look at what happened in this country and all around the world,
um,

1458
01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:01.750
Facebook opens up to the world in 2006 you don't have to be a college student,

1459
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:04.900
but very few teenagers have a Facebook account.

1460
01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:07.900
In 2006 2007 the iPhone comes out,

1461
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:10.360
but it's very expensive and very few teenagers have won.

1462
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.200
By 2010 2011 around half of American teenagers have an iPhone or Samsung,

1463
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:21.400
they have a smartphone and they have access to social media in middle school.

1464
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.590
Because even though for Facebook and Instagram,

1465
01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:27.070
I think the minimum age is and was 13 you know,
I mean my,

1466
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.130
my son is 12 a lot of his friends have Instagram.
You just lie.

1467
01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:35.340
So middle school kids are now getting on social media by 2010 2011 you've got a

1468
01:24:35.351 --> 01:24:36.040
lot of them.

1469
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.180
And that's what I think is the main cause of this because social media does not

1470
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:43.980
really affect boys very much,
but man,
does it affect girls?
Why is,
uh,

1471
01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.290
so if you look at,
so a couple of reasons.
First,

1472
01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:51.940
look at the nature of aggression within the sexes.
Boys bullying is physical.

1473
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:52.451
Okay?

1474
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:55.720
Boys are physically dominating and then the risk is that they're going to get

1475
01:24:55.721 --> 01:25:00.550
punched.
Okay,
so you give everybody an iPhone.
What do they do with it?

1476
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.980
Games and porn.
They don't use it to hurt each other.
Um,
boys,

1477
01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:08.590
your boys.
That's right.
It doesn't affect their bullying.

1478
01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.600
But girls aggression that girls are actually as aggressive as boys.

1479
01:25:12.601 --> 01:25:14.620
There's research for from the eighties and nineties on this.

1480
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.050
If you include relational aggression,

1481
01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.500
girls don't bully each other by threatening to punch each other in the face.

1482
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:24.370
Girls bully each other by damaging the other girls' social relationships,

1483
01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.460
spreading rumors,
spreading lies,
spreading a doctorate,
photograph,

1484
01:25:27.461 --> 01:25:30.580
saying bad things,
excluding them.
It's relational aggression.

1485
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.820
And so it's always been really hard to be a middle school student.

1486
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:38.230
It's always been harder to be middle school girl than a middle school boy.
Okay?

1487
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:42.610
So beginning around 2010,
2011,
we throw in this brand new thing into the mix.

1488
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:43.900
Okay girls,

1489
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.610
here's this beautiful thing in your hand and here's all these programs where you

1490
01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:52.930
can damage anyone social relationships anytime of the day or night with

1491
01:25:52.931 --> 01:25:57.760
deniability from an anonymous account go at,
at girls.
And so,

1492
01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:58.210
um,

1493
01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:03.210
the nature of girls bullying is hypercharged by social media and that's one

1494
01:26:03.861 --> 01:26:06.840
mechanism.
The other two mechanisms,
um,

1495
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:11.780
are the social comparison because it's always been hard to be a teen girl

1496
01:26:11.781 --> 01:26:14.510
emerging with beauty standards and impossible beauty standards.

1497
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.541
And when we were kids,

1498
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:19.880
you had impossible beauty standards that these models were all doctored up and

1499
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:23.570
then Photoshop.
Okay?
So you've got these impossible beauty standards out there,

1500
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:26.570
but beginning of social media,
and especially in recent years,

1501
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:31.100
your own friends can put on a filter and Instagram to make their lips big or

1502
01:26:31.101 --> 01:26:33.200
their skin cleaner,
their eyes bigger.

1503
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:36.620
So your own friends are more beautiful than they are in real life.

1504
01:26:36.621 --> 01:26:39.740
You feel uglier.
So that's the social comparison of beauty.

1505
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:44.120
And then probably the biggest single one is the fear of missing out,

1506
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:47.360
the fear of being left out.
So all kids are subject to this.

1507
01:26:47.361 --> 01:26:49.790
Everyone's concerned about whether they're included,
whether they're,

1508
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:52.700
they're excluded,
but girls are much more sensitive.

1509
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:57.560
And so suddenly when everybody is tracking each others who was invited,

1510
01:26:57.561 --> 01:26:58.370
who's there,

1511
01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:02.750
and especially any program in which a girl puts something out and then waits to

1512
01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:07.240
see what other people say about it,
that is what's really damaging.
I think we'd,

1513
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:10.910
again,
let me stress,
we don't know for sure there are some experiments on this,

1514
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:13.970
but it's mostly correlational stuff we're talking about here.
Correlational data.

1515
01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:14.900
Um,

1516
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.900
but the overall experience of being a girl who was born in 1995 or later and got

1517
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:23.930
this stuff in middle school is different from being a girl born in 1990 let's

1518
01:27:23.931 --> 01:27:25.850
say we didn't get this stuff til college.

1519
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.530
Are you concerned that this is a trend that as technology becomes more and more

1520
01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:35.030
invasive and with these new technologies as they emerge,

1521
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:39.750
that this is going to be worse?
Yes,
yes.
But it doesn't have to be so,

1522
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:43.770
so I think in the last two years were really waking up to this,
um,

1523
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:47.300
the founders of this technology.
It's really interesting.
So first of all,

1524
01:27:47.301 --> 01:27:49.790
it's important to note as many people have read the,

1525
01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:52.880
a lot of the creators of this technology do not let their kids have it.

1526
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:55.700
So they know that these things were made to be addictive.

1527
01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:00.180
They're made to grab eyeballs and not let go.
So,
um,
um,

1528
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:02.090
that's one thing we all wish,
keep that in mind,

1529
01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:04.340
that the makers of this are wary of it.
Second,

1530
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:07.070
they've gotten more and more addictive as they've gotten better and better as

1531
01:28:07.071 --> 01:28:09.680
they've evolved.
Um,
so they're getting more and more.

1532
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:14.680
And Fortnite is an example of,
of,
uh,
you know,
uh,
extremely addictive game.
Um,

1533
01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.670
um,
and it does.
But,
uh,
so when you,
if you've ever been to a,
um,

1534
01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:25.760
a casino and you've seen kids,
you've seen people sitting at those machines,

1535
01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:29.300
like zombies just you know,
hour after hour pulling that crank.

1536
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:33.590
Cause there were psychologists working out the variable reinforcement schedule

1537
01:28:33.591 --> 01:28:36.020
for the gambling companies,
psychologists,

1538
01:28:36.021 --> 01:28:38.270
they are helping companies manipulate he users.

1539
01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.910
And that's happening to our kids too.
They're,

1540
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.370
they're manipulated to stay on the device.

1541
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.420
So once we're beginning to realize this,
the nature of these technologies,

1542
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:52.900
the fact that what is good for adults may be terrible for 12 year olds,

1543
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:54.290
10 year olds.

1544
01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.630
And once we realize that these things are so attractive that they crowd out all

1545
01:28:59.631 --> 01:29:01.860
the other healthy activities like playing outside,

1546
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:05.730
playing with groups of friends.
Um,
once we realize that,
I think,

1547
01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:09.000
and I hope we'll get some reasonable norms.
And what I'd like to propose,

1548
01:29:09.001 --> 01:29:11.940
this is fantastic to be able to talk to so many people.
Um,

1549
01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:14.070
what I'd like to propose is if you have kids,

1550
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.290
especially if you have kids under about 16,

1551
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.280
please do what you can to talk with other parents.

1552
01:29:20.281 --> 01:29:22.890
And especially with the principle of any schools,

1553
01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:27.690
you know and say we need some sensible norms because we can't solve this problem

1554
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:32.220
by ourselves.
So I want to keep my kids off social media,
but my son says,

1555
01:29:32.221 --> 01:29:34.980
well most of my friends or have Instagram accounts now,

1556
01:29:34.981 --> 01:29:37.980
if it was every friend and he was the only one who was excluded,

1557
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.320
you'll be really hard for me to stick to my guns.
I would do,

1558
01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:41.310
it would be really hard.

1559
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.670
Whereas if it was only a few of his friends and most of them weren't,

1560
01:29:44.671 --> 01:29:47.550
it would be so easy.
And I hear this from parents over and over.

1561
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.240
I don't want my kid on social media,
but I don't want her to be left out.

1562
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:55.770
And so if the principal would just say,
parents,
please,
this is getting,

1563
01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:58.440
this is getting out of hand.
This is harming kids.
Look at the data,

1564
01:29:58.441 --> 01:30:01.230
look at the suicide rates,
look at the,
look at the self harm rates.

1565
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.140
We've got to do something.
What do you do?
A couple of things.

1566
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.470
I think it's pretty a couple of pretty simple norms.
One,

1567
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:12.390
all devices out of the bedroom by a set time,
at least half an hour before bed.

1568
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:17.370
There is no reason why kids should have an iPhone or a computer or a screen in

1569
01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:20.490
their bedroom because so many kids are attracted to it.

1570
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.580
They'll check their status overnight and it interrupts their sleep.

1571
01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:27.150
We can't be having teenagers who have interrupted sleep that there's just no

1572
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:28.270
benefit from that.

1573
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:32.740
<v 1>Gave my daughter a fitbit,
my 10 year old to a monitor,</v>

1574
01:30:32.741 --> 01:30:34.360
all sorts of different things.
She was interested in it.

1575
01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.200
So we got her one for Christmas and um,

1576
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:41.260
she slept five and a half hours the first night she had it on cause we could

1577
01:30:41.261 --> 01:30:44.510
check.
We're like,
what are you doing?
She's checking the fifth.
What is,

1578
01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:47.740
what's going on here?
I'm like,
this is not good.
Like you can't wear this now.

1579
01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.650
And she's like trying to make all these arguments to keep,
but I'm like,
listen,

1580
01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:53.650
she goes,
it's not distracting me.
I go,
if it's not distracting you,

1581
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:56.230
then you shouldn't care if you don't have it on.
Right.

1582
01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:57.670
Because then it's not going to mean anything.

1583
01:30:58.090 --> 01:30:59.620
And then there's like this like a shit.

1584
01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:04.270
Like she got checkmated that's right now because these things are so
interesting.

1585
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.880
It's so addictive.
I had one of those goddamn watches,

1586
01:31:06.881 --> 01:31:10.420
those apple watches I had it on for one day while I was doing the podcast.

1587
01:31:10.421 --> 01:31:14.080
It kept vibrating.
I'm like,
Oh my God,
I'm getting text messages on my wrist,

1588
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:15.183
my wrist.
Yeah.

1589
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:20.240
<v 0>So great.
And your brain is all developed adult.
Sketchy.
Okay.</v>

1590
01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:24.680
But imagine if you're a 10 or 11 year old kid and you put something out there

1591
01:31:24.681 --> 01:31:27.440
and you want to know,
did you know,
did bill like it yet?
You know,
why did,

1592
01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:30.890
why did Mary like bills but not like,
so that's rule number one.

1593
01:31:30.891 --> 01:31:32.850
You've got to get devices out of the bedroom.
Yeah.

1594
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:36.180
Give him an old fashioned alarm clock.
Let him wake up with an alarm cuts one.
Um,

1595
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:38.960
to no social media till high school.

1596
01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:42.680
There is no reason why kids in middle school or elementary school should have

1597
01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:46.460
Instagram,
Facebook,
snapchat,
any of those.
They can text each other.

1598
01:31:46.461 --> 01:31:48.320
Like when we were kids,
he'd call each other on the phone.
That's fine.

1599
01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.273
They can text each other,

1600
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:52.560
but there should be no social media till high school cause it's a,

1601
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:56.300
it's a social dilemma.
It that we can't solve alone.
We only saw the,

1602
01:31:56.301 --> 01:31:58.910
if there's an agreement among parents and guidance,

1603
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:01.840
the principal please parents don't give your kid and Instagram.
Yeah.

1604
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.680
<v 1>My only concern is that they're not going to learn how to mitigate it or how to</v>

1605
01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:10.480
navigate it rather if we say nothing till high school and then when they get

1606
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:13.420
into high school then they,
they're confronted with it.

1607
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:17.530
I would like them to have some skills or at least some understanding of what's

1608
01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:18.364
going on.

1609
01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:22.930
<v 0>So,
so I'm not saying don't let them have access to these machines.</v>

1610
01:32:22.931 --> 01:32:25.240
I'm not saying don't let him know.
I know exactly what you're saying.

1611
01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:28.510
You're saying they won't allow you to have social media.
Yeah.
And how about this?

1612
01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:33.640
Um,
the bullying that takes place in middle school is primitive and destructive.

1613
01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.330
Uh,

1614
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:37.720
and the bullying that takes place in late high school is a lot less and is not

1615
01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.570
the same way.
Why do you say it is?

1616
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:43.570
Well mills like middle school kids are just coming into this.
Um,

1617
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.950
there's some research on gene twinkie has a book called ign and she has some

1618
01:32:47.951 --> 01:32:51.910
data in there that suggests that when you get social media in college,

1619
01:32:51.911 --> 01:32:55.840
it doesn't seem to harm you,
but when you got it and your preteen years it does.

1620
01:32:56.380 --> 01:33:00.070
And so,
and she thinks that it's in part,
the nature of the bullying is such,
um,

1621
01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:03.070
so you know,
sure,
we want them to know how to deal with this,
but you know,

1622
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:05.860
they can learn it pretty quickly when they're 15.

1623
01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:08.440
It's not like they need a running start from 11 to 15.

1624
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:13.830
So I just see no good whatsoever coming from social media in middle school and I

1625
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:16.440
see a lot of harm.
If you want your look,

1626
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:18.940
I go around the country to talk about this.
The almost,

1627
01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:21.280
the rule now is when someone in someone says,
oh,

1628
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:23.800
well my daughter's in high school and you know,
she's had it.
And I say,

1629
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:27.430
how she doing?
Does she have anxiety problems?
The answer's almost always yes.

1630
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:28.930
And if it's not her,

1631
01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:31.990
then her friends are all crippled by or suffering from anxiety.

1632
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.200
So I think we have to,
you know,
you have to wake cost and benefits.

1633
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:38.140
A few years ago we didn't know for sure about the costs.
Now we do.

1634
01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:40.510
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
you're making total sense.
I'm,</v>

1635
01:33:40.511 --> 01:33:43.630
I'm purely playing devil's advocate and I'm on the same page with you.

1636
01:33:43.631 --> 01:33:46.690
I don't give,
my kids don't have phones and my 10 year old,

1637
01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.370
it's shocking how many girls in her class have phones.
Right.

1638
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.160
And Facebook accounts and Instagram

1639
01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.350
<v 0>and they,
I'll,
I'll say it right now,</v>

1640
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:57.940
her friends are at higher risk than she is of having an anxiety disorder of

1641
01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:01.190
being hospitalized because they're going to cut themselves and ultimately
assist.

1642
01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:01.941
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1643
01:34:01.941 --> 01:34:06.500
It's so common and it's most of the kids in school now and when they get older

1644
01:34:06.501 --> 01:34:10.700
than 10 the,
the number increases.
Like parents hold out for as long as they can.

1645
01:34:10.701 --> 01:34:13.060
But as they get older and the kids want want

1646
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.120
<v 0>phones,
man,
everybody wants a phone.
Okay.
So then he put in a plug.</v>

1647
01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:19.360
So I gave my son,
so I'm saying two contradictory things.

1648
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:21.100
One is I'm saying we got to let our kids out,

1649
01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.050
got to start letting them out at least by age eight,

1650
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:26.190
at least to go with their friends to playground stores.

1651
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.250
We've got to start doing this.
Um,

1652
01:34:27.690 --> 01:34:31.300
and at the same time I'm saying that the technology has some negative effects.

1653
01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:33.610
Okay.
If you're going to send your kid out,

1654
01:34:33.611 --> 01:34:36.430
I totally get what you were saying about you're either panic,

1655
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:39.970
like the first time that we let our sign out in the park and then he didn't come

1656
01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:44.140
home right when he said like,
and it was real panic.
Um,
in part.
So two things.

1657
01:34:44.141 --> 01:34:46.330
One is we have to get used to that because he always does come home.

1658
01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.520
But secondly,
I didn't realize this when I gave him an iPhone.
My old iPhone,
um,

1659
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:54.250
there's a great little product.
The,
uh,
uh,
I'm not,
I don't know if horizon,
no,

1660
01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:58.820
they don't make it.
It's an LG makes it,
but it's a Gizmo,
a Gizmo gadget.
Uh,

1661
01:34:58.821 --> 01:35:02.210
and so it's a simple,
it's a watch.
It's a,
it's,
it's a big clunky thing,

1662
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:05.420
but my daughter loves wearing it because it's kind of like a James Bond Dick

1663
01:35:05.421 --> 01:35:08.720
Tracy thing.
It's a watch.
You press a button,
you turn it on,

1664
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.810
you can call three phone numbers.
That's it.
Three,
four so she can call.

1665
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:14.930
And so now I can send it out to get bagels on Sunday morning.

1666
01:35:14.931 --> 01:35:18.380
She walks about six blocks in New York City.
It's incredibly safe.
How old is she?

1667
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.430
She is nine.
So yeah.
So um,
uh,

1668
01:35:22.431 --> 01:35:25.790
and she is a much more independent,
confident girl because of it.

1669
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:29.390
And she is proud of this fact that she is a free range kid.

1670
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.330
She can walk around our neighborhood.
I mean we live in Greenwich village,

1671
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:36.660
it's incredibly safe.
Um,
so she can go get bagels and it,
you know,

1672
01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.300
she has no sense of direction.

1673
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:40.730
So a couple of times when she's been out doing an errand,
she gets lost.

1674
01:35:40.731 --> 01:35:42.260
She just presses a button.
Daddy,

1675
01:35:42.261 --> 01:35:45.280
I don't know where I am and she's calm and you know,

1676
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:48.050
we've talk it through and I can track her.
That's the the reassuring thing.

1677
01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:51.200
I can see on a screen roughly where she is,
so I can say,

1678
01:35:51.201 --> 01:35:52.160
you know what do you see?
And I said,

1679
01:35:52.161 --> 01:35:54.260
I'll come back this way and she always knows her.
She gets in trouble.

1680
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:59.190
Just walk home and start again.
What are you thinking,

1681
01:35:59.210 --> 01:35:59.961
Joe?
Right.
What's,

1682
01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:02.960
what's that facial expression for that thing is just children wandering around

1683
01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:04.130
on their own.
Yeah.

1684
01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.170
That has always happened and as they have to do at some point,
I know,
but listen,

1685
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.860
look at how you're even reacting to this at what you're,
you're,

1686
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:17.300
you're beaming up and you're adding emotion to your voice and you're smiling as

1687
01:36:17.301 --> 01:36:18.790
though it's,
everything's going to be fine.

1688
01:36:18.791 --> 01:36:22.460
Everything you're doing this and sort of,
you're not just reassuring.

1689
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:24.050
You're selling it.
You're right.

1690
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:29.170
I am selling it because we as a society bought into a set of beliefs that are

1691
01:36:29.691 --> 01:36:33.470
based on false hoods.
The risk to our kids is miniscule.

1692
01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:37.250
Someone calculated at present rates of abduction by strangers.

1693
01:36:37.251 --> 01:36:40.310
If you put your kid in a car and you go into a store and you leave the windows

1694
01:36:40.311 --> 01:36:42.320
open and your kid sitting there in the parking lot,

1695
01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:47.750
you'd have to stay in that store for 700,000 years before your kid is likely to

1696
01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:50.630
be abducted.
Well,
it does not depend on what neighborhood you live in,
I suppose.

1697
01:36:50.631 --> 01:36:54.890
So,
yeah.
But still the point is that there's hardly any actual abduction.

1698
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:58.190
And so actually it's,
this brings up a really important point.
I'd like to say,
um,

1699
01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.000
you,

1700
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.330
one of the sticking points here is that we're afraid to let her kids out because

1701
01:37:02.331 --> 01:37:05.090
bad things can happen to us as well as to the kids.

1702
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.260
And so I hope that would be the least of your concerns or what number one

1703
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:10.790
concern would be your children's safety,

1704
01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:14.810
but you getting in trouble for that hope would be the least of your concerns and

1705
01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:17.900
not the least of them.
Because I am selling something.

1706
01:37:17.901 --> 01:37:20.750
I'm selling the idea that,
that the,

1707
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:25.220
the gigantic rise in mental illness of teenagers is caused in part because we've

1708
01:37:25.221 --> 01:37:28.550
overprotected them.
We have denied them the experiences of independence,

1709
01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:31.340
they need to develop their basic social sense.

1710
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:33.440
And so I am selling idea that we've,

1711
01:37:33.730 --> 01:37:36.530
we've totally botched this and we need to undo it.

1712
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:41.210
And a big piece of that is we need to be removed from the fear of legal

1713
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:45.680
prosecution.
And so Utah,
the State of Utah passed a year and a half ago.

1714
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:49.550
A year ago.
Yeah.
They passed the first free range kids bill,

1715
01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.740
which says it puts into state law.
It says,
uh,
I forget what the exact terms,

1716
01:37:54.741 --> 01:37:59.741
but the gist of it is a parent cannot be considered to be negligent just by

1717
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:03.840
having the kids be unsupervised.
So if you send your kids out to the park,

1718
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.200
you know,
you have to use judge.
Obviously if there's a pattern of neglect,

1719
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:10.020
that's a totally different story.
Right?
But the mere fact that as you just said,

1720
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:12.540
the story about,
well,
I'm teaching my kids to go outside.

1721
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:15.420
I know that they're outside.
I told them to go outside.

1722
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.870
You can't be arrested for that.
And until we have legal protections,

1723
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.460
it's can be very hard for anyone to do it because they,
you know,

1724
01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:27.570
the risk is you could be drawn into months and months of supervision.

1725
01:38:27.571 --> 01:38:30.700
Your kids can actually be taken away from you if you give them independence in

1726
01:38:30.701 --> 01:38:31.590
some parts of the country.

1727
01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.330
It's interesting that you taught would be so progressive about that.
Um,
yeah,

1728
01:38:36.331 --> 01:38:38.670
I don't know the history behind it.
Such a safe place.

1729
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:41.880
It's one of the reasons why thank [inaudible] that could be so a big part of

1730
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:44.740
this is we don't trust each other anymore.
Um,
you know,
if,

1731
01:38:44.741 --> 01:38:48.960
if you don't trust your neighbors,
then you're,
you're not going to let them out.

1732
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.823
You're not let your kids,

1733
01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.920
<v 1>oof.
Um,
one of the things you talk about,
uh,
in,</v>

1734
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:59.010
in your book about happiness,
it's really interesting is cognitive therapy,

1735
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:01.590
Prozac and meditation.
Those,

1736
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:05.800
those three factors being enormous,
uh,

1737
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:10.590
AIDS in,
uh,
acquiring a certain amount of happiness.

1738
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:15.930
You know,
um,
I've,
I've,
I've,
um,
I found it very refreshing that you,

1739
01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:18.060
um,
you also added in Prozac,

1740
01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:23.061
you added in ssrs because there's a lot of people that seem to take this

1741
01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:28.790
approach with,
um,
any depressants in particular that they're overprescribed,

1742
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.220
which I think they probably are.
And that they do more harm than good,

1743
01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:35.730
which is debatable,
but the fact that they do do good.

1744
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:40.820
I have had two close friends that were in really bad places and they got on an

1745
01:39:42.121 --> 01:39:47.121
Ssri and it cleaned them up and they eventually wean themselves off of her and

1746
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:48.960
now very productive and very happy.

1747
01:39:48.961 --> 01:39:51.690
But they were in a place in their life where they,

1748
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:57.000
like my friend Ari put it best,
he's like,
uh,
my brain was broken and he goes,

1749
01:39:57.001 --> 01:39:59.700
I needed to fix it.
And I fixed it.
And then once it was fixed,

1750
01:39:59.701 --> 01:40:01.890
I realized it was fixed and then I weaned myself off.

1751
01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.680
<v 0>That's right.
Yeah.
So in,
in chapter two of the happiness hypothesis,</v>

1752
01:40:05.681 --> 01:40:08.380
so the book is based on 10 ancient ideas.
Um,

1753
01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:12.760
and one of the ancient ideas is,
um,
uh,
the world is,

1754
01:40:12.761 --> 01:40:17.720
but we deem the world is,
uh,
the world is what we deem it.
Um,
it,
it,

1755
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:21.200
with our perceptions,
we make the world,
the world is not an objective thing.
We,

1756
01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.140
we don't react to the world as an objective fact.

1757
01:40:23.141 --> 01:40:24.790
We are at react to it through filters.

1758
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:29.560
And one of the major personality traits is sort of positivity,

1759
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:33.370
negativity or overall happiness.
Some people look at the world,
they see threats,

1760
01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.620
other people look at the world,
they see opportunities.

1761
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:38.350
And if you take a bunch of kids,
four,
five,

1762
01:40:38.351 --> 01:40:41.320
six year old kids and you put some weird toy in front of it,
makes noise.

1763
01:40:41.710 --> 01:40:44.050
Some of the kids are going to go towards it and say,
Oh,
what's that?

1764
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:46.990
Some are gonna move away.
Like,
oh,
this could be threatening.

1765
01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.400
And from that behavior,
you can predict not with a lot of accuracy,

1766
01:40:51.401 --> 01:40:54.370
but you can do better than chance.
Who's going to go to the high school prom?

1767
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.470
Who is going to be a successful,
uh,
in,
in,
um,

1768
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:00.070
in any sort of social endeavors?

1769
01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:03.010
Because some people's brains are set to fear and avoidance.

1770
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:06.250
When your brain is set to see more threats,

1771
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:09.040
you have a bias towards interpreting things negatively.

1772
01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:12.820
And if the world is incredibly dangerous,
well that might be adaptive.

1773
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:16.510
But if the world's incredibly physically safe as ours is,
um,

1774
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.750
you're losing a lot of opportunities,
you're going to be less successful.

1775
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.910
And so the point of that chapter was there are ways you can change your filter,

1776
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:28.780
even though this is highly heritable,
identical twins reared apart,

1777
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:33.100
tend to be pretty similar on these traits,
but you can change your filters.

1778
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:37.810
And so that chapter two of the happiness hypothesis shows the three main ways of

1779
01:41:37.811 --> 01:41:41.830
changing your filter.
So it was a meditation,
cognitive therapy,

1780
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.500
and SSRS and all three work.
There's a lot of evidence for all three.
Um,

1781
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:51.820
meditation has only good effects.
It's wonderful,
but it's hard.

1782
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:56.410
That is,
I've assigned it to my classes and of most undergraduates,

1783
01:41:56.411 --> 01:41:57.670
if they have to do it for a few weeks,

1784
01:41:57.671 --> 01:42:02.440
most of them stop a few continue and get benefits.
Cognitive therapy is easier.

1785
01:42:02.690 --> 01:42:05.800
Um,
it,
when I've assigned students to do it most have success.

1786
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:09.020
<v 1>I have a real hard time with that phrase.
It's hard.</v>

1787
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:14.090
That is hard or really do.
Um,
I don't think it's hard.

1788
01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:19.670
You find it easy to sit for 20 minutes.
Not easy,
but it's not hard.

1789
01:42:19.671 --> 01:42:21.620
Coal Mining's hard.
Okay.
You know what I mean?

1790
01:42:21.621 --> 01:42:25.820
We're doing something you hate is hard.
This is just complicated.

1791
01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:27.170
I don't think it's hard.

1792
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.250
<v 0>You're right.
Let me use a different word.
Um,</v>

1793
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:33.490
meditation is such that the noncompliance rate ends up being quite high.

1794
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.680
<v 1>Well,
there's a massive,
people have problem with a few things.
One,</v>

1795
01:42:37.681 --> 01:42:39.760
discipline to,
um,

1796
01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.620
avoiding discomfort.
This is a,

1797
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.750
this is one of the reasons why people don't like to exercise.

1798
01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.300
And it's also really just starting exercise cause the actual exercise itself is

1799
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:53.730
kind of pleasure.
Once you develop a habit,
it's a lot of,
yes,
this is,

1800
01:42:53.731 --> 01:42:58.560
I think what you have with meditation.
It's this procrastination,
this,

1801
01:42:58.561 --> 01:42:59.220
uh,

1802
01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:03.600
your brain tries to find ways to avoid whatever difficult,

1803
01:43:03.601 --> 01:43:05.850
especially in some strange way,

1804
01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:08.700
if it's been shown to be beneficial,

1805
01:43:08.850 --> 01:43:11.700
things that have been shown to be beneficial,
your brain wants to avoid.

1806
01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:16.380
I do not know why that is,
but things you get,

1807
01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:20.370
I have a theory that,
especially when you're growing up,

1808
01:43:20.371 --> 01:43:24.200
that you associate work with schoolwork.

1809
01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:29.130
Jobs did.
So anytime you have these thoughts in your head,
you're like,

1810
01:43:29.190 --> 01:43:32.160
oh,
it's that thing.
It's one of those things.
And they don't want to do,

1811
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:34.240
I want to go play video games,
want to play night,

1812
01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.740
why don't I have to do the work?
But the doing the work,
really,

1813
01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:40.950
it's just a matter of how you interface with it,
how you,
how you view it.

1814
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:42.390
And we're,
it's many,

1815
01:43:42.391 --> 01:43:47.250
many years of conditioning that this is mundane,
dreary,

1816
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:51.830
boring horse shit.
When you could be out playing,
you'd be out fun stuff.

1817
01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.531
<v 0>No,
that's right.
There's a,</v>

1818
01:43:52.531 --> 01:43:56.190
there's a great little scene in the Simpsons where Bart's on a video game and

1819
01:43:56.191 --> 01:43:59.820
he's shooting down a state capitals and he's shooting,
you know,

1820
01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:03.030
like something appears like,
oh,
there's Halena,
you know,
there's a,
you know,

1821
01:44:03.031 --> 01:44:06.090
Springfield.
And then at a certain point he says,
wait,
I'm learning.

1822
01:44:06.450 --> 01:44:06.930
And he throws it.

1823
01:44:06.930 --> 01:44:10.790
<v 1>Do I like to help with that?
Yes,
exactly.
So that's your thesis.</v>

1824
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:13.440
It's really what it is,
what it is.
I mean,
it's,

1825
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.920
it's kind of amazing that we have done such a shitty job teaching kids that we

1826
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:24.950
make school out to be this dreary thing that there they have like a deep voice.

1827
01:44:26.630 --> 01:44:28.970
<v 0>Well,
that's right.
And that's,
and this is Peter Gray's point,
Peter Gray,</v>

1828
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:32.990
this wonderful developmental psychologist at Boston college who thinks that

1829
01:44:32.991 --> 01:44:37.190
schools are,
are not designed with kids learning in mind.
Um,

1830
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:40.640
kids learn best from interacting with the world from experience.

1831
01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:44.280
We get experience from feedback.
Um,
and so,
uh,

1832
01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:48.050
we make learning painful.
And so it,
you know,
an example would be,
you know,

1833
01:44:48.051 --> 01:44:51.050
like how do you learn to climb a tree?
You know,
when we were kids,

1834
01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.340
he'd climb a tree and you know,

1835
01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.400
do you know that feeling when you go out on a branch and a certain point,

1836
01:44:55.401 --> 01:44:59.060
you just get the sense that it's about to crack.
Yeah.
Can you pull back?
Okay.

1837
01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:02.840
Now imagine that you had a hundred kids who learn how to climb trees by climbing

1838
01:45:02.841 --> 01:45:05.570
trees.
You take another hundred kids,
you get in tree climbing class,

1839
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:08.370
but you never let him climb a tree.
Okay.
But you,
you know,
you,
you,

1840
01:45:08.371 --> 01:45:11.930
you bring in the world's best experts on tree climbing and they teach these kids

1841
01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.200
how to climb trees.
Uh,

1842
01:45:13.201 --> 01:45:16.390
and then you put them all out and you give him treats to climb.
Um,

1843
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:19.100
I know in general I would put my money on the kids who actually learned from

1844
01:45:19.101 --> 01:45:23.690
experience.
Oh,
for sure.
And so,
you know,
the general principle again is that,

1845
01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:24.771
well actually here,

1846
01:45:24.771 --> 01:45:26.720
I'll bring up one other where the idea of and happiness hypothesis.

1847
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.640
I find it really helpful to think of the mind as being divided into parts like a

1848
01:45:31.641 --> 01:45:35.240
rider on an elephant.
And the rider is our conscious reasoning.

1849
01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:39.170
It's the little guy up on top who has language and it's what we're aware of,

1850
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:42.470
but the elephant is the other 99% of our minds.

1851
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.580
And that's almost all automatic processes.
It's intuitions,
it's emotions,

1852
01:45:46.610 --> 01:45:49.910
it's habits,
phobias,
all sorts of things.
Um,

1853
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.240
and so child development can't be just training the rider for 18 years.

1854
01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:59.540
Wisdom,
knowledge,
skill,
competence,
those,

1855
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:04.010
those have to involve training the elephant and when the two work together,

1856
01:46:04.011 --> 01:46:06.620
then you get the best results.
And I think we,
we just,

1857
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:10.070
what we've done in America especially is we've said,

1858
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:12.350
we want our kids to be really good in math,

1859
01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:16.820
so we're going to teach the math earlier,
let's give the math in kindergarten.

1860
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:19.370
But there's no evidence that that helps it.

1861
01:46:19.371 --> 01:46:22.130
There's no evidence that teaching academic skills earlier,

1862
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:25.520
we'll make them advance to a higher level at the end.

1863
01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.770
What they most need when they're young is to play.

1864
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:29.360
And we've taken that away from them.

1865
01:46:29.361 --> 01:46:34.361
We've given them too many afterschool lessons and too much supervision of their

1866
01:46:34.401 --> 01:46:35.234
play.

1867
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:38.450
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the saddest thing in the world is when my kids come home and they're</v>

1868
01:46:38.451 --> 01:46:40.860
really frustrated because they have homework,
you know,

1869
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:45.110
10 year olds that have hours of homework.
This is,
you're in school all day.

1870
01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:47.180
That's right.
And I don't know how to address that.
I mean,

1871
01:46:47.181 --> 01:46:50.070
do you bring it to the teachers and say,
Hey,
you guys are fucking up.

1872
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.490
Even though I've never taught anyone ever in class.
I'm telling you,

1873
01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:54.324
you're doing it wrong.

1874
01:46:54.450 --> 01:46:55.920
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
you know,
it's a,</v>

1875
01:46:55.921 --> 01:46:59.430
it's a case where you certainly need the research and the research.
Uh,

1876
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.520
we cover some of the research in chapters eight and nine of the coddling,

1877
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:06.120
the American mind.
Um,

1878
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.690
and as far as we can tell to be searched seems to show that they're essentially

1879
01:47:09.691 --> 01:47:13.110
no benefits to doing homework in kindergarten and first grade.

1880
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:16.650
Maybe a little bit of like,
you know,
they learned to organize their time,

1881
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:19.260
but barely any by fifth or sixth grade,

1882
01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:22.950
there's more evidence that homework is beneficial.
But in between there,

1883
01:47:22.951 --> 01:47:26.880
it really isn't clear.
What's really clear is that play free play is beneficial.

1884
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:32.010
So,
um,
so it's hard for you as,
as,
as just one parent to say,
Hey,
don't do this.

1885
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:36.690
But I think as part of a larger program to say,
our kids are being messed up,

1886
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:40.440
look at these graphs,
look at the rates of anxiety and depression.
And you know,

1887
01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:44.440
when I talk,
I talk about the book all around.
Um,
you talk,

1888
01:47:44.441 --> 01:47:47.040
not people not come up to me and they'll say like,
I'm a guitar teacher.

1889
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:50.910
I've been teaching guitar for 20 years and suddenly like just in the last few

1890
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:53.430
years,
I give them negative feedback and they crack.

1891
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:57.840
So everyone's beginning to notice that our kids are frail and nobody wants this.

1892
01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.280
And so I think we're going to find people more open to changing what we're
doing.

1893
01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:07.660
<v 1>Boy,
I hope so.
Um,
it's also,</v>

1894
01:48:08.890 --> 01:48:13.510
it's got to be so incredibly difficult to cater a lesson where you have,

1895
01:48:13.511 --> 01:48:13.751
you know,

1896
01:48:13.751 --> 01:48:18.610
30 or 40 kids in the classroom with varying abilities and varying interests and

1897
01:48:18.611 --> 01:48:22.600
you're sort of catering a lesson where we trying to excite them about astronomy

1898
01:48:22.601 --> 01:48:24.350
or whatever it is you're teaching and,

1899
01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:28.390
and get it through into their heads and make it seem fun.

1900
01:48:29.290 --> 01:48:33.220
Yeah.
Yeah.
And still teach them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1901
01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:36.310
And then still set them up to have a certain amount of discipline.

1902
01:48:36.311 --> 01:48:38.050
And if you're going to enter into the workforce,

1903
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:41.890
you're going to have to do things you don't necessarily want to do while you're

1904
01:48:41.891 --> 01:48:42.724
doing it.

1905
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:43.640
<v 0>That's right.</v>

1906
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.470
And if we're in now you add to that the decline of authority of teachers and

1907
01:48:48.471 --> 01:48:52.310
principals and you add to that the sense of empowerment that parents have to

1908
01:48:52.311 --> 01:48:56.180
find tune control and be involved.
Um,
the,
you know,

1909
01:48:56.181 --> 01:48:59.900
their stories now that parents who come to the lunchroom because they want to

1910
01:48:59.901 --> 01:49:03.050
see their kid at lunch.
Um,
um,
where,
you know,

1911
01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:06.500
where principals and teachers were once,
uh,
you know,

1912
01:49:06.501 --> 01:49:08.900
if the principal or if the teacher gives a bad grade,

1913
01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:11.580
the parents would assume that it was deserved.
A,

1914
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:14.820
I think there's more of a tendency in recent,
in the last decade or two,
uh,

1915
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.850
to have parents who are very competitive,

1916
01:49:16.851 --> 01:49:21.050
are concerned about getting the kid into college to complain.
So if you have,
um,

1917
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.030
I don't know how general these,
these trends are,

1918
01:49:23.031 --> 01:49:24.380
I don't want to overestimate this,

1919
01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:29.150
but if you have a general decline of authority of teachers and principals,

1920
01:49:29.690 --> 01:49:33.830
now they have less leeway to give negative experiences.
So if someone does,

1921
01:49:33.831 --> 01:49:37.670
if someone fails to turn in a paper because they were responsible and you say,

1922
01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:41.570
sorry,
f yeah,
that would could be a good learning experience.

1923
01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:46.290
<v 1>Right.
But it could be,
but it'd be devastating for their GPA.
And that's right.</v>

1924
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.970
That's probably a good thing though.
It's from

1925
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.820
<v 0>the understand the consequences.
Right,
exactly.
What about teaching children?</v>

1926
01:49:51.821 --> 01:49:56.140
How to think.
And why is that not a massive part of the curriculum?

1927
01:49:56.141 --> 01:50:00.030
Because I think that's something that I really had to learn on my own.
Um,

1928
01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:02.680
and I think it's one of the most valuable things that I've ever learned.

1929
01:50:02.681 --> 01:50:06.070
But as I got older,
I always thought,
why didn't I learn this in school?
Okay.

1930
01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:09.580
A couple of reasons.
So when,
uh,
in the 1980s,

1931
01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.410
there was a huge emphasis on teaching critical thinking and we don't hear about

1932
01:50:14.411 --> 01:50:19.370
that anymore because nobody found a way to do it.
Um,
so it's not that easy.
Uh,

1933
01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:22.960
one of the things I cover in the happiness I in the righteous mind is we're all

1934
01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:24.630
designed for confirmation bias.

1935
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.530
We're all really good at confirming what we already believe.
Um,
and so,
uh,

1936
01:50:29.531 --> 01:50:33.310
it's very hard to train anyone to disconfirm their own hypotheses.

1937
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:37.690
What we really need to think better is the right system,
the right community.

1938
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.460
We actually need critics.
So actually here I brought you a copy of a,

1939
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:43.980
of a little book that I coped produced.
All right.

1940
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:48.730
So this is John Stuart Mill wrote one of the most important books in the western

1941
01:50:48.731 --> 01:50:51.430
tradition on liberty chapter two.

1942
01:50:51.431 --> 01:50:56.431
Avant liberty is the best set of arguments ever made for free speech for why it

1943
01:50:57.461 --> 01:51:00.580
is that we need to let people talk and challenged and criticized.

1944
01:51:00.670 --> 01:51:04.270
Even if we think they're wrong,
we get smarter from having to rebut them,

1945
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.060
whereas if we shut them down,
if we have blasphemy laws,

1946
01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:10.960
we get dumber because we never actually faced tests of what we believe.

1947
01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:15.430
So this set of arguments in chapter two of on liberty is timeless.
I mean,

1948
01:51:15.431 --> 01:51:20.080
we need like mill anticipated every argument that we hear now about why we need

1949
01:51:20.081 --> 01:51:24.130
to shut that person down lot,
let that person talk.
And so I thought,
wow,

1950
01:51:24.131 --> 01:51:28.310
we need to get this book back out cause coushins don't read this anymore.
Um,

1951
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.250
and it's a little bit difficult,
the text.
So I,
um,
I happen to be friends with,

1952
01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:37.740
uh,
uh,
with Richard Reeves,
who's a mill scholar is at Brookings Institution and,

1953
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:41.510
and he called,
he said,
Jonathan,
I love what you're doing at Heterodox Academy.

1954
01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:44.110
If I can be of help,
let me know.
So I said,
well,
actually,
Richard,

1955
01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:49.270
would you coed it,
this addition of,
of um,
mills second chapter?
And he said,

1956
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:51.940
yes,
I'd love to.
So he made the selections,
we worked together to like,

1957
01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.600
to reduce it.
It's only 7,000 words,
so it's easy to read.

1958
01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:59.590
And then this wonderful artist,
Dave says,
Sorelli stopped by my office.
He said,

1959
01:51:59.591 --> 01:52:02.620
I love what you're doing,
a heterodox academy,
if I can be of help,
let me know.

1960
01:52:02.621 --> 01:52:06.790
And I said,
well,
actually could you read this text,
find mills metaphors?

1961
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:09.340
Cause millions is a lot of wonderful metaphors and illustrate them.

1962
01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:12.160
And so if you just pass it over,
which is,
it's that camera.
Okay.

1963
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:16.540
So what Dave did was he took a,
he took mills metaphors.

1964
01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:21.010
Um,
and so,
you know,
and we've got these like amazing,
you know,

1965
01:52:21.011 --> 01:52:26.011
graphic cartoon type images of the dynamics of what happens when we shame people

1966
01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:29.170
because mill was not concerned about government censorship.

1967
01:52:29.171 --> 01:52:31.420
That wasn't a big deal in London in 1859.

1968
01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:34.750
It was social censorship just as it is today.
So,
you know,

1969
01:52:34.751 --> 01:52:39.430
so Sorelli families made these beautiful illustrations,
uh,
of,
of mill's point.

1970
01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:43.350
And so we think that this book,
if this book was assigned,
uh,

1971
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.310
in every high school for seniors or every incoming

1972
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:49.640
<v 2>freshmen class,
uh,
we think that people would think a lot better.</v>

1973
01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:53.340
So you want to know how to do critical thinking,
read this book,
um,

1974
01:52:53.341 --> 01:52:56.030
and then seek out your opponents,
seek out your critics,

1975
01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:59.450
seek out the people who can do for you what you can't do for yourself,

1976
01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.940
which is challenge your ideas.
Are you concerned with this?
Uh,

1977
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.020
the trend that we're seeing now with social media of,
I mean,

1978
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:11.410
I get removing blatant racism and sexism and in certain really awful types of

1979
01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:17.150
behavior from certain social media sites,

1980
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:21.740
but at a certain point in time,
it becomes an,
an ideological battle.

1981
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.630
And people that lean one way or another want that other side to be silenced.

1982
01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:29.540
I'm seeing this way more from the left,

1983
01:53:29.541 --> 01:53:33.950
which is very disturbing to me because growing up my family was very liberal,

1984
01:53:33.951 --> 01:53:34.790
you know,
and I said,
well,

1985
01:53:34.791 --> 01:53:37.610
my formative years in San Francisco was always around hippies.

1986
01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:41.990
And I always felt like the people that were on the left with the open minded,

1987
01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:47.020
educated ones who were concerned with the future of discourse and humans,

1988
01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:52.670
uh,
developing the ability to really flesh out ideas and work their way through

1989
01:53:52.671 --> 01:53:55.730
them,
which only happens through three,
four through real free speech,

1990
01:53:56.120 --> 01:54:01.120
giving people the ability to express themselves and then deciding whether or not

1991
01:54:01.281 --> 01:54:06.230
you agree with that and why you disagree or agree and then speaking your mind

1992
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:08.720
and then everybody works it out together.
This,

1993
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:12.110
this is not necessarily the trend that we're seeing today.
Oh,
that's right.

1994
01:54:12.230 --> 01:54:16.010
That's right.
So first let me just say,
you can get this book for free.

1995
01:54:16.011 --> 01:54:21.011
At least you can download the pdf if you go to heterodoxacademy.org/mil or you

1996
01:54:21.861 --> 01:54:25.670
can get a $3 kindle.
Did you go to Amazon?
Look this up,
it's $3 for the kindle,

1997
01:54:25.671 --> 01:54:27.410
or you can buy the art book there too.
Awesome.

1998
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:30.080
That's so cool that you're doing that and allowing people to download it for

1999
01:54:30.081 --> 01:54:32.300
free too.
We want to get the word out.
We think this would be,

2000
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:35.150
these are the ideas that are needed.
So onto your question.
Um,

2001
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:38.630
so in part there's an empirical question here,
which I don't know the answer to.

2002
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:43.010
In Europe,
they,
uh,
ban in most they ban hate speech.

2003
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:45.410
So a or you know,
a Holocaust denial.

2004
01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:49.430
There's certain things that are illegal to crime.
Um,
and in America we don't,

2005
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.740
now it's an empirical question,
meaning it's open to actual investigation.
Um,

2006
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:55.820
does banning it,

2007
01:54:55.821 --> 01:54:59.990
push it underground and let the people feel that they are victims of being

2008
01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:04.370
silenced things and they come back stronger or is sunlight the best
disinfectant?

2009
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:07.370
Um,
I don't know the answer to that.
Um,
I think in general,

2010
01:55:07.371 --> 01:55:09.530
I think the American system has,
has worked better,

2011
01:55:09.531 --> 01:55:12.390
but I don't know their scholars who could,
who could address that.
Um,

2012
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:17.400
as for what is happening to the left is the left more intolerant.
Um,
I,

2013
01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:21.380
I agree with you that you would think the left would be more open.

2014
01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:23.180
And in my research on left,
right,

2015
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:27.230
the left is generally higher in openness to experience the idea of dissent.

2016
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:31.550
Dissent is patriotic.
These are leftist ideas,
not just idea.
So the left,

2017
01:55:31.551 --> 01:55:36.320
it should be more open.
Problem is any group that,

2018
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:40.880
any group that loses a variety that loses diversity,

2019
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:44.070
any group in which everybody thinks the same is at

2020
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:48.660
<v 0>risk of,
of turning it into an ideology of turned to her religion.</v>

2021
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.430
Uh,
and then you lose the ability to think straight.
And now if somebody,
so,

2022
01:55:53.431 --> 01:55:58.110
you know,
when I was in college at Yale,
you know,
everybody sort of leaned left,

2023
01:55:58.290 --> 01:56:00.750
but there was,
they were conservatives,
there were some conservative professors,

2024
01:56:00.751 --> 01:56:03.090
like I'd been exposed to some conservative ideas.

2025
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:07.830
But now if you're in a college that has essentially no conservatives that we'll

2026
01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:11.160
put out ideas and you encounter one,
now it's much more painful.

2027
01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.170
It's much more shocking.
Again,
it's like,

2028
01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:16.380
it's like you have a peanut allergy to ideas that are not your groups.

2029
01:56:16.710 --> 01:56:17.970
And we want,
so we,

2030
01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.960
it's terrible if we're putting young people in systems that are basically giving

2031
01:56:21.961 --> 01:56:24.030
them ideological peanut allergies.

2032
01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.080
<v 1>Hmm.
That's a great way to look at it.
Um,
I,
I,</v>

2033
01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:31.400
I definitely agree with that in terms of young people,
but I'm,

2034
01:56:31.401 --> 01:56:36.400
I'm concerned with grown adults as well.
I think that the way,
uh,

2035
01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.730
my personal opinion,

2036
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:42.910
the way to con the way to deal with bad speech is better speech or the way the

2037
01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:48.920
way deal with shitty ideas is to make those ideas look shitty through debate.

2038
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.470
It's not to silence the person that's talking.

2039
01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:56.471
This is one of the more confusing things about people that are pulling alarms on

2040
01:56:57.321 --> 01:57:00.320
speakers and,
and shouting them down while they're talking.

2041
01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:03.590
You have an opportunity when that person's in front of you to listen to their

2042
01:57:03.591 --> 01:57:07.190
idea and there should be an opportunity to,

2043
01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:10.090
to debate that idea,
to,
to,

2044
01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:13.480
to form your own opinion and have a,

2045
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.590
a really good argument against it.

2046
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:18.740
And to present that argument and to have people see both sides.

2047
01:57:18.741 --> 01:57:21.740
And this is what learning is supposed to be all about,

2048
01:57:21.741 --> 01:57:26.450
especially recognizing the flaws and ideas,
recognizing bias,

2049
01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:31.490
recognizing the lack of critical thinking or recognizing critical thinking and

2050
01:57:31.491 --> 01:57:32.324
applauding it.

2051
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:36.090
<v 0>Um,
I will agree with you depending on the context.</v>

2052
01:57:36.091 --> 01:57:41.091
What I mean is if you have a group of people interacting with certain norms or

2053
01:57:41.401 --> 01:57:46.050
laws,
um,
that,
that ban intimidation and violence,

2054
01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:49.980
um,
that,
um,
make people,
uh,

2055
01:57:49.981 --> 01:57:53.910
have some accountability for how they,
the style that they used to argue.
If you,

2056
01:57:53.911 --> 01:57:58.800
if you,
if you lie,
if you threaten something,
you're reputation,
something bad,

2057
01:57:58.801 --> 01:57:59.560
we'll come back to you.

2058
01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:02.020
<v 1>Yes.
Meaning intimidation and violence are probably the most,</v>

2059
01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:07.360
<v 0>those are,
um,
and so within a university,
I totally agree with you.
Now,</v>

2060
01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:12.670
if you look at the country as a whole or the internet as a whole and you have,

2061
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:13.450
um,

2062
01:58:13.450 --> 01:58:18.190
a culture war going on or you have a sense of us versus them and you have all

2063
01:58:18.191 --> 01:58:21.400
kinds of bad actors like the Russians discovered,
uh,
you know,

2064
01:58:21.610 --> 01:58:23.530
before then that were,
there was the,
the,
you know,

2065
01:58:23.531 --> 01:58:26.790
the fake news people who discovered they make fake articles and you know,

2066
01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:29.110
on the left and the right and it just turned out that actually the right would

2067
01:58:29.111 --> 01:58:31.630
click on the more.
So they went that way.
Um,
there are,

2068
01:58:31.631 --> 01:58:35.440
if there are people who are gaming the system,
then your idea,

2069
01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:36.880
which is mills' idea,
there are,

2070
01:58:36.881 --> 01:58:40.090
I think there are conditions in which it wouldn't work.
I'm not sure about that.

2071
01:58:40.091 --> 01:58:42.160
But I think there are six conditions

2072
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.230
<v 2>in which that logic would not work.</v>

2073
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:46.120
And so one thing that I'm very concerned about,

2074
01:58:46.270 --> 01:58:51.070
I don't see why it is that we can ever let people start an account where there's

2075
01:58:51.071 --> 01:58:54.880
no verification of who they are.
Not saying you can't have anonymous accounts.

2076
01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:55.571
Like,
you know,

2077
01:58:55.571 --> 01:58:57.910
I understand the reasons why you'd wanna be able to post without your real name.

2078
01:58:57.911 --> 01:59:01.720
That's fine.
But if you make a death threat or what,
you know,

2079
01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:02.770
what happens a lot is like,
you know,

2080
01:59:02.771 --> 01:59:05.770
there's research showing if you post something as a woman versus a man,

2081
01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.960
as a woman,
you're gonna get a lot more rape threats and things like that.
If you,

2082
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:11.680
if you post as a black person or white person,
you get a lot more racist stuff.

2083
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:12.800
So,
um,

2084
01:59:12.810 --> 01:59:16.930
at least the platforms should always know that you're a person and that you can,

2085
01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.190
your account can be shut down if you,

2086
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:20.830
if you talk this way because I think that um,

2087
01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.960
there are so many people saying such nasty stuff that it feeds back and changes

2088
01:59:24.970 --> 01:59:26.170
people's willingness to speak up.

2089
01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:29.140
My concern is not necessarily free speech per se,

2090
01:59:29.141 --> 01:59:31.150
it's free speech as a means to an end.

2091
01:59:31.450 --> 01:59:36.160
And that end is that we as individuals are kind of stupid and we only get smart

2092
01:59:36.161 --> 01:59:39.010
if you put us together in the right way where we can challenge each other.

2093
01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:42.400
That's what universities should do.
And when we have a call out culture,

2094
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:44.650
we're walking on egg shells,
we can no longer do that.

2095
01:59:45.010 --> 01:59:46.840
And in the marketplace of ideas,

2096
01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:52.060
I think it's really interesting to see those two things play out.
The one,

2097
01:59:52.061 --> 01:59:53.590
the benefit of being anonymous,

2098
01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:56.110
that you could talk about things without fear of retribution.

2099
01:59:56.111 --> 01:59:59.620
You could talk about things without fear of losing your job and controversial

2100
01:59:59.621 --> 02:00:04.150
ideas,
especially in this day and age that you know might not really be that

2101
02:00:04.151 --> 02:00:07.810
controversial to you or at least arguable to you,

2102
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:10.320
but that you could get shamed for it and you can get,

2103
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:13.810
people could take your words out of context and you could get in real trouble.

2104
02:00:13.810 --> 02:00:16.720
So there's a benefit of an anonymity.
But on the other hand,

2105
02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:21.010
when you're looking at slurs,
attacks,
threats,

2106
02:00:21.670 --> 02:00:26.200
stalking,
all that stuff,
it would be nice if we knew who was behind all this.

2107
02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:30.100
Absolutely.
Yeah.
So that's a case whereby I don't think it's a pendulum.

2108
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:33.760
I do think that there will be some technological solutions and maybe some social

2109
02:00:33.761 --> 02:00:38.761
norms so that people who critique in a certain way where it's slurs and it's

2110
02:00:39.101 --> 02:00:42.790
guilt by association,
those people will in some sense lose points,

2111
02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:44.620
lose credibility,
be downgraded.

2112
02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:50.190
My big word for 2019 is nuance that most things are complicated.

2113
02:00:50.561 --> 02:00:54.490
Least the things we're talking about are compensated.
And anybody who can say,

2114
02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:55.150
you know,

2115
02:00:55.150 --> 02:00:58.450
I think you're right about x but wrong about why like that should be a hundred

2116
02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:01.360
bonus points.
Yeah.
That is one of the essential skills of,

2117
02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:03.400
of sincerely engaging with people.

2118
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:07.780
And anybody who uses guilt by association loses a hundred points.

2119
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:11.470
So like one thing I'm finding because I'm a centrist,
um,
I,

2120
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:14.170
I only vote for Democrats.
I've never voted for a Republican,

2121
02:01:14.171 --> 02:01:16.370
but I consider myself philosophically,
um,

2122
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:21.010
to be a centrist and now people will say that I'm all right adjacent.
You know,

2123
02:01:21.070 --> 02:01:24.010
like the favorite one,
the adjacency.
That's a,
that's a wonderful,

2124
02:01:24.011 --> 02:01:27.190
I get that one because I've had people on the podcast that are right wingers.

2125
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.820
Yeah.

2126
02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:32.530
So you should say to them or they say on social media is anybody who makes an

2127
02:01:32.531 --> 02:01:37.210
adjacency argument.
Um,
is McCarthy adjacent?

2128
02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.130
That is me.
Say again,
if you're making a guilt

2129
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:42.800
<v 0>by association argument,
if you,
if you say an adjacency argument,</v>

2130
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:47.720
that's guilt by association.
Anybody does guilt by association is like Mccarthy,

2131
02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:49.730
therefore they're McCarthy adjacent.

2132
02:01:50.050 --> 02:01:52.950
<v 1>Yeah.
Wish I said that clear,
but it is a good argument.</v>

2133
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.310
That's a good definition of what you're saying.
Um,
it's,

2134
02:01:56.370 --> 02:02:01.260
it's a screwy thing that people are doing by this outright adjacent thing.

2135
02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.273
Well,
you know,

2136
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:07.470
someone wrote a whole chart of like people interacting with people and

2137
02:02:07.471 --> 02:02:10.830
connecting these people because they've had communication with these people and

2138
02:02:10.831 --> 02:02:14.790
so that somehow or another of these things are all related.
Like,
boy,
that is a,

2139
02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:18.510
yeah,
that's a squirrely argument.
No,
but,
but,
but actually this is

2140
02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:20.230
<v 0>the way the human mind works,
right?</v>

2141
02:02:20.231 --> 02:02:24.610
We have to see is that we evolved to do this kind of religion with witchcraft

2142
02:02:24.611 --> 02:02:26.760
believes and Voodoo.
Yes.
There's all,
you know,

2143
02:02:26.770 --> 02:02:31.150
there's all these patterns that recur all around the world and the miracle is

2144
02:02:31.151 --> 02:02:35.500
that there have been societies such as ours that developed norms of science,

2145
02:02:35.650 --> 02:02:37.270
norms of discourse,
norms of civility,

2146
02:02:37.271 --> 02:02:42.271
norms of toleration and free speech where the exceptions and it's precious and

2147
02:02:42.611 --> 02:02:44.890
it's easily lost.
I think I fear.

2148
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:49.830
<v 1>Do you think that it's also this new found ability to communicate that we're</v>

2149
02:02:49.831 --> 02:02:54.780
experiencing because of the Internet leads us to a lot of this sort of sloppy

2150
02:02:56.460 --> 02:03:00.450
arguing and categories category,
categorizing of,

2151
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:05.160
of humans and ideas that it's this,
we're just not used to these tools yet.

2152
02:03:05.670 --> 02:03:08.820
<v 0>Yes,
but it's not so,
so I,
I put this as a social psychologist.</v>

2153
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.810
So most of the commentary about this comes from cognitive psychologists or

2154
02:03:12.811 --> 02:03:16.590
people who talk about the information bubbles,
the filter bubbles as though,

2155
02:03:16.770 --> 02:03:21.390
you know,
I have my ideas in my head and if I'm exposed only to ideas from here,

2156
02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:24.330
then I'm going to have an incorrect bounce of ideas.

2157
02:03:24.450 --> 02:03:26.760
So to look at the information flow,
obviously these,

2158
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:30.330
these tools have vastly changed the information flow mostly for the better.

2159
02:03:30.610 --> 02:03:33.870
We can Google anything.
At any time.
Um,
so mostly for the better,

2160
02:03:33.930 --> 02:03:36.120
but we had this problem of unbounced like,
you know,

2161
02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:39.240
you'd only sugar or something so you haven't unbounced.
Dot.
Okay,
fine.

2162
02:03:39.241 --> 02:03:41.550
Those are problems.
I'm a social psychologist.

2163
02:03:41.730 --> 02:03:45.660
I think the social dynamics problems are vastly bigger,
vastly more dangerous.

2164
02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:51.080
And they are that if whatever I say or whether I will agree with you or whether

2165
02:03:51.811 --> 02:03:55.170
I'll even press the like button,
I'm thinking,
what's going to happen to me?

2166
02:03:55.230 --> 02:03:56.340
Who's going to nail me for it?

2167
02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:59.700
And there are people who go through my Twitter feed and they look at what I

2168
02:03:59.701 --> 02:04:01.830
liked months or years ago and they'll say,
well,

2169
02:04:01.831 --> 02:04:03.720
he liked this or he followed this Brit.
Yeah.

2170
02:04:03.721 --> 02:04:07.020
I follow people on the alt right and the far left and communists and fat.
I mean,

2171
02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:11.090
yeah,
I study this stuff.
But the idea that you could be somehow,
you know,

2172
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:15.900
blamed for having some connection.
This is what normal human people,

2173
02:04:16.050 --> 02:04:20.580
normal human beings do this guilt by association.
And we have to rise above it.

2174
02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:25.320
We have to call it out when we see it as it were.
Um,
and realize,
you know what,

2175
02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:29.970
we all need critics.
We all need to engage with a variety of viewpoints.

2176
02:04:30.450 --> 02:04:33.910
That's what John Stuart Mill said.
That's what common sense will tell you.
Uh,

2177
02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:37.650
and if we have institutions that don't expose students to a variety viewpoints,

2178
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:42.600
<v 2>it's possible that they are making them less wise when they graduate than they</v>

2179
02:04:42.601 --> 02:04:45.330
were when they arrived.
Well,
listen,
Jonathan,

2180
02:04:45.331 --> 02:04:48.030
we just crank through two hours and a,

2181
02:04:48.031 --> 02:04:52.110
I want to thank you for illuminating these ideas and for your great books and,

2182
02:04:52.111 --> 02:04:55.710
uh,
and thank you for coming on the podcast anytime you want to do it again.

2183
02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:59.280
So now let's do it again.
Thank you.
I'd love thank you so much.
Bye everybody.

2184
02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:03.920
Wow.
Wow.
