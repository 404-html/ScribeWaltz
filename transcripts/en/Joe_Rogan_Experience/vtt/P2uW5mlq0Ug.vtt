1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
The soccer.
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,
uh,

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:07.560
tomorrow live on Spike TV,
his glory world series with me,

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.850
my man Joe Schilling.
Last minute addition,
I want to talk to you about some shit,

4
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:16.380
dude.
Let's stop.
I was working out in my gym yesterday dying.
Okay.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.220
All I'm doing is hitting pads.
No one's hitting me back.
I'm fucking exhausted.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.830
And when I like to do,
when I'm,
when I'm working out.

7
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:27.680
And so I like to put fights on from motivation and I'm watching you and,
uh,

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.080
you're,
you're fighting in the,
the last man standing tournament.

9
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.710
You got to fight three times this,
this night.
You're,
you're fighting you.

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.620
You're going for fucking rounds.
Exhausting.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.020
Ridiculous fight.
And then I remember this shit.

12
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.940
Oh Shit.
Oops.
I just dropped Elvis.
Elvis has left the building.
Yeah,

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.390
I remember this shit.
Right?
And this is Brian Look and sent me this picture.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.010
What the fuck,
dude?
How are you able to have that kind of cardio?
I mean,

15
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:02.970
you fought three times that night for four rounds,
the first fight before you,
uh,

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.010
you,
uh,
won by knockout and you're,
you're smoking cigarettes.
Yeah.

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.070
How's that possible?
Oh,
Joe,
I didn't want to talk about this last time.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.100
First five minutes of the show.
Here you go.
It's just,
I couldn't believe it.

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.630
I really have a hard time believing it.
Like I was,
I was watching the fights.

20
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.410
I was like,
how the fuck does this guy have this kind of energy?
Uh,

21
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.750
would it be honest?
I was exhausted in the third round when a,

22
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.610
and went back to my corner and I looked at my coach and like,
you know,
he's like,

23
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.470
I think you'd have to go another round.
And I'm like,
fuck,

24
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:35.580
I did not want to go another round.
I was exhausted.
Uh,
no.
I just wanted to win.

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
And that was,
that's kind of what it did.
Well,
it was just a ridiculous fight too.

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.200
Yeah.
I mean it was,
the whole tournament was ridiculous.

27
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.660
It's crazy to make someone fight three times at night,
but that,

28
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.020
that first fight was just so fucking back and forth and wild and crazy.

29
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.800
And,
and for you to go that hard,
why you smoke cigarettes?

30
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.660
Yeah.
I don't,
like I said,
I can't,
I can't justify it.
I'm really,

31
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.080
I'm about ready to quit.
My last fight,
my cardio was,
you know,

32
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.110
I've done kickboxing for so long where he,
you know,

33
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350
I get tired like anybody else,
but uh,

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.060
for whatever reason it's never really bothered me that much.

35
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.210
And in the last fight he was holding me a lot and just the cardio system is

36
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.580
completely different and it's uh,
yeah,
it's coming to an end.

37
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.080
I'm getting really sick of smoking and I'm getting really sick of explaining,

38
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.040
having this conversation.
Joe Joe's the reason when I quit,

39
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.020
this will be the reason.
Well good.

40
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.690
Well I wanted to talk to you about these stupid vaporizing things,

41
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.810
but Simon Marcus,
the guy you're fighting is a tough motherfucker.

42
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.430
You guys going back and forth three rounds and then you'd go into the fourth

43
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:42.750
round and you still managed to knock them out in the fourth and that was a crazy

44
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.500
fight.
And to know that you're doing all this,
giving yourself mean,

45
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.250
what kind of a cardio deficit do you think cigarettes gives you?
Is it 5% may be?

46
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.680
Uh,
I really don't know.

47
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:56.100
I've been smoking since I was since before I started doing kickboxing.

48
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.810
So it was something that was just,
you know,

49
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.010
my cardio always sucks the beginning of the camp and then by the

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 1>end of camp and I'm out running everybody else.
And uh,
it's a,
it's,</v>

51
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.140
I'm sure it's a deficit of amazing cardio if you didn't smoke,

52
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.470
I mean think of that.
Unless,
you know what I used to think when I was young,

53
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.304
I was really retarded.

54
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.300
I would think that maybe smoking cigarettes is like weightlifting for your
lungs.

55
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.870
I kept,
makes your lungs work harder because like if you smoke,

56
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.090
if you work out really hard and you smoke,

57
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.960
like maybe your lungs have to like work extra hard to deal with that smoke and

58
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.650
they get stronger.
I quit for one fight when,
uh,

59
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.680
it was my last amateur fight and uh,
my coach,
you know,
it was against it.

60
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.440
Obviously it was against you quitting.
Oh,
it gets me smoking.

61
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.200
He said,
don't be a pussy beer.
Exactly.
So,

62
00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:45.580
uh,
yeah,
I quit for three months to train really,
really hard.
And,
um,

63
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.540
for whatever reason,
I was exhausted in the fight after the second round.

64
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.100
They were like,
you know,
seconds out and I'm like,

65
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.540
look at my coach and I can't stand up.

66
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.170
And my legs were like locked up and he had like lift me off the stool and uh,

67
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.920
I got robbed in the,
I lost that fight.
But it was,
you know,

68
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.150
everybody said I won the fight,
but whatever.
But uh,

69
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.870
that was my coach after the fight.
It was like,
you know what,
he quit,

70
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.700
he did everything I asked you to,
you know,
do whatever you want to do after that.

71
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.780
And Wow.
Yeah.
I wonder if you bought it was suffering nicotine withdrawal.

72
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.711
I don't know.

73
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.070
Or if I was overconfident and my cardio is gonna be so much better that I wasn't

74
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:19.480
pacing or something that could be right.
Yeah.
That's a big issue,
right?

75
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.480
That a lot of people that watch fights really have no idea the energy management

76
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:25.684
that's going on.

77
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.230
Like there's a whole bunch of management going on during a fight and energy

78
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.710
management is like a big issue.
Knowing when to,
when to blow it out.

79
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.330
And that's why you see like a lot of guys chill sun on the podcast said it best.

80
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.540
He said if you try to win by knockout but don't win by knockout,

81
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.430
you often lose decision.
Yeah.
You just don't have the gas to keep going.
Right.

82
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.930
It's pretty true.
How is that an experience thing you think?
Like when you're,

83
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.400
you're managing your energy like that in in the ring?
I think,
uh,
I think so.

84
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.910
I think it's,
uh,
it's also has a lot to do with like hiding how tired you are.

85
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.060
And like that example,
for example,

86
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:04.180
that fight with a seven Marcus you were talking about,
I usually,

87
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.120
the way I hide it and all the secrets can be out there with,
oh shit,

88
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.500
I'll do like a little walk off.
And if you notice like,
uh,
the ref broke us,

89
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.580
John McCarthy broke us and like I turned my back and I was walking away and I

90
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.080
was like,
that's where my breath.
And then he like,
you know,

91
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.460
he stalks me and as he's coming,
I'm waiting for them.
One big shot.
You know.

92
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:22.730
So it's like you're exhausted.
You,

93
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.790
you pace yourself for a second to give that next explosion,
the next explosion.

94
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.410
You know,
it's just experience.
I've,

95
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.950
I've always been tired and every fight I've ever had,
so I'm at that level,

96
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.140
you know.
But like my last fight with Bella tour,

97
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.610
I was just a different level of exhausted from the wrestling and Jujitsu that I

98
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.580
haven't been doing for 15 years of my life.
And you know,

99
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:46.630
I'm at a point now in my career where it's like I've worked my ass off for so

100
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:49.210
long that like kickboxing comes natural to me,
you know.

101
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.320
And with MMA it's like if I want to,
yeah,
I have half of the game down,

102
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.750
but if I want to really take this to the next level,

103
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:57.980
I have to improve on the ground

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.110
<v 0>and in the wrestling and that's going to take me improving my cardio I think.
So.</v>

105
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.210
Are you committed totally to fighting in both MMA and kickboxing or do you,

106
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.720
do you go back and forth on this or,
um,
you know,

107
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.420
I love kickboxing and I want to do it forever.

108
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.630
And if the opportunity stays there for me to do both,
then yes,

109
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:20.810
but I definitely have to step my game up and may if you know,

110
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.050
I really hate my record.
This last fight a fucking drives me nuts.

111
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.130
The last fight was a close one up until it got to the ground.

112
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.350
It just seemed like you were having a real hard time getting up.

113
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.090
It's like this is such a giant issue when it comes to the difference between the

114
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.860
kind of endurance that you have with grappling and you know,
and your,

115
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:43.490
your ability to calculate all the different moves and all the different,

116
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:48.290
like it takes so long to get grappling inflammation in your body and your head.

117
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.040
There's just so much stuff that's going on when guys are holding you down and

118
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:54.590
say like is a few guys that get the,
the,

119
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.050
the takedown defense game down like Cro,

120
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.960
cop did and pride and then start to become really successful.

121
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.860
But once they actually get taken down and actually get held down in the ground,

122
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:08.420
like it just saps you of your energy.
Right.
And it,
it takes away.
I was watching,

123
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.721
I was like,

124
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.200
I wonder how frustrating this is for him because you're used to fighting your

125
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:15.200
style of fight,
your style,
fights,
kickboxing.
Right.
You know,

126
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:18.380
and then all of a sudden you've got this guy on top of you and you can't get up

127
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.071
and you know,

128
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.500
he's holding you down and nothing really was happening on the ground.

129
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.220
Like there wasn't,

130
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.760
there wasn't a lot of ground and pound wasn't like real significant submission

131
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.000
attempts,
but it's just keeping you from doing the shit you want to do it right.

132
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.300
Yeah.
It was incredibly frustrating.
Incredibly frustrating.

133
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.080
Do you think about just not doing it anymore?
Uh,
not really.
Cause I,

134
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.340
you know,
this is not who I am.
When things are frustrating and hard,
I don't quit.

135
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.990
I just step it up to the next level usually,
which is,
you know,

136
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:46.390
it's something I like about myself.
So I don't want to change that.
Well,
no,

137
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.700
that's a good quality for sure.
It's just,
you know,
it's frustrating.
And then,

138
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.510
you know,
I obviously have things that I needed to work on and I,
you know,

139
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.250
I had stuff from the camp and I was really sick during the cap and it's,

140
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.140
you can continue to kickbox when you're really sick,
you know,
to an extent.

141
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.130
But like you can't do Jujitsu and be like drooling and slobbering and fucking

142
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:06.650
sweat and then some guys face when you have the flu,
you know?

143
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.060
So like for that camp,

144
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:11.210
I only had like three weeks of Jujitsu and then I was sick for three weeks ahead

145
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:15.590
of fucking bronchitis and lung infection.
That nasty shit,

146
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.380
which probably fucking smoking wasn't,
you know,

147
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.620
we just smiled while you had the bronchitis.
I was just smoking all the time.

148
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.550
What I wanted to ask you is about these stupid,

149
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:29.710
these stupid vaporizer things that people keep sending me.
These vape.
Yeah.

150
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.990
I'm actually sponsored by firebrand and it's been good.

151
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.780
I think I'm going to start using that stuff to,
uh,
to quit.

152
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.250
That's a way better thing for your lungs,
right?
I mean,
I think so allegedly,

153
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.810
allegedly,
you know,

154
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.110
I'm sure in 20 years they're going to say that was the reason that,
you know,

155
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.400
Joe got brain cancer.
I just,

156
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.840
I wonder how,
I mean,
I know that,
uh,

157
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.890
being a professional fighter takes a tremendous amount of and time and I wonder

158
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:01.200
like,
when I see you in glory and I see you also in,
in Beltour,
I'm like,
man,

159
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:05.670
does this guy have the amount of time that it takes to compete at the level that

160
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:08.520
you compete at in kickboxing in both?
I mean,

161
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:13.350
do you have the time to put into Jujitsu and to wrestling defense and stuff like

162
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.250
that?
It's,
it's,
it's been really tough,
you know,
the,
um,

163
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.290
at the beginning of the year I was really excited about it.

164
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.370
I was gonna be a busy year,
you know,

165
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:24.270
but it's really hard to have a fight and then immediately go right into another

166
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.900
training camp for a different style for,
you know,
for another sport.
And it's,
uh,

167
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.510
you know,
it's like these fight my next fight,
June 26.

168
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.150
And it's like I just fought and jumping right back into clutter or belts or oh,

169
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.920
back in it again,
which is nice cause Lisa's two in a row,
you know.
Um,
yeah,

170
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.330
should be good.
I'm leaving tomorrow to a Florida,

171
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:45.270
it'll be American top team for three weeks.
It makes you a good move.

172
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.500
I'm gonna be a sparring with Tiago Elvis for his fight with Carlos condit and

173
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:49.801
then you know,

174
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:52.860
working a lot with the wrestling team and with the king mo out there.

175
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.070
So that's very smart for him.
Cause uh,
you know,

176
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.930
Carlos and you have similar builds.
That's a,

177
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.900
that's a very smart fame and that's great for you too.

178
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.470
That's a great camp as far as like wrestling knowledge and grappling knowledge.

179
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.880
Right.
You know,
he said,
you know,

180
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.120
I'm not the kind of person that like when I lose a fight,
I'm like,
oh,

181
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:10.110
I don't want to do this shit anymore.

182
00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:11.760
I'll just go to where I'm good and you know.
Right.

183
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.960
What do I need to do different?

184
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:15.960
I need to get with a better team that's more focused on him and man has better

185
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:20.640
wrestlers,
you know,
work this up.
I totally get that.

186
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.570
But I would wonder how you could do both.
Like that's what I would wonder.

187
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:27.450
I mean I could totally get you saying,
Hey,
you know what?

188
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.810
Right now I'm in my athletic prime.
I think that the,

189
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:34.980
the eyes are on him and may right now and I'm just going to make the jump and

190
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:36.670
just fully make the jump but to do both.

191
00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:39.840
And you're still active at a world class level in kickboxing,

192
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.260
you fighting world champions and kickboxing and the real number one contender

193
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:46.710
right now for Gloria.
But I couldn't take care of that shit.
So statement my eyes.

194
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.400
The last person that you know,
I knocked outside my nose ring number one.

195
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:54.600
He beat two guys that weren't even in the top three and somehow got rank number

196
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:58.260
one to fight out to 11 I,
I'm just saying well those are good fights though.

197
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.990
They were good fights,
but it's San Joe

198
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.610
just got said it did get it gets said they've got to now like two to make the

199
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:11.070
decision though to like say if you have a camp and a,

200
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.920
you're going to go and do this bell tour fight in June.
Um,

201
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.920
and then if they offer you a kickboxing fight,
like saying August,

202
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.710
is that a difficult decision?
Like do you say like,
Hey,
you know,

203
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:21.810
I would rather be kickbox and were like four or five months,

204
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.250
really get sharpened in the groove or is it okay to bounce back and forth?

205
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.480
Do you do enough kickboxing during your MMA training?
Uh,
I think I can go,

206
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.420
I can go back and forth with kickboxing at that level.
You know,
it's,

207
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:34.220
you just cut out.

208
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.490
The problem is when I do the kickboxing fight and then they offered me a belts

209
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.480
were fight right away because when I,

210
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.020
if I fought Bella tour in June and then I was going to fight kickboxing in

211
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:47.280
August,
July,
end of June and July and August,

212
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:49.670
I wouldn't be doing any wrestling or,
you know,
just don't of time,

213
00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:54.370
like focusing on kick boxing,
sparring,
all that stuff.
So that kind of the issue,

214
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.020
you know,
it was going back and forth.

215
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.040
Would it make any difference at all if it was a Moitai fine instead of,
um,

216
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.390
instead of kickboxing,

217
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:04.570
like if you're doing Muay Thai all the time and then went right into MMA where

218
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:08.260
you got a little bit more grappling,
would that have any effect?
Um,

219
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.430
possibly.
I mean,
I still train pretty much the same.

220
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:16.150
The difference would be the elbows for that,
uh,
is,
you know,

221
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.370
we're not five or clench work,
not so much.
Um,

222
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.150
I've still clenching with kickboxing,
just not for as long a period of time.
Um,

223
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.190
you know,
every referee is different.
Even with Gloria,

224
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:29.940
it's like they say no clinching,
but then you watch my fight with Simon,

225
00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:33.640
they were still way longer than five seconds of clenching in there.
So,
uh,

226
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.920
training wise it's still the same for me.

227
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.580
That's one of the reasons why it was so particularly impressive that first four

228
00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:44.020
round fight because Simon Marcus's Moyie Thai guy and he's known,

229
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.890
that's the one of his specialties is his clinch and he's just very physically

230
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:50.530
strong and he's,
he fights it draining,
kind of fight,

231
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.320
just really gets a holy guys and manipulates you around.

232
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:56.230
There's a lot of knees and elbows in the clinch and,
uh,

233
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:00.520
the fucking go four rounds of that guy and then fight two more times afterwards

234
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.960
and then against Wayne Barrett and fucking art 11,
like,
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

235
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.010
When I was walking out or limping out for the,
you know,

236
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.500
after I beat Simon the first time I was like on a high and then beating,

237
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.450
you know,
uh,
Wayne,
it was just like,
fuck,
I gotta fight.
It was,
there was no high.

238
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:19.750
It was like,
I like fucking one more fight after this is crazy.
And,
uh,

239
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:21.670
we were in the back dressing room and everyone's just kind of,

240
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:23.620
everybody was just in shock and just kind of looking at me like,

241
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.320
how are the fuck are you going to do this?
And I'm looking at them and like,

242
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.240
I have no fucking idea.
I'm going to do this right now.

243
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.680
And I was limping to the ring and I'm just like,
when was this?

244
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.060
When was the cigarette?
That cigarette was right after the fight with uh,

245
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.850
Robert Thomas in the dressing room.

246
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.450
Ryan Lochte loco shut up my dress room before I got in the shower and it was

247
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:46.900
like taking pictures and I'm like,
he's like,
can I,
can I take,

248
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.790
I won't take a photo.
I'm like,
Ryan,
just take the picture
here.

249
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.830
This now.
When you fought in a tournament,

250
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:55.840
you didn't have any cigarettes in between fights or anything?

251
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:59.770
Did you have to Simon?
I went outside and had a serious,
true story.

252
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.120
Oh my God,
you got a cigarette and then fought twice more.

253
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.750
I mean for all this cigarettes like I should,
we get sponsored by Marlboro.
Right?

254
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.270
You should fuck the Reebok deal in Marlborough.
What's up?

255
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.400
Cowboy gets sponsored by Budweiser.
Does he?

256
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.490
He's always wearing Budweiser shirts that gotta be thrown him some cash.

257
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.060
I can't imagine.
He's not.
Yeah,

258
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.740
I don't seem to do it without a Budweiser shirt on.
Yeah.

259
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.950
I could be their poster boy.
Yeah.
Well if anybody would like,

260
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.600
like marble would love you.
Yeah.
Like look at this fucking guy.
You know.

261
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.820
What do you smoke?
What kind of smoke?
My rear lights.
There you go.

262
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.690
They'd probably be like,
look folks,
the lights are okay.
Yeah.
Hey,

263
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.850
this guy's got great.
Cardio is perfect.
How does a man fight so many rounds?

264
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.230
You know,
three different guys one night.
Come on.
It's not that bad.
Right?

265
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.150
Don't be a pussy.
Don't be a pussy.
Yeah.

266
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:53.180
Those,
um,
those vaporizer things though,
they did have helped a lot of people.

267
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:56.680
Right?
Like what about gum?
You ever try that shit?
I can't stand it.

268
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.600
And just nicotine gum not to do it.

269
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.030
And I'm like you just to keep it good for your mouth.
John on fucking nicotine.

270
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.680
I don't think nicotine is really as bad as the chemicals that are in it.

271
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:09.860
And the burning of the,
um,
the,
the plant matter.

272
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.540
I think there's something about the burning of the actual leaves themselves and

273
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:15.141
then the,

274
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:20.141
the 500 plus chemicals that the cigarette companies put into cigarettes to

275
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:25.610
enhance the flavor and to enhance the addictive properties of it.
So there's a,

276
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.930
an interesting topic.
So now,
uh,

277
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.060
Philip Morris is making their own,
we'd products now,

278
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.080
I heard that they had,
uh,
you know,

279
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.820
they had some big fucking thing and that they're,
you know,
they're,

280
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.790
they're getting ready for the whole distribution of,
yeah.

281
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.280
So I have like Marlboro cigarettes.

282
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.820
So it's like you go ahead and take something like natural and healthy and then

283
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.610
give it to a,
a cigarette company and watch what happens.

284
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:52.850
And then all people will be getting fucking cancer and all kinds of shit from

285
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.540
smoking weed.
Yeah,
right.
They'll become republicans.
Like something will happen.

286
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:59.330
They'll put some shit in the cigarettes and you're like,
you know what?
I'm not,

287
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:02.670
I don't think I'm real excited about gay marriage.
And he's like,
all of a sudden,

288
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.490
sudden people have these weird Republican right wing views.
Um,

289
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.690
I think that,
uh,

290
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.230
it's real possible cause if you see those natural cigarettes like those,
uh,

291
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:16.160
American,
one of those American spirits,
spirits,
those are just tobacco,
right?

292
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.650
Apparently they taste like shit.
No friends smoking will not,
that'd be fun.

293
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:21.710
And they'll burn forever,

294
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.110
which I guess is without the chemicals like a cigarette.

295
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.410
If you just light a cigarette and you sit in the ashtray,

296
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.610
it will burn all the way down.

297
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.260
Like if you like a joint instead of the SGA would burn out,
you know,

298
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.340
it won't burn the whole thing.
But I guess it's the chemicals in it.
They like it,

299
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.030
they keep it lit or keep it burning and then the,
uh,
the American spirits,

300
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:41.090
it's like,
it takes forever to smoke one.
You just kind of good.

301
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:43.670
You only smoke like half of it and get rid of that.
But the disgusting,
right.

302
00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:46.820
Pretty Nasty to my opinion.
Did it give you the same rush?

303
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.880
Like that's what you're getting,
right?
This nicotine rush,
right?
Yeah.

304
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.840
I mean I guess so.

305
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.100
Let me give you the same feeling because I think that tobacco itself is,

306
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.300
I don't think it's good for you,

307
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:00.620
but I don't think it's nearly as bad for you as the tobacco with all the jazz in

308
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:03.950
it.
Yeah.
Right.
Did you ever see that movie the insider,
a Russell Crowe?

309
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.050
It's uh,
about,
you know,
you don't really know how much,

310
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.720
whenever they do a movie on real life situations,

311
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:14.450
you don't know how much fuckery is involved and manipulate things.

312
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.750
But the movie is about a guy who is a scientist working for cigarette companies

313
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:25.490
that his whole deal is figuring out how to make them more addictive than he

314
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.400
testifies against cigarette companies.
And they,
you know,

315
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.890
they're fucking stock in his home,
scaring the shit out of them.

316
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:32.960
And it's apparently supposedly,
supposedly,

317
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.230
you've got to say that based on a real story based on a real story,

318
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.780
but there are hundreds of chemicals,

319
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:43.781
500 plus chemicals that they put into cigarettes for various reasons.

320
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.240
Yeah.
Why would they do then that menthol taste?

321
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.190
I want to know how got into the black community.
How did uh,
men,
Coles?
Yeah.

322
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.840
The Nike Nike Sign,
isn't it?
Hmm.
No,

323
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.030
that's the new port is in Newport and before it has the Nike side,

324
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.590
I don't know how they do it.
Cools.
That's true.
Right cools.
It was like,

325
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:07.740
it's interesting how like certain cigarettes are for,

326
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.160
I mean they're just fucking cigarettes,
but they figured out a way to brand them.

327
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.060
So they appealed towards certain ethnic groups.
You know,

328
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.560
like lucky strikes.

329
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:21.561
You got to be some sort of a savage like mechanic with fucking a missing Pinky,

330
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.610
you know,
if you're drinking,
if you're smoking,

331
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:27.580
those filtered lucky strikes you trout probably drinking Pabst blue ribbon

332
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.710
writer that can,
you know,
write your,
your uh,
your,

333
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.510
your fingernails are always dirty.
He drinking,

334
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.280
you're drinking horrible booze and you smoking lucky strikes.

335
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.940
Everybody knows that you don't see black people smoking lucky strikes when it's

336
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:46.050
time you saw a black guy smoking American spirits.
Now there's a white hipsters,

337
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:49.110
right?
Yeah,
pretty much.
Yeah.
Try to be natural.

338
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.680
But Kools I just remember cool.

339
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:54.630
So like there was an Eddie Murphy movie and it was,

340
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.090
they would always have like the black guy like Glen,
my packet cools man,

341
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.070
give me that pack of cool.

342
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.420
My mother used to smoke Kools I don't know what that says about my mom can't be

343
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:04.254
good.

344
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.140
I want to say anything about Joe's mom.
Yeah man.
If you think,

345
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.600
if you see a young white Gal and she's smoking Kools and you're a black guy,

346
00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:17.520
you probably think you've got a shot.
Like I see what she's doing.

347
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:18.690
She's sending out the bat signal.

348
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.440
It's just bizarre that there's certain cigarettes that they appeal to certain

349
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:29.520
ethnic groups.
Huh?
Never thought about that.
Yeah.
It's um,
marketing man.

350
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:32.760
Marketing is fucked.
How clean is your diet when you a,

351
00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:35.850
I mean obviously you have the issue with the cigarettes,
but other than that,

352
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.820
the issue with the cigarettes,
how clean is your diet when you're training?
Um,

353
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.030
when I'm training I just don't eat like fast food and shit like that.

354
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.720
But that's pretty much it.
You know,

355
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.770
it's pretty weight management base that would think,
you know,

356
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:50.940
if my weight's good than I eat,
you know what I want.
But if it's a,
you know,

357
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.180
when I used to fight like once,
uh,
once 75,
one 68,

358
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.080
then it was like a month of low carb and it was killing myself,

359
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.610
chicken salads three times a day.
Oh,
so you do like,
um,
like an Atkins type deal?

360
00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:06.330
Yeah,
when I do low carb.
But like it works really well to take off the weight.

361
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.480
Doesn't have as fuck with your energy.
Yeah.
W it would,

362
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.010
especially as the fight got closer and it would really start cutting back on

363
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:17.760
carbs.
Like I would try to keep carbs like a under a hundred a day.

364
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.830
And then as I got closer it would be like under 50.

365
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:21.840
And like last week it'd be like almost no carbs.

366
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:25.050
And then I had to find myself like pulling out in front of,
in traffic,

367
00:20:25.051 --> 00:20:29.820
like your brain works off of,
of carbs and water.
So,
uh,
yeah,
it wasn't good.

368
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.090
When I went up to one 81 87 for glory,
uh,

369
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.440
it was a lot easier to make weight and my performance was way,
way,
way better.

370
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.660
Yeah.
I would only imagine there's gotta be a significant point of,
you know,

371
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.390
what you would call diminishing returns where you can only cut so much weight

372
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:46.950
where it's not going to benefit.
Yeah,

373
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.600
totally sound like when you see guys like Frankie Edgar that fought so well at

374
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:57.130
one 55 and he weighed one 55 and then you see other dudes that are coming down

375
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.090
from,
you know,
way,

376
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.990
way above that are oftentimes like in the high one eight glazed and t value.

377
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:05.170
Or see that guy in real life.
Wait till you meet him.

378
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.820
You're going to go down to American top team.

379
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.200
You're going to look at that guy and you go,

380
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:11.860
how in the fuck does that kind of make one 55 I mean,

381
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:16.540
it doesn't make any sense.
He's huge.
I mean,
he's fucking huge.
I mean,

382
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:19.630
he's like,
you'd be one 90 I dunno,
I dunno how he does it.

383
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.090
You see him when he's getting ready to weigh in,
you're like,

384
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.820
that doesn't even make sense.
Like that's not even one 55.

385
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:27.770
Now he gets in the scale,
it says one 55.
And you're like,
well,

386
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.290
how's that possible?
Yeah.
I don't see a lot of those guys.
I just don't get it.

387
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.130
I just don't understand.
That's the dark secret of MMA.

388
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.390
The dark secret of combat sports is the weight cut.
It's very dangerous.

389
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.510
You heard about that guy that just died recently?
Kidney failure.
No,

390
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.370
amateur guy just died.
Just a like a week or two ago.

391
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.590
Yeah.
He had a kidney failure.
They,
uh,
pulled him out,
took him to the hospital.

392
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:56.770
I believe he died shortly after,
I want to say a day or two later,

393
00:21:56.771 --> 00:22:01.660
but that's terrible.
Yeah.
It said fucking dehydration,
man.
It's just so dangerous.

394
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.210
It really is.
There really is.
I mean I had some really,

395
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:08.860
really bad cuts in the past and obviously the,
yeah,
the performance wasn't good,

396
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:12.510
but there was a couple of minutes where it was like walking to the way in like

397
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.790
there was,
it was a good,
uh,
at commerce casino,

398
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:19.720
there's like a long fucking stairway and like every step I would have to stop

399
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.650
and like when I take another step is they're like 15 minutes to get up the

400
00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:26.080
stairs and it was like the doctor like check,
you know,

401
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:27.910
does like the check or whatever beforehand.
And he's like,

402
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:30.790
I'm going to let you cut another ounce if you don't make it.

403
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:33.330
Because usually they give you like two hours to make two more pounds or
wherever.

404
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.620
He's like,
you're not cutting anymore weight.

405
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.110
And I had to like tell him to come home.
I'm okay.
I have a nurse standing by,

406
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.990
I'm going to get an Ivy,
like I'm going to be all right.
But it was really,

407
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.180
really bad.
And then you know,
you see some of these guys,
uh,
which,

408
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.040
and he was the ultimate fighter where the guy who was like in the back cramping

409
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:51.760
and screaming,
crying,
they wouldn't let them fight.
But yeah,

410
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:55.930
I don't know why people go that that far.
It's all the wrestling,

411
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.220
the influence of wrestling.

412
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:59.840
Cause that's always been a part of the wrestling culture.
Like if you,

413
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.840
if you tried to wrestle at your natural weight,

414
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:04.990
you're a pussy and let you be like what?
You can't cut weight,
you can't,

415
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:05.980
you can't be uncomfortable.

416
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.290
Like wrestlers only seem to be happy when they're miserable.
Like they're,

417
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.400
they're happy when they're chewing ice and running upstairs.
They slide,

418
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.090
they're like marines and a certain way we're like marines.

419
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.430
You were talked to marines.
They,
they always want,
like they'll,

420
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.140
they'll brag about how much more miserable there time was and other people's

421
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:23.901
time.
Like they,

422
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:28.300
they take pride in the fact that they can suffer and being able to do it.
Yeah.

423
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.260
I mean I guess there's,
you know,
look,
it's not easy to fucking enduring misery.

424
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.320
I guess there's a badge of courage attached to that.

425
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:40.210
But when it comes to wrestling,
there's like a culture of being miserable.

426
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:44.290
A culture of like overtraining,
like no one overtrained like wrestlers.

427
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.720
I could say it's a significant issue because yeah,

428
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:49.340
you get mental toughness out of it.

429
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:52.520
Like there's no one mentally tougher than wrestlers when it comes to MMA.

430
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.080
Like when those guys enter into,
into MMA,
they have this,

431
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.000
this fucking steel determination,
like the elite high level wrestlers.

432
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.550
Do you get it from elite high,
real high level kick boxers as well.

433
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.880
But it seems like there's something about that.

434
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.720
The grind of amateur wrestling going through high school,
going to college,

435
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:15.470
going through,
you know,
a Olympic trials and references do the,
the,

436
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.170
the level of intensity and the wrestling room and the dealing,

437
00:24:18.171 --> 00:24:22.220
the constantly dealing with being in a bad state physically,

438
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.450
like constantly overtrained they just develop this mindset of,

439
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:28.730
of driving through that cause this sounds miserable.
I mean,

440
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:33.110
I feel depressed was when you talk about it,
he wants to do that shit.

441
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.420
Yeah.
There's talk about,
um,
the,
the guy who runs,
um,
the,
uh,

442
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.670
California State Athletic Commission.
Um,
he wants to have people,

443
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.550
Andy Foster,
very smart guy,
had a good conversation with him.
He wants to uh,

444
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.030
talk to,
uh,
guys about pop.

445
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:56.110
Possibly putting some sort of a limit as to how much you can gain like till like

446
00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.100
after the,
after the land to discourage like really bad weight cuts.
Like,

447
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:04.430
you know,
cut it to like 10 pounds,
15 pounds,
whatever the fuck it is,

448
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:08.570
whatever the number is.
What do you think of that?
Uh,
well,

449
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.890
I mean the theory is good,
but then you still have the same problem as before.

450
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:15.680
You get these guys that think they can cut 30 pounds and then I'll just put it

451
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.890
on 10 more,
you know,
and we'll then you're,
you're still fighting dehydrated.

452
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.070
You're going to have the same injuries and risks.

453
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.270
You're most risky more now cause you're not allowing them to at least get in

454
00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:29.800
there healthy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I agree.
You know,
I think the,

455
00:25:29.801 --> 00:25:33.630
the real way to do it is probably the way someone like six weeks out.
Yeah.

456
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.640
You know,
and then,
and then figure out how much you would allow them.

457
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.540
But they would cheat them to cut weight once a week for the way.
Yeah.

458
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.670
They would just cut a shitload of wait six weeks out and just lie,
you know,

459
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.650
they'd cut 10 pounds and then you'd say,
all right,

460
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:51.830
you can lose 15 more and then now they're cutting 25 you know,

461
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.300
it's just seems like the other option is the day of Wayne's,

462
00:25:56.301 --> 00:26:00.110
which is a terrible cause they'll cut weight then too.
Yeah,
they'll do it.
Yeah.

463
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.320
Yeah.
I don't know how to fix it other than telling people what's bad for you.

464
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.510
You know,
more people die I guess.
Yeah,
I'd say,

465
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.370
I mean would there be a benefit of making people fight it their natural way?

466
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:16.040
Like what do you,
what do you walk around and like close to 200 yeah,

467
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:20.690
I'm about two oh five right now.
And when you get into the ring,
when you fight,

468
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.590
like saying glory,

469
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.190
will you be about to home 200 some of them around like 200 pounds.

470
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.900
What about like making some sort of agreement with other fighters that also,

471
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:33.740
I like that lack of guy like Simon,
like just way in the day of the fight.

472
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.970
No cutting weight.
Like this is what you gotta wait,
you gotta wait 200 pounds.

473
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.880
Yeah.
Or maybe getting that big can make an opening like you okay.

474
00:26:41.881 --> 00:26:44.820
You gotta be between one 90 and 200 you know what I mean?
Right.

475
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:48.940
But 10 people cut weight.
Right.
What wouldn't,

476
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.210
they'd cut weight to make 200.
Yeah,
but they'd be bigger.

477
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:56.070
They bulk up to like two 10 and cut down
almost.

478
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:58.200
Seems like there's no way to,
there's no way to fix it.

479
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:02.520
I guess that's a fucked up situation.
Uh,
and for people who don't know,

480
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.140
the real issue with a weight cutting when it comes to combat sports as opposed

481
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:12.060
to wrestling is head trauma.
Because a,
your brain takes a while when you're,

482
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.400
especially when you're just ingesting fluids orally,

483
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:17.340
meaning just drinking water or pedialyte or whatever.

484
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:21.120
It takes a while to get up to your brain.
But in wrestling,

485
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:23.790
that's okay cause no one's kicking you in the head right now.

486
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:26.340
When you were in MMA or kickboxing,

487
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.130
you got a real issue because it takes a while for it,

488
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.220
which is why everybody likes to go with uh,
ivy bags.

489
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.340
Fuck Salmon.
Almost like MMA is too much.

490
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.910
There's like too much going on between all the different shit you have to do.

491
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:44.640
And then also you have five minute rounds as opposed to three minute rounds of

492
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:49.140
kickboxing.
The wrestling,
kickboxing,
the,
the submissions,

493
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:50.820
like all,
all the different variables.

494
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.150
It's almost like you're fucking can't keep up with it.
Yeah.

495
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.620
There's a lot of shit going on there.
I don't know how to fix the weight.

496
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.130
I mean it's gotta be an issue in boxing tuna.
It was just don't talk about it.

497
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.340
It's not as big an issue.
It's not as big an issue because the,

498
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.730
the physical weight is not as big an issue.
It's an issue.

499
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:12.620
But it's not as big an issue as say like a guy who can take you down and oh is

500
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.850
that weight on top of you?
Right.

501
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.740
Cause the weight isn't going to really help you that much.
Yeah.

502
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.640
Like you see a guy like Chris Weidman who fights at one 85 he does not weigh one

503
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:23.430
85 right now.
If you wade Chris Weidman right now,

504
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:25.380
he's got to be well over 200 pounds.

505
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:30.381
He's a big boy and he has a hard cut to get down to one 85 and he's a UFC

506
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:34.620
middleweight champion,
you know,
so.
And he fights a very,

507
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:39.600
very heavy physical style.
Very a very aggressive gets on top.

508
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:43.410
But do it's vicious ground and pound knows how to use his weight and if you're

509
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:44.370
not prepared to that way,

510
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:47.730
like after Liotta fondom one of the first things Liotta said was,

511
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:50.100
I got to get stronger.
I just got to get bigger.
I just can't,

512
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.240
can't fight at this weight.

513
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.540
<v 1>Yeah.
There's like,
you know,</v>

514
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.540
some people they just gain weight easier than other people.

515
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:00.420
Like some guys in shape could be right around two oh five,

516
00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:03.720
but when they're out of shape and get all the way up to like 225 pounds,
me,

517
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:07.620
I'm like two oh five to two 10 period and shape out of shape,
whatever.

518
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:10.680
Like I don't,
I don't know.
I'm not the type of guy that gets fat,

519
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.710
you know what I mean?
That's smart.
Well,
it's just,
I wish I could gain weight.

520
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:15.560
It would be a little easier.
You know,
if I,

521
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.890
for me to bulk up for a fight and do the weights and I'm drinking like 3000

522
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:24.420
calorie shakes,
like twice a day just to try to put weight on.
And uh,
it's,

523
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.120
I see these other guys that,
you know that,
uh,

524
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.220
who's that Bella tour champion Housley he posted a picture the other day and it

525
00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:33.450
was like two 30.

526
00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Did you see there's a,</v>

527
00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:39.100
there was an article in the underground about that guy or people were accusing

528
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:43.480
him of a Mexican supplements.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

529
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.170
I forget.
I don't like to engage in those things cause I don't know what,

530
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.310
who's telling the truth or who's not telling the truth.
Anytime someone fights.

531
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:56.270
Well,
was all immediate accusations.
Like that was one with a hot file.

532
00:29:56.271 --> 00:29:59.440
Dos Anjos after he beat Pettis,
like everybody was saying,
oh,

533
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:02.470
he's got to be on something.
It's got to be on something.
Like,
look at them.

534
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.010
It's gotta be on something.
I just think anybody that does what

535
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.480
<v 1>well they're going to say that,
you know.
And then like who say it is the fan.</v>

536
00:30:08.481 --> 00:30:11.690
Some,
the Bella tour posted a picture of me after I knocked out.

537
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.230
I'm Melvin and a picture when I was 17 years old

538
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:19.290
<v 0>training and all the comments were like ped suddenly since I was 17.</v>

539
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.770
I rarely kept believe he looks different than when he was 17.
Yeah,
that's weird.

540
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.450
Dude.
Said,
you mean you got older and you look different?
Yeah.
It's crazy.

541
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.720
Strange as fuck.
Hmm.
Dosign Jill's looks exactly the same too.

542
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:33.510
That's why it's so stupid that I was accusing him.

543
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.180
It doesn't mean he couldn't possibly have been on something.
But you know,

544
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:42.010
he's training with uh,
one of the disciples of um,
Marv Marinovich.

545
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.770
Do you know the modeling?
Yeah,

546
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.950
he's training with this guy nick curse on who's going to be on the podcast in a

547
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.500
couple of weeks.
I'm very excited to interview that guy.

548
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.920
And he's got some pretty radical training methods that he learned from Marvin

549
00:30:56.330 --> 00:31:00.430
Marinovich cause I heard them talk about him when Bj used it.
Right.
Yeah.

550
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.220
And this guy has the same sort of training methods.

551
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.910
I really can't wait to interview him and talk to him about these,

552
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:11.590
these methods butts.
Interesting.
Yeah,
because dos Santos was in insane shape.

553
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.150
I mean the,
the pace that he put on pedes and he didn't have any holes.

554
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:16.990
I mean there was nothing,

555
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:21.550
nothing by striking was on point is grappling was insane.
His Cardio is insane.

556
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.930
I mean he just covered all the bases,
dotted all his eyes,
checked all his t's.

557
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.620
It was a,
that was impressive as fuck.
I want to find out what this guy's doing.

558
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.880
Yeah.
Cause I'm too,

559
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.780
I always wonder like how much of of uh,

560
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.970
how much of a training camp and this is protected.
It's particularly important,

561
00:31:39.971 --> 00:31:40.840
I guess in MMA.

562
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.920
How much of a training camp should be dedicated to strength and conditioning and

563
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:46.960
how much should be dedicated to skill work?

564
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:53.180
<v 1>You know,
for me,
I,
for the last man standing,</v>

565
00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:57.760
I had a like a six months notice or something for the,
for the fight.
And uh,

566
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.250
my fight before that was with Wayne Barrett in New York and I just felt

567
00:32:01.251 --> 00:32:03.350
physically too small when I fought him by moving,

568
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.220
that was the first time in my career where the guy that I weighed in against and

569
00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:09.800
the guy got in the ring with were like two different people.
And uh,

570
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.600
they really bothered me mentally.

571
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.350
And like there were shots that he would hit me with that like didn't even land,

572
00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:17.900
but he like hit me in the forearm and he'd be like pushing me across the ring.

573
00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:21.410
And I really felt like too small and um,
you know,

574
00:32:21.411 --> 00:32:23.540
I hit the weights and I was doing the high calorie things or whatever.

575
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.910
And I did the weights for a long,
long period of time.
And then,
um,

576
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.220
my coach stopped me about six,
six weeks out from the fight and was like,

577
00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:35.080
you know,
more weights now you have to get your,
cause I was stiff and you know,

578
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.320
if you lift weights,
so you're sore all the time,
right?
Yeah.

579
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.360
You just saw her and you're,

580
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.210
every time you're muscle you're making it tighter and tighter and tighter.

581
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:45.230
And you know,
for speed,
for kickboxing,
especially in boxing,

582
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.260
it's about a technique and being loose and snap more so than like punching hard

583
00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:54.980
and economy of movement too.
Right.
You gotta be able to be loose and yeah,

584
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:56.790
it's up.
It's about getting that punch,

585
00:32:56.791 --> 00:33:00.440
the snap at the end and not trying to push through.
Right,
right,
right.
And,
uh,

586
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.760
you know,
I had a really good result with that,
with that camp.
Um,

587
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.180
and I felt like I was hitting harder,
obviously knocked out Simon,
you know,

588
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:11.360
so it was good.
Um,
but like now when I'm fighting so actively,

589
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:14.210
it's like I don't really have time to hit the weights and like bulk up or like

590
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:15.810
get that tight again.
You know?
So that's,

591
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.370
that's been an issue for me when you're fighting so consistently,
I'm sure that,

592
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:21.680
uh,
you know,
uh,

593
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.850
I'd be interested to see what Donald's Cerrone does when he's fighting so often,

594
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:28.220
you know,
if he has time,
because for me it was like,
okay,

595
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:31.170
get right back into camp.
You're right back where you are like the last,
you know,

596
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.660
five weeks or we're running all the time.

597
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:34.040
You're trying to get your speed and our agility,

598
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:35.720
but there's not a whole lot of strength training going on.

599
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.910
<v 2>Yeah.
I talked to Diego Sanchez about that and Diego,</v>

600
00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:42.490
the way he would prepare for a flash.
Yes.

601
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.390
He just pulled out a cross and just started fucking screaming.
Yes.

602
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.390
I didn't see that.
Somebody told me about that,
that they day and I'm like,

603
00:33:48.391 --> 00:33:51.580
what the fuck this up?
You got to see it as like,
God,
I just saw that

604
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.290
he was telling me about it.
I didn't believe him.
And then I youtube.

605
00:33:56.291 --> 00:34:00.060
Then I was like,
Holy Shit,
that's some,
there's not a mother fucker alive.

606
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.700
He believes in himself more than Diego Sanchez.

607
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.860
I mean you might believe in yourself as much,

608
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.330
but you are at 100% we were at 100% belief that mother fucker,

609
00:34:09.331 --> 00:34:13.650
believe me,
I hit him when he was like walking out yelling yes or wherever,

610
00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:17.100
but I hadn't seen where he like pulled out the cross and was like fighting

611
00:34:17.101 --> 00:34:19.830
demons on the way to the ring.
That was fucking crazy.

612
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.590
The greatest moment for what that is.
Something smells.

613
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:28.650
So it's a lot of things.
No,
this is,
this is just a yes one.
This is great.

614
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.700
So he's like,
Diego's an interesting cat.
He's,
he's like,

615
00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:34.560
he's very big on yoga.

616
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.430
He's very big on sensory deprivation tanks.

617
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.570
Like we talked in depth about sensory deprivation.
Fine.
He's got,

618
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:46.470
maybe it's the craziest one is it's a craziest Diego Sanchez Sanchez.

619
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.470
That's very subjective though.
All of his walk ins are crazy.
He,

620
00:34:52.471 --> 00:34:54.340
uh,
no.
You know,

621
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:59.450
he's got a hook or some shit and he's like fucking fighting demons on the way

622
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.920
that it looks like some sort of a monk.

623
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.120
He's a big,

624
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.890
he's a big fan of optimizing everything he's got,

625
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.540
including his mental state.

626
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.800
Like he's really into like positive affirmations and positive thinking.
Yeah,

627
00:35:16.801 --> 00:35:21.720
here it is.
Yeah.
This one.
Yeah.
So as he walks out,

628
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.910
like as he starts walking out towards the side,

629
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.560
pretty sure this got set up for it.
I'm like,

630
00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:28.940
he's like hiding it or something and then Bam.
Yeah.
There it is.
Here's a fucking

631
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.360
look at this.
Oh,
see I don't,

632
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.010
I calling this

633
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.320
<v 0>fight.
I don't believe,
I believe I was watching it at home,</v>

634
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:44.650
so I got a chance to laugh.
I could laugh really hard yet.

635
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.840
So that's something right there.
That's if I had to see if I seen this.

636
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.060
Yeah,
it's Kenny Florian talking.
If I was there alive,

637
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.910
I most certainly would have started laughing.
Yeah.

638
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.520
But what I was going to say is that Diego,

639
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:04.260
what he does before camps is he would do only strength and conditioning.

640
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:07.890
No fitness,
no a striking training,
no grappling training,
no nothing.

641
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:12.870
Everything he would do leading up to his camp would be like weightlifting,

642
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.230
running like all physical physical shit.

643
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:19.440
Just get his body to the peak of condition.

644
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.620
Then he would start to taper off of that and then go into his skill set

645
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:25.380
training.
Right.

646
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.680
So they would do it like when he would actually do it six weeks for camp,

647
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.400
his six or it could be all wrestling,
all striking,
all Jujitsu.

648
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.110
That's ideally what I would do.

649
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.980
Except now it's like I only have six weeks between if I said I don't really have

650
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:42.660
time to do that right now.
He brought in Steve Maxwell for is Bj Penn fight.

651
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.840
And you know it was interesting because Steve said it was,

652
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.640
would almost be better if I didn't train him because Steve was like,

653
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.930
cause if I didn't train him he wouldn't be in as good a shape and they would

654
00:36:53.931 --> 00:36:57.780
have been like a quicker fight.
Like he was.
So he was out class in that fight.

655
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:01.410
Like Bj was just lighting them up and because he was in such good shape,

656
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:03.750
he was able to take a tremendous amount of punishment.

657
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.130
I mean Bj dropped him just a couple minutes or so into the first round and then

658
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:11.730
just battered him for the rest of the fight until he eventually cut them with

659
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:12.960
that head kick and stopped him.

660
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.400
It's interesting too because I've heard and I kind of believe it is that your

661
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.890
Chin is improved with your,
the better shape here.

662
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.030
You heard that before like I would imagine,
I wonder why that is the,
well,

663
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:28.020
I think that when you're tired you're weak.
You know?
I mean,
um,

664
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.190
I remember I had a,
I find a kickboxing tournament.

665
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:36.780
It was a in Rhode Island above the waist,
kickboxing,
the old school days.

666
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.580
I want to use spinning heel kick knockouts.
Yeah.
Until I got,
it was pretty cool.

667
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.220
That was the taekwondo tournament.
But in a kickboxing tournament,

668
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:48.900
I fought three times in one night.
And um,
I won the first fight by knockout,
uh,

669
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.440
beat the shit out of the second guy and then have a long wait like,

670
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.500
like an hour plus four,
the third fight.

671
00:37:55.501 --> 00:37:59.470
And I was exhausted and I wasn't in the best of shape,
wasn't,
you know,

672
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.640
wasn't that smart back then,
wasn't eating very good and uh,

673
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.680
I was really tired after the first round,

674
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:07.260
this fight and this guy hit me with a punch.
That really wasn't that.

675
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.380
It wasn't that big of a punch.
Like I remember seeing it on video,

676
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.670
hit me with a left hook and my legs just went,
take care.
We'll see you later.

677
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.410
They just stopped working and like,

678
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.720
I'm like any other time I'd be able to take that punch.

679
00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:19.770
Like it doesn't make any sense.

680
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:23.120
It wasn't like sometimes you see a punch and you see your head snapped back and

681
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.790
go,
God damn,
you got cracked.
But this wasn't that.

682
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.600
It was just my body just was exhausted and if I was in better shape,

683
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.490
I know I would been able to take that better.

684
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:37.240
And you see guys that are in really good shape and it's very rare that they

685
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:40.300
can't recover from a couple hard shots.
Whereas it's at,

686
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:45.310
seems like everything is based on your vitality and if you are body is in really

687
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:48.640
good condition,
you can bounce back from things quicker.

688
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.560
Like Frankie Edgar's another perfect example.

689
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:54.370
I think a lot of it you have to chalk off to heart and will and determination.

690
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.390
You know like some guys like Frankie just has is fucking incredible.
We'll like,

691
00:38:58.391 --> 00:38:59.380
you can't,
like,

692
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:02.500
he was like a dude who was a little dude who people have been fucking with him

693
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:06.660
since he's been,
he's a little guy.
He ain't having it.
You know,
he's kind of,

694
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.880
he's going to fucking kick your ass.
It doesn't matter how hard you hit him.

695
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.270
He's eventually gonna.
If,
if all fights went to a hundred rounds,

696
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.130
Frankie Edgar would never lose.

697
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.860
He would just keep going and keep going and keep going.

698
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:20.350
Eventually you get tired and he would beat your ass.

699
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.250
But I think one of the ways that he could absorb the kind of punishment that he

700
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:28.720
could absorb like against gray Maynard.
Remember those fights fucking insane.

701
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.070
Too Insane.
First rounds or gray had him out in both fights.

702
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.520
Great.
Cracked him.
I mean he's wobbling.
A lot of,

703
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.230
lot of referees would have stopped the fight.

704
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.160
He's going down to three times in the first round just getting wobbled.

705
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:46.510
Blood face swelling.
Second round he comes out and he winds around,

706
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:49.840
you know,
how's he doing?
It was just,
it was just insane shape.

707
00:39:49.841 --> 00:39:54.190
His cardio is just so fucking good.
He can take it.
He bounces back from it.

708
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:57.940
He recovers quickly and then his cardio is so good that in the second round he's

709
00:39:57.941 --> 00:39:58.774
back again.

710
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.800
Well then it's like the guys that lose their chin or they're just not in good

711
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:06.690
shape anymore or is it punishing an issue?
I think it's,
you know,

712
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.290
that's where we've all seen it.

713
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.920
Guys in the jail that have a certain amount of certain amount of times you could

714
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:15.670
punch that card until it's like it's over.

715
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.170
It's just doesn't work anymore.
Chucked described it to me once and he said,

716
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:22.540
the way it was described to him,
uh,

717
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.020
is that the doctor was telling him that at a certain point in time,

718
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:29.140
your brain recognizes that you're too tough for your own good.

719
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.950
So your brain knows when he gets tagged,
Oh,

720
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.760
this fucking dude is just going to start at absorbing punches again and we're

721
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:39.910
going to have to deal with all this damage.
Let's just shut off.
Right.

722
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.870
That makes sense.
That makes a lot of sense.
But last time this happened,

723
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.810
we just took a little nap and everything was fine.
Let's just do that again.

724
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.940
Let's just take a little nap.
I was like,
fuck this guy,
this asshole.

725
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.000
Once it's to go eat post doing this shit again.
Fuck your leg.

726
00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.880
You got to wonder like,
what is that?
When that time is,
you know,
like when,

727
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.490
when do you,
uh,
when do you,

728
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.880
when do you know was most fighters have think like,
you know what,

729
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.100
if I just have one more camp on a,

730
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.170
maybe I'll do eight weeks instead of six weeks.
It may be,

731
00:41:12.171 --> 00:41:16.120
I'll clean my diet up and maybe I'll bring in a guy to work with me,

732
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:18.280
maybe on my defense a little bit more.

733
00:41:18.281 --> 00:41:21.430
And maybe my strength and conditioning could be better than improve everything.

734
00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:24.970
And I made it,
you got to know him in the camp though.
I mean,

735
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.940
if you're getting knocked out and sparring regularly,
you know,

736
00:41:28.941 --> 00:41:31.410
if that's happening,
it has never happened with me in sparring and be like,

737
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.070
if that's,
if that's a thing happens in the gym,
like

738
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.080
<v 1>how much confidence can you really have when you're walking into the rank?</v>

739
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:38.450
Like two weeks ago he got knocked out.
She don't tell anybody.

740
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:41.970
<v 0>Yeah.
So that's a regular occurrence,</v>

741
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.210
regular occurrence and MMA.
A foreign script.

742
00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.860
And when you fought her inner says he got knocked out apparently twice.
Yeah.

743
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:54.750
And you've seen the Marvin Eastman Travis Luder fight.
Yeah.
Um,

744
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.160
that was when Marvin got hit with this very strange punch.
It was like,

745
00:41:59.161 --> 00:42:00.330
it was a decent punch,

746
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.930
but it was like at the very end of the punch and he just went out like he got

747
00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:07.260
shot and I remember thinking,
wow,
that's kind of crazy.

748
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.980
Then we found that afterwards he got knocked out twice in camp,

749
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.030
like really recent,

750
00:42:12.031 --> 00:42:16.500
like Tito and knocked him out with a knee and then someone had knocked him out,

751
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.620
uh,
got knocked out with like a take down attempt or something like that.

752
00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:24.570
Like it was like two,
two in a row.
So like one didn't really recover from that.

753
00:42:24.571 --> 00:42:26.250
Went back and got another one.

754
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.310
<v 1>See that's the other thing.
It's like,
if are these,
is the,</v>

755
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.880
is there just a number or is it like this guy got knocked out and I didn't do

756
00:42:33.881 --> 00:42:36.940
the right things.
Didn't do the hyperbaric chamber.
You just didn't take time off.

757
00:42:36.941 --> 00:42:40.180
You know what I mean?
Do you do that hyperbaric chamber?
Uh,
I used,

758
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.120
I've done it before and I did.
Uh,
I do like the,

759
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.420
the altitude tents at my house sleeping that,
yeah.

760
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.730
Do you get your lady to sleep in there with you?
Yeah.
She's not a big fan.

761
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.820
She asleep state.
It's like a giant tent.
And the uh,
the uh,
you know,

762
00:42:56.821 --> 00:43:00.820
our nightstands a bed and everything fits in there and she just can't stand like

763
00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:04.090
the smell of it cause it smells like you're sleeping in a tent.
All,
yeah.

764
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.800
I remember Bj Penn and one of the countdown shows,

765
00:43:08.801 --> 00:43:11.530
it goes when you're going to sleep in a big plastic tent,

766
00:43:11.531 --> 00:43:16.050
you know someone's going to get their ass kicked.
Yeah.

767
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.750
It's kind of fucked up.
Right.
Like sleeping in a big plastic tent just to,

768
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.460
but that's the only way

769
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.470
<v 0>to mimic it.
They said that's actually the best way.</v>

770
00:43:23.471 --> 00:43:27.640
That's actually even better then training at altitude because training at

771
00:43:27.641 --> 00:43:29.620
altitude kind of limits your workload.
Right.

772
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.960
Whereas you really want the recovery.

773
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.410
<v 1>There's this place in Costa Mesa that would,</v>

774
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.920
we used to go to before I got this hat and I probably will start going back to

775
00:43:37.921 --> 00:43:39.390
it cause it was really good.
It was in,

776
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.800
it's called a a sent and the product is called [inaudible] and it's this

777
00:43:43.801 --> 00:43:48.480
altitude chamber that um,
it looks like a jet plane cockpit.
Uh,

778
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.400
Ian uses it a lot of time.
Ian Mccall,

779
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.980
it was designed by the guy that invented the MRI machine and it's actually the

780
00:43:56.041 --> 00:44:00.630
purpose behind it was to like cure diabetes or treat diabetes with circulation

781
00:44:00.631 --> 00:44:04.640
problems or something,
but they can't,
they're in the process of getting it,
uh,

782
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.110
licensed or whatever to where they could was approved by the FDA or whatever

783
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.970
disease.
Huh?
Yeah.
Something about,
and they get people that have like,
you know,

784
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.590
people who have diabetes,
their feet turn purple because they're fucking bloods,

785
00:44:16.591 --> 00:44:17.041
floods,

786
00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:21.120
blood flows all fucked up that put people in this machine and they'll like,

787
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.670
after a couple of treatments,
like their feet get regular color again,

788
00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.400
but the way it works is it,
it's uh,

789
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:31.670
it takes you to weigh higher altitude and like my at home goes to like thousand

790
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.010
feet.
This would go all the way to like 33,000 feet or some shit like Everest,

791
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:39.570
Everest.
And it goes up and down.
So like in a 20 minute session it goes,

792
00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.410
you know,
based on what program it is,
like maybe Everest,
the back down to zero,

793
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:46.350
like a hundred times and 20 minutes like the while you're in there,

794
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:47.460
it's constantly dropping.

795
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:50.490
The pressure's filling up and dropping cause he's the guy who found that your

796
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:54.330
body goes through more of a metabolic change during the,

797
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:58.050
the change of altitude as opposed to like what did we've known as you go and you

798
00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:01.590
stay there for eight hours or however long and then he'd come back down to
train.

799
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.080
So this is constantly going up and down,
up and down,

800
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:06.360
up and down and your body's like,
what the fuck?
What the fuck?

801
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:09.240
And that's supposed to create more red blood cells are particularly really,

802
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.640
can you get one of those for a gym?
You can,
they have,

803
00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.370
I think there's like 15 in the u s um,
crazy expensive,
I'm sure.

804
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.720
Sure.
Yeah,
I think you could,
you could definitely do that.
You could hit up.
Ah,

805
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.960
there it goes to Mesa.
Yeah.
Demo and say,
is there a demo for this?

806
00:45:24.961 --> 00:45:27.630
They have a video,
Jamie,
probably that looks,

807
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:30.120
are you going to launch into the fucking universe in that thing?

808
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.320
A lot of a lot of fighters use it.
A lot of triathletes are using it on there.
Uh,

809
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.820
it's,
it's really good stuff.

810
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.600
I just stopped doing it because it was so with my schedule and training here and

811
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:40.351
there and everywhere else.

812
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:42.510
Driving all the way to Costa Mesa and back everyday was tough,

813
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:45.970
but if you had one in the yard though,
probably jumping that pitch out every day.

814
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.180
I'd sleep in that thing.
Cranked this up.
Jimmy,
let me hear this.

815
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:49.200
I want to be what they have to say.

816
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.600
<v 3>Hi.
Creating lower pressure and thinner air.</v>

817
00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:55.390
Just like you get on a day of skiing up in Aspen.

818
00:45:56.030 --> 00:46:01.030
<v 4>Athletes get an increase in vo two Max or our field of vision.</v>

819
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.880
Quicker reaction.
Endurance.
How

820
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:09.590
<v 3>the seat back people say the body's response is to increase its blood volume,</v>

821
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:13.280
but that they still haven't studied the effects enough to save for sure.

822
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:16.970
I decided to get into the thing and try out a typical session,

823
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.430
not going to get injured in this

824
00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.660
<v 1>pussy.
Get in there like your ears will pop,
like shed,
like really fucking hard.</v>

825
00:46:23.661 --> 00:46:26.660
It's like you have to get,
it takes like four or five sessions to get used to it.

826
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.810
Wow.
But uh,
yeah,
my coach would notice a big difference.

827
00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:32.430
And like the biggest difference that I noticed from that,
from using now,

828
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.340
sutent was like the fog.
Oh flick sparring or being in a fight,

829
00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:39.410
like all of the,
everything kind of slowed down.

830
00:46:39.411 --> 00:46:40.820
Like it just seemed like more focused.

831
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:42.950
I'd find myself like checking out the guy's tattoos

832
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.520
and like my coach would notice a big difference,

833
00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:48.960
like two sessions in there and he be like,
you've been using that machine on?

834
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:52.340
And like,
yeah.
Really?
Wow.
Cause I mean,
as a smoker,
Joe,

835
00:46:52.341 --> 00:46:55.880
I gotta take care of every,
you know,
I got to do everything I can.
So that was,

836
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.910
that was a regular part of like six or seven of my fights.

837
00:46:58.911 --> 00:47:02.600
I was going down there.
No shit man,
you got to get back in there dude.
Yeah,

838
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.870
I really do.
Got To fall.
We'll get his,
his ears are popping body.
Yes.

839
00:47:05.871 --> 00:47:08.950
So you're constantly and they're just popping her as popping as pop Norris.
Oh,

840
00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.960
this is fucking cool.
Fucking cap.

841
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.080
It'll crush the shooting off

842
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:20.280
the water bottle.
Just like,
like a gorilla smushed it.
Yeah,

843
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:25.010
<v 3>baby.
Use The pod and believe it helps.
Some university research has been,</v>

844
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:29.040
<v 1>I literally loved about it is there was only like 12 I think in the u s like I</v>

845
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.100
knew when I was in there that

846
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.400
<v 0>my opponent wasn't,
wasn't using that shit.
Right.
I mean like,
yeah,
this is,</v>

847
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:38.650
that's what people feel like you can do steroids
essentially.

848
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:41.700
Yeah.
Did we talk about the Cryo chamber last time you were there?
You,

849
00:47:41.701 --> 00:47:44.500
you referred me.
I went down to it.
When did you was cool.
It was real cool.

850
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.160
Does it come out here now?
Oh,

851
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.000
there's one right down the street I could live in and that shit.

852
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.880
How many times today have you been in the I haven't been,
yeah,
just opened.

853
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.270
It hasn't even had like a hard opening yet.
They just done a soft opening.

854
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.180
Same company though.
Cryo healthcare is that,
that's where he went wrong.
Yeah.

855
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.420
That's amazing,
isn't it?
It was really cool.
It was really cool.
Cold as fuck.

856
00:48:01.421 --> 00:48:03.940
But when you get out,
don't you feel like you could jump over the moon yet?

857
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:07.690
It was like fucking,
I try to describe it in text and I was like,
I didn't,

858
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:08.740
so I'm fucking write it.
I'll be like,

859
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:11.260
when you're in there and I would like take a deep breath.

860
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.260
It's almost like a head rush,
like fucking cold air going in.
It was,

861
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:17.260
it was almost like a whippet.
It was cool.
The whole thing.
It was fucking cool.

862
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.650
It was cool at night.
Next on my list.
I want to try one of those,
uh,

863
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.420
the float labs.
Tell me when you tell me when you can use mine at my house.
Yeah,

864
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:28.480
come on over dude.
You tell me when.
All right.
Whenever,
whenever you're free,

865
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.410
we'll listen.
Let's,
let's set up a date soon and,
uh,
come on over the house.

866
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:35.920
You could have dinner and uh,
I'll leave you down there for a few hours.
Cool.

867
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:39.540
And come on up and you'll,
you'll freak out.
That's awesome.
What,
what did,
I mean,

868
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.860
my buddy told me about it and it's like a hallucinogenic kind of thing or,
well,

869
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.550
sorta not.
I've heard people like using it for training.
So yeah.

870
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:49.110
What's great for training,
you know,
it's great for problem solving too.
Uh,

871
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.540
I use it for like,
if I have a joke that I'm working on,
it's not working well,

872
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.940
I'll go in there and I'll sort it out.
I'm like,
Oh fuck.

873
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:56.230
It's gotta be an angle for this joke.

874
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.730
Like I could sit down and look at a keyboard and maybe think about it,

875
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:04.810
but I feel like my mind has more resources when I'm in the tank.

876
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:10.030
And the reason being is that the idea of the sensory deprivation tank was

877
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:14.230
created by this guy named John Lilly.
John Lilly was just really nutty dude.

878
00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:16.180
He was a psychedelic pioneer,
uh,

879
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:21.760
esteemed professor and intellectual.
It was a pioneer interspecies communication,

880
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:23.950
did a lot of research with dolphin communication,

881
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.870
did a lot of drugs and a lot of LSD,
lot of ketamine.

882
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:33.700
And one of his things was he was trying to figure out how to separate the mind

883
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.930
from the influence of the body.
He was thinking that there's like,

884
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.030
oh my neck hurts.
Like,
oh,
I got to Fart.
You know,

885
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:42.460
like all these different things that are going on in your body that are

886
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:46.420
distracting the mind.
How could I get away from that?

887
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:50.380
And he came up with a bunch of different solutions.
One of them was,

888
00:49:50.381 --> 00:49:54.370
you've seen that movie altered states ever seen him?
It's really stupid,
man.

889
00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:57.160
It was great in the 80s when I saw it when I was a kid,
I was like,

890
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.740
this movie's Great.
And it's one of the movies you watch again when you're 40.

891
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:04.400
Go without spooking.
So many movies don't hold up.
Yeah,

892
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:08.470
that's weird though.
It's one of them.
It does not hold up.
But,
um,

893
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.090
it was based on John Lilly.
That's how all the van Damme movies where,
Oh yeah,

894
00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.060
I would like kickbox here where like changed my life,
you know,

895
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.460
and it's solid a couple of months ago and I was like,
what

896
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.040
have you seen that little kid before we get into the sensory deprivation tank?

897
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:26.430
Have you seen that little kid doing the Bruce Lee Nimchuk scene?
Yeah,

898
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.370
I saw that shit.
Fucking amazing.

899
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:32.090
<v 2>Four years old.
Watch this.
Look at this little kid.</v>

900
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.680
He's wearing a Bruce Lee outfit from the game of death and he's gotten nunchucks

901
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:40.820
just like Bruce Lee's and he was,

902
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.900
he's doing it in sync to Bruce Lee behind him.
Like

903
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.590
he's doing the total noon,
chuck move skillful as fuck.

904
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:56.591
He's five years old and he's doing everything exactly the way Bruce is doing it

905
00:50:57.501 --> 00:51:01.670
on the screen behind them.
So cool.
So cool.

906
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.150
Amazing.
It's so good.
Like first of all,

907
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:11.780
this kid definitely can't read yet,
right?
These five,

908
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.160
it probably hasn't even been to school yet.
Maybe a little bit of kindergarten,

909
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.053
you know,

910
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.470
pre k maybe she's got no information in his head other than this Bruce Lee
scene.

911
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:24.860
That's the key.
That's the key and like,
you know,

912
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:29.450
and then by the time kids 12 they'll be 500 people in his life to tell them to

913
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:31.370
be realistic and like shoot him down.

914
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.860
Every imaginative thing that he has in his fucking head.

915
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.790
When I look at my kids just,
I love this.

916
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:40.880
This makes me really happy when I see that.
Yeah,
me too man.

917
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.430
Dana white posted this video the other day of a little girl hitting the mitts.

918
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:51.610
Find that video on Dana White's Instagram.
It's this little girl,

919
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.660
she looks like she's maybe like six or seven years old and she's hitting the

920
00:51:55.661 --> 00:51:59.410
meds and fucking technique is on point.

921
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.640
She's blocking and roll in and you know,
no kicks.
Just punches.

922
00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:07.600
But like God damn that tap out commercial came out a couple of years ago when

923
00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:10.780
they had those two kids.
Two little [inaudible].
I'm doing all that shit too.

924
00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:15.340
This is the future.
And still,
here's the video.
Watch this.
I saw this.
Yeah.
Dope.

925
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.650
I mean,
come on man.
This is fucking bad at.
Look at the technique.

926
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:28.260
Look at our footwork,
the movie.
Look at the fucking ducking.
Come on man,

927
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:32.040
every time she's throwing these punches or hands are in the right position.

928
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.290
I'm so impressed with this.
That's impressive.
Pr,

929
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.440
you know that girls can grow up to be a psycho.
You don't want to date her,

930
00:52:40.441 --> 00:52:41.660
but I know they'll do it.
That one

931
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:48.880
somehow has to be some level of where the fight sit stop and you're like,
okay,

932
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:52.270
you know,
I don't want the girl to be able to like take it to the next level.

933
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:55.630
You're arguing and then starts beating your ass.
Like it's not cool.
Yeah.

934
00:52:55.631 --> 00:52:58.720
Like if you date and Ronda rousing,
she mounts you go listen bitch,

935
00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:03.600
you got to get off.
May Lead my arm alone.
Um,

936
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.490
so the sensory deprivation tank,
the get back to that,

937
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.710
the way he first did it was like a scuba helmet.

938
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.480
He came up with a way to hook up a scuba helmet with like these underarm

939
00:53:13.481 --> 00:53:15.070
harnesses so that you kind of,

940
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.370
you're suspended by the air and the scuba helmet and you know,

941
00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:21.940
kind of like floats your body.
And then eventually you forget about the school,

942
00:53:21.941 --> 00:53:26.100
but helmet and then somewhere along the lines he realized if you just

943
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.910
<v 0>had water that was filled with salt,
that you would just float in it.</v>

944
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:30.571
Sort of like the dead.

945
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:33.380
Say you ever see those videos of the people that go to the Dead Sea?
No,

946
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:36.780
I'd heard about this.
I hope he didn't explain to me cause she float on the salt.

947
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:40.260
So it's packed full of salt.
But at the salt lake is buoyant.

948
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.940
That salt is as long as you continue to cycle the water,
the water,

949
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.810
my pump goes on every morning,
it's on a timer.

950
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.550
So I get five o'clock in the morning.

951
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.960
Like sometimes I'm up real early and I'll hear blue coming down from the

952
00:53:54.961 --> 00:53:58.140
basement and that's the pump kicking on automatically.
And the,

953
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.200
the water cycles through this series of filters is huge.

954
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.460
Spa filters with like the way that guy crash down at the float lab,

955
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:13.440
uh,
in Venice is a mad genius.
This guy has done.

956
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.480
Like when he first came around,

957
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:20.610
I found out about him through a guy who used to repair tanks for this company

958
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:21.450
called Samadhi.

959
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:25.230
Samadhi is the first company that I bought a tank farm and they were actually in

960
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:27.930
business with Lily Lily's first tank.

961
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.050
But one of his first tasks was a Samadhi and um,

962
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.840
he kind of taught them how to put it together and manufacture it.

963
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.160
And then this guy crash,

964
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:40.590
he's just crazy and he's just very technically oriented and he just took it to a

965
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:41.490
totally new level.

966
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:46.230
He uses ozone to filter out the water and he has oxygen pumped into the chamber.

967
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:51.240
He made the chamber walls real thick and insulated so it retains heat,
no sound.

968
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:54.270
It keeps the heat stable and they're much tall.
His,

969
00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:59.130
his tanks are seven feet tall and six feet wide and nine feet long.

970
00:54:59.131 --> 00:55:00.450
I mean he's,
he's a master.

971
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:05.340
The guy just figured it out and so this a pump kicks on and it goes through all

972
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:08.610
the water cycles,
all the water.
So the water doesn't crystallize.

973
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.790
Cause if you let it sit,
the salt will eventually crystallize.

974
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.520
And then I've done that before accidentally.
The power,
uh,

975
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.290
kicked off and I didn't know about it like a,

976
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.530
a circuit blue and I had these rocks,

977
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:23.670
these giant like crystals in the,
in the uh,
water.

978
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:24.660
Just because the salt,

979
00:55:24.661 --> 00:55:27.780
it's sort of congealed cause there was no heat in it any more to keep it,

980
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:28.973
keep it warm.

981
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:33.420
But as long as the water keeps cycling and as long as the water stays at a high

982
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:36.990
temperature,
which is around,
you want to keep it,
mine's at 94 degrees,

983
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:40.200
which is about the same as the cell surface of your skin.
Oh,
okay.

984
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.720
So then when you lie in it,

985
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.080
you don't feel the water really because the water's the same temperature as your

986
00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:49.620
skin.
That's the goal.
If it's too hot,
you'll start to sweat.
It was too cold,

987
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:52.890
you'll feel cold.
But if you get a chest and that goldilocks zone,

988
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.240
then once you relax,
you don't feel the water and half of your body.
Like,

989
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:01.620
like say like if you cut a person half from the top of their head,

990
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.700
like sideways,
like everything above your nipples is like,

991
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.480
that's what it looks like right there.
Perfect example.
Huh?
So,
uh,

992
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:10.930
in this image that we're looking at right here,

993
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.320
this guy's floating in the water and uh,
it's just because the salt,

994
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.580
there's a mine has minds a little bit bigger than this tanks and mine is a

995
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.070
thousand pounds of salt in it.
It's all Epsom salts too,

996
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.080
which is really good for your body.
Like when I'm real sore,

997
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:31.030
I take Epsom salt baths the great for you it's something about the amount of

998
00:56:31.031 --> 00:56:34.100
salt in your body or magnesium.
Yeah,
because we use it to,

999
00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.810
to cut weight sometimes the last couple of ounces or pounds,
he can't get a,

1000
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.240
also if you drink it in water,

1001
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:45.250
you will shoot diarrhea out of your ass hole in a way that you've probably never

1002
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:46.480
experienced in your life.

1003
00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.410
It's like a way of a top 10 list of things that need to do,
but that,

1004
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.200
well,
people do it shoot diarrhea your ass like nobody's business.

1005
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:59.890
It's like a a way to do an enema.
Yeah,
it's,
yeah.
Yeah.
You can,

1006
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:02.350
you drink a little bit of,
I mean it's not much.

1007
00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:06.470
He'd like a couple of tablespoons in a glass of water and you just,
you go,

1008
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
oh,
he just run to the bathroom.

1009
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:13.330
There's something about that salt just gets in there and scrubs the inside of

1010
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:17.890
your colon and anything that's stuck that's gotta be pretty healthy actually.

1011
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:22.780
Maybe,
maybe not.
Could be not good at all.
Have you done a colonic?

1012
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:27.820
Yeah,
I haven't either.
I don't know about that.
I hear mixed things.

1013
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:30.690
I hear it's,
I'm sure people on Twitter with,

1014
00:57:30.691 --> 00:57:34.020
tell me now about how great it is or how awful it is.
Somebody,

1015
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:34.631
there's another thing.

1016
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:38.480
Somebody did that for the ultimate fighter to cut weight on one of the episodes.

1017
00:57:38.481 --> 00:57:42.280
That was game Ruger.
Yeah.
He probably wanted something up his ass.

1018
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:47.980
I'm just kidding,
Gabe.
It's,
it's supposed to be good for you and I in some ways.

1019
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.010
No,
he's not.
Before we get on the show,
before we started,

1020
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:54.190
Joe Rogan was talking about you gave,
he said you were in the shit like that.

1021
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:57.370
I'm just putting it out there.
I didn't say that.
Making shit up.

1022
00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.520
If you gave her any things in your ass.
Some dudes are straight as fuck.

1023
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:04.300
They just like things in their ass.
That's up to you folks.
It's all on you.

1024
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:08.290
It's okay.
No judgment.
Um,
but the Kalanick thing,

1025
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:09.820
I have a friend who did it and he said,
dude,

1026
00:58:09.821 --> 00:58:12.550
he's like the fucking pianos were coming out of my ass.
He goes,

1027
00:58:12.551 --> 00:58:15.220
I was finding things that I ate when I was a kid.
I was like,
he was,

1028
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.270
he said there was a pipe that was coming out like,
you know,

1029
00:58:18.271 --> 00:58:22.000
it's attached and you could see all the things that were coming out of your ass

1030
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.590
and the like,
the lady was pointing out his diet and she was like,
you know,

1031
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:27.180
oh you need more fiber.
And he's like,

1032
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:31.450
it was fucking tree trunks are coming out of his ass and bark and tennis balls.

1033
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.840
He said,
it's just ridiculous.
And you're looking through a two.

1034
00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.650
But this water with all the,
you know,
the particles.

1035
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:41.280
How much weight did he dropped his,
you know,
I don't think Gabe got,

1036
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.680
that's the thing about taking a shit.
Shit's don't weigh that much.
You know,

1037
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.520
pisses way heavier.
Like if you have to take a leak to gain weight.

1038
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:51.670
Like we learned that in wrestling.
Like a guy took a shit and he was like,
dude,

1039
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:55.960
I just took a mass for shit.
I bet he lost a pound
ounce.
Yeah.

1040
00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.000
Shit is not heavy for some strange reason,

1041
00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:00.310
but like if you're sick and you have diarrhea or whatever,

1042
00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.640
I end up like dehydrated like a mother fucker.
You're driving a lot of weight.

1043
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:08.650
That's dangerous.
Yeah.
That's one of the ways people die from dehydration.

1044
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:11.440
When the primary ways people die from dehydration is diarrhea.

1045
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:16.780
It's very dangerous.
Like certain diseases where where people just get wrap,

1046
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:21.070
massive diarrhea that winds up.
It's,
it's one of the causes of death.

1047
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:25.310
It's because your body just gets so dehydrated.
Your electrolytes drops so low.

1048
00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:29.660
Your heart function doesn't work properly.
It's a shitty conversation.

1049
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:30.920
Is it French shitting calm?

1050
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.780
He had a big smile on his face and he said that he was sending it up.

1051
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:40.670
So it's a float lab.
The float lab would,
the tank does is,
um,
first of all,

1052
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:44.060
it's real relaxing.
Like your muscles loosen up because you're floating.

1053
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.940
You like in that no gravity state like you saw in that picture.
Yeah.

1054
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:51.080
Everything is like a,
you know,
nothing's pulling on it.

1055
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:52.870
Like even here when we're sitting here,
you know,

1056
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:57.800
gravity's pulling down your spine and there everything seems to like lengthen up

1057
00:59:57.801 --> 01:00:02.690
and relax.
And when I get out of it,
I feel so loose.
I just feel just relaxed.

1058
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:07.680
And the magnesium,
the salt absorbs into your skin and it's Epsom salt.

1059
01:00:07.681 --> 01:00:11.690
So it's an excellent source of magnesium,
really healthy for your body,

1060
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:15.470
for muscle growth and development.
And when you're in there,

1061
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.980
you don't have any influence,
uh,
of your body.
Like you're not the,

1062
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.280
sometimes you get like an itch,

1063
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.000
but that's really just your body fucking with you because your body's like,
hey,

1064
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:29.750
there's nothing going on here.
I don't feel anything.
My nose itches.

1065
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.130
And you like wouldn't telling you is such a mind fuck yeah.
You know,

1066
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.530
you just started with don't scratch whatever you do.
But,

1067
01:00:36.531 --> 01:00:40.550
so the idea is that someone told me that it's simulates the same feeling as

1068
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:43.670
being in the womb or something.
Yeah,
I've heard that too.
I wonder,

1069
01:00:43.671 --> 01:00:46.970
but if your mother's yelling at your father and smoking cigarettes events

1070
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.380
different,
Huh?
I think that,
um,
what it,

1071
01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:55.040
what it does is it gives you a relaxation state that's unachievable without the

1072
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:58.910
tank because there's no news,
nothing touch.

1073
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.080
It's an environment that is completely alien to the earth.

1074
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:07.100
When you lie in that thing,
you literally don't see anything.

1075
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.290
You don't feel anything and you're floating,

1076
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.930
which means you feel like you're weightless.
You feel like you're flying.

1077
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.940
It gives you the feeling,
the impression of like,
of like moving through space.

1078
01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:19.340
Like you're flying through space.
It's real weird,
right?

1079
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:19.911
When you're going in there,

1080
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:23.810
do you feel like different or is there like a panic that happens or like,

1081
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:27.470
you know,
um,
you can,
some people get a little claustrophobic,

1082
01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:29.360
but you just gotta relax.
Nothing's going to happen.

1083
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:32.150
It's just like laying on the ground.
It's just the door.

1084
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.920
The door doesn't have a latch,
you just push.
It opens,
appeasing.
You know,

1085
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.490
I've done it so many times,
I don't have the panic feeling anymore,

1086
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.210
but there's a weirdness to it.
Definitely.
You climb in there and I,
you know,

1087
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:46.120
I always,
I squeegee it because a,

1088
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.670
there's always like a little bit of condensation on the roof,
uh,
the,
uh,

1089
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:53.360
inside the ceiling rather of the tank.
So I squeezed you that away.

1090
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:56.500
Otherwise it'll drip down your face while you're,
while you're in there,

1091
01:01:56.510 --> 01:02:00.230
which is annoying.
And then once,
uh,
once I've done squeezed unit,
I shut the door.

1092
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:04.190
I'm like,
can we go?
I just lay back and,
and flow.
Yeah.

1093
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.640
And you will definitely,
once you do it for a while,

1094
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.800
you will definitely have trippy experiences in there.

1095
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:14.180
He definitely have like some sort of strange psychedelic experiences that
happen,

1096
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:19.620
but also real good for sorting out things.
Like say if you,
man,

1097
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:21.990
I gotta get my shit together.
Let me go in there and think about my life.

1098
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.090
You'll go in there and you'll go,
you know,

1099
01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:28.530
I gotta stop doing this or I got to stop hanging around with this person or I

1100
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:32.430
got to do more of that,
or I'm slacking off in this area.

1101
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.950
Like it's almost like a seminar on your life.

1102
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.660
And if I have a like a Jujitsu moves,
it's great for Jujitsu moves.

1103
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:44.870
Like I'll drill Jujitsu moves in my mind and the way I'll do it is aligning the

1104
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.630
tank and I'll go over positions as if they're happening in real life.

1105
01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:50.850
Like I'll start off slow and like,

1106
01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:53.280
you know like if you were doing like flow drilling or something like that,

1107
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:55.590
like I'll start off like I'll like say for instance,

1108
01:02:55.591 --> 01:02:58.830
I'll do like a half guard sweep.
Like,
I'll start off in half guard,

1109
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:02.670
I'll scoot my hips this side,
a fight for the under hook,
I'll get the,

1110
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:06.930
I'll get the grip,
a pull guy in,
I'll trip the leg up,
I sweep,

1111
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.870
I get on top and then I'll,
I'll do it as if it was a drill,

1112
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:11.670
like if you're performing a drill,

1113
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:16.290
but I'll do it all completely in my head and I'll go over the motions first

1114
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:20.760
slowly and then I'll do it fast and then I'll go over it and then I'll do it.

1115
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.930
Like I'll,
I'll,
I'll recreate like the violence of it,

1116
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:26.910
like the explosion of it in my head.

1117
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:31.170
I'll recreate the resistance and then once I get like one drill down,

1118
01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:32.640
then I'll have counters to the drill.

1119
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.600
Like I'll go into it but I'll lose a position and now I have to,
you know,

1120
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:39.150
reestablish another position.
And when you do that,

1121
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:43.500
like that kind of mental training really shows up in,
in the,
in the gym.

1122
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.750
Like it really recreates in the gym.

1123
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.200
And I would imagine it'd be the same as striking out.

1124
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:50.520
Imagine it'd be the same with tennis,
with anything.
I think,

1125
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.940
I think they've shown that recreation and visualization is as much of a factor

1126
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.060
in the development and growth as actual training.
Yes.

1127
01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:04.860
<v 1>Oh absolutely.
Absolutely.
Do you do stuff like that?
Yeah,</v>

1128
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:07.590
I'm into that stuff.
I know you're working with Vinny shoreman there,
right?

1129
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.200
Vinnie is going to come on the podcast.
I've been talking to Ian about it.

1130
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:13.800
We're going to work this out.
Yeah.
He's coming to to uh,
and June.

1131
01:04:13.801 --> 01:04:16.710
He's going to be here for a couple of weeks doing like seminars and stuff.
So

1132
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.910
<v 0>yeah.
You were saying the last time you were here that he helped you,</v>

1133
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:23.480
like what do,
what do you guys do like and how often you,

1134
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:28.460
<v 1>we've done a lot of stuff and then now it's like,
it's,
it seems to be every,</v>

1135
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.100
every time I talked to him it's like a new thing that,
uh,
he comes up with it,

1136
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.950
it just,
he's helped me so much in my life.
It's not even,

1137
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.870
I don't even know if it's even about fighting anymore.

1138
01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:39.960
I was just stuff that he's,
uh,
you know,
he's done hypnosis on me.

1139
01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:42.870
He's got me to the point now where it's a,
we call it trance.

1140
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:44.190
It's not even hypnosis,
but like,

1141
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:47.290
he can start talking to me a certain way and I'm already in a different thing.

1142
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.450
When I get off the phone with them,

1143
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:52.450
my mind's just going insane based off the conversations we had.
It's real.

1144
01:04:52.451 --> 01:04:55.860
It's really weird.
It's,
it's amazing guy.
Really good guy.

1145
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:59.580
I can't wait to talk to him.
The mind is a motherfucker,
isn't it?
Yeah,

1146
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.570
it's really,
it really is that stuff you were just talking about right now.

1147
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:07.900
So it's really interesting to me.
Uh,
I've done that with,

1148
01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:11.340
with my fights,
you know,
like,
uh,
you know,
watching a fight,

1149
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.530
you know,
if I would explain it even like blocking leg kicks,
you know,
uh,

1150
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.700
when you can visualize it happening and your reaction to it,
you know,

1151
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:25.090
in your head without actually seeing it or that actually doing it,

1152
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.920
I think it make,

1153
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:31.030
it plays it out to be so real is a good example.
So,

1154
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.400
uh,
one thing we do is,
uh,

1155
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.880
I'll focus when I,
when I sign a fighter,
we get booked for a certain date.

1156
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.860
About four or five weeks out all the time.
When I wake up in the morning,

1157
01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:48.000
when I'm sitting on the toilet,
anytime I'm alone,
I'll,
I'll,
uh,

1158
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.290
think about 15 minutes after I won the fight.

1159
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:54.100
15 minutes after I'm thinking is high def as possible.

1160
01:05:54.101 --> 01:05:57.040
When the first time I'm doing it,
it's not very high death by the end it's like,

1161
01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:01.270
it's so real.
I could smell,
smell the room,
I can feel the chair I'm sitting in.

1162
01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:05.590
It can see the,
the my coaches faces.

1163
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:09.850
Who else is in there?
What uh,
what they're saying to me,
how I feel about myself.

1164
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:13.870
And the idea behind it is if,
if,
um,

1165
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:18.250
if you focus on 15 minutes after you've won and you do it over a period of time,

1166
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.310
it becomes so real in your head that it's like it already happened and if it's

1167
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:21.911
already happened,

1168
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.700
how could you possibly have anxiety about something that your mind thinks

1169
01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:27.160
already happened?
You know?
Does that make sense?

1170
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.600
Is there a possibility that you know,
that feeling that you get,
um,

1171
01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.050
I don't know if you've experienced this.

1172
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.790
Probably you probably have where you didn't get up for a fight because you

1173
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:42.160
thought that you're going to kick this guy's ass pretty easy,

1174
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:44.830
so you weren't nervous.
And then when you got in there,

1175
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:49.030
you felt like off like you did.
You weren't performing the way.

1176
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.110
Like you would be like,
say if you fought a guy like art Tim Lebbon who you know,

1177
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:56.740
top of the food chain,
you're,
you're going to be on your toes.
You know,

1178
01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:59.170
you're going to be ready.
Whereas you're going in there,
you're like,

1179
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:01.750
I'm going to kick this fucking guy's ass.
And mean you go in there and you like,

1180
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:06.670
it just seems like damn,
like this is not,
I'm not firing.
Right.
It's not,

1181
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.900
is that possible?
I mean,
deviation of anxiety cause like,

1182
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.940
I don't know about that.
I think that it could be,

1183
01:07:15.941 --> 01:07:19.330
I think that that what you're talking about is something that is ultimately

1184
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:23.980
helped me with a lot because my,
my problem is I,
one of my problems,

1185
01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.210
so many problems.

1186
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.250
One big problem is I always do poorly in that situation.
When I'm,

1187
01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.070
when I'm the favorite,
I have a hard time.
Um,

1188
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:38.410
it's not that I don't train hard for it,
it's just something about,
uh,
I always,

1189
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:41.500
I'm that guy that rises to the occasion of the three fights in one night where

1190
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:43.120
it's,
you know,
how the could you,
you know,

1191
01:07:43.121 --> 01:07:45.760
it's three rematches in two guys beat you.
And that's,

1192
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.430
that's when I do really well.
It's right.
No one expects you to win is when,

1193
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.550
when I really rise to the occasion when,
when,

1194
01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:55.240
when people start telling me that it's an easy fighter,
that it's,
you know,

1195
01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:56.380
I'm the favorite or whatever.

1196
01:07:56.381 --> 01:07:59.760
I just really try and shut that out and try and convince myself that,
you know,

1197
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.540
he's going to kill me and he's a really bad guy.

1198
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.610
I don't know if it's about not getting up for the fighter,
if it's,
uh,

1199
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:11.920
if it's,
uh,
you know,
you just take the guy lightly or what it is,

1200
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.780
but I've always had issues with that in the past.

1201
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.990
A lot of people have issues with that.
Taking a guy in

1202
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.030
<v 0>lightly is a huge problem and it's a real common in,</v>

1203
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:22.970
in you see it in a fight,
like maybe when a guy's the favorite.

1204
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:26.720
Like I'm not necessarily saying that this was the case in the cub,

1205
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:30.530
Swanson Max Holloway fight.
Did you see that fight?
Great fucking fight.

1206
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.740
Max Holloway,
man,
that motherfucker looked good in that fight.

1207
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:36.740
God Damn was a amazing performance by Holloway.

1208
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:40.940
But Cub Swanson was a big favorite lead leading into that fight and he just

1209
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:45.350
couldn't get off,
just did not seem like he get off.
And um,

1210
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:48.140
I think there's probably a few issues with the way he was training.

1211
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.740
He was doing a lot of um,
boxing specific training and even had a,

1212
01:08:52.741 --> 01:08:56.990
a famous boxing coach.
Um,
I forget his name.
Diaz in his corner.

1213
01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:02.000
Yep.
Uh,
no,
that's the guy from Miami.
Yeah,
no,

1214
01:09:02.001 --> 01:09:05.680
this was the guy that trains,
um,
uh,

1215
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.670
Tim Bradley.
He works with a lot of,
uh,
I forgot it doesn't matter.

1216
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.150
Point is the guy was giving him like boxing instruction in the corner.

1217
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:16.220
And I'm like,
he's dealing with a guy that's kicking him,

1218
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.940
throwing the elbows and flying knees and spinning back,
kicks his way.

1219
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:23.510
Like walk off.
You know,
like this is,
you got the wrong guy here man,
you need,

1220
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:28.511
you need a fucking Matt Hume type character that's telling you like MMA specific

1221
01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:30.350
shit to do.
I'm so,

1222
01:09:30.351 --> 01:09:34.280
there's probably some technical issues with the way he approached the fight but

1223
01:09:34.281 --> 01:09:39.000
also just didn't seem like if you saw him against like other fighters like,

1224
01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.620
like Jeremy Stevens who's a fucking murderer,
you know,
he's,
he's fighting,

1225
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.540
he's a murderer,
he's fighting another murderer.

1226
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:46.700
These two guys are dangerous as fuck.
You know,

1227
01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:50.270
he is a sharp as shit cause it's just deadly dangerous fight.

1228
01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:55.190
Whereas Max Holloway,
you know,
he had beaten some real good guys,

1229
01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:00.410
but he was thought to be like a notch below cup and comp just couldn't fucking

1230
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:02.570
put it together.
And you,
you know,
you got to say,

1231
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:06.440
well it was definitely a case of Holloway rising to the occasion,

1232
01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:08.930
fought better than they ever fought before.
You can't take nothing away from him,

1233
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:13.310
but when you look at cub,
just didn't look,
didn't look right,
just couldn't.

1234
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:17.210
And you've got to wonder how much of that is him coming into that fight as a

1235
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:20.150
prohibitive favorite.
Like I think it was like three,
four to one favorite.

1236
01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:24.780
<v 1>Well,
it's like one guy is,
you know,
this is,</v>

1237
01:10:24.781 --> 01:10:27.590
this is my big shot.
This is everything.
You know,
he's focused on it.

1238
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.030
Like hundred percent of the other guys that go,
this is another fight.

1239
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.940
It's still a serious fight.
I know it's,
I still got to take it seriously,

1240
01:10:32.941 --> 01:10:36.750
but the other guy is like going for greatness in your,
you know,
it's,

1241
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:41.730
it's a,
it's a weird balancing act,
you know,
so much of fighting is mental.
Um,

1242
01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.960
you can have a phenomenal camp and that lasts two hours before you walk out

1243
01:10:45.961 --> 01:10:49.950
there.
Couldn't come blow it all,
you know?
So that's why I work with Vinny and uh,

1244
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:54.540
you know,
we're,
we're always finding new things to work on and you know,

1245
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:56.640
I'm far from perfect,
but I feel like my game is,

1246
01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:58.190
has come a long way since I started work or work

1247
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.710
<v 0>with them.
Yeah,
I really think we discussed this.</v>

1248
01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:04.820
I really think that mental coach is going to be just as important as having a

1249
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:08.080
striking coach.
Just as important as having a grappling coach.
I mean,

1250
01:11:08.081 --> 01:11:09.860
you're going to have to have a mental coach.

1251
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.830
It's going to be just like you have guys have strength and guys,

1252
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.140
you know that they work with on a regular basis.

1253
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:18.510
You're going to have some sort of a mental coach that you work with on a regular

1254
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:21.510
basis.
I think it's,
it's going to be a really,
you know,

1255
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.250
it's going to be the next big thing or pretty soon.

1256
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.200
I think so till it doesn't though.
I hope I stick to just me.
No one else.
You.

1257
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:28.471
Well,

1258
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:33.000
I would wonder if someone could do it where they have a microphone that pumps

1259
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:34.790
into a tank where a,

1260
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:38.040
you lie in the sensory deprivation tank and it's miked up,

1261
01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:41.070
which should be very easy to do and as you're lying in there,

1262
01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:46.071
like crash has developed this system where he actually has a screen that's in

1263
01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:50.370
front of you as you lie down,
so as you're floating,

1264
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:55.371
this screen is floating above your head and it's so low in its light emissions

1265
01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.060
that you can't see the edge.
You don't see the border of the screen,

1266
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:02.580
you just see the images,
but because you're in a,

1267
01:12:02.581 --> 01:12:06.030
you're in an environment that has no light in it at all other than the screen.

1268
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:06.961
It's like this.

1269
01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:11.961
These images are floating in the sky in front of your face and in doing so he

1270
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:16.080
believes because you have no distractions,
like no physical distractions.

1271
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:18.690
You're not feeling the weight,
you're not feeling gravity,

1272
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:22.590
you're not feeling sensory input,
you're not judging space around you,

1273
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:24.150
you just getting the images.

1274
01:12:24.151 --> 01:12:27.930
You'll learn things quicker because your body will have no,

1275
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:32.310
no resources that it's demanding of the,
of the mind.
What's the,
what's the,

1276
01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:35.220
what's on the screen?
Different documentaries.

1277
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:39.330
Different instructionals like he's got one that they're working with.

1278
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:42.960
I think his idea is that like sports specific stuff like golf,

1279
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.480
like that you would absorb like information,

1280
01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:47.830
like how like the rotation of the hips and you know,

1281
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:53.000
especially doing things from a first person perspective on a and showing shows

1282
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.610
color lay in there and do like straight Djj stuff.
Yeah.
Like a week.

1283
01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:02.160
Work on your half guard.
The get ups.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1284
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:04.290
I want you to come down to 10th planet and uh,

1285
01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:07.350
and learn some shit from Eddie Bravo two with your long legs.

1286
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:10.050
I'd love like learning some,
uh,
some guard stuff.

1287
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.820
Even just learning how to hold on to guys in a way where they can't,

1288
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:18.360
they can't hit you and they're not going to be able to get up or you'll get

1289
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:23.340
standups better,
which is a legit strategy and Nma as long as they have standups.

1290
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.770
I don't know.
I don't agree with standups,
honestly.

1291
01:13:25.771 --> 01:13:28.630
Think they should be removed from fighting because I think that if you're going

1292
01:13:28.631 --> 01:13:32.370
to have MMA,
uh,
if you've got a guy that can hold you down for five minutes,

1293
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.710
that's,
that's,
that's what it is.

1294
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.750
You get in five minutes from now and you're gonna be able to get up and every

1295
01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:39.960
fight starts,
every round starts standing,
you know?

1296
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:43.680
So you think that people should win fights based on not fighting like,
no,

1297
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.300
but my like,

1298
01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:48.990
I just don't think that you should win a fight by your goal and the fight is

1299
01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.040
just to nullify the fight.

1300
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:53.310
I think if I can stop this fight from happening for three,
three,

1301
01:13:53.311 --> 01:13:56.250
five minute rounds that I,
when I understand what you're saying,

1302
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.400
but I think that if a guy can take you down and hold you and control you,

1303
01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.730
he's kicking your ass.

1304
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.550
Even if he's not beating you up the way you would be to guide up.

1305
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.680
Like if you had your druthers,

1306
01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:09.870
you'd forced guys to stand with you and you'd light them up.

1307
01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:14.871
You have a giant over 99.9% of the planet in MMA when it comes to kickboxing,

1308
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:20.230
your,
I mean,
your ideal world is like get these guys to just stand with you.

1309
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:24.490
Let's,
hey,
let's make an agreement.
Fuck shooting.
No takedowns let's just throw,

1310
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.000
you know you're going to have a giant advantage.
And so other guys would say,

1311
01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:30.940
listen,
I'm just making an agreement.
No,
no kickboxing.
Let's just,
uh,

1312
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:33.940
let's just see who's the better grappler.
You'd be like,
get the fuck Outta here.

1313
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.340
But for a guy like Ben Asker and that would be a really good agreement.
Right,

1314
01:14:37.341 --> 01:14:39.550
right.
Because he could take down most guys,

1315
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:43.860
he fights vanaskie her and gets a hold of guys like,
like Douglas Lema,

1316
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:47.420
fucking killer.
Kickboxer dangerous motherfucker been astronauts,

1317
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.910
just rag dolls ragdoll some tosses him to the ground and in can do that

1318
01:14:51.911 --> 01:14:55.570
consistently.
So for a guy like that,
why would you,

1319
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.210
why would a guy like that want to stand up?
He could,

1320
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.480
he could grab a hold of you and you can't stop him from taking you down if you

1321
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:03.130
watch like some aspirins fights.

1322
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:07.330
By the time it gets to the third and fourth round,
his opponents were like,
fuck,

1323
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.000
this guy's going to take me down again and I can't do shit.

1324
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:14.980
Well that's a fight and he is fighting,
but he's fighting you his way.
He's not,

1325
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.250
he doesn't have the kind of snap to his punches or kicks that you do.

1326
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.210
It doesn't have the kind of arsenal of attacks when it comes to striking that a

1327
01:15:22.211 --> 01:15:23.044
guy like you does,

1328
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:27.220
but when it comes to holding motherfuckers down and giving them nuggies punched

1329
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:30.070
him in the face and they can't do shit about it.
That's his world.

1330
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.130
And I think for fighting to be realistic,

1331
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:35.740
you've got to have guys like that as well.

1332
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:39.910
Like a lot of people didn't like Matt Brown and Johnny Hendricks the last fight.

1333
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.360
I loved it.
I didn't love it because I wanted Matt Brown to lose.

1334
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.560
I loved it from a technical standpoint because you got a guy like Johnny

1335
01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.620
Hendricks who was a decorated all American wrestler and that just shows you,

1336
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.630
this is what happens when you fight a high level wrestler like Hendricks.

1337
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:56.464
It's on point.

1338
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.950
The motherfucker is going to take you down whenever he wants to and he's going

1339
01:15:59.951 --> 01:16:03.160
to be on top and you're going to be eating shit sandwiches and that's just the

1340
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:06.970
way it goes as the wake.
And that's a real fight.
If you want to fight in MMA,

1341
01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:11.890
that's a real fight.
Now if Hendrickson Matt Brown fought in the boy tie fight,

1342
01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:12.520
it was a,

1343
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.750
it'd be a completely different fight if Hendrix couldn't shoot for the take down

1344
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:20.080
whenever he was in trouble and he got stuck or especially forget Moy Tai,

1345
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.090
take up more glory rules.

1346
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.000
We've going only grapple for five seconds where you can only clinch for five

1347
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:25.630
seconds.

1348
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:28.180
Then you've got a completely different fight and then you got to fight where

1349
01:16:28.181 --> 01:16:31.390
Matt Brown is just throwing elbows and kicks and knees and punches and just

1350
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:32.141
keeps coming at you.

1351
01:16:32.141 --> 01:16:34.720
Is Not afraid to throw a flying knee cause he's not worried about getting taken

1352
01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:35.200
down.

1353
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.980
He's not worried about just blasting you with leg kicks cause you can't grab his

1354
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:41.620
legs.
You can't trip them and throw them down and get on top of them.

1355
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:46.750
You can only kickbox with them.
Yeah,
I agree.

1356
01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:51.730
But I think that if you take the guy down and you just lay on top of him that

1357
01:16:51.731 --> 01:16:53.500
it's somebody's responsibility to,

1358
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.560
for the love of God to do something and stand them up.

1359
01:16:58.751 --> 01:17:00.400
Or like,
you know,
my last fight,

1360
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.130
you know the referees like you guys gotta improve positioner I'm gonna stand you

1361
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:07.480
up.
I'm like,
okay,
yes,
Tammy up bitch,
you gonna stand you up.
All right,

1362
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:09.590
we're gonna stand you up and I'll make,

1363
01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.050
are you going to fucking stand a sub or not?
Well you know,

1364
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:15.470
he's clenching against the fence.
I mean I think I agree with you and that's,

1365
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:20.180
I mean the way I obviously have to look at it is that I have to be able to stop

1366
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:21.630
him from doing that.
I mean that's,

1367
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:25.220
that's the reality is I can't allow these guys to continuously do this because

1368
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:26.780
let's face it,
that's what people are going to do.

1369
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.500
But I think that on the scorecards,

1370
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:33.890
if one guy gets dropped and then lays on top of you for three minutes and then

1371
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:35.500
you know who's wins that round,

1372
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:38.420
the guy that drops the other guy cleaned with a punch or the one that lays on

1373
01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:42.110
top of my specific,
but if you want to judge me,

1374
01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:46.160
mine's the only one that matters shows
especially that one,
right?

1375
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:50.510
If you want to judge damage for sure you won that round and you won that fight

1376
01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:54.600
if you want a judge damage.
But the problem is they don't just judge damage.

1377
01:17:54.601 --> 01:17:58.220
They also judge control.
He didn't do anything to you once he got you down.

1378
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.550
I mean he stayed active but there was no moments where like you were in trouble

1379
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.410
the moment where you hit him.

1380
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:07.780
And dropped him was the most significant moment of that fight by far because it

1381
01:18:07.781 --> 01:18:11.240
dude's consciousness was wobbled,
his fucking legs gave out.

1382
01:18:11.241 --> 01:18:13.760
He was on Queer Street,
he was in deep shit.

1383
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:17.840
But he was able to clinch up with you and it was able to turn it to a grappling

1384
01:18:17.841 --> 01:18:21.290
match and survive.
So when you look at it damage wise.
Yeah,

1385
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:24.170
that was the closest to him losing consciousness for sure.

1386
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:28.700
But MMA is about a bunch of shit.
It's about controlling the moments.

1387
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:33.140
See I personally think that pride had it right.
I agree.

1388
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:36.590
I think they had the best rules.
I like the yellow cards.
I don't like,

1389
01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.980
I don't like fighters being punished financially.

1390
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:43.880
I don't agree with the yellow cards as far as like taking 10% of your purse.

1391
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:48.230
I think that's bullshit.
But I do think that some stalling,

1392
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:52.390
like if guys are just running away and they're not doing something you,

1393
01:18:52.391 --> 01:18:55.700
you should be able to penalize them.
Maybe a percentage of a point,

1394
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.430
like maybe instead of a full point deduction,

1395
01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:00.590
maybe it's a percentage of a point and all that.

1396
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.590
Cause I think the scoring system 10 point scoring system is retarded.

1397
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.430
The only reason it exists is because it exists for boxing.
Right.

1398
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.990
And it kind of works for boxing.
It's a good system for boxing.

1399
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:13.700
But when you have MMA and you're dealing with takedowns submission attempts,

1400
01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:17.810
kicks,
punches,
elbows,
knees,
I mean most people,
uh,

1401
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.741
if you don't know,

1402
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:23.420
if you've never watched Moyie Thai muy Thais judged very different than MMA and

1403
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:27.980
a very different than boxing.
Like the clinch in [inaudible] is very important.

1404
01:19:27.981 --> 01:19:30.590
Controlling the clinch is one of the most important things.

1405
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.230
Kicks are judged very highly in Moy Tai.

1406
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:38.410
I think the problem with when we tie in the U S is that it's refereed by Steve

1407
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.170
Mazzagatti.
Other people that do,
you know,
the same guys,

1408
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.340
like if you watch a Muy Thai fight and Thailand,

1409
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.100
the referee actually knows what's going on in the clinch.

1410
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.440
And if there's not shit going on in the clinch,
they break you.

1411
01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.670
But Steve Mazzagatti,
we'll let you hold on me.
When I fought Simon,
he was like,

1412
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.360
I was talking to Steve and Steve,

1413
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.520
you can break us and he would just hold me against the rope for long,
long,

1414
01:19:58.521 --> 01:20:01.460
long period of time.
Right.
And he does that consistently.

1415
01:20:01.461 --> 01:20:05.030
So you need like Apollo Tosha guy or something like that.

1416
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:08.070
Like someone who's been maybe not him.
I laugh all

1417
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:09.390
<v 2>the time,
you know what I'm saying?</v>

1418
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.650
I do next topic.
He's always been nice to me.
But you know what I'm saying?

1419
01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:19.080
Like someone who's maybe competed in white tie,

1420
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:23.580
someone that's been around for a long time,
it goes in anything.

1421
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:27.420
It's the people that are judging and the people that are referring in any sport,

1422
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.760
you know,
should,
should know what the hell they're doing.
You know?

1423
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:32.910
And one question,
what's important in any sport,
you know,
and uh,

1424
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.660
like with Mike sit here and complain about my fight and really don't care.

1425
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:40.440
But uh,
who was the referee?
Uh,
uh,
Bill Beltran.

1426
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.210
Yeah,
he's good.
He's good.
Mike's good.
Mike's very good.
But three judges,

1427
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.850
three different scorecards.
Mm.
That's a problem.

1428
01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.510
One of the one deciding score code all three rounds to my opponent.

1429
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:54.750
That doesn't make sense.
Yeah,
it doesn't make sense.
That's incorrect.

1430
01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.790
What frustrates me about that situation,

1431
01:20:56.791 --> 01:20:59.940
it's like I have to look at my record and deal with it and I have to deal with

1432
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:02.910
the consequences pay wise,
sponsor wise,
whatever.
You know,

1433
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.240
what if I don't do my job regardless of anybody else,
but if I don't do my job,

1434
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.490
there's consequences.
But,
and,

1435
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.820
and all of that athletic commissions on a regular basis,

1436
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:15.360
there's constantly mistakes and there's constantly people not doing their jobs

1437
01:21:15.361 --> 01:21:18.570
correctly and there's no consequences for them.
There's never any retro,

1438
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.180
there's never anything but the fighter that,
you know has to deal with it.
Yeah.

1439
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.960
It was a good Manny Pacquiao fight with Timothy Bradley.

1440
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:29.250
What was the consequence to that?
Well,
what,
and one of the women were happened,

1441
01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.410
one of the women who was a very controversial judge in that stop judging,

1442
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.950
uh,
because of that fight.
And,
uh,

1443
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.450
there was one other fight that she judged as well,

1444
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.400
where there was a lot of speculation about

1445
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.320
whether or not there was corruption involved.
And when just in competence,

1446
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:47.970
which is just speculation,
no one knows.

1447
01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:52.970
But she had a series of like really ridiculous scorecards on championship level

1448
01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:57.420
fights where you're like,
what the fuck?
Like how is this like,
first of all,

1449
01:21:57.421 --> 01:21:59.670
especially in boxing,

1450
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.030
boxing has been around for fucking hundreds of years.

1451
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:06.690
We're not talking about MMA where there's just really not that many people that

1452
01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:11.100
are really good practitioners and all the various martial arts at understand all

1453
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:14.220
the different positions.
There's,
when you watch him boxing,

1454
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:17.940
it's pretty goddamn clearcut punching.
There's movement,
there's defense.

1455
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:22.170
That's it.
That's all it is.
Like this,
uh,
this Floyd Mayweather fight.

1456
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:23.940
What did you think about that fight?
Uh,

1457
01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:26.610
I thought it was exactly what I thought it was going to happen.
Me,
Tina.
I mean,

1458
01:22:26.611 --> 01:22:29.280
uh,
and I'm not,
the person that hates,
I mean was,

1459
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:33.030
it drives me nuts as how many people have no clue about boxing and are all over

1460
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.970
like the Internet now complaining and saying that their side of the story,

1461
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:40.530
the fact is Mayweather is the best in the world of defense and not getting hit

1462
01:22:40.531 --> 01:22:41.640
and hitting you and not getting hit.

1463
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:44.880
And the reason this fight was so interested in everybody as they thought that

1464
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:48.690
Manny Pacquiao was going to do something different than what had happened in 48

1465
01:22:48.691 --> 01:22:52.050
other maybe where there's fights and it didn't happen and everyone's pissed off

1466
01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:52.950
at Mayweather about it.

1467
01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:55.590
It's like that's the same shit he's done his whole career.
What?

1468
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:59.910
You should be mad at Petco.
But the,
uh,
the scorecards were messed up.

1469
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:03.900
They miss mark this scorecards,
you saw this,
that they,
uh,

1470
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.010
they thought that may,
whether it was in

1471
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.660
<v 1>the blue corner or the red corner or whatever.
Yeah,</v>

1472
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.920
they came out and there was the,
uh,
one of this,

1473
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.530
they still gave it to me whether they had the scores correctly,

1474
01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.480
but it was marked red versus blue.

1475
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:20.160
<v 0>It's on the Internet.
Oh,
so they marked the wrong corner of the room.</v>

1476
01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:22.650
Still judging from Mayweather.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1477
01:23:22.651 --> 01:23:26.250
Well there's a lot of fucking shitty people that are involved in every sport.

1478
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:28.620
There's,
you're always gonna have that.

1479
01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:30.630
There's definitely a lot of shitty boxing judges,

1480
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:36.130
but I just think that having a shitty boxing judge is almost less excusable than

1481
01:23:37.021 --> 01:23:40.710
having a shitty MMA judge.
Cause there's so many fucking boxing fans,

1482
01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:43.560
there's so many guys that have been doing it for so long.

1483
01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.530
And if you listen to like Harold Letterman on Hbo,

1484
01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.130
I very rarely disagree with that guy.
I listened to his scorecards.

1485
01:23:50.131 --> 01:23:53.100
It makes sense.
And I hear what he's saying.
You know,

1486
01:23:53.101 --> 01:23:56.100
I'm the same Steve Farr Hood.
Is that the guy's name that does it for showtime?

1487
01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.480
<v 1>I think,
uh,
I think that's his name.
I think so.</v>

1488
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:01.630
<v 0>I'm good that the showtime guys,</v>

1489
01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:05.560
same thing mean they disagree on a round or two here or there,
but I,

1490
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:08.860
their points are on there.
They,
they,
they know boxing.

1491
01:24:08.861 --> 01:24:11.410
They understand what the fuck is happening.
You know,
they,
they,

1492
01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.740
they're appreciating everything that's going down while you're watching a fight.

1493
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.720
You're telling me you can't find nine,

1494
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:19.420
10 of those guys that only judged championship fights.

1495
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:21.940
That's those the only guys ever like here's the list.

1496
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.240
These are the best in the world.
Uh,
at judging boxing.

1497
01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:26.620
When you have a boxing match,

1498
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.450
these are the only guys that should be able to judge.

1499
01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:32.540
<v 1>It's just,
there's a reason there's three,
three judges.</v>

1500
01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:34.940
It's cause if one of you makes a mistake,
the other two we'll fix it.

1501
01:24:34.941 --> 01:24:38.210
But have three judges have three completely different scorecards.

1502
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:39.830
What are we do it here.

1503
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:41.240
<v 0>You know what I think we should do too,</v>

1504
01:24:41.241 --> 01:24:44.360
because the fact that we have the internet today,
I think they should be,

1505
01:24:44.361 --> 01:24:49.361
there should be a panel of experts that you just have that are floating online.

1506
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:54.350
Like say like,
you know,
pick out a bunch of guys.
Like a guy from bloody elbow,

1507
01:24:54.351 --> 01:24:56.330
a guy from SB nation,

1508
01:24:56.331 --> 01:25:01.331
a guy from a sure dog have like a bunch of guys who are real legit fans.

1509
01:25:01.881 --> 01:25:05.600
Journalists guys have been doing it for a long time and have that be like a

1510
01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:09.320
fourth judge.
Like say if you're in a situation where you,
you know,

1511
01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:14.130
you've got a close fight,
um,
have the three people calling it ringside w the,

1512
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:17.600
and then the one group of people that agree on,

1513
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.920
I would say maybe 80% of them agree that this guy won.
You know,

1514
01:25:21.921 --> 01:25:25.160
and that should count in the,
in the,
in the scoring system.

1515
01:25:25.161 --> 01:25:28.130
I think having three people is not enough people.

1516
01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.560
I think you should have a bunch of people that judge a fight

1517
01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:32.390
<v 1>and then you get to a point where it's like,
okay,</v>

1518
01:25:32.391 --> 01:25:36.110
you could question or you're going to,
uh,
what do you call it?

1519
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:39.560
Like appeal the decision or whatever.
Nobody ever wins those.
Nobody ever wins.

1520
01:25:39.561 --> 01:25:40.311
But the reason they don't,

1521
01:25:40.311 --> 01:25:43.790
when is the same reason why the police never get charged with a murder?

1522
01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:46.370
When they kill people,
it's because they protect their own.

1523
01:25:46.371 --> 01:25:49.010
So the head of the Athletic Commission writes you a letter says yes,

1524
01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:51.440
she made valid points,
but we need to support our,

1525
01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.650
our people because they don't want to say that,
you know,
our guys screwed up,

1526
01:25:54.651 --> 01:25:57.680
you know?
And that's a,
so the fighter has to eat it.
You know,

1527
01:25:58.130 --> 01:26:00.680
dad is a real issue and that's,
that's messed up.
You know,

1528
01:26:00.681 --> 01:26:03.110
it should be some sort of,
you know,

1529
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.470
if you make a mistake you have to pay for the consequences or own up to it.

1530
01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:09.770
But it's like when the judges are,
they athletic commission makes a mistake.

1531
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:13.970
It's the fighter that has to,
that suffers from,
it has to deal with consequences.

1532
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.820
I just think it's wrong.

1533
01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:17.430
<v 0>There was a real issue with that,
with the Nevada state athletic commission.</v>

1534
01:26:17.431 --> 01:26:19.980
They ousted the athletic commission chamber.
The,
the,
the,
uh,

1535
01:26:19.981 --> 01:26:21.360
head of the athletic commission is gone

1536
01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:25.050
<v 1>when,
when,
uh,
you know,
one of my charts I got,</v>

1537
01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:30.170
I got a swept what was questionably illegal sweep and I got slammed on my head

1538
01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:34.320
and the referee didn't see it and let me stand up,
walk in the wrong way.

1539
01:26:34.321 --> 01:26:36.950
And then I got teed off on and they called it a knockout.

1540
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.310
And I appealed the athletic commission.

1541
01:26:38.311 --> 01:26:41.760
I had three different videos with footage of showing that it was an illegal

1542
01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:45.090
sweep and that the referee wasn't paying attention.
It was like,
no way,

1543
01:26:45.091 --> 01:26:48.990
I'm not winning this one.
And,
uh,
Kaiser wrote us a letter saying,
you know,

1544
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.970
although you made very good points,

1545
01:26:50.971 --> 01:26:53.400
we need to support our athletic commission and nothing happened.

1546
01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.770
<v 0>Yeah.
He's the dude that wasn't going to bring them up by name.
Yeah.</v>

1547
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.520
He's a bad guy either.
But Kaiser is a,
he's a politician,
you know,

1548
01:26:59.521 --> 01:27:02.190
and that's why he's,
that's why he got ousted.

1549
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.900
<v 1>And then my next fight,
uh,</v>

1550
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:07.950
I score a knockdown the jab and like the first round and then the scorecards

1551
01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:10.420
come out and two of the judges didn't count the knockdown.

1552
01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.330
It just didn't count that the eight,

1553
01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:17.880
the eight point must system why he won by one or I lost,
he won by one point.

1554
01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.510
It was like where's the,
I forget what the score was but there was,

1555
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.310
there was no way he could have scored that many points.

1556
01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.790
They would come to the knockdown that's,
that was in Nevada.

1557
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:30.450
<v 0>Yeah.
There's a lot of shady shit going on when it comes to judging.</v>

1558
01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:35.040
Just the idea that what drives me crazy is the idea that someone who is not a

1559
01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:37.410
practitioner doesn't understand what's happening.

1560
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.820
It's never really been punched in the face.

1561
01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:42.640
Probably their whole life can judge a pro kickboxing bout like that.

1562
01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.250
That's bananas.
It doesn't make any sense.
Like how did that guy get that Gig?

1563
01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:52.080
Especially Jujitsu and MMA because if you don't understand what the fuck,

1564
01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:52.910
like if you're like,

1565
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:56.930
say if a fight goes to the ground and the guy in the bottom is threatening with

1566
01:27:56.931 --> 01:27:58.290
a submissions and the,
the,

1567
01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.440
the referee or the judge rather doesn't score it for him because he doesn't

1568
01:28:01.441 --> 01:28:03.550
understand how close the guy was to get it

1569
01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.690
<v 1>to the guy that was on the bottom has a knee bar but he's on the bottom or an</v>

1570
01:28:06.691 --> 01:28:09.990
ankle lock or whatever it is.
But he's on the bottom,
but he's almost got it,

1571
01:28:09.991 --> 01:28:13.380
you know,
and the guys wincing in pain,
but he's on top.
But the other prison,

1572
01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.840
all they could see as the guys asked from the inside,
they don't know.

1573
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:17.960
So that guy wins the round cause he helped her out and for two rounds,

1574
01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.890
<v 0>well we had a fight for,
um,
for those,
um,</v>

1575
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.050
judges to get screens for them to get monitors to watch the asked you about that

1576
01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:28.550
last time.
That's really important.
Yeah.
We had a fight for that.

1577
01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:30.260
That was big because I'll tell you,
man,

1578
01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:32.840
I don't see a lot of shit that's happening and I'm fucking,

1579
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:35.630
it's close as anybody alive.
Right.
I'm right there.

1580
01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:39.740
I'm touching the floor next to the cage with my hands while the fights going on

1581
01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:43.220
and sometimes I can't see shit.
What's 30 feet across the cage,
right.

1582
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:47.330
I think the cage is too big too.
We used to use a smaller one for the,
um,

1583
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:51.200
for uh,
the,
the WEC and for the hard Ron fights.

1584
01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:53.600
We used to do fights at the hard rock and we'd be in a smaller cage.

1585
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.870
I liked that one better.
I think forces guys,
I mean,
you could still move.

1586
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:59.000
It's not,
it's not like you're fighting in a phone booth,

1587
01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:01.590
but the idea that you could literally run,

1588
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.600
I mean you could sprint away from a guy in the octagon.
It's so big.
Yeah.

1589
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:08.040
I mean they're greedy.

1590
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:12.050
What don't they want more seats in the arena is shrink that pitch up.

1591
01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:15.510
Put some more fucking seats.
Why did they do the cash?
I don't know.

1592
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:18.970
I have no idea.
I don't know.
Maybe it looks more grand or something like that.

1593
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.100
I really don't understand it.
It's the smaller cage is plenty big.

1594
01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:26.070
It's still really big.
The boats were cases smaller.
Like here's this 30,

1595
01:29:26.071 --> 01:29:30.030
I think ours is 25.
We try and say bell two is better.

1596
01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.020
I think Bella towards better.

1597
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.530
But do you think about this a Reebok sponsorship shit that's gone down.

1598
01:29:34.531 --> 01:29:39.060
This is a big deal right now in MMA that Reebok is the official sponsor for the

1599
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:39.720
UFC.

1600
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.080
Fighters can't have independent sponsors when they walk into the cage now and

1601
01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:47.040
financially it seems to be a huge disaster for the fighters.

1602
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:50.520
I think that I'm glad I five her Bella tour and you can sponsor me for Bella

1603
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:51.354
tour if you'd like.

1604
01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:54.980
And do you have a management Maryann management that they can contact your send

1605
01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.250
sponsorship?
Michael Colgan.
Oh,
there you go.
Yeah.
He told me to say hello to you.

1606
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:02.320
I'll tell him I said what's up?
Yeah.
I think,
um,
it's,

1607
01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.700
whenever you see these guys complaining and talking about the difference in the

1608
01:30:08.041 --> 01:30:11.370
amount of pay that they're getting,
like that's not,
that's not good.

1609
01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:15.360
It's not just not good,
like all that stuff had to be worked out,

1610
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:17.490
I think should have been worked out in advance.

1611
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:20.940
It's great to have a big sponsor like Reebok involved,

1612
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:24.230
but not if the fighters have to suffer.
Yeah,
I think it's just a,

1613
01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:27.510
when it came out,
it was,
you know,
I think everyone kind of saw this coming.

1614
01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:29.630
You know,
Tim Kennedy did a tweet today.

1615
01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:31.890
He said he was getting 2,500 or something for his,

1616
01:30:31.891 --> 01:30:34.920
and that's the only sponsor that you're allowed to allowed to have.
You know,

1617
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:38.010
it's a,
well,
Brendan Shop said he would be getting 10 grand,

1618
01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.370
but every single fight that he had before this,

1619
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.660
he was getting more than he was getting six figures is what he said.
So I mean,

1620
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:48.040
at least a hundred thousand I don't know how much,
six figures,
you know,

1621
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:50.920
it could mean as much as 900,000 for every fight.

1622
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:55.470
So six figures for every fight and then now he's making 10 grand.

1623
01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:59.430
That's a,
that's a big hit.
Yeah,
it's huge.
It's huge.

1624
01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:03.000
And it's based off the raking,
you know?
So if you're,

1625
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:05.850
I guess if you're Chris Weidman is going to get more money than that,

1626
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.000
well even the champs get 40 grand,
the champs,

1627
01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:11.450
the best guys in the world get 40 grand.
That's a,

1628
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:16.470
that doesn't seem like enough to me.
No,
it just doesn't seem right.
Um,
look,

1629
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:19.950
I'm not a businessman.
I'd be the shittiest businessman in the world if I,

1630
01:31:19.951 --> 01:31:23.700
if I own the UFC,
the UFC would probably be filing for bankruptcy right now.

1631
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.950
I would never have gotten it to where it is.

1632
01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:29.760
I would never done any of the smart moves that these guys had done.

1633
01:31:29.761 --> 01:31:34.410
I'm an idiot when it comes to business,
but,
uh,
I,
uh,

1634
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.730
I just don't,
I don't like when I see fighters suffering financially,

1635
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:43.050
I don't like it at all.
It's just a really weird thing.
You know,

1636
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:46.020
it's great for bill tour and the guys ability to work cause you know,

1637
01:31:46.021 --> 01:31:48.750
all of those sponsors that can no longer sponsor in the UFC.

1638
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.000
It got to go somewhere in June or July.

1639
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:52.860
What do you think about a fighters' union?
I mean,

1640
01:31:52.861 --> 01:31:55.980
I was going back and forth with John Fitch about that today.

1641
01:31:55.981 --> 01:32:00.290
And John Fitch actually,
he posted something like,
let me pull it up because I'm

1642
01:32:01.930 --> 01:32:06.760
<v 1>spiders intelligent guy,
John Fitches,
I saw some of the videos he posted like a,</v>

1643
01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:09.520
he's very smart of him talking politics.
I was like,
God,

1644
01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:14.440
I wish I could speak that well.
Yeah,
he's a,
he's a very smart dude.
He wrote,

1645
01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:16.150
um,
I,
I,

1646
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:21.160
I posted something about MMA being illegal in New York is New York.
Just a,

1647
01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:21.910
there was a,
uh,

1648
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:25.990
an article that was posted about New York being the corruption capital of

1649
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:27.750
America,
more corruption

1650
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:32.070
<v 0>in New York than anywhere else.
And uh,
when I posted it,</v>

1651
01:32:32.071 --> 01:32:35.220
John Fitch said that,
he said,
no,

1652
01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.880
the reason MMA is illegal in New York is because of Zuph is treatment of

1653
01:32:38.881 --> 01:32:40.880
employees,
both fighters and

1654
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.300
<v 1>tell workers,
which is not really true.</v>

1655
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:47.760
Even if you disagree with the way UFC treats,
uh,

1656
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:51.560
fighters or hotel workers.
And what,
when they say hotel workers,

1657
01:32:51.561 --> 01:32:53.590
they don't make my intelligent comment.

1658
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:57.620
I think he's just saying that because you know,
he's,
he's upset,
you know,

1659
01:32:57.621 --> 01:33:01.580
I don't think he's a,
he's not happy with a,

1660
01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:06.230
the way a lot of things went down,
but it's old school boxing,
uh,
politics.

1661
01:33:06.231 --> 01:33:10.190
It is 100%.
That's the boxing commission in New York.

1662
01:33:10.191 --> 01:33:13.310
They have no other athletic commission as far as kickboxing.

1663
01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.130
They don't sanction kickboxing there either.
They have a,

1664
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:22.050
their own sanctioning body that's not a state run thing in New York.
Yes.

1665
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.630
So there's no,
you know,

1666
01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:26.480
the benefit of having athletic commission went as a fighter is that you're

1667
01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:29.210
guaranteed to get paid.
You're guaranteed to have,
uh,

1668
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.790
health insurance for the fight if you get hurt or whatnot.
And when,
um,

1669
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:37.760
it's not through the state,
you know,
the Iks the what,

1670
01:33:37.761 --> 01:33:41.690
any letters you want to put together,
you don't have that same confidence.

1671
01:33:41.691 --> 01:33:44.420
And I'm in New York,
it's only boxing.

1672
01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:46.890
Then you have the wk when you fight in New York,
and,

1673
01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:50.990
and a lot of states that are too small to have that led a commission.
But it's,

1674
01:33:50.991 --> 01:33:52.160
yeah,
it's,
it's uh,
it's,

1675
01:33:52.161 --> 01:33:55.760
boxing has been huge in New York for eternity and that's what they want.

1676
01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:56.090
You know,

1677
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:58.560
<v 0>it's also the culinary union,
the culinary,</v>

1678
01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.820
when he was talking about hotel workers,
what he's talking about is the culinary,

1679
01:34:01.821 --> 01:34:04.850
the UFC.
This is the,
the,
the long and short of it.

1680
01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:10.080
The UFC is owned by [inaudible] also owns the people that own Zoomba also own

1681
01:34:10.081 --> 01:34:14.300
station casinos.
They own 20 plus casinos in Vegas and they're non union.

1682
01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.990
The employees voted for them to be non union.

1683
01:34:17.991 --> 01:34:22.130
The union wants it to turn union because it was union.
They'd make some,
uh,

1684
01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.520
somewhere around $15 million a year just from the station casinos.

1685
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:30.850
So they've had this campaign for years to try to get the UFC to acquiesce and

1686
01:34:31.371 --> 01:34:35.660
become a union,
a casino station,
Casino Union casino.

1687
01:34:35.661 --> 01:34:37.790
So they have this smear campaign against the UFC.

1688
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:40.160
And so that's what he's saying when he's saying hotel workers.

1689
01:34:40.190 --> 01:34:42.220
That's what he means.
He doesn't mean like the UFC shows up

1690
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:46.680
<v 1>now hotel workers,
how does he know all this stuff?
I know Tim Kennedy,</v>

1691
01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:47.730
my Twitter got hacked yesterday.

1692
01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:54.180
He gets say that without any irony whatsoever.
That's a wait,

1693
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:58.430
I love Jane Kennedy.

1694
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.350
<v 0>He's a bad motherfucker.
But uh,
so John Fitch posted about this thing,</v>

1695
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:08.380
uh,
m m a f a mixed martial arts fighters association.
Uh,
m.

1696
01:35:08.381 --> 01:35:13.110
M a f a is on Twitter.
Uh,
there's,
I guess a guy named Rob May,
uh,

1697
01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:17.780
may Macy,
m.
A.
Y.
S.
E.
Y.
He must be in charge of it.

1698
01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:21.920
And I don't think it's a bad idea to have some sort of an organization that

1699
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.990
looks out for,
uh,
for fighters.
And I also think that it's,

1700
01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:31.020
it's super important to have something like tour like that is owned by Viacom

1701
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:36.410
that starts to come up in the public's consciousness and become bigger and

1702
01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:40.910
bigger and have more competition.
I think competition is,
it's the best.

1703
01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:44.700
The only way you get in fight like Manny pack yellow versus Floyd Mayweather is

1704
01:35:44.701 --> 01:35:47.960
he have two bad motherfuckers who are on rival promotions.

1705
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.890
They get together and showtime and HBO both got together and said,
listen,

1706
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:54.630
let's make some money that's put this fucking thing together.

1707
01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.150
These are the two biggest fighters in the world.

1708
01:35:56.151 --> 01:36:00.290
You're going to make the 4.5 million paper view bys.

1709
01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.030
I mean that's fucking insane.

1710
01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:06.260
At 100 bucks and nothing like that exists in MMA.

1711
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.620
And if Bella tour had a champion,
you know,

1712
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:13.100
if you become champion at Bella Chore at 185 pounds and it,

1713
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:17.060
it builds up where you're knocking dudes dead and then you know,

1714
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.400
whoever is in the UFC at the same time,
you know why men are Vituro shocker,

1715
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:22.340
right?
Whoever the fuck it is,

1716
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:27.020
if it builds up in the public's consciousness like this fight has to happen.

1717
01:36:27.021 --> 01:36:31.940
It has to take place.
Yes.
Well sort of,
sort of tried to,

1718
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:33.200
didn't really work.
I mean the,
the,

1719
01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:36.230
they tried to make an agreement with pride and you know,

1720
01:36:36.231 --> 01:36:39.590
the UFC sent chuck Ladell over there and then,
you know,

1721
01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:42.440
pride was supposed to send some fighters over here but it never happened.

1722
01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.100
They brought over Vandelay and Vandelay and chuck,
you know,

1723
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.700
had that stare down the octagon.

1724
01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:50.900
But it wasn't until years later when pride was purchased by the UFC that the,

1725
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:54.920
the fighters actually came,
right.
It was mostly some Japanese fuckery.

1726
01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.690
Those guys are heard.
There's a lot of fuckery.
But yeah.
Was lost.

1727
01:36:57.691 --> 01:37:01.570
Slickness those guys are slick.
I mean,
not in a good way,
but you know,

1728
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:03.080
they made a lot of money doing that.

1729
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.290
You know what the whole pride UFC thing happened,
you know,

1730
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:10.970
do you know the story behind it?
The UFC purchase pride for $65 million.

1731
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.460
When they got it,
they realized that all the contracts were invalid.

1732
01:37:13.770 --> 01:37:17.660
There were all illegal.
They were all they had was a library.

1733
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.080
They essentially had a library of Dvds and tapes,

1734
01:37:21.081 --> 01:37:25.970
which good luck making 65 million off of that.
And so then they tried to sell it,

1735
01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:30.140
you know,
or try to,
um,
uh,
to sue them and the,

1736
01:37:30.141 --> 01:37:34.460
that didn't really work.
I mean,
good luck trying to sue someone in Japan,

1737
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:35.380
you know,

1738
01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:38.490
what are you gonna keep flying over Japan every couple of weeks for court dates

1739
01:37:38.491 --> 01:37:43.460
and,
and on top of that extension.
Yeah.
While they were,
um,

1740
01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.290
while they bought pride,

1741
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:48.500
they were going to keep the pride office open and have like,
you know,

1742
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:51.080
they're going to start running pride events in Japan and they realize how much,

1743
01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:55.200
how hard it is to do.
Like it's not easy.
It's not like you're just going to like,

1744
01:37:55.201 --> 01:37:59.370
you would do a event New Mexico,
you know,
it's,
it's a totally different country.

1745
01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.990
I mean they have completely different laws,

1746
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:04.590
completely different customs and the people that were working for them,

1747
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.930
they were all,
while they had an office running,

1748
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:11.850
the people who are working for them started putting together dream.
So then they,

1749
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:12.680
they,

1750
01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.770
they put together their own MMA organization and started putting on their own

1751
01:38:16.771 --> 01:38:18.870
fights.
It's fucking chaos.

1752
01:38:19.090 --> 01:38:22.890
So I that contract or that it's the context was legally shots.

1753
01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:24.840
Why fade or never came to the UFC initially?

1754
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.240
The reason why fade or wasn't a part of the pride deals,

1755
01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:29.520
the contracts would talk shit.
There was nothing there.

1756
01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:34.050
And that was their big fader is probably a big reason behind buying pride.

1757
01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:37.920
Oh,
how could you not want fate or to come over?

1758
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.680
I mean they tried hard to get fade or a lot of people don't realize that,
uh,

1759
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:43.551
how hard they try.

1760
01:38:43.551 --> 01:38:47.160
But it was a good view of she fucking cared about putting on the right foods due

1761
01:38:47.161 --> 01:38:48.420
to her food or come over.

1762
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.890
They would m one global who are the people that promote fade or they wanted to

1763
01:38:52.891 --> 01:38:54.960
have co-promotion rights to the UFC.

1764
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:58.530
But the problem is that's not like they don't have,
there's no promotion.

1765
01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:03.050
They're like,
it's just a management team of fader.
Like you see,

1766
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:04.800
they wouldn't really be promoting anything.

1767
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:06.810
They would just be glomming on and making.

1768
01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.080
So the UFC offered them a big percentage of the pay per view buys a large chunk

1769
01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:16.940
of money you would get when fade or fights.
They want it to be co promotion,

1770
01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.700
they want it to be the UFC and [inaudible] glow.
Who the fuck is m one global?

1771
01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:22.650
Nobody knows what that is.
Like three shows on it.
Yeah.

1772
01:39:22.651 --> 01:39:26.730
You're not talking about like showtime and Hbo or like Bob Arum and t,
you know,

1773
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:29.250
and golden boy productions to establish companies.

1774
01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:32.160
You're talking about one company that fucking no one knows.

1775
01:39:32.161 --> 01:39:36.060
And one company that's the NFL of MMA.
So it didn't make any sense.

1776
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.690
They offered him a fuck load of money.
And then Dana,
we said,
listen,

1777
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:43.920
you guys got to realize that this guy can lose and if he loses this ain't worth

1778
01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:47.400
shit.
Like as soon as he loses this is not worth anything.

1779
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.960
And then he goes to strike for us and then V for doom triangles,

1780
01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:55.980
them wraps him up,
taps him out and like that's it.
Everything just got weird.

1781
01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.370
And then after that big foot pizza,
fuck out of him.

1782
01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:03.770
And then after that Henderson Kaos him that said there goes your,

1783
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.650
there goes your big money,
it all went away and there goes the dreams man.

1784
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:10.800
The fucking fights a good a band with that guy in the UFC would have been

1785
01:40:10.801 --> 01:40:15.750
amazing.
But that's how it goes.
Japanese fuckery,

1786
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:17.220
Japanese fuckery.

1787
01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:22.380
The apparently the way they do businesses,
lot of,
they'll say,

1788
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.330
oh we will get together and have a meeting and we are interested in selling

1789
01:40:27.331 --> 01:40:31.080
pride.
And then,
you know,
then they get together and everyone,

1790
01:40:31.081 --> 01:40:34.130
he gets really excited and there's all this publicity and they go,
Huh,

1791
01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:37.260
we change our mind but we have a big event next week and then they put on this

1792
01:40:37.261 --> 01:40:39.500
big event.
Now they have all this publicity because they,

1793
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:43.770
the UFC is going to by pride and then they have to put on this fucking gigantic

1794
01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:45.690
show and it's very clever.

1795
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.410
They just have a different way of approach ever figure out what the microphone

1796
01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:51.720
was about.
Like why did they have the headset?
What did the referee have?

1797
01:40:51.721 --> 01:40:55.450
A headset so he could talk,
made some accusations,
but oh,

1798
01:40:55.451 --> 01:40:58.930
he was saying that the there was fake.
Yeah,
he was just fucking with fighters.

1799
01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.200
Fucking makes some good points.
Why would he have a headset?

1800
01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:07.090
Well there is a problem with some of the fights in pride that we're clearly

1801
01:41:07.091 --> 01:41:09.010
fixed.
Right?
There's no doubt about it.

1802
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:12.760
There can be no doubt you watch Mark Coleman versus Takata if you don't think

1803
01:41:12.761 --> 01:41:16.810
that that fight was fixed,
you're an asshole.
And the k one two oh yeah,
yeah.

1804
01:41:16.811 --> 01:41:18.910
So I'll tell him boo cow.
Like how them was killed.

1805
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:22.200
Masato trying to get to win over blue cow.
Oh yeah.

1806
01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:27.370
Three routes and they give an extra round and then he kills him in the fourth

1807
01:41:27.371 --> 01:41:30.760
round of this extra round and he could see massage.
Like what the fuck really?

1808
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:34.450
And like boot cal was just kicking the fuck out of him and I guess Masato had to

1809
01:41:34.451 --> 01:41:38.080
retire for like eight months or something.
The internal bleeding,
it was bad,

1810
01:41:38.490 --> 01:41:42.760
was bad.
They always,
uh,
that's a finance are kind of known for uh,

1811
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.260
trying to get the,
the Japanese when,
yeah,
there's always going to be that.

1812
01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:52.400
There's always going to be a little bit of that.
But yeah,
it's fun,
man.
The,
the,

1813
01:41:52.401 --> 01:41:57.310
the glory,
early days of MMA and kickboxing.
And look,

1814
01:41:57.311 --> 01:42:00.490
when you,
you look at that,
like say,
you know,
they did,

1815
01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:01.840
they definitely did some fuckery,

1816
01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:06.610
but they put k one on the map and therefore kickboxing on the map on a grand

1817
01:42:06.611 --> 01:42:07.444
scale.

1818
01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.960
When you look at those k one grom priests and they're in the Tokyo Dome in front

1819
01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:15.640
of like,
God knows how many thousands of people.
That was amazing.

1820
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.090
That was a as well.
I fell in love with kickbox.
That was my,

1821
01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.130
my dream was always watching those,

1822
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.830
those world Grand Prix and then the cold wet glory was like,
Oh,

1823
01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:27.640
you want to find it when night tournament.
Yeah.

1824
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:30.070
Waiting my whole life for this.
Yeah.

1825
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:34.750
Well I just hope that glory and there's a big event that's going on this Friday

1826
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:37.700
night.
They're doing regular events on spike.
Um,

1827
01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.460
I just hope that it can achieve the same sort of level in America that the UFC

1828
01:42:42.461 --> 01:42:46.510
has or that pride and k one had in Japan.

1829
01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.550
And I just think if you look at the quality of the,

1830
01:42:50.551 --> 01:42:54.010
the fights that they're putting on,
it's right up there.
It's an amazing,

1831
01:42:54.011 --> 01:42:58.660
I think they're the best quality as far as the,
the,
the level of the strikers,

1832
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:02.580
the best quality we've ever had.
Guys like you and Nikki holds skin and,

1833
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:04.360
and mark the box.

1834
01:43:04.410 --> 01:43:08.500
It's like so many guys that are like at a super high level in,
in,

1835
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:11.020
in glory right now.
Yeah.
It's really exciting.

1836
01:43:11.021 --> 01:43:13.780
They're putting them in the production value on their shows is really good.
It's,

1837
01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.740
yeah.
I just hope people keep tuning in or start tuning in.

1838
01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:21.040
All their ratings have been a little questionable lately on some really big

1839
01:43:21.041 --> 01:43:24.970
carts.
And uh,
yeah,
man,
they just need more push.
They need to keep,

1840
01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:26.380
don't they need to keep doing it.

1841
01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:29.590
And eventually I think it's gonna catch on guys like Raymond Daniels,

1842
01:43:29.591 --> 01:43:30.910
Joseph out the Leni.
There's like,

1843
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:35.260
there's so many high level guys that are fighting exciting fights.

1844
01:43:35.261 --> 01:43:37.660
There were wild,
exciting fights to watch.

1845
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:42.550
I just can't see it not working.
I just think it just has to a,

1846
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:47.190
it just has to keep pushing,
you know?
That's all it is.
I mean it's,
it's,

1847
01:43:47.210 --> 01:43:49.510
it seems to me like the product is there.

1848
01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:53.450
It's just a matter of letting people about it.
Yeah.
And then this,
uh,
you know,

1849
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:55.130
having it on spike is good too.

1850
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:59.750
Having that Friday nights fight thing every Friday night,
they f fights on spike,

1851
01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.490
whether it's a bell,
a tour van or a boxing event or Gloria event.
Yeah.

1852
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:06.320
They can keep that up.
That could be,
that could be really big.
That's huge.

1853
01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:10.490
This PVC boxing cards had been pretty awesome on there too.
Yeah,
yeah.

1854
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:14.270
He's been really good on that.
It's been,
uh,
you know,
he said boxing is dead,

1855
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:16.820
but it seems like there's a,
there's a lot of buzz behind boxing,
wrestling.

1856
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:20.510
Can you say it's dead when they have,
you know,
4.5 million paper view,

1857
01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:23.690
but I'm looking forward to Canelo Alvarez versus James Kirkland this weekend.

1858
01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.600
That's going to be fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1859
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:29.460
But I heard Kirklin I realized that I watched the uh,
you know,

1860
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:32.330
the countdown show that they were doing about it,
whatever they call it,
24,

1861
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:36.730
seven and a Kirkland didn't train with Ann Wolfe for this fight.
No.

1862
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:38.083
Which is like,

1863
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.150
if you ever thought like a guy definitely should be training with a woman

1864
01:44:41.151 --> 01:44:45.320
trainer,
like in any,
in any other sports that ever happened in a combat sport,

1865
01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:46.154
you'd be like,
what?

1866
01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.830
But if you look at like the shit that Ann Wolfe would make him do,

1867
01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:54.190
she would get in a truck and she had a heavy bag attached to an arm on the front

1868
01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:59.780
of the truck and then the truck would move forward at like a certain amount of

1869
01:44:59.781 --> 01:45:00.740
miles per hour.

1870
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:06.010
And he was forced to back up and punch the bag as he's backing up doing

1871
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:10.460
roadwork.
Never seen anybody do that before.
They didn't know.

1872
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:13.280
But they showed it in the,
you know,
in the,
uh,
the,
the,

1873
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.980
the training montages and stuff.
And I was like,

1874
01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:19.600
dad is a fucking great idea because you have to keep up.
You've got it.
Yeah.

1875
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:23.270
Trucks coming your way.
You know you've got a backup and you know,

1876
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:25.680
you can't take any breaks.
Like,
you know,
for whatever reason,

1877
01:45:25.690 --> 01:45:29.000
how many mount rounds she's making them do or how many minutes she's making them

1878
01:45:29.001 --> 01:45:33.410
do as he's backing up,
he's got to hit that fucking bag.
And when he was with her,

1879
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.100
his conditioning was on point.
Man.
I mean,
he,
she put him through hell,

1880
01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:39.710
but some dudes don't want to go through hell.
They will.

1881
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.170
They go through hell a few times.
Like Bj Penn with Marvin [inaudible],

1882
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:47.450
he went through hell a few times and he was like,
fuck this man.
I'm not going to,

1883
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.900
I had a strength coach couple years back that was awful.
We stopped doing it.

1884
01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.910
But,
uh,
Yo,
the,
I was really successful and I was with him.

1885
01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:02.870
Fucking hell for sure.
That's what it is though,
right?
It's like this,

1886
01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:06.500
this nick curse on guy who trained a Hofeld dos Anjos is one of the reasons why

1887
01:46:06.501 --> 01:46:07.940
I can't wait to talk to him.

1888
01:46:08.230 --> 01:46:11.750
It's because when you put those guys through hell like that,

1889
01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.940
the results are undeniable,
but it's a matter of like,
how much should,

1890
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.330
how much should that replace skill training.
Right.
You know,
like,

1891
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:22.790
like here's a perfect example.
Um,

1892
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:27.380
say if a guy like rich Franklin had gone through a guy like Marinovich when he

1893
01:46:27.381 --> 01:46:28.400
fought Anderson Silva,

1894
01:46:28.401 --> 01:46:32.540
he still would not have been technically able to deal with Anderson striking.

1895
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:36.270
Right?
Well,
it wasn't rich like,
wasn't the where he's training?

1896
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:40.400
Did we talk about that?
Like he was,
uh,
yeah,
he had some pretty intense,

1897
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:43.880
intense,
hardest trading fighters at the time or whatever.
Yeah,

1898
01:46:43.881 --> 01:46:47.670
he will at the time.
I mean,
I don't know.
And he just stands up.
It was a big boy.

1899
01:46:47.671 --> 01:46:50.700
Huge.
Yeah,
it was,
but yeah,
it just didn't have,

1900
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:52.680
it was the clinch didn't have the answer for the clench.

1901
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:55.440
That's a technical thing.
You could have trained all day,

1902
01:46:55.441 --> 01:46:58.710
every day and it's not going to change.
You're lacking in that area.
You know.

1903
01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:02.190
He also didn't have the answer standing up.
I mean,
even outside of the clinch,

1904
01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:02.431
you know,

1905
01:47:02.431 --> 01:47:05.870
when you see Anderson drop his hands and Shuck and jive in front of him,

1906
01:47:05.871 --> 01:47:07.500
my Franklin throws punches and kicks it.

1907
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:10.740
Air Anderson's just ducking under the kicks and looking at it.
I'm like,

1908
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:15.630
that's a terrifying place to be when you're standing there with a guy who he

1909
01:47:15.631 --> 01:47:16.830
knows you can't hit him.

1910
01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:21.420
Did you ever see his fight Anderson's fight with Jorge Rivera in cage warriors?

1911
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:24.900
Cage rage,
whatever the fuck it was and no,

1912
01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:28.660
the only one I remember was his fight with the Tony frequently the back.
Yeah,

1913
01:47:28.661 --> 01:47:33.570
the cage rage.
I was an early,
yeah,
he fought.
He fought,
um,

1914
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.820
Jorge Rivera and he let Jorge Rivera Punch him in the face over.

1915
01:47:38.821 --> 01:47:43.821
And horror is known as a knockout guy and he punches him three,

1916
01:47:43.861 --> 01:47:45.630
four times clean in the face.

1917
01:47:45.631 --> 01:47:49.980
And Anderson just staring at him smiling like literally let him tee off on its

1918
01:47:49.981 --> 01:47:54.840
face.
So scared to do that.
It doesn't jam.
You can get stupid and stuff like that.

1919
01:47:54.841 --> 01:47:59.770
But what if that goes bad?
What would it feel that hit me and I like,
well,

1920
01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:03.840
every Anderson and Weidman,
I mean the clowning around ultimately will happen.

1921
01:48:03.841 --> 01:48:07.980
Huh?
That was the worst ever moment.
An innocence career.

1922
01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:11.160
And the biggest example why she'd never clown around in a fight.

1923
01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:16.350
That was,
uh,
that was one of those things that you,
when it's happening,

1924
01:48:16.351 --> 01:48:20.430
you don't believe it's happening.
Like what?
What are we seeing?
Like what?

1925
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:23.130
Like you almost have to shake your hand.
Like what is this?

1926
01:48:24.170 --> 01:48:27.600
<v 2>Because like that's what everybody wants to see.
What's that like?
Lay down.</v>

1927
01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.800
I'm like,
no mother fucker.

1928
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.690
He laid down and put his hand on his head like he's taking a nap.
It's so funny,

1929
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:38.730
Dude.
I was slamming my hands against the table.

1930
01:48:39.110 --> 01:48:41.690
Just posted a clip the other day and you can hear yourself laughing.

1931
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:45.250
You can actually see me across this.
I can't tell if I'm excited or not,

1932
01:48:45.251 --> 01:48:46.760
but to stand up and I'm screaming something.

1933
01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.890
That was a crazy fight,
man.
It was weird

1934
01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:55.900
<v 0>being being there for that and then watching Anderson after it was over,</v>

1935
01:48:55.901 --> 01:48:59.380
realizing how much pressure was on him when he just laid down and started

1936
01:48:59.381 --> 01:49:02.780
weeping like,
whoa.
Yeah.
Is it,

1937
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:07.110
<v 2>there's big,
the memes about this are awesome.
All the</v>

1938
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:14.130
pose.
Don't stand up homie.
Oh my God,
he's so funny.

1939
01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:16.170
He was so crazy.

1940
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:22.430
The goat and Anderson Silva as far as like a dude that people love to see fight

1941
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:27.600
is,
you don't get much better than nick.
No.
People love that.
Kelly is fucking,

1942
01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:35.150
I couldn't believe he did it and that's have to talk in all kinds of mad shit

1943
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:39.990
that we all would.
None of us knew that was going to happen today.

1944
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.630
He probably didn't even know.
He wasn't,
you know,

1945
01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:44.970
it was real respectful talking about him,
you know,

1946
01:49:44.971 --> 01:49:47.530
even throughout the whole camp you and be like,

1947
01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:50.200
oh you going to fucking mom bird saying anything to him?
And he's like,
oh,

1948
01:49:50.201 --> 01:49:53.800
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just going to survive.
She can survive.

1949
01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:56.070
And I'm like,
I'm gonna kick his fucking ass.

1950
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:59.890
What you mean by they were in the back and he's like said something like,

1951
01:49:59.891 --> 01:50:03.100
Oh yeah,
I might,
I might fuck with him or something.
And I was like,
oh,
okay.

1952
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.940
You know about.
They're like,
what the fuck is all this shit?

1953
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:10.120
It was awesome though.
It was great.
And you could,

1954
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:13.210
we could see how much it was messing with Anderson right away when he started

1955
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:16.630
doing it.
Like he fucks with everybody's perspective.
Yeah,
it's really effective.

1956
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.180
But Nick Fox with everybody said he fucked with Robbie Lawler's head.

1957
01:50:19.210 --> 01:50:21.180
You could really see it in that robbery hour flight.

1958
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:25.870
Like Robbie Lawler was used to just going Berserk on guys and all of a sudden

1959
01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:29.080
nick was like,
what bitch?
What bitch?
What's up bitch?
What's up bitch?

1960
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:31.710
And it's like stand in front of his face.
You could see Ravi.
Yeah,

1961
01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.120
it was affected.
And for sure when nick onto the cage,

1962
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:37.540
I'll never forget that fight because he got in the cage and he looked over at

1963
01:50:37.541 --> 01:50:41.430
Robbie,
starts going stocked in,
motherfucker stocked him mother fucker.

1964
01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:45.850
And Andy Robby was like looking around like,
what,
what's happening here?

1965
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:49.750
Where is Stockton?
Where's this?
Where's this going to lead?
Like this is bizarre.

1966
01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.210
Like it's just a totally different thing.

1967
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:56.610
Would Have Robbie would have been like de Moines,
Iowa Bitch.

1968
01:50:57.430 --> 01:51:02.390
Yeah.
It was um,
a very rare moment in time.
This is a,

1969
01:51:02.391 --> 01:51:06.310
a big card coming up this weekend,
right?
The glory card.
Me Goodwin.
Who's on this?

1970
01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.370
I got a here queued up here.

1971
01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:13.390
It's a Simon and um,
art Tim for the,
for the belt.

1972
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:16.690
If you don't have m spike,
you could watch it online.

1973
01:51:16.691 --> 01:51:18.760
If you go to glory world series.com,

1974
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.800
you could stream it for only 10 bucks and a arts and 11.

1975
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:28.510
And Simon Marcus,
Artem,
Levin,
uh,
one of the best kickboxers on earth for sure.

1976
01:51:28.690 --> 01:51:32.410
So is Marcus Simon Marcus one of the best on earth too.
And uh,

1977
01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.320
they're gonna fight.
You have two really interesting styles,
you know,

1978
01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.880
having fought both of them are,

1979
01:51:36.881 --> 01:51:40.720
Tim is very much like a Floyd Mayweather kind of a,
he's very elusive.

1980
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:43.570
He'll score is points and then hold and kind of eats up the clock really well.

1981
01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:46.900
Um,
and then Simon is one of those just like bull forward,

1982
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:51.640
constantly coming forward,
constantly trying to uh,
you know,
having,

1983
01:51:51.670 --> 01:51:54.370
having fought both of them.
Simon,
when you're,

1984
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:56.500
when you're standing across the room from Simon,

1985
01:51:56.501 --> 01:51:57.970
you see somebody that you have to knock out.

1986
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.460
Like he's going to keep coming at me no matter what.

1987
01:52:00.461 --> 01:52:02.020
There's no weakness in his mindset.

1988
01:52:02.021 --> 01:52:04.750
He's going to keep coming until I knock him out with the art team.

1989
01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:07.120
It's like supreme confidence.
It's to go really.

1990
01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:12.130
It's very interesting standing across from both of those guys and both guys have

1991
01:52:12.131 --> 01:52:15.870
had a long career.
I mean,
you look at a look at the records there,

1992
01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:20.880
54 and one for 1142 two and one from Marcus and [inaudible] and Marcus up until

1993
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:23.530
your fight was undefeated,

1994
01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:27.920
you knocked him out and then he lost in China again after that as well.
Right.

1995
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:28.691
Aco and China.

1996
01:52:28.691 --> 01:52:31.380
I think that was one of those things for like we were talking about before where

1997
01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:33.430
he didn't take the time off after I knocked him out.

1998
01:52:33.431 --> 01:52:35.290
And that was a bad knock out your face plant.

1999
01:52:35.291 --> 01:52:38.320
You're out for a long period of time,
you know?
And then he got,

2000
01:52:38.321 --> 01:52:42.460
he got rocked again and China right after that.
Who fought him in China.
Oh,

2001
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.920
I don't know the guy's name.
And he wasn't even a big,
big name is Chinese guy.

2002
01:52:47.710 --> 01:52:50.120
The Chinese guy.
I them in China.
Crazy.
Go figure.

2003
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:54.410
It's like a Russian guy I find in Russia.
But uh,
yeah.

2004
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:56.300
And then he came back and won the,

2005
01:52:56.301 --> 01:53:00.080
a contender tournament against Jason Wellness and uh,
Wayne Barrett.

2006
01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:03.680
Now Raymond Daniels was fighting in the car too.
He's an La guy.

2007
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:06.220
Do you train with him at all?
Um,
I was on the,

2008
01:53:06.221 --> 01:53:10.070
I did that world combat league like six years ago.
We were on the same team.

2009
01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.310
I have met him and got to know him a little bit then we haven't tried together.

2010
01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:14.950
That was a chuck Norris thing.
Yeah.

2011
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.380
Now the truck nars thing took place in like a bowl,
right?
Yeah.

2012
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:23.180
What'd you think about that?
I hated it.
I hated it was terrible.
I thought it was,

2013
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:28.190
it was,
it was really set up specifically for point karate guys to do well.

2014
01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:32.600
It was just like everything against like the kickboxer really were wearing those

2015
01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:33.230
pants.
Right.

2016
01:53:33.230 --> 01:53:37.010
But underneath the pants we have like the sport Combate super thick Shin pads

2017
01:53:37.011 --> 01:53:40.040
underneath the pants.
Oh really?
So like you know,
your leg kick is,

2018
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:43.630
and it's a one round,
it's three minutes and then you have,
you know,

2019
01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.760
30 minutes or whatever until you come back out and you fight your s your second

2020
01:53:46.761 --> 01:53:49.100
round or whatever.
So it's really hard to be effective with,

2021
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:53.600
with round kicks in general with the Shin Pad on and it's only one round.

2022
01:53:53.601 --> 01:53:55.880
You know,
the Shin Pad is a weird thing,

2023
01:53:55.881 --> 01:54:00.881
but it's not weird when you think about the fact that the guys wear gloves and

2024
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:05.240
that you'll also,
I w I always wonder,
especially in MMA,

2025
01:54:05.241 --> 01:54:08.450
like why do they have gloves on?
Like if you really,

2026
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:10.520
we've been talking about this a lot lately,

2027
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:15.470
that if you wanted to lessen the effectiveness of,
uh,

2028
01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.760
of,
uh,
like punching techniques,
one of the best ways to just remove the gloves,

2029
01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:23.300
right?
Like if you remove the gloves,
you make guys fight bare handed,

2030
01:54:23.301 --> 01:54:24.134
you get to see what,

2031
01:54:24.170 --> 01:54:27.800
what's really effective and not effective when it comes to striking.
Yeah.

2032
01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:31.360
You still can kick guys in the head.
You still,
but you couldn't eat.
You guys,

2033
01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:34.330
Nigga only kicked him in the head with the Shin Pad on,
like,
imagine if you,

2034
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:36.530
you mean in life without parole comment?

2035
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:41.280
Imagine punching somebody in the leg with a glove on.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2036
01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:43.280
It's like it takes away all of the effectiveness to,

2037
01:54:43.281 --> 01:54:45.260
it's different when you meet somebody in the chin,
you know,

2038
01:54:45.261 --> 01:54:48.950
but you'd have to hit somebody really fucking hard if with a punch to the leg to

2039
01:54:48.951 --> 01:54:52.430
hurt them,
which is essentially what that Shin Pad would be doing for it.

2040
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:54.170
And I just,
I hated the rules.

2041
01:54:54.171 --> 01:54:58.250
I hated that circle threw me off big time being in a circle with no ropes and

2042
01:54:58.251 --> 01:54:59.084
then you,

2043
01:54:59.110 --> 01:55:02.110
you get into an exchange and you just step back and you would be on this,

2044
01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:06.150
this slant,
you know,
why did,
why does everybody have to wear those pants?
Uh,

2045
01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.630
it was something about the sponsors that,
you know,
I got uh,

2046
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:12.830
I got in a lot of trouble because I had like sponsors like Henna tattooed on my

2047
01:55:12.831 --> 01:55:14.990
back,
cause they wouldn't let us put anything on the pants.

2048
01:55:15.630 --> 01:55:17.870
And after the first fight,
the director or whatever,

2049
01:55:17.871 --> 01:55:21.140
it comes to the back and he's screaming and yelling and Chuck Norris is really

2050
01:55:21.141 --> 01:55:24.570
mad at you.
And Oh my God,
Chuck Norris is mad at me.
Is He mad?

2051
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.180
It was like really pissed off that I was,
you know,

2052
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:31.460
taking the advantage of something.
Did they not stated in the rules?

2053
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.240
I think it was in the rules that you couldn't do it or you said you couldn't,

2054
01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:37.910
you couldn't have anything on,
you couldn't alter the uniform,

2055
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:40.070
you couldn't put patches or anything that uniform.
And I'm like,

2056
01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:44.070
well he had a tattoo on my back.
It's like,
pardon permanent marker.
That was

2057
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:47.070
<v 0>the guy's like dumping water on me the bag and like scrubbing it.</v>

2058
01:55:47.071 --> 01:55:48.870
And it wasn't even like he was trying to get it off.

2059
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:51.480
He was just trying to screw it up.
So my sponsor would be,
you know,

2060
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:56.560
did it work and I got paid.
I didn't.
Did it mess it up at all though?

2061
01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:58.740
I mean Hannah Tycho yeah,
it messed it up.

2062
01:55:58.770 --> 01:56:00.560
It will cause it was like you get like Keana with me.

2063
01:56:00.570 --> 01:56:02.080
We went to like Venice beach to get it done.

2064
01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:06.090
Like before I left and then like come in the hotel room and it's all like

2065
01:56:06.091 --> 01:56:09.310
smeared and bad and I'm like,
Hey,
can you cover this?
Like the other guy,

2066
01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.500
that team with a sharpie dental little you might be even better than Hannah,

2067
01:56:13.501 --> 01:56:16.980
right?
Yeah.
Things like that might last even longer.
Yeah.

2068
01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:19.370
So they were scrubbing it.
It was whatever.

2069
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:24.160
That was an issue with the UFC wants with Ricoh Rodriguez.
He had some uh,

2070
01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:26.390
golden palace.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2071
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:29.340
That was back when they had online gambling was like really popular.

2072
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:31.800
Did Not Bernard Hopkins you that wants to,

2073
01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.400
I feel like God guys were doing that in boxing.
Boxing and having a lot.
Yeah.

2074
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:40.290
But they stopped.
So how are they put a stop to it?
Of why though?
Why?

2075
01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:42.330
I don't know.
I mean the UFC a unit maroon,

2076
01:56:42.331 --> 01:56:47.250
the man or something Kinda does fuck with what you're looking at.
I mean,

2077
01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.100
it doesn't matter to me if a guy has sponsors all over shorts,

2078
01:56:50.490 --> 01:56:53.760
but if he's got like a big sponsored tattooed on his back,

2079
01:56:53.761 --> 01:56:58.100
it just seems like tips kind of cheesy.
Yeah.
Like low,
low rent.

2080
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:02.880
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't want to cut into a guy's ability to make money,

2081
01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:07.230
but that does seem a little low rent.
Yeah.
Golden pals.com

2082
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.250
back in the day.
He's a fucking freak,
Huh?
49 years old.

2083
01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:16.290
Still fighting at a world class level.

2084
01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.460
The alien fights against Coleville [inaudible] who's a murderous puncher.

2085
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:25.440
Russians are a different kind of white people,
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah,
they really are.

2086
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:28.620
But this glove getting guy who's a mother fucker only God.
I love that dude.

2087
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:32.130
I love him and he'll knock you out with shots that it doesn't mean if any,

2088
01:57:32.131 --> 01:57:34.110
and I were talking to him about about him the other day,

2089
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:36.930
like it doesn't look like he's trying to hit you hard,

2090
01:57:36.931 --> 01:57:39.220
but like when he throws it all natural and loose,

2091
01:57:39.221 --> 01:57:40.470
it's like he knows it's going to knock you out.

2092
01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:42.730
He's knocking people out with like body shots that don't look hard.

2093
01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:45.600
Look like they missed.
People are dropping.
Awesome.
Yeah,

2094
01:57:45.601 --> 01:57:48.030
his left hook to the body.
Fucking devastating.

2095
01:57:48.031 --> 01:57:50.730
One of the best in the business who he fought,

2096
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:53.760
but he threw her right hand in it like it looked like it slid off.

2097
01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:55.710
Didn't even know it was like penetration at all.

2098
01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:59.820
And the guys don't knock out these two fights ago.
You get to go with it.
Yeah.

2099
01:57:59.821 --> 01:58:03.810
He's a motherfucker do hazing.
He's,
he's awesome.
He's really awesome.

2100
01:58:03.811 --> 01:58:06.390
I love the fact that there's so many guys like that.
Now.

2101
01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.530
I Cam Kovalev um,
uh,
providing a cough.

2102
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:14.190
I love watching like a savage,
like Oh,

2103
01:58:14.191 --> 01:58:18.360
debt fight that he had with Lucas Matisa Jesus Christ.
That was crazy.

2104
01:58:19.110 --> 01:58:23.190
Did you see the a urine sample after the fight?
No Dude.

2105
01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:24.900
Pull that up cause you got to see this.

2106
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:28.830
He posted an Instagram photo of his urine sample and it looks like he poured

2107
01:58:28.831 --> 01:58:30.720
Coca Cola into the cup.

2108
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:36.080
Like he was pissing just so dark from blood and you know,

2109
01:58:36.121 --> 01:58:39.210
internal bleeding and leading and you know,

2110
01:58:39.211 --> 01:58:41.530
a lot of apparently not just internal bleeding,

2111
01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:46.531
but when you have an unbelievably grueling physical event like ultra marathons,

2112
01:58:46.571 --> 01:58:47.404
like we'll get it up there.

2113
01:58:49.710 --> 01:58:52.260
That's his Pittsboro what?

2114
01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:57.120
Yes.
Yes.

2115
01:58:57.230 --> 01:59:00.600
But pull up the actual Instagram so you could see it and we could read it.
Yeah.

2116
01:59:00.601 --> 01:59:03.600
That's his urine sample man.
That his urine sample.

2117
01:59:03.601 --> 01:59:07.080
That's the urine sample that he gave the Athletic Commission,

2118
01:59:07.110 --> 01:59:09.900
the Post doping post-fight cause I've been before,

2119
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:14.910
but it was nothing that dark like that.
It was like fucking orange.

2120
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.380
Well I have a friend who did an ultra marathon.
Um,

2121
01:59:18.590 --> 01:59:22.700
my friend Cameron Hanes and uh,
he said the same thing that when you,

2122
01:59:22.710 --> 01:59:26.400
when you do an ultra marathon,
when you pay,
it looks like Coca Cola.
Really?
Yeah.

2123
01:59:27.450 --> 01:59:28.710
It's like your kidneys are failing.

2124
01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.920
Know Fuck yeah,
here it is.
Sorry,

2125
01:59:33.921 --> 01:59:36.990
I told my friends I lost tonight and I felt like I could have won this fight.

2126
01:59:36.991 --> 01:59:39.960
I almost had him,
but the fight happened the way it happened and here it is.

2127
01:59:39.961 --> 01:59:43.260
He's saying,
uh,
one more fight in my career when I did my doping test,

2128
01:59:43.261 --> 01:59:46.590
I had black urine.
That one,
the first one was against Tim Bradley.

2129
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:51.750
It's black urine ball,
lack urine.
Fuck Dude.

2130
01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:54.480
I think it's an endurance thing too.

2131
01:59:54.481 --> 01:59:58.350
It's just a kidney failure thing cause the guys who have luck and crazy,

2132
01:59:58.410 --> 02:00:00.900
I can't believe that's real.
Yeah,
it's totally real.

2133
02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:05.520
Those guys who have Rhabdo rhabdomyolysis from a crossfit and she'll like,

2134
02:00:05.521 --> 02:00:09.540
that's one of the signs of it.
You get black urine,
but ultra marathoners,

2135
02:00:09.541 --> 02:00:11.340
they all talk about it.
Black urine.

2136
02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:15.000
What's the mission of the ultra marathon and a regular 100 miles in a day.

2137
02:00:15.090 --> 02:00:18.990
24 hours is 24 hour race.
You run a hundred miles

2138
02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:25.500
and you just broken when it's over.
I mean,
why?
Why did they do that?

2139
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:28.930
Prove they can do it.
Yeah.
My friend Cameron who does it as a fucking savage,

2140
02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:32.760
she's just a psychopath because he like really skinny guy and he's 170 pounds.

2141
02:00:32.761 --> 02:00:35.220
Pretty yoked actually.
Really?
Yeah.
He's a bow hunter.

2142
02:00:35.221 --> 02:00:39.450
He's a professional bow hunter and he got started getting into endurance

2143
02:00:39.451 --> 02:00:43.350
training because bow hunting you would think is not a physical event,

2144
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.950
but with a physical event is,

2145
02:00:44.951 --> 02:00:49.230
is getting to the animals up the mountains and packing out all the meat.

2146
02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:50.730
So like you're going,

2147
02:00:50.731 --> 02:00:53.820
like I had this guy Remy warrant on the podcast recently and he was talking

2148
02:00:53.821 --> 02:00:58.560
about how they had to pack out this,
a little moose or an elk.

2149
02:00:58.561 --> 02:01:03.330
They shot Moose and elk,
one of those big fucking animal.

2150
02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.280
Okay.
And he's packing out a hundred plus pounds at a time,

2151
02:01:08.670 --> 02:01:13.050
walking several miles back with 100 plus pounds,
add elevation,

2152
02:01:13.051 --> 02:01:16.830
going up mountains down mountains,
and then going back.
So he,

2153
02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.620
over the course of,
you know,

2154
02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:23.250
x amount of days when they packed all the meat out,
it took them,

2155
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:28.310
it was 30 miles of walking with a hundred pounds on your back up mountains.

2156
02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:34.080
And he's like,
after it was over,
he goes like,
I was just done.
He goes,

2157
02:01:34.081 --> 02:01:37.650
I got sick,
I was exhausted,
my body was just broken.

2158
02:01:38.670 --> 02:01:40.970
That's you don't think about,
and these guys that do it,

2159
02:01:40.971 --> 02:01:44.510
like Cameron every year it goes elk hunting in the mountains,

2160
02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:47.570
shoots a big elk every year,
has to carry it out.

2161
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:50.900
And so he does all these crazy workouts.
And one of them he does,

2162
02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.710
he takes 'em one of these,
uh,
like a meat backpack.

2163
02:01:54.711 --> 02:01:57.810
They call it 10 zinc backpack and he puts on,

2164
02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:02.840
puts 135 pound rock and the backpack and he'll fucking hike up hills with this

2165
02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:07.190
fucking Brock on his back.
Miles and miles,

2166
02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:12.680
man,
I realize how spoiled,
at least as good as my buddies,
uncle's property,

2167
02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.980
they hike a little bit there when we'd shoot the thing and drag it to where he'd

2168
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:19.830
get to it and call him and he bring a fucking four wheeler and tried to shut up.

2169
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:23.380
It was hanging in the barn.
Yeah.
That's uh,
that's the easy way.
Yeah.

2170
02:02:23.381 --> 02:02:27.980
And it spoiled.
Well,
that's a,
that's the way most people do it.
Tree stands,

2171
02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.810
you know,
but when you go for elk and the mountains though,
the big elk,

2172
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.810
oftentimes they're,
they're hard to get to there.
They're smart.

2173
02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.370
They're not going to hang around to your house.

2174
02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:40.070
They're going to go up in the mountains and they're trying to get some elk,

2175
02:02:40.071 --> 02:02:44.010
pussy and you got to,
you got to sneak him,
sneak up to them,

2176
02:02:44.011 --> 02:02:46.460
and then you've got to call him in and,
and then once you shoot him,

2177
02:02:46.461 --> 02:02:50.990
then you got to cut them up and drag him out of there.
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2178
02:02:50.991 --> 02:02:52.400
So that's why he does ultra marathons.

2179
02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:57.140
He's sort of got into running and fitness because of that.
And then escalated.

2180
02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:00.440
Just asked who skinny.
It's usually those marathon or like super,

2181
02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:02.210
you know all the triathlete guys.

2182
02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:06.470
I know they're ready to pull up his Instagram cause he's got a bunch of pictures

2183
02:03:06.471 --> 02:03:10.910
of him.
Sexy bitch likes to show his muscles.
Yeah,
there's all these,

2184
02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:15.510
he just,
he's an animal.
47 years old.
Works fulltime job trains every day.

2185
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:20.450
Every fucking day.
Runs every morning lifts every night.
He's a fucking animal.

2186
02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.880
That's him.
I would never sit and think that was even a marathon guy.

2187
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:29.650
Little ultra marathons.
We just ran the Boston marathon in under three hours.

2188
02:03:29.651 --> 02:03:34.000
He did two,
two hours and 50 minutes.
But yeah,
he's,
he's an animal,
Huh?

2189
02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:38.420
Just killing shit.
Eating wild meat.
That's a big part of it too.

2190
02:03:39.010 --> 02:03:42.290
Like if you see like pull up a little bit from up there above the,
yeah,

2191
02:03:42.291 --> 02:03:46.390
that's him in the marathon.
But there's a picture of his legs would go.

2192
02:03:46.690 --> 02:03:50.990
Keeps crawling up,
up,
up,
up.
Not Down Up.
Okay.
Go down a little.

2193
02:03:51.730 --> 02:03:55.610
There's a right there like you see like a fucking veins is,

2194
02:03:55.611 --> 02:04:00.230
dude's gotten his legs.
He's using some sort of massaging tool,
but that's him.

2195
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.020
It's just a driven dude,
man.
I would've never thought that was a marathon guy.

2196
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.500
I don't know.
We'll see.

2197
02:04:06.650 --> 02:04:11.390
You'd be amazed at the kind of fitness that you need to have.
Just a hike,

2198
02:04:11.391 --> 02:04:13.440
eight hours a day in the mountains.
That sounds,

2199
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:16.670
we're talking about a lot of stuff that just gets really depressing.

2200
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:22.520
Yeah,
it's a lot of work.
I don't work out there.

2201
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:24.950
There's a lot of things that people would like to do,

2202
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:27.910
but it's just too much work.
Then I would,

2203
02:04:27.970 --> 02:04:32.690
I'd probably say that what you do for a living is at the very top of that list

2204
02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:37.100
and you're looking at this guy carrying,
you know,
caring elk steaks,

2205
02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:39.410
running up hills and like,
fuck that.

2206
02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:42.960
Meanwhile would be looking at you fighting three times in a night going,

2207
02:04:42.961 --> 02:04:47.790
fuck that.
No,
fuck that.
Everybody wants to eat.
A few are willing to hunt.

2208
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:48.960
That's what,
yeah,
look at that.

2209
02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:54.200
He's got a pack full with meat and giant ass fucking antlers carrying that pitch

2210
02:04:56.341 --> 02:05:00.070
out there.
I used to hunt all the time when I was growing up in Ohio.
Yeah.

2211
02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:04.980
Deer hunting all the time.
It's been a long time.
Best Meat for you man.

2212
02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:08.100
No better meat in the world.
And wild game was broke.

2213
02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:09.260
My brother and I were living in this

2214
02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.850
<v 1>living together and we were,
you know,</v>

2215
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:17.280
every dollar was spent on like cigarettes and beer were like 17,

2216
02:05:17.281 --> 02:05:21.120
18,
19 I think.
And uh,
I guess I was younger than that.
17,
18.

2217
02:05:21.690 --> 02:05:26.070
And uh,
we would go a hunting every year and it'd be like three or four of us.

2218
02:05:26.071 --> 02:05:29.100
We'd all get a deer and we would chop up like every little piece and we haven't

2219
02:05:29.101 --> 02:05:32.640
been having like dear kebabs like for a whole year we were living off the deer

2220
02:05:32.641 --> 02:05:34.630
that was in the fridge.
That's good.
Tired.

2221
02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.230
<v 0>It's great for you though,
man.
So good for you.</v>

2222
02:05:37.231 --> 02:05:40.340
Do you ever get ahold of some now where you're training?
I'll get you some moose.

2223
02:05:40.630 --> 02:05:44.140
Moose for you.
Yeah.
Fuck Yeah Dude.
Oh yeah.
Moose.
It's tough.

2224
02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:48.810
It's tough for the IC or posts.
You're quite the chef on the with that.
I love it.

2225
02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:52.020
Like last night man,
I was coming home last night from the comedy store.

2226
02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:53.061
I was driving home,

2227
02:05:53.061 --> 02:05:56.130
I was like 1230 I was kind of tired of like I could just fucking slip right into

2228
02:05:56.131 --> 02:06:00.970
in and out right now and go,
nope.
I said just go home.
We got,

2229
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:04.710
cause I knew I had some defrosted Moose and the and the frigerator so I went

2230
02:06:04.711 --> 02:06:07.980
home,
Cook some steaks and some keylock in and out.
Look at that.

2231
02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:10.860
Oh so good to that stuff.
Gives you energy to,

2232
02:06:10.861 --> 02:06:13.110
when I eat that it's something about Mousse.

2233
02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:17.040
I think something about those big athletic,
very lean animals.

2234
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:21.990
I feel energized when I eat the meat.
That doesn't seem to make sense.

2235
02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:24.820
Could see the,
I don't know if they really have a,

2236
02:06:24.821 --> 02:06:29.821
an accurate account of all of the properties of various different kinds of meat.

2237
02:06:30.710 --> 02:06:32.850
You know,
I would like to see like if there,

2238
02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:37.880
if there's a way to do some sort of double blind placebo controlled effect test

2239
02:06:38.701 --> 02:06:42.630
on the difference between eating elk versus chicken or the difference between

2240
02:06:42.631 --> 02:06:47.550
eating,
you know w alligator versus beef.
I really would like to know.
I really,

2241
02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:52.620
I wonder what was the fuck is happening because I tried to look at it really

2242
02:06:52.621 --> 02:06:56.490
objectively.
Like I try not to like,
and maybe I'm,
this is a placebo effect.

2243
02:06:56.491 --> 02:06:59.400
Maybe I'm fucking with myself.
I don't think it is though.

2244
02:06:59.401 --> 02:07:02.880
When I eat moose like more than any other animal I've ever eaten.

2245
02:07:03.210 --> 02:07:05.610
There's something about when I eat it,
I feel like,
ah,

2246
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:10.330
I just feel how fucking charged up man.
I don't know what it is.
I've heard of my,

2247
02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:14.280
I have a buddy of mine who,
uh,
was lifting.
He's a,
he's a,

2248
02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:18.000
he's a big fitness fanatic too.
And his wife shot an elk and a,

2249
02:07:18.010 --> 02:07:20.250
he was eating nothing but elk for months.
He's like,
dude,

2250
02:07:20.251 --> 02:07:21.930
I'm making all these fucking gains.

2251
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:26.160
And I got to think it's connected to this elk.
He's like,
I've nothing but elk,

2252
02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:28.840
you know,
it doesn't have a lot of money.
And he's like,

2253
02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:32.550
we've been eating nothing but elk for like the past two months.
And he goes,

2254
02:07:32.551 --> 02:07:34.530
and I've gained like five pounds of muscle.
And maybe there's,

2255
02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:37.390
there's something to that horse beef thing that Overeem was talking about.

2256
02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.840
I mean,
obviously he's on whatever,
but like the fucking horse beef thing,

2257
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:45.310
maybe it is.
Well eat a horse is kind of the same thing you're talking about shy,

2258
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:47.110
super athletic.

2259
02:07:47.710 --> 02:07:51.400
I mean an animal that jumps over trees with you on its back,

2260
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:55.540
you know that's a motherfucker you ever had horse?
No.

2261
02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:59.380
As a place called Joe beef in Montreal.
If you've never been to Montreal,

2262
02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:01.560
if you ever go up there to train at Tristar or something like that,

2263
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:05.500
the best fucking restaurant on earth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's in Montreal.

2264
02:08:05.501 --> 02:08:09.460
I took my pal Tony Hinchcliffe there,
uh,
last week and uh,

2265
02:08:09.550 --> 02:08:14.260
that guy serves horse all the time and I've had it there twice.
It's good.
Yeah,

2266
02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:18.910
it's real good.
It's weird.
Is that Gamey or no?
No,
no,
not at all.

2267
02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:21.700
It's weird that you're eating a horse,
but I mean is,
is it,

2268
02:08:21.701 --> 02:08:25.300
I mean it's weird to eat a pig,
you know,
go watch babe and then have a,

2269
02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:28.120
have some bacon,
pigs like Waller and shit.

2270
02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:30.580
Like they live in like three feet of shit.

2271
02:08:31.450 --> 02:08:36.190
Eat all asleep and shit.
So that's,
that's not good.
That's gross.
It's nasty.

2272
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.050
You have a wild pig?
No.
Looks different.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's dark.
It's weird.

2273
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.990
I think the flesh is dark.
I cooked a wild ham the other day.

2274
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:47.230
[inaudible] see if it's on my Instagram,
I pulled up.
Uh,
yeah,

2275
02:08:47.231 --> 02:08:50.950
it's on my Instagram.
There's a wild ham from about three or four weeks ago

2276
02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.360
that it's Kinda like,
it's different than like boars are.
It's the same.
Well,

2277
02:08:55.361 --> 02:08:58.480
boar is just mail,
you know,
like if you shoot a male,

2278
02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:04.320
a male bear is also called a bore and a sal pig and a sal bear,

2279
02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:08.050
they're called,
uh,
the females called the south.

2280
02:09:08.230 --> 02:09:11.380
So when you got wild boar in a restaurant,
they're kind of bullshitting you.

2281
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:16.240
It's not really wild.
It might be wild sal.
It's wild pig is what they should say.

2282
02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.680
But it sounds cool to say we're going wild boar hunting.
Yeah.

2283
02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.850
You're going to wild pig hunting.
I thought that,

2284
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.640
but they're all pigs have like the fucking,
yeah,
there it is.

2285
02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:28.870
So that's what it looks like.
See up there.
That's what,
that's,

2286
02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:30.280
that's wild pig.

2287
02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:35.000
That's a female as a female that a shot at this place called the [inaudible]

2288
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:38.230
ranch.
It's about an hour,
hour and a half north of here.

2289
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:43.600
It's fucking delicious,
dude.
It's so good.
And it's very little fat on it.

2290
02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:47.020
Didn't compare it to domestic pig.
Much,
much less fat.

2291
02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.290
You got like a giant freezer home,
just full of shit to have them shut.
Yeah.

2292
02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.230
Two huge freezers.
Big commercial freezers.
Yeah.

2293
02:09:53.231 --> 02:09:57.400
Well I kinda decided like when I started getting into hunting,

2294
02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:59.890
I went,
the first time I went hunting,
I was like,

2295
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.790
I'm either going to become a vegetarian or I'm going to become a hunter.
Like,

2296
02:10:03.791 --> 02:10:07.170
let's see,
like how I feel like after I shoot this and shoot it,
yeah.

2297
02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:09.190
I might feel like an asshole.
Maybe I'll just stick.

2298
02:10:09.191 --> 02:10:11.680
The only fish never really felt bad about fish.

2299
02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:14.620
They didn't even take care of their babies.
They ship them out and run away.

2300
02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:17.140
You know,
they,
they drop out the eggs.
Fuck fish.

2301
02:10:17.141 --> 02:10:19.720
A male comes off Jesus on the eggs and they bolt.

2302
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:25.770
It's like the,
the idea of mammals.
Mammals are the issue.
Um,

2303
02:10:26.170 --> 02:10:31.170
so I decided once I did it like I'm going to try to eat exclusively in my house

2304
02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:32.500
only wild game.

2305
02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.920
I don't really totally do that because occasionally I'll go buy some bison or

2306
02:10:36.921 --> 02:10:38.460
something like that from whole foods,

2307
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:42.770
but almost exclusively in my house I'm eating wild game.

2308
02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:46.220
Like tonight I'm having a Moose stew.
It's cooking right now.

2309
02:10:46.221 --> 02:10:49.460
It's on the slow cooker.
I left the house this morning,

2310
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:52.100
it was on and it will cook for like six hours.

2311
02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.550
Have you always been into cooking or is it just some of the started with he got

2312
02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:58.460
into hunting?
No,
I've always been into cooking.

2313
02:10:58.461 --> 02:11:01.000
Some things like I'm really good at making steak.
I'm,

2314
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:03.440
I'm a really good steak cooker and I,

2315
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:07.880
I'm cooked pasta and I cooked vegetables.
Like real simple stuff,
you know,

2316
02:11:07.881 --> 02:11:12.860
I'm not making like Keesha's or anything elaborate souffle's or anything that

2317
02:11:12.861 --> 02:11:16.820
requires like a deep cooking knowledge.
My skills are limited,

2318
02:11:17.090 --> 02:11:19.700
but I know how to do what I know how to do.
You know,

2319
02:11:20.090 --> 02:11:22.260
you could throw it some steak on the barbecue.
Oh cool.

2320
02:11:22.290 --> 02:11:25.250
I'll kick the fuck out of this barbecue.
The fuck out of some steak.

2321
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.610
I know what I'm doing.
That's about the extent of,
you know,

2322
02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:31.850
these foods contain the best natural sources of Creatine,

2323
02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.690
Venison.
Wild game,
Huh?
Oh Wow.

2324
02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:38.990
Experts agree that best animal source of Creatine is wild game.

2325
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:42.290
While so there you got all my questions answered.
There you go.
Venison,
elk,

2326
02:11:42.291 --> 02:11:47.270
Bison and Buffalo.
What about Moose Bitch?
Moose is the same as gotta be on there.

2327
02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:48.830
It's,
it's 100% on there.
Yeah.

2328
02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:51.090
It's probably just harder to get because he's just note.

2329
02:11:51.110 --> 02:11:55.100
There is no commercially available Moose.
You can get commercially available.

2330
02:11:55.101 --> 02:11:58.880
Venison,
elk,
Buffalo,
and Bison.
Which by the way of the same animal.

2331
02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:01.820
I don't want to redundant a game meat in the,

2332
02:12:01.821 --> 02:12:04.730
unless it's a different type of buffalo,
like there's water buffalo.

2333
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:07.340
But when you talk about the American Buffalo,
you're talking about a bison.

2334
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:11.900
MMM hmm.
Next best source is free range meats,
which includes Turkey breasts,

2335
02:12:11.901 --> 02:12:16.560
chicken breasts.
I just shot a Turkey shot a Turkey couple of weeks ago.
That's,

2336
02:12:16.590 --> 02:12:20.660
that's interesting.
That tastes different.
You shot in the body,
shot in the head,

2337
02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:23.540
shot in the head,
shoot the head,
right?
Yeah.
If you shoot it,

2338
02:12:23.541 --> 02:12:28.520
the body you destroy spitting out little Nell buckshot pellets.
Yeah.

2339
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:32.750
Yeah.
It's,
it's a dirty trick man.
You put out a rubber Turkey,

2340
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:37.310
you put out a rubber female,
start making noises.
It's like,

2341
02:12:37.311 --> 02:12:39.620
Oh boy,
what?
I lacked some cock.

2342
02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:45.540
And then they come over looking to give some caucus,
boom,
boom.

2343
02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:48.030
Blow his fucking head off.
Yeah.
They don't die easy.

2344
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:51.410
Should feel bad about that one.
I mean that's,
no,
no,
no birds.

2345
02:12:51.710 --> 02:12:55.340
Birds can suck my dick birds and fish.
Yeah.
Birds.

2346
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:58.880
They will at least they lay their eggs and then sit on them.

2347
02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.420
So like they're like one step above and they're kind of like,

2348
02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:06.140
I have chickens that I don't want to kill.
You know,
they're like pets,

2349
02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:10.040
but if shit goes down,
the power goes down,

2350
02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:13.250
I'll kill them before I killed my dog.
That's for fucking sure.

2351
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:18.440
Those chickens are getting it,
but they're kind of,
um,

2352
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:19.610
their pets.
You know,
my,

2353
02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:23.780
my daughters will pick them up and hold onto them and they're cute.
You know?

2354
02:13:23.781 --> 02:13:27.530
And they're nice.
Yeah,
they're friendly.
We've had them since they were babies.

2355
02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:29.420
I mean we hatched them,
I mean not hatched them,

2356
02:13:29.421 --> 02:13:32.880
but we got the hatchlings like days after they're born.

2357
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.340
The way it works is they actually send them to the mail,

2358
02:13:35.341 --> 02:13:40.020
which is kind of fucked up.
They do to the US post office and it's like,
no,
no,

2359
02:13:40.021 --> 02:13:42.600
the chicks,
when the chicks are born,

2360
02:13:42.630 --> 02:13:45.440
they pack them in special boxes and they send them there.

2361
02:13:45.441 --> 02:13:50.130
The boxes have like air holes in them and they send them one day air and it gets

2362
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:53.370
to you,
you know,
express mail,
whatever it is,
ups express,

2363
02:13:53.371 --> 02:13:56.490
whatever the fuck they call it.
It gets there.
And uh,
you know,

2364
02:13:56.491 --> 02:14:00.810
they give you an alert like,
hey,
it's going to be coming within one day.
And then,

2365
02:14:00.811 --> 02:14:03.630
you know,
these animals haven't had any food at all for 24 hours.

2366
02:14:03.631 --> 02:14:07.650
When you get them and you get them and you give them some food and they're a

2367
02:14:07.651 --> 02:14:10.680
little,
these little tiny things,
man,
you have to incubate them.

2368
02:14:11.050 --> 02:14:15.600
He put them in this large box with a heat lamp above it.

2369
02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.790
So they're in this like little chicken container box and you know,

2370
02:14:20.791 --> 02:14:25.680
you feed them and it's,
it's really kind of intense.
Yeah.
What else you got?

2371
02:14:25.770 --> 02:14:30.230
You got a monkey or anything?
No,
no much.
There's a,
I have a,

2372
02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:34.170
an indoor court yard in my house and while I was on fear factor when I was

2373
02:14:34.171 --> 02:14:37.650
losing my fucking mind while I was in full blown losing my mind,

2374
02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:40.500
I was actually thinking about filling,

2375
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.800
putting a roof over the indoor courtyard,

2376
02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:47.700
putting thick glass walls all around it and um,

2377
02:14:48.150 --> 02:14:52.320
putting a crocodile monitors in there and like feeding them rabbits,

2378
02:14:52.321 --> 02:14:55.770
like having my own Jurassic Park,
like having like a little opening,

2379
02:14:56.070 --> 02:14:58.030
throw a rabbit through there and watch,
uh,

2380
02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:01.620
the crocodile monitors attack it and devour it.
I'm like,
come on.

2381
02:15:01.621 --> 02:15:05.340
That would be the dopest shit ever.
But the problem is those mother fuckers,

2382
02:15:05.490 --> 02:15:08.370
if they get really big,
you can't really stop them.

2383
02:15:08.490 --> 02:15:11.730
Like if they want to attack you look at like seven,
eight,
nine feet long.

2384
02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:15.930
And also their shit is toxic.

2385
02:15:16.230 --> 02:15:20.250
Like this shit is just disgusting.
So I was like,

2386
02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:21.360
who's going to clean this shit?

2387
02:15:21.361 --> 02:15:24.480
I'm going to have some dude come over the house and clean that shit and like get

2388
02:15:24.481 --> 02:15:27.390
eaten by the fucking hell.
Yeah.
It was a crocodile monitor.

2389
02:15:27.391 --> 02:15:31.080
If you seen one of those,
check it out going the cargo.
No,
it's a,

2390
02:15:31.081 --> 02:15:32.910
it's a giant lizard.

2391
02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.290
A really freaky looking giant predatory lizard.

2392
02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:42.330
This is a crocodile monitor pulling up Jamie.
Yeah.

2393
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:47.100
That's Kinda awesome.
Yeah.
If it wasn't for the shit,
I would have been like,
oh,

2394
02:15:47.101 --> 02:15:48.860
you'd be fucked up Joey.
Should I go?

2395
02:15:48.930 --> 02:15:51.660
I know I came real close to that was pricing.

2396
02:15:51.690 --> 02:15:54.150
I was talking to contractors and everything.

2397
02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.640
See like look at that one of the rat in his mouth down there,

2398
02:15:57.270 --> 02:16:02.250
right there at January.
He always thought it'd be fun to have like a Parana tank.

2399
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:03.780
I had that throw.
Fuck yeah.

2400
02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:08.940
I had a giant paroxetine for steak in there and watch him go nuts.
No,
the stakes,

2401
02:16:08.941 --> 02:16:12.870
not the move to move his goldfish.
You get to watch the attack.

2402
02:16:13.290 --> 02:16:18.290
I used to go to the supermarket or the pet store every week and I would get a

2403
02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:21.720
large bag of goldfish cause I had,

2404
02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:26.760
I want to say I have 30 prawn allegedly cause they were illegal.
Allegedly.

2405
02:16:26.761 --> 02:16:28.770
This is a made up story.
I'm just telling you I'm making it up.

2406
02:16:28.771 --> 02:16:31.990
This is for entertainment,
entertainment purposes only.
And uh,

2407
02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:36.940
I also had a skeleton,
a human skeleton in there that purchased online,
uh,

2408
02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:41.350
from like a medical supply thing.
Like you could buy a human skeleton,

2409
02:16:41.351 --> 02:16:45.010
which I thought was fucked up.
That's fucked.
It's so fucked up.

2410
02:16:45.011 --> 02:16:47.720
That should be illegal.
It's legal.
I had it.

2411
02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:55.360
So the bottom of the Purana tank was these skeletons like a skull and shin bone

2412
02:16:56.711 --> 02:17:00.610
and some other bones and people would come over and they would look at it and

2413
02:17:00.611 --> 02:17:04.630
then they would look closer and they'd be like,
yeah,
I'm fucking real skeleton.

2414
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:06.610
I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
that's real scared.

2415
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:08.140
Did you kill somebody and throw it in the tank?

2416
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:11.170
Like shows house houses like the equivalent of like Willy Wonka chocolate

2417
02:17:11.171 --> 02:17:14.230
factory for jacket.
I'm definitely coming over next week.

2418
02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:19.190
Male children that now that have daughters and everything.
It's all feminize.

2419
02:17:19.191 --> 02:17:23.800
They've ruined my whole existence.
But uh,
not really,
but I mean my,
my,
my,

2420
02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:28.640
my male sanctuary is now been feminized mixed stream way.

2421
02:17:28.641 --> 02:17:33.460
I mean,
I had pit bowls and fucking piranhas.

2422
02:17:33.461 --> 02:17:37.620
I was looking to have a reptile sanctuary,
but um,

2423
02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:41.920
the parameters were fun.
But you know what's more fun?
The Puranas turtles.

2424
02:17:42.610 --> 02:17:45.040
Turtles are motherfuckers,

2425
02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:49.380
they're way more vicious than piranhas and you look at them collectively,

2426
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:51.100
you look kind of cute and everything like that.

2427
02:17:51.370 --> 02:17:55.660
When turtles are hungry and you feed them Goldfish,
I would feed the Goldfish,
uh,

2428
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.950
to turtles as well.

2429
02:17:57.190 --> 02:18:00.540
There are way more entertaining because they're way more entertaining and

2430
02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:03.010
piranhas.
They're fucking vicious bastards,
man.

2431
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:06.370
And they would grab them with their paws.
They would,
they use their,

2432
02:18:06.371 --> 02:18:09.460
the little fins had grabbed them with their fins.
They are,
look at that turtle.

2433
02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.140
What is he eating?
Jesus Christ tomato or something.
Yeah.

2434
02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:18.810
You want to see though that's not a turtle.
That's a tortoise.
I believe.
What?

2435
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:23.110
See if there's a video of turtles eating goldfish.
And what was crazy is like,

2436
02:18:23.111 --> 02:18:27.550
well,
these are actually a turtles eating goldfish.
Th they're actually legal.

2437
02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.270
You know,
we're Paranas since I didn't have them,
because they would be illegal.

2438
02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:35.200
Paranas are illegal.
There was a video of like this lady in Thailand,

2439
02:18:35.201 --> 02:18:39.070
I think it was tired of that.
And she was like fishing for Paranas.

2440
02:18:39.071 --> 02:18:43.330
She had like fucking some sorta gizzard or some kind of meat or whatever.

2441
02:18:43.331 --> 02:18:46.450
And she would dangle it in the water and the water's circling all crazy.

2442
02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.790
And then she would pull it out and there'd be all these Puranas hanging onto the

2443
02:18:48.791 --> 02:18:53.230
me.
Yeah,
look at them.
Look at this turtle swimming around.

2444
02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:58.320
And they would swim and they would just plow into the pile of goldfish and snack

2445
02:18:58.931 --> 02:19:01.750
on them.
And when they get ahold of them,

2446
02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:05.740
they use their little fucking hands to grab what their little hands.

2447
02:19:06.210 --> 02:19:10.330
I hope this guy gets once we could see it,
but they fucking man.
Hey mangles them.

2448
02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:14.530
Look at him.
Oh my kids are getting turtles.
Oh Dude,
they're fun to watch.

2449
02:19:15.010 --> 02:19:19.330
But you gotta be careful if your kids do get turtles because they develop all

2450
02:19:19.331 --> 02:19:21.790
sorts of funky diseases from a shitty water.

2451
02:19:21.791 --> 02:19:25.320
You've got to clean the fuck out of the tank with those clients because ladies,

2452
02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:28.220
they're tearing them apart,
man.
They're mangling

2453
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:29.031
<v 2>these goldfish.</v>

2454
02:19:29.031 --> 02:19:32.900
It's fun to watch because you realize like these things are dinosaurs,
man.

2455
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:35.960
They haven't changed for a hundred million plus years.

2456
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:39.680
Still get that dead goldfish.
Just foreign snacking on them.

2457
02:19:39.681 --> 02:19:42.380
Can we get the hell off?
Does this happen?

2458
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:45.350
Makes it's like feed him every couple of days.
Yeah,

2459
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:48.020
you feed them every couple of days.
But the uh,

2460
02:19:48.021 --> 02:19:52.130
the thing is you gotta be real careful with touching the water and then like

2461
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:55.610
touching your face or eating something like you can get diseases.

2462
02:19:55.611 --> 02:19:57.920
Like my wife made me get rid of him when she got pregnant.

2463
02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:02.480
Having babies and being around that stuff like you can,

2464
02:20:02.481 --> 02:20:06.440
you can definitely get sick.
That water gets real dirty.
They're dirty animals.

2465
02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:10.850
They shit it fucking,
it gets,
it gets funky quick cause they're pretty big.

2466
02:20:10.851 --> 02:20:13.190
You know,
you're dealing with something that's several inches.

2467
02:20:13.191 --> 02:20:17.000
Lawns is shitting in this tank.
And I've always,
I've always wanted a monkey.

2468
02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:21.170
Yeah.
And then my girl,
like you have two kids and I'm like,

2469
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:24.650
my grandmother had a monkey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It wasn't good.

2470
02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:27.440
What was that movie with Clint Eastwood had the fuck every which way,

2471
02:20:27.441 --> 02:20:32.420
but loose orangutan rank or whatever his name is.
Clyde Clyde.

2472
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:36.440
Right.
Turn Clyde Clyde with punch people out the window.

2473
02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:41.970
All the Clyde idiot.
That'd be awesome.
Yeah.
Until it,

2474
02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:45.030
this slide is to rips your fucking arm off to death with it.

2475
02:20:45.031 --> 02:20:49.200
And I know all that good stuff and I heard they like throw their shit.
Yeah.

2476
02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:51.620
That's awesome.
Well,
you just gotta be nice to him.

2477
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:52.920
I'm sure if you're nice to them.
Right.

2478
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:56.540
But you have to be around them all the time.
It's like having a baby.
It never,

2479
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:59.510
never stops being a baby.
Somebody was telling me that they had,

2480
02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:01.760
I mean it wasn't that kind of,
forget what it was called,

2481
02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:02.960
but it was like they get about,

2482
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:07.960
it was like a little outbreak monkey that's called and uh,
did,
uh,

2483
02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:12.080
she was telling me that her dad had bought one off of some people that was like

2484
02:21:12.081 --> 02:21:15.050
a,
it was already full grown and loved the dad,

2485
02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:18.560
but hated like females get really possessive over the males.

2486
02:21:19.730 --> 02:21:23.300
It hated her.
And uh,
you know,
sometimes she'd be cool or whatever,

2487
02:21:23.301 --> 02:21:23.991
but they shipped him,

2488
02:21:23.991 --> 02:21:27.620
she'd be like attacker and scream and fucking like scratch and shit.
Oh my God,

2489
02:21:27.850 --> 02:21:30.510
this is what,
that movie kind of ruined it for me.
Outbreak.
Those,

2490
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:32.840
that's not the one I want.
I want that one.
Oh,
let Clyde,

2491
02:21:32.850 --> 02:21:34.870
I don't want the nice guy.
Well,
chimps,

2492
02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:37.400
I've thought chimps would be cool to have until that lady in Connecticut,

2493
02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.930
her friend came over and ate or friend's face to fucking door off the car.
Yeah.

2494
02:21:41.931 --> 02:21:43.580
That's like a same thing.
It's like,

2495
02:21:43.581 --> 02:21:47.540
it was jealous that this woman was going to be spending time with his
girlfriend.

2496
02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:49.950
Who was the wife.
The,
the,
the,
the,

2497
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:53.390
the owner rather that was his in his mind it was his girlfriend.
Right.

2498
02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.190
Cause he used to hang out with her that he would,

2499
02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.940
the lady would give the chimp wine,
she'd give them Xanax.

2500
02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:03.020
She came Xanax,
crazy bitch.
Uh,
type of crazy bitch.

2501
02:22:03.021 --> 02:22:05.720
Just going to have a champion and have them walk around with diapers on is the

2502
02:22:05.721 --> 02:22:09.230
same type of crazy bitch just going to give a chimp Xanax like chip was wearing

2503
02:22:09.231 --> 02:22:13.970
diapers.
Did you know that by the way?
Huge chimp,
200 pounds.

2504
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:19.100
Imagine chimp as big as you dude,
but only five feet tall.
She just fucking,

2505
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:24.910
it's crazy yoked and just,
there's a video to kind of rip a fuck.

2506
02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:28.980
Like he can rip your arm off,
rip your arm off and beat you with it.
This table,

2507
02:22:28.981 --> 02:22:32.880
this solid oak table,
smash his fucking thing to pieces if it wanted to,

2508
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:37.890
the amount of strength that they have.
Look at that.
What the fuck and fuck.

2509
02:22:40.650 --> 02:22:43.050
That's like Vandelay Silva when he was fighting in pride,

2510
02:22:43.051 --> 02:22:47.340
when he fought in the heavyweight Grand Prix.
It's even,
that's,
no,

2511
02:22:47.341 --> 02:22:51.660
you know what that is?
That's who some are.
Paul Harris after he did a cycle.
Yeah,

2512
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:55.740
Jesus Christ,
but like 50 times stronger.

2513
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:59.700
The physical strength that those fucking things have is off the charts.

2514
02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:03.270
He can't even,
we can't even imagine.
We don't even,

2515
02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:06.210
we don't even know what the fuck that is.
I still want one

2516
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:11.700
gorillas.
I love gorillas.
I was like,
I just don't know.
Well,

2517
02:23:11.701 --> 02:23:12.570
that was my other thought.

2518
02:23:12.571 --> 02:23:17.010
I have this area of my yard that's a one acre blocked off area right there.

2519
02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:22.290
Oh,
look at that gorilla.
Jesus fucking Christ.
He's yoked.

2520
02:23:22.770 --> 02:23:26.190
Awesome.
Or this guy who's this?
Look at that and that's not real.

2521
02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:29.340
That's a fake Brilla Jesus Christ.

2522
02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:34.500
Fucking the imagine that murderous motherfucker trying to bite your Dick off to

2523
02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:37.170
physical strength that those things have to,

2524
02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:39.390
it's not like a man who's built like that.

2525
02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:43.380
Did you see the one with the fucking arms on that thing?

2526
02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:48.600
You see the one we got the sack on him too.
Oh Shit.

2527
02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:53.370
Do you know that a ball size is directly determined by the amount of promiscuous

2528
02:23:53.371 --> 02:23:57.210
females around you?
Really?
Really?
Yeah.

2529
02:23:57.270 --> 02:24:00.640
When you see an animal with giant balls to means he's around hose.

2530
02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:05.350
I can't trust these hoes.
You got to have as much sperm development as possible.

2531
02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:09.240
You seen that video of that fucking guy from like Ethiopia or somewhere.

2532
02:24:09.241 --> 02:24:12.690
It has like a hundred pound testicles.
Yeah.
There's a bunch of dudes like that.

2533
02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:14.910
There was a kind of miracle like that for awhile.

2534
02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:18.420
Do you see the M in that picture?
There's a hairless bear.

2535
02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:19.261
I mean they're bad enough.

2536
02:24:19.261 --> 02:24:20.880
You've got to carry them around with you all the time anyway,

2537
02:24:20.881 --> 02:24:23.490
but a hundred pounds,
I don't usually bother me.

2538
02:24:23.491 --> 02:24:26.700
It doesn't bother me like my regular size balls.
No,
I don't feel the way,

2539
02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:31.950
but maybe you've got big of balls and they do
live.

2540
02:24:31.951 --> 02:24:35.130
Ever put it down.
He's got a fucking,
maybe we have a smear surrounded by Jose.

2541
02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:41.420
Can't trust these hoes like pull up the picture of that hairless bear.

2542
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:45.990
What a fuck is that,
man?
It's funny.
Somebody posted this today.
It was a,

2543
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.850
<v 5>yeah,</v>

2544
02:24:46.850 --> 02:24:51.290
<v 2>15 of the scariest balding and one was or some shit like that.
Yeah,
that's,</v>

2545
02:24:51.291 --> 02:24:54.590
I'm a weird animals.
Look when they're don't have hair.
That's a sun bear.

2546
02:24:54.591 --> 02:24:58.610
I don't know what those things look like with hair.
It's not a a black bear.

2547
02:24:58.611 --> 02:25:01.880
We'll look at that one up there.
The one that far,
not the far right,

2548
02:25:01.881 --> 02:25:04.880
but the one next to it.
Keep going.
Yeah,
right there.
Yeah.
Fucking thing.

2549
02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:09.880
Jesus Christ.
That's a black bear bear.
Yeah.
Cause that's in Orlando.
So that's a,

2550
02:25:09.881 --> 02:25:14.600
uh,
that's a bear with mange.
Creepy fucking animals,

2551
02:25:14.601 --> 02:25:19.590
man.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2552
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:24.760
How weird.
Nature's weird as fuck man.
If bears didn't eat,
what is that?

2553
02:25:24.761 --> 02:25:28.620
Is that a baboon?
Oh my God.
That's a hairless baboons.

2554
02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:32.500
Oh,
Krav riced.
Where else?

2555
02:25:32.501 --> 02:25:37.030
And one stir he can't have is a Hyena.
Have you seen that?
Thanks.
And I like it.

2556
02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:39.390
The Africans have a Mike on giant leashes,

2557
02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:43.960
like they're fucking toys or they put muzzles on him and shit and gnarly big

2558
02:25:43.961 --> 02:25:47.500
chains on their necks.
Hairless Hyena.
Is that real?

2559
02:25:48.970 --> 02:25:52.630
Well,
that's what they say.
A chupa copper is,
you know,
the truth macabre.

2560
02:25:52.631 --> 02:25:54.820
Like they're always like saying,
oh,
we found a troop of copper.

2561
02:25:54.821 --> 02:25:59.380
It's a real animal with a Chupa copper is is a coyote that has mange.

2562
02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:05.080
Look at that fucking monster.
Look at that thing.
Jesus Christ.
Those are scary.

2563
02:26:05.850 --> 02:26:10.090
They,
those things have some of the huge picture somewhere like this African dude

2564
02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.290
walking one and it's like enormous.
Go back to that picture.
That mouth open.

2565
02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:18.040
Jamie is pimple.
Look at that fucking face.

2566
02:26:19.210 --> 02:26:22.270
Oh,
just designed to bite through bone.

2567
02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:27.250
That's what that amount is for that fucking baboon right there too.
Oh yeah.

2568
02:26:27.251 --> 02:26:31.690
They're creepy as fuck too.
They kill each other left and right to baboons.

2569
02:26:31.691 --> 02:26:35.330
Are they killed baboons?
Babies.
They kill everything.
Yeah.

2570
02:26:35.410 --> 02:26:38.460
Hyenas are the only matriarchal mammal society that we know of.

2571
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:41.790
The females were actually larger than the males early.
Eh,

2572
02:26:41.890 --> 02:26:45.670
keep the males from eating the babies.
Huh?
They also have a fake Dick.

2573
02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:47.530
They have a pho penis.

2574
02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:50.830
The female Hyena has a foe penis and she'll get on top of the mail.

2575
02:26:50.831 --> 02:26:54.430
I'm fucking in the ass.
We were fake Dick.
Shut the fuck up.
I wish.
I was like,

2576
02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.620
I wish I was lying.
Pull up the video of a female Hyena.
Got To be seen.

2577
02:26:59.870 --> 02:27:02.920
A female Hyena fo punk,
two girls,
one cup,

2578
02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:08.020
nature's roughest.
Fuck man.

2579
02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:13.640
There's a lot of infanticide and then in the animal kingdom where I think that's

2580
02:27:14.591 --> 02:27:16.930
the way the world should be.
I think society fucks it all up.

2581
02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:21.100
She thinks that's the way it should be.
Well,
however nature wanted it.
I mean,

2582
02:27:21.101 --> 02:27:26.101
maybe this is Eileen is doing it that you're going to see actual sex.

2583
02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.650
I want to see the female penis raping the mail.

2584
02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:34.480
Did you Google fake female folk penis?
I can't pay.

2585
02:27:34.481 --> 02:27:37.450
This is real.
Yeah.
No,
it's real man.

2586
02:27:37.470 --> 02:27:41.740
Go Google images instead of see if there's a,
yeah,

2587
02:27:41.741 --> 02:27:46.741
see there's this is this artificial penis that comes out as a she penis.

2588
02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:50.800
It's an artificial penis that comes out and the female,

2589
02:27:50.801 --> 02:27:55.750
which is larger than male to see show it's an actual penis.
It just doesn't work.

2590
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:58.660
Commercial.
What's not really a dick?
It's just a hunk of meat.

2591
02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:03.190
That's it right there.
That's a male.
That's a female right there.

2592
02:28:04.030 --> 02:28:07.300
But like they still squat when they pee.
Little like your vagina.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2593
02:28:07.301 --> 02:28:10.720
They don't pee out of it.
They just fuck you with it.
Yeah.

2594
02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:19.960
Well they don't,
you know,
I believe that that's what,
yeah,
flabbergasted.

2595
02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:23.120
Give birth out of it.
No,
60% of the cubs,

2596
02:28:23.121 --> 02:28:26.450
the first time mothers die of suffocation inside the pseudo penis.

2597
02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:33.350
It doesn't make sense.
Maybe they go down the wrong hole.
Hmm.
I wonder.

2598
02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:37.850
I Dunno.
Fuck Hyenas though.
Fuck that world.
The whole world is horrible.

2599
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:41.600
I don't want to hide that anymore.
No,
you don't want a Hyena.
This just,

2600
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:45.050
just so like,
it's like,
like people who say they want bears.
It's like,
you know,

2601
02:28:45.051 --> 02:28:49.940
almost all bears are cannibals.
Like all,
all of them,
like especially males,

2602
02:28:49.970 --> 02:28:50.631
male bear.

2603
02:28:50.631 --> 02:28:55.631
One of the reasons why they hunt males like mature boars is to make the

2604
02:28:56.241 --> 02:28:58.730
population healthy.
It seems counterintuitive,

2605
02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:03.940
but male bears will eat way more cubs than any hunters ever going to kill like

2606
02:29:04.251 --> 02:29:06.710
male bears when they're,
when they come out of hibernation,

2607
02:29:06.711 --> 02:29:10.010
especially in the spring when the first things they do is go look for cubs to

2608
02:29:10.011 --> 02:29:10.844
eat.

2609
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:16.750
And this is something that biologists are just the easy prey and they don't know

2610
02:29:17.211 --> 02:29:20.090
if they're doing it.
They just guess why they're doing it.

2611
02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:24.170
They don't know if they're doing it just for food or if they're doing it because

2612
02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:26.240
they want to bring the female to estrous quicker.

2613
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:31.640
So it could be both or it could be the side effect of them doing it for food is

2614
02:29:31.641 --> 02:29:34.790
the female comes into estrous quicker.
But,
uh,
when I was,

2615
02:29:34.850 --> 02:29:36.230
I was bear hunting in Alberta,

2616
02:29:36.231 --> 02:29:41.231
we got to watch a male try to get this female's cubs and the female fought in

2617
02:29:41.691 --> 02:29:45.440
the mail mail off and we're like 30,
40 yards away from this.

2618
02:29:45.441 --> 02:29:50.330
It was fucking crazy.
But where you compensating where,
yeah,
I kind of was.

2619
02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:53.330
I kind of what it was,
but my mouth was wide.

2620
02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:57.670
It goes from a called Mount on the pier.
They were standing up to it

2621
02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:04.010
like attacking,
he doesn't relate to that was pretty good.

2622
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:05.600
I was there.
That would,
it was actually saw it,

2623
02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:09.110
but it's kind of fucked when you see it.
Like the guys,
while we were in camp,

2624
02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:10.960
one of the guys witnessed a,

2625
02:30:10.970 --> 02:30:15.620
a male kill one of the cubs and then,
uh,
he ate half of it.

2626
02:30:15.621 --> 02:30:19.340
And then the female came over and chased him away eventually and then she ate

2627
02:30:19.341 --> 02:30:23.480
the rest of her own cub.
It's hard out there for a pimp.

2628
02:30:24.460 --> 02:30:29.450
Hard hunting.
Yeah.
And none of those three look like a good target or not.
Well,

2629
02:30:29.451 --> 02:30:32.090
the mail and wanted to hike up the mountain.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2630
02:30:32.091 --> 02:30:33.470
The mail was a good target,

2631
02:30:33.471 --> 02:30:37.130
but he wouldn't sit still and he was too far away and he was in between trees

2632
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:40.220
and when he came up to the female,
the female took her.
We wouldn't,

2633
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:43.340
we wouldn't kill a female and we definitely wouldn't kill a female with cubs.

2634
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:47.890
And when the mail came over like he was,
it was like,
it was so quick.

2635
02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:52.900
It was also getting dark where you was totally on that borderline where you're

2636
02:30:53.331 --> 02:30:56.210
not really sure.
You could see exactly where you're shooting.

2637
02:30:56.211 --> 02:31:00.870
Especially with a bow and arrow.
Oh,
it was Bo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're archery.

2638
02:31:00.920 --> 02:31:05.030
Many times you have to shoot a bear with a boat I shot at once cause I shot it.

2639
02:31:05.031 --> 02:31:07.940
Right.
If you shoot it runs you,
you go through the double lungs,

2640
02:31:08.390 --> 02:31:10.250
you know with these,
these bows,

2641
02:31:10.430 --> 02:31:15.430
the power of these Bose is insane and the real like a Hoyt compound bow 80 pound

2642
02:31:16.491 --> 02:31:17.150
poll,

2643
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:22.150
you're talking like 288 feet per second of 468 green arrows flying with razor

2644
02:31:24.211 --> 02:31:28.980
sharp broadheads blows right through the body.
I mean,
oh yeah,

2645
02:31:28.981 --> 02:31:31.320
these are,
this is in fucking New Jersey Dude.

2646
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:34.650
New Jersey has such a bear population problem.

2647
02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:39.800
New Jersey has the largest population of bears per capita in North America.

2648
02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:45.380
Big Ass fucking black bears and they're fighting over who controls the garbage.

2649
02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:48.060
Like the territory where the garbage is.

2650
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:50.730
These fucking bears are biting each other in the face,

2651
02:31:50.731 --> 02:31:53.070
in front of people's cars and the big,

2652
02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:57.000
I mean these are several hundred pounds he's fucking bears is that you go

2653
02:31:57.001 --> 02:31:57.661
earlier than that.

2654
02:31:57.661 --> 02:32:00.870
You get to see them knock over the garbage cans when they first,
yeah,
up there,

2655
02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:04.290
up there,
back,
back up a little bit.
And they first start duking it out.

2656
02:32:05.010 --> 02:32:08.700
Like one bear is controlling.
Well this is this guy's fucking front lawn man.

2657
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:11.910
Is this,
his mailbox is getting knocked over by these bears.

2658
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:15.930
My brother lives in Longwood,
Florida,
and that's like a gated community.

2659
02:32:15.931 --> 02:32:17.490
It's like a really nice area.

2660
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:21.240
And every night there's giant bears knocking over the trash cans in the
backyard.

2661
02:32:21.470 --> 02:32:25.830
Yeah.
And uh,
I guess the city,
like they won't do anything about it.
Well,

2662
02:32:25.831 --> 02:32:28.410
they didn't want to open up a bear hunting season in Florida,

2663
02:32:28.411 --> 02:32:31.770
but they're starting to do it and yeah,
in New Jersey they have a real issue.

2664
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:33.210
A fucking kid got killed.

2665
02:32:33.211 --> 02:32:38.211
A Rutgers student got killed in New Jersey by somebody in my brother's

2666
02:32:38.581 --> 02:32:41.310
neighborhood got mauled.
Some lady got mom.
Yeah,
Dude.

2667
02:32:41.311 --> 02:32:43.830
And then he got these idiots that are like fucking leaving food out for the

2668
02:32:43.831 --> 02:32:45.690
bears.
Oh yeah.
It keeps them coming.
Yeah.

2669
02:32:46.030 --> 02:32:48.360
That's another thing about bears is not like a deer.

2670
02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.830
If you leave food out for a deer,

2671
02:32:49.831 --> 02:32:53.220
it'll eat that food and then go find food other places you leave food out for a

2672
02:32:53.221 --> 02:32:56.280
bear.
He knows that's where the food is.
Keep coming back.

2673
02:32:56.610 --> 02:32:59.220
So they have real problems.
When a bear like this,

2674
02:32:59.221 --> 02:33:02.020
when a bear gets ahold of your garbage,
like these bears there,

2675
02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:06.220
they're going to war right here because they've found a spot where the garbages

2676
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:10.110
so look at these fucking guys.
Just Duke.
These are huge bears man.

2677
02:33:10.111 --> 02:33:13.140
Cause I keep telling him like,
hey,
shoot the fucking bear.
Yeah,

2678
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:16.020
he's got like two giant English master's.

2679
02:33:16.021 --> 02:33:20.400
I'm like shoot the bear feeding them the bear meat.
Yeah,
this is good.
He's like,

2680
02:33:20.401 --> 02:33:23.390
oh,
what if I shoot it?
It doesn't fucking die.
It doesn't.
You know

2681
02:33:24.930 --> 02:33:28.530
how many shots?
One,
you just go right to the lungs.
Lungs,
Kevin,
listen,

2682
02:33:28.531 --> 02:33:30.460
Joe Rogan's giving me advice here.
Double lunch.

2683
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:33.390
They'll wait till it turns sideways.
You get a broadside shot,

2684
02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:38.400
you shoot right behind the arms like right where the armpit is right there.
Boom.

2685
02:33:38.430 --> 02:33:41.390
Goes right through.
Especially with a bow and arrow.
It'll,

2686
02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:44.700
it'll penetrate through both lungs and it will be dead in seconds.

2687
02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:48.510
You're talking like 10 feet away.
15 feet.
It's in the yard.
Yeah.

2688
02:33:48.511 --> 02:33:51.780
They're not scared.
They're not scared of people at all.
He said,

2689
02:33:51.781 --> 02:33:54.020
if he's afraid of is what if he,
you know,

2690
02:33:54.021 --> 02:33:57.870
it hurts us and hit a hurts if it doesn't kill it and think of charges him death

2691
02:33:57.871 --> 02:34:02.060
possible.
I'm like,
you got five more shots.
Three 57 well,
he's unique.

2692
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:06.900
Use a pistol.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would use a rifle rifle.

2693
02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:09.450
If he's going to shoot a gun,
get a real,
you know,

2694
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:12.260
get a seven millimeter Remington,
ultra Max,
something like that,

2695
02:34:12.261 --> 02:34:15.350
and just blow one through him where he's in that gun up 12 get slugs.

2696
02:34:15.351 --> 02:34:18.550
I'm going to handle it.
You could,
yeah,
you could go the slug cup.

2697
02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:22.900
I'm a fan of rifles.
It's just,
yeah,
it's super accurate.

2698
02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:23.830
Very precise.

2699
02:34:23.831 --> 02:34:28.210
I want him to miss and shoot the neighbor's house and dog and that's a good

2700
02:34:28.211 --> 02:34:31.780
point.
Yeah,
and he wears you left Florida.
Can You suppressors in Florida?

2701
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:35.580
Can you silencers?
Oh,
there's a problem in California.
You can't,
you silent.

2702
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:39.700
There's,
which is really,
does that work?
I saw on the Steven Seagal movie,

2703
02:34:39.701 --> 02:34:42.250
He like taped a 20 ounce bottle to the end of it.

2704
02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:44.650
I think it's like under siege without work.

2705
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:48.310
Everything in Steven Seagal movies are all actual and factual.

2706
02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:50.200
That's the only thing he allows.

2707
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:54.420
He doesn't allow anything in a movie unless it's absolutely correct,
really.

2708
02:34:57.070 --> 02:35:00.890
I'm sure he doesn't want serious.
The 20 a two liter bottle of coke or something.

2709
02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:04.060
I mean,
I'm sure it doesn't silence it,
but am I like probably takes a little bit.

2710
02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:05.170
I'll come in it a little bit off of it.

2711
02:35:05.470 --> 02:35:08.560
It's kind of where I was talking to this guy from Sig Sauer yesterday about
this.

2712
02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:13.700
Oh,
they tried it.
Let's hear it.
Let's see.
Thought I made that up to me.

2713
02:35:22.210 --> 02:35:24.320
<v 6>Steven Seagal silence 45</v>

2714
02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:27.640
<v 2>that's going to shoot this dude right in the face.</v>

2715
02:35:27.650 --> 02:35:31.760
You know he's going to die here.
This doesn't work.
I'm sending it to Jack.

2716
02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:34.250
You going to shoot it at the bottom?
At the grounds,
dummy.

2717
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:35.783
<v 6>Okay,
here it goes.</v>

2718
02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:42.780
<v 2>No.
Yeah.
It wasn't very quiet.
Didn't work at all.</v>

2719
02:35:43.850 --> 02:35:47.800
I had to make a suppressor from a flashlight.
Does that real?

2720
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:54.660
Let's see.
Let's see how it works.
Well,
this pull it ahead.
Oh,

2721
02:35:54.661 --> 02:35:57.300
this guy's like going deep.
He's building shit.

2722
02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:03.000
But it's weird because in California silencers are illegal.
I don't know why.

2723
02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:05.430
Because if you can hunt and you can hunt with a rifle,

2724
02:36:05.431 --> 02:36:08.640
what a silencer does is it eliminates the sound it,

2725
02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.060
I mean it doesn't eliminate it totally,
but that big boom,

2726
02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:16.710
do you want the boom?
Like why?
It doesn't make any sense.

2727
02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:19.650
It's like it's one of those weird things where people aren't,

2728
02:36:19.710 --> 02:36:23.400
they're not thinking logically and objectively when they create laws,

2729
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:26.580
like they think that someone's gonna like snipe people and you're not going to

2730
02:36:26.581 --> 02:36:28.500
hear it and someone's going to die and get shot.

2731
02:36:29.130 --> 02:36:33.660
But the reality is if somebody shoots you like it doesn't matter if there was a

2732
02:36:33.661 --> 02:36:36.930
bang or not,
it's the rifle still works.

2733
02:36:38.010 --> 02:36:39.630
You have to have a silencer on your muffler.

2734
02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.980
You have to have a silencer on lawn equipment and lawn mowers.

2735
02:36:43.981 --> 02:36:47.940
Anything the have to use some sort of a muffler,
but not on rifles.

2736
02:36:47.941 --> 02:36:51.870
You can't have it on rifles.
Yeah,
I don't get it.

2737
02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:57.540
I get most of it.
You shouldn't get most of it.
Most of it doesn't make sense.

2738
02:36:59.130 --> 02:37:03.150
Not a huge fan of the police force nowadays,
Joe.
It's getting ugly out there,

2739
02:37:03.151 --> 02:37:07.980
isn't it?
It's so bad.
It's so just,
just bad.
You know,

2740
02:37:07.981 --> 02:37:11.100
I think part of it is,
um,
I think it's just numbers.

2741
02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:16.460
You're also dealing with 350 million people in this country who knows how many

2742
02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:20.180
thousands and thousands of police officers who knows how many incidents they

2743
02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:21.014
have to deal with.

2744
02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:23.630
Who knows how many people are in competent and the ones that are in competent,

2745
02:37:23.631 --> 02:37:28.050
they get highlighted,
videotaped,
put out there.
And I also think that there's a,

2746
02:37:28.051 --> 02:37:31.580
a culture that day have a developed a,

2747
02:37:31.581 --> 02:37:34.730
of doing shit in a fucked up way that people don't like,

2748
02:37:34.731 --> 02:37:36.770
that they got away with for a long time.

2749
02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:40.910
And then cell phones and cameras and youtube came along and now everybody's

2750
02:37:40.911 --> 02:37:43.670
super aware of it and you just can't do it anymore.

2751
02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:46.850
You just can't do what they've been doing their whole career,
I think,
I mean,

2752
02:37:46.851 --> 02:37:50.810
there are,
obviously there are racial issues or whatever,

2753
02:37:50.811 --> 02:37:52.760
but I just think that those get highlighted even more.

2754
02:37:52.761 --> 02:37:57.380
But I see just fucking asshole cops do an asshole things to every color person.

2755
02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:00.050
And it's just that lately it's been highlighted,

2756
02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.520
but it's like if no one's fucking shooting at you,
stop shooting people,
you know,

2757
02:38:04.521 --> 02:38:04.910
when,

2758
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:09.230
when did they become such pussies that like there was a video of a guy walking

2759
02:38:09.231 --> 02:38:11.570
out of his house with a screwdriver and like he was literally walking,

2760
02:38:11.571 --> 02:38:13.490
it was like with his wife is like 50 year old man.

2761
02:38:13.530 --> 02:38:15.920
He's walking out with a screwdriver in his hand like this.

2762
02:38:15.921 --> 02:38:19.370
Like he was walking to the mailbox to fix something and the cops like shout at

2763
02:38:19.371 --> 02:38:22.580
him like nine times and then didn't,
uh,

2764
02:38:23.390 --> 02:38:26.390
didn't like try to help him or anything.
Like,
you know,

2765
02:38:26.450 --> 02:38:28.940
when were they responding to it?
What did they think he was,
he was,

2766
02:38:28.970 --> 02:38:31.520
he was domestic violence or something.
I don't even know what it was,

2767
02:38:31.521 --> 02:38:32.354
but it was like the,

2768
02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:36.470
the older woman get walks out and then the husband walks up right behind him and

2769
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:40.460
they were that,
he was like,
oh,
drop it,
blah,
blah blah.
And the guy's like,
what?

2770
02:38:40.461 --> 02:38:44.000
And then a little and they shot him like nine times and then they don't even go

2771
02:38:44.001 --> 02:38:45.260
up to like help the guy.
You know?

2772
02:38:45.261 --> 02:38:50.261
It's like I find almost like these guys are just looking for that opportunity

2773
02:38:50.901 --> 02:38:53.720
for when it's okay.
Then more so like when it's necessary.

2774
02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:55.110
You know there's a lot of them do that.

2775
02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:57.770
There's a lot of them that are just too stupid to be cops.
Yeah,
sure.

2776
02:38:58.300 --> 02:39:01.130
But I think most people are unqualified to be cops.

2777
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:03.650
We've talked about this ad nauseum on this podcast.

2778
02:39:03.651 --> 02:39:07.700
I just think that we have to appreciate the fact that being a cop is a fucking

2779
02:39:07.701 --> 02:39:11.450
ridiculously hard job.
You want to talk about PTSD for soldiers,

2780
02:39:11.451 --> 02:39:13.550
but nobody talks about PTSD for cops.

2781
02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:17.240
Cops are dealing with horrible shit every fucking day of the week and most of

2782
02:39:17.241 --> 02:39:19.640
them are doing a great job and the ones that do a great job,

2783
02:39:19.641 --> 02:39:22.970
you don't hear anything about,
it's the ones that fuck up and shoot.

2784
02:39:22.971 --> 02:39:25.240
Like that guy in South Carolina that shot,
that guy was,

2785
02:39:25.250 --> 02:39:28.770
he was running away and then planted the gun.
Did he plan a gun?

2786
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:31.940
Landed the Taser or something that you watch and he walks up and he said

2787
02:39:31.941 --> 02:39:34.850
something else on the floor.
Oh really?
Then the story was,
oh,

2788
02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:39.770
he went away for my Taser and it was like [inaudible] my God.
They did that.

2789
02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:43.640
But of course that gets spun into the Black Guy.
That was a fucking,

2790
02:39:43.641 --> 02:39:46.550
it didn't matter who that was.
He was going to do that same shit too.
You know,

2791
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:50.210
evil guy goes to the issues are and then runs away.
You don't get to shoot them.

2792
02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:52.970
You know what?
I'm going to shoot him as he's running away and then I'd hold,

2793
02:39:52.971 --> 02:39:55.610
gets a shoot him while he's only going to away and then run up and put the Taser

2794
02:39:55.611 --> 02:39:58.310
down next to him.
I didn't know.
I know that.
That's awful.

2795
02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:03.110
I didn't know that he did that.
Oh God.
I just think of there.
There are good cops,

2796
02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:05.510
you know?
But it's like if you're a good cop,

2797
02:40:05.511 --> 02:40:08.120
how many bad cops have you knocked out because you know,

2798
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:11.270
you know how many other ones are in the station.
You know what I mean?
Like,

2799
02:40:11.290 --> 02:40:14.100
there's just this,
uh,
you

2800
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.470
<v 1>know,
this like brotherhood of,
you know,</v>

2801
02:40:16.471 --> 02:40:19.030
I'm going to stand up for our own and you know,
that,

2802
02:40:19.170 --> 02:40:21.470
that's what bugs me about it.
It's always been that way.

2803
02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:25.590
My Dad was just really upsetting and disgusting and have kids and to have see

2804
02:40:25.591 --> 02:40:27.480
all this shit right now,
it's just really scary.

2805
02:40:27.550 --> 02:40:31.350
It's just worried about your son having some asshole cop to something.
Yeah,

2806
02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:36.270
I mean,
Mike,
my,
uh,
my,
my wife,
my fiance,
I'm sorry,

2807
02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:40.230
bad.
She had set a really bad,
um,
she's,
uh,

2808
02:40:40.290 --> 02:40:41.550
she's mixed and like our,

2809
02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.480
we have two boys and one of them looks white and the other one looks mixed.

2810
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:49.980
I'm black,
you know?
And uh,
yeah,
this racial shit and ignorance is a,

2811
02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:51.180
it's upsetting.
Scary.

2812
02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:53.200
<v 0>It should be.
It is.</v>

2813
02:40:53.250 --> 02:40:58.250
And I'm hoping that all this anger and all these protests and all these videos

2814
02:40:58.331 --> 02:41:00.280
that are coming out and all this,
this,

2815
02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:04.810
these youtube videos and all these people that are rising up that's going to

2816
02:41:04.811 --> 02:41:06.460
change things,
I hope.

2817
02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:09.510
<v 1>Yeah.
But just seems like Marshall loves coming in like that.</v>

2818
02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:14.350
There was something about,
you know,
it's like they're the,
somebody uh,

2819
02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.050
said something about they're allowing the,

2820
02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:20.050
the conditions to eventually go to martial our law.

2821
02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:22.240
<v 0>Yeah.
People say with the way that,</v>

2822
02:41:22.250 --> 02:41:25.710
that mass media is like highlighting everything,
it just makes it so much worse.

2823
02:41:25.770 --> 02:41:26.603
I just all bad.

2824
02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:28.680
I think they're highlighting him because that's what people want to pay

2825
02:41:28.681 --> 02:41:29.570
attention to.
Man.

2826
02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:32.430
I really don't think there's any concerted effort to create martial law.

2827
02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:34.410
There's a lot of conspiracy theories about that stuff,

2828
02:41:34.411 --> 02:41:35.670
but I think that's just horse shit.

2829
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:41.150
I think the last thing they want is an armed culture of Americans involved in

2830
02:41:41.551 --> 02:41:46.260
arm martial law.
It's just like,
it's,
it's not going to work.

2831
02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:48.770
This is not the country.
We could pull that off.
Just not,

2832
02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:52.590
you can't take everybody's guns away.
It will fucking never happened.
Yeah.

2833
02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:55.410
There's more guns in this country than there are people.

2834
02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:58.750
It's just not going to happen.
You're just not going to take away their,

2835
02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:01.290
I don't know if there's more guns than people,
but I bet he's close.

2836
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.330
He's just not going to happen.

2837
02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:07.470
I just think that people panic about that kind of stuff and people always love

2838
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:11.220
talking about some Thai ironical conspiracy with the government comes in.

2839
02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:12.780
And even when you try not to,

2840
02:42:12.781 --> 02:42:15.420
it's like someone say something and it's hard not to.

2841
02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:19.140
Did you grow up in a family with guns?
He had guns,
your family all the time.

2842
02:42:19.141 --> 02:42:23.090
Grew up hunting it.
We started hunting and shooting at like 10,
12.
Yeah,

2843
02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:27.060
I think I went rabbit hunting when I was 12 of shootings since I was like,

2844
02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:29.880
your dad was into it.
My Dad was into it.
My brother and I,

2845
02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:32.880
we didn't talk about this the last time and there's was something that was

2846
02:42:32.881 --> 02:42:36.930
controversial after our podcast because during the manhood training camp,

2847
02:42:36.931 --> 02:42:38.190
your dad died.
Right.

2848
02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:41.760
<v 1>How hard was that man to go through?</v>

2849
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:45.390
My Dad and I had like a weird relationship with my dad and I had like a falling

2850
02:42:45.391 --> 02:42:48.990
out probably,
uh,
10 or 12 years ago.

2851
02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.670
I hadn't spoken 10 years.
And uh,
uh,

2852
02:42:52.890 --> 02:42:55.510
he came to one of my fights,
uh,

2853
02:42:55.650 --> 02:42:58.810
when I've won a glory 10 with arts and Lebanon.
And,
uh,

2854
02:42:59.150 --> 02:43:01.560
it was one of the biggest things that Vinny helped me work on it.

2855
02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:05.580
I found out my dad had cancer and like my reaction when my brother and sister

2856
02:43:05.581 --> 02:43:08.730
told me it was like fucking like,
I don't care.
Like I really didn't care.

2857
02:43:08.731 --> 02:43:13.460
He didn't that much that uh,
have
wow did a,

2858
02:43:13.461 --> 02:43:17.460
I was just like,
he didn't like,
we had like a really bad issues.
And,
uh,

2859
02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.040
uh,
when I started talking to Vinny,
you know,
I mentioned yeah.

2860
02:43:21.041 --> 02:43:24.180
And my dad had cancer and I didn't know how I felt about it because part of me

2861
02:43:24.181 --> 02:43:28.890
like carried,
you know,
at some point.
And uh,
Vinny did some like a,

2862
02:43:28.891 --> 02:43:31.350
he called it timeline therapy and we had the,
uh,

2863
02:43:31.950 --> 02:43:35.340
this is not at all was point on talking about,
but,
um,
we,
uh,

2864
02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:38.070
he asked me all of these scenarios like,

2865
02:43:38.071 --> 02:43:41.130
think of a time in your life when you were really proud and then think of a time

2866
02:43:41.131 --> 02:43:44.190
when you were really upset and like all these different emotions and he didn't

2867
02:43:44.191 --> 02:43:46.410
know what he was,
what it was about or what was gonna happen.

2868
02:43:46.411 --> 02:43:47.290
He was just trying it on me.

2869
02:43:47.310 --> 02:43:49.680
And every one of the things that he talked about was my dad.

2870
02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:53.790
Like every one of those times was a time with my dad.
And,
uh,

2871
02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:57.600
he did like the,
you know,
the whole session or whatever.

2872
02:43:57.870 --> 02:44:01.470
At the end of it I just had no more resentment or anger towards my dad and it

2873
02:44:01.471 --> 02:44:06.240
was really weird.
And,
uh,
it was like this chip on my shoulder,
like my whole life.

2874
02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:10.350
And,
uh,
at one point for a long time,
uh,

2875
02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:12.270
I used to think about my dad before I would fight,

2876
02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:14.490
when I was fighting professionally,
like I would use,

2877
02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:17.760
not necessarily like I'm fighting my dad but like to shove it up his ass,
like,

2878
02:44:17.761 --> 02:44:22.320
look what I'm going to do,
you know?
And,
uh,
I realized that like,

2879
02:44:22.321 --> 02:44:26.490
that anger that I had and that I used to tap into all the time was actually like

2880
02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:31.410
holding me back.
It was almost like a handicap.
And uh,
yeah,
when I,

2881
02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:36.810
when he helped me forgive my dad,
I was able to,
uh,
go to Florida.

2882
02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:40.060
As you know,
he's got stage four cancer,
he's going to die.
And,
uh,

2883
02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:43.170
I had a relationship with my dad for the last year before he died,

2884
02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:48.360
that I hadn't had in 10 years.
And that was from that Vinnie helped me do that.

2885
02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:54.380
That's got to have a big impact on the way you raise your own sons.

2886
02:44:54.841 --> 02:44:55.710
Yeah,
for sure.

2887
02:44:56.470 --> 02:44:59.590
Knowing the resentment that you had towards your father and the anger and the,

2888
02:44:59.591 --> 02:45:04.440
the bad relationship,
like never wanting it to get to that place.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2889
02:45:04.441 --> 02:45:09.420
It was,
it was weird.
It was a,
you know,
Vinny didn't know that he was,

2890
02:45:09.690 --> 02:45:12.210
that that was even going to be the result.
He was just like,
oh,

2891
02:45:12.211 --> 02:45:15.270
I want to try this timeline therapy thing on you.
And uh,
yeah,

2892
02:45:15.271 --> 02:45:19.080
I went from like completely hating him to like just forgiving him completely.

2893
02:45:19.081 --> 02:45:22.770
Not like half ass for giving him to like waiting for that apology.

2894
02:45:22.771 --> 02:45:24.960
Like there was no apology.
There was no talking about it.

2895
02:45:24.961 --> 02:45:29.130
It was like completely starting over and uh,
yeah,
we had like a really good,

2896
02:45:30.330 --> 02:45:30.910
<v 7>yeah,</v>

2897
02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:34.780
<v 1>a relationship for that last year before he died.
And,
um,
I knew that he was,</v>

2898
02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:39.850
he was battling cancer.
My brother started treating him,
he was stage four.
I mean,

2899
02:45:39.851 --> 02:45:42.160
it was the doctor's like,
you know,
as your dad's going to die,

2900
02:45:42.161 --> 02:45:46.230
he had cancer and as long as cancer in his brain cancer in his chest as she

2901
02:45:46.231 --> 02:45:50.380
cancer in his neck,
he had like this giant mass.
I was neck.
And,
uh,

2902
02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:53.830
my brother started treating him with CBD oil and,
uh,

2903
02:45:54.730 --> 02:45:58.240
allegedly I was shipping it to him from here and to Florida or whatever.

2904
02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:00.640
But that was probably wasn't very good.
It allegedly,

2905
02:46:00.641 --> 02:46:05.230
allegedly there was fiction for fishing or friction informational purposes.
Um,

2906
02:46:05.290 --> 02:46:09.410
and we,
uh,
we're giving them CBD oil for about,
I don't,
no,

2907
02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:12.890
I guess seven months probably.
And uh,

2908
02:46:14.270 --> 02:46:18.260
after,
um,
he wasn't going to chemo,
he just didn't want to do it.

2909
02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:23.090
He was like really stubborn.
I'm stubborn.
Guy wouldn't do that.
And uh,
they,

2910
02:46:23.091 --> 02:46:25.040
uh,
they tested him.

2911
02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:29.280
They did like a graph or whatever to see where the cancer had grown or whatever

2912
02:46:29.281 --> 02:46:33.650
over a period of time.
And they were shocked that 90% of the cancer had died.

2913
02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:37.520
That there was 90% of the cancer was dead.

2914
02:46:37.521 --> 02:46:41.090
And 10% of the cancer that was still alive was like completely surrounded in

2915
02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:44.810
dead cells so that they couldn't get even medicine to it and it couldn't grow.

2916
02:46:44.811 --> 02:46:47.490
And you know,
it was just gonna he was gonna have to live with it,
you know,

2917
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:50.780
but it was completely surrounded by dead cancer cells.

2918
02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:54.980
And the only thing possibly that could have done it was the CBD oil because he

2919
02:46:54.981 --> 02:46:58.820
was doing nothing else correctly.
He was like,
um,
you know,

2920
02:46:58.821 --> 02:47:01.910
they had them on so many narcotics and pain pills and stuff that he was,

2921
02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:05.320
he's a asshole to be around was really hard.

2922
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:09.710
It was like constantly on like this drug thing.
Um,
and he wouldn't eat,

2923
02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:12.470
he only wanted to eat was like chocolate cake and ice cream,
you know,

2924
02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:17.050
like wouldn't,
it was like really hard for cancer.
We're like,
uh,
you know,

2925
02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:21.110
try and get them the right supplements in.
And,
you know,
it was a,

2926
02:47:21.111 --> 02:47:24.100
it was a tough situation,
but the,
uh,
the CBD oil was,

2927
02:47:24.130 --> 02:47:26.240
was beating the cancer and the cancer wasn't what killed him.

2928
02:47:26.241 --> 02:47:31.241
He actually died from like starvation or malnourishment from not doing what we

2929
02:47:32.031 --> 02:47:36.290
would beg him to do.
You know,
really well.
90% of the cancer was dead.

2930
02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:38.330
Cbd Oil people.
It really works.

2931
02:47:38.430 --> 02:47:40.260
<v 0>It's working right now from my friend's mom.</v>

2932
02:47:40.261 --> 02:47:43.280
My friend's mom has stage four cancer and her brain,
uh,

2933
02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:47.920
I allegedly got them some CBD oil and uh,
he,
uh,

2934
02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.930
he um,
got it to his mom,
uh,

2935
02:47:50.970 --> 02:47:53.610
within less than two months,

2936
02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:58.880
her cancer had shrunk by 30% that she had been doing chemo and they were saying

2937
02:47:59.281 --> 02:48:01.530
that her immune system was so devastated by the chemo.

2938
02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:04.440
The Chemo was probably going to kill her quicker than the cancer was.

2939
02:48:04.441 --> 02:48:08.130
And they had recommended her stopping chemo and he was just in full desperation

2940
02:48:08.131 --> 02:48:12.300
mode.
My friends,
real,
super straight edge.
He just,
he's just,
you know,

2941
02:48:12.420 --> 02:48:16.080
Mr Republican American doesn't,
you know,
thinks Obama's a Muslim,

2942
02:48:16.081 --> 02:48:20.790
that Kinda guy and never would want to have anything to do with a CBD oil or

2943
02:48:20.791 --> 02:48:25.020
anything.
Cannabis.
I got it to him and now his mom can sleep.

2944
02:48:25.050 --> 02:48:27.360
She's eating,
she sleeps at night.

2945
02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:31.020
She doesn't have pain anymore or tumor shrinking.
The doctors are astounded.

2946
02:48:31.290 --> 02:48:32.940
Those stories,
you hear so many of them,

2947
02:48:32.941 --> 02:48:37.610
it's almost like they seem like anecdotal fairy tales because until it's,

2948
02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:40.920
it happened to someone you actually know and care about and then you go and then

2949
02:48:40.921 --> 02:48:41.910
you start getting angry.

2950
02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:46.950
Like this is what these Goddamn assholes that are making laws in this country

2951
02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:47.930
and fighting against us,

2952
02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:51.450
the lobbyists and the people that are working for the pharmaceutical companies

2953
02:48:51.451 --> 02:48:53.730
that are actively trying to suppress this information.

2954
02:48:53.731 --> 02:48:57.750
You are keeping one of the best ways to,
to heal these people.

2955
02:48:57.870 --> 02:49:00.780
You're keeping it illegal and it's,
it's a fucking horrible crime

2956
02:49:01.390 --> 02:49:03.480
<v 1>and tell you about it,
which is just atrocious.
They,</v>

2957
02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:06.270
my dad is there giving my brother the talk that my dad is,

2958
02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:11.370
is going to die and it's,
it's terminal and you know,
all this stuff for,

2959
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:14.070
you know,
weeks and weeks and weeks.
He's going to the doctor.

2960
02:49:14.071 --> 02:49:17.520
And finally my brother's like,
hey,
so you know,
what about,
you know,

2961
02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:20.610
medical marijuana,
is that something that,
and they were like,
oh yeah,

2962
02:49:20.611 --> 02:49:23.700
we can prescribe him Marinol,
but we just can't,
you know,

2963
02:49:23.701 --> 02:49:27.940
there's no question that the cannabis or Thc,
whatever it is,
uh,

2964
02:49:28.020 --> 02:49:32.160
cannabis helps fight cancer,
but we can't,
we can't refer,
you have to ask.

2965
02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:35.260
We can't just offer it to you.
And then they gave him that the,
uh,

2966
02:49:35.490 --> 02:49:36.720
prescription for Marinol,

2967
02:49:36.721 --> 02:49:41.580
which is like the government pharmaceutical form of the pill,

2968
02:49:41.581 --> 02:49:45.040
which is probably way weaker than the very old,
and we were giving him,
yeah,

2969
02:49:45.610 --> 02:49:48.810
not nearly as good.
So yeah,
like we got the call,

2970
02:49:48.811 --> 02:49:52.400
I got the call from my dad or my brother that my dad had passed away.
Um,

2971
02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:56.180
I think it was three weeks before the,
uh,
the Melvin man off fight.

2972
02:49:56.740 --> 02:50:00.210
And I flew home to,
um,
to Florida to,
you know,

2973
02:50:00.211 --> 02:50:03.780
kind of with my brother and sister and figure out the situation where we were

2974
02:50:03.781 --> 02:50:07.230
gonna do.
And my brother picked me up from the airport and we went to,
you know,

2975
02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:11.520
straight to the bar to a,
you know,
have it out about my dad.
And,
um,

2976
02:50:12.090 --> 02:50:16.590
when we got back to his house,
my uncle had calls and,
you know,

2977
02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:20.560
we just assumed that my uncle was calling to,
you know,
give us,
you know,
sorry to,

2978
02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:21.480
sorry about your dad.

2979
02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:26.760
And my sister answered the phone and my uncle was hysterical.
And,
uh,

2980
02:50:26.761 --> 02:50:31.740
I guess my cousin Cody,
who was 23,
I was very close with his huge fan of mine,
um,

2981
02:50:32.250 --> 02:50:36.510
had fallen off a balcony on their vacation and died the same night.
And,
uh,

2982
02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:40.550
so it was,
it was a ton of stuff to deal with that last,
you know,

2983
02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:44.940
two weeks before my fight.
And,
um,
again,
I talked to Vinny and,
uh,

2984
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:48.070
you know,
he helped me stay focused on what it needs to do,

2985
02:50:48.071 --> 02:50:51.280
do to handle business in that fight.
And,
uh,
you know,

2986
02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:53.730
Vinny foreman can't think of enough of that stuff.

2987
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:58.140
That's gotta be unbelievably difficult to do.
Both of those things.

2988
02:50:58.141 --> 02:51:02.190
Unbelievably difficult to deal with while you're trying to focus on,

2989
02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:05.610
especially finding guy like manholes,
very fuck,
you know,
every,

2990
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:09.530
every post anybody tags you in is like,
and Man House highlight reel,
you know,

2991
02:51:09.540 --> 02:51:14.370
so it's like fuck,
it was tough,
you know,
and it just drains.
You haven't,

2992
02:51:14.450 --> 02:51:17.580
I tried to,
I come back and I got two weeks left for the fight and I'm trying to,

2993
02:51:17.640 --> 02:51:20.940
you know,
try to stay focused and uh,
you know,

2994
02:51:20.941 --> 02:51:24.570
I can run it at a good clip and,
you know,
I run six miles,
you know,

2995
02:51:24.571 --> 02:51:25.650
regularly and like,

2996
02:51:25.651 --> 02:51:29.160
I'd be like half a mile in and just be exhausted because all of this mental

2997
02:51:29.161 --> 02:51:32.010
stuff just wears on you.
And,
uh,
you know,

2998
02:51:32.011 --> 02:51:34.020
I had this internal battle with myself of,
you know,

2999
02:51:34.021 --> 02:51:35.970
should I pull out of the fight and not pull out of the fight.

3000
02:51:35.971 --> 02:51:39.540
And I talked to Vinny and I was like,
you know,
I just,
I don't know what to do.

3001
02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:44.190
And,
uh,
he was like,
he's just a dick actually.
He was like,
uh,

3002
02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:49.150
he was like,
your dad and your cousin died.
And I was like,
yes.
And he's like,

3003
02:51:49.290 --> 02:51:54.060
and that,
that's sad.
And I'm like,
yes.
And he's like,
and,
uh,

3004
02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:56.700
you never gonna see them again?
And I'm like,
yeah man,
I'm never see him again.

3005
02:51:56.701 --> 02:52:01.340
He's like,
and that's not fair.
And I was like,
yeah,
mother Fucker is not fair,

3006
02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:04.410
you know?
And he's like,
uh,
you know,
he says all this shit.
And then he's like,

3007
02:52:04.411 --> 02:52:06.860
now what?
And I was like,
what do you mean?
And he's like,

3008
02:52:06.861 --> 02:52:07.694
what are you going to do now?

3009
02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:08.760
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

3010
02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:09.720
<v 1>And I was like,
he's like,</v>

3011
02:52:09.721 --> 02:52:12.640
are you going to not ever fight again and you gotta not to carry your family,

3012
02:52:12.750 --> 02:52:15.660
you're going to let this stop you from everything you've ever wanted to do.

3013
02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:17.810
And I'm just like,
no.
And he's like pulling in,

3014
02:52:17.970 --> 02:52:22.470
turn off that APP and wait until after your fight handle your business,
you know,

3015
02:52:22.471 --> 02:52:25.500
whether you're religious or not at some level somewhere you think your,

3016
02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:28.440
your cousin and your father,
what would they want?
And it's like,
well,

3017
02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:31.140
I talked to both of them about the fight.
They were both excited about the fight.

3018
02:52:31.141 --> 02:52:32.160
I knew what they were going to want,

3019
02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:35.700
so I just kind of turned off that emotion until after the fight.

3020
02:52:35.701 --> 02:52:40.360
And when I knocked out Melvin,
there's like this,
this,

3021
02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:41.670
this moment right after,
like,

3022
02:52:41.671 --> 02:52:45.440
the referee stops it at like fucking explode and there's like good bell tours

3023
02:52:45.450 --> 02:52:46.620
post the picture all the time.

3024
02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:50.190
But like at that moment was like all of that emotion that I had turned off,

3025
02:52:50.191 --> 02:52:52.950
like came back right at that moment.
And uh,
you know,

3026
02:52:53.010 --> 02:52:56.340
after the fight I was thinking about them and stuff and it was really cool.

3027
02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:59.920
<v 6>Wow.
Wow.
That's intense.</v>

3028
02:53:01.090 --> 02:53:01.923
Wow.

3029
02:53:03.150 --> 02:53:07.330
<v 0>But there's stuff that's an iconic photo to the photo of you right after you</v>

3030
02:53:07.331 --> 02:53:12.250
knocked him out.
It's a pretty intense photo.
That was a crazy fight too,
man.

3031
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:16.730
It was a big one.

3037

That was that moment right there.
