29
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golf is the one I've always avoided.</v>

30
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I've always avoided golf because I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw it suck away people's time.</v>

31
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't go.</v>

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:07.554
<v Speaker 1>like I don't have the time and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patience to really block that whole day </v>

33
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
<v Speaker 1>off to go play outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to go over there and just hit the </v>

<v Speaker 1>driver for 30 minutes on the simulators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would imagine with what you do for a </v>

36
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.004
<v Speaker 1>living with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you do is one of the </v>

37
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>craziest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest,</v>

38
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>most demanding things a person could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an occupation where,</v>

39
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

41
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.364
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than being a soldier or a </v>

42
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.943
<v Speaker 1>firefighter or a cop or a fighter </v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>it takes a certain mentality to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to climb onto a bull.</v>

49
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a certain energy about them </v>

50
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>that they got that I don't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's cranked up the tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>every time you're around them you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

58
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>are we going to end up in jail tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real possibility.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

70
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

71
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a little,</v>

72
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>when I was little thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>what the hell am I going to grow up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a,</v>

74
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.623
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father was really successful in the </v>

75
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>sport so I would go to</v>

76
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 2>the races and I would watch him race and</v>
<v Speaker 2>see him win and watch him go through </v>

77
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>victory lane and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and celebrate and all those things.</v>

78
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

79
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>this is what I gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do this,</v>

80
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this looks fun.</v>

81
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>This looks exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are,</v>

82
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are in all of the drivers,</v>

83
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>

84
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.123
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the personalities and I just wanted to </v>

85
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 2>do it real badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I knew that the odds of making it or</v>

86
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.024
<v Speaker 2>tufts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's only 40 guys in the field </v>

87
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.184
<v Speaker 2>every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's 40 guys in this in the whole </v>

88
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>country that are going to get the shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it,</v>

89
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.553
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And may the odds of me even with my dad </v>

90
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 2>being a successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

91
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have a lot of doors open to me.</v>

92
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 2>But the odds of me actually getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and being able to stay,</v>

93
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>have the staying power and the success </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talent I just knew were tough.</v>

94
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't know if I'd ever get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

95
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

96
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.513
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I went to a </v>

97
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:58.834
<v Speaker 2>two and a half mile track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Talladega and you hold it wide </v>

98
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

99
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>working at my dad's dealership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing oil.</v>

100
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 2>He owned a Chevy store in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina.</v>

101
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone rang and he said,</v>

102
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.493
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was on the van and he was in </v>

103
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.594
<v Speaker 2>Talladega for a test and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your helmet and your suit and meet </v>

104
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 2>me at the race track the next day you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna fly the king air to the,</v>

105
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>to the track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know,</v>

106
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>don't ask questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it.</v>

107
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 2>And so I got there and I knew I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to Talladega and I thought,</v>

108
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must be driving this.</v>

109
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.643
<v Speaker 2>This is gonna be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go around this two and a </v>

110
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 2>half mile to track full speed at 190 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour.</v>

111
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.313
<v Speaker 2>I'd never done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never went faster than 90 or 95 on a </v>

112
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.493
<v Speaker 2>race track before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never drove anything bigger than a half </v>

113
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 2>mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

114
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got there,</v>

115
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna test this car,</v>

116
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 2>get in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get ready.</v>

117
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 2>He puts me in there and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a hold of wide open if you don't</v>

118
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:52.710
<v Speaker 2>hold a lot up and the motor's not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work it,</v>

119
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 2>it'll hurt the motor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to hold it the way they tune the</v>

120
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 2>motor to run wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to run it,</v>

121
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.043
<v Speaker 2>it has to run at full throttle if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to go around there and half </v>

122
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 2>throttle to burn the Pistons that a run </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lean all those things.</v>

123
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.554
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that and I thought to </v>

124
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.254
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he just telling me that just to make </v>

125
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>sure I hold a lot open because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I would,</v>

126
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be opposed to not do it.</v>

127
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

128
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little nervous,</v>

129
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold it wide open.</v>

130
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 2>But I pulled out on the track and mash </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gas full throttle and I'm going down</v>

131
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.084
<v Speaker 2>the back straightaway and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking down the back straightaway </v>

132
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>into the next corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this long corner.</v>

133
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's it going to stick?</v>

134
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's the car going to,</v>

135
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 2>how's the car not going to flat of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>racetrack like it.</v>

136
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

137
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel like it's going to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the track.</v>

138
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I kept running,</v>

139
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 2>kept running through my head about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's saying,</v>

140
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I got to hold it wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

141
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>well that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll,</v>

142
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll go wide open around here.</v>

143
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:54.960
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.953
<v Speaker 2>I believe everything he says and you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the corner and you turn a into the </v>

145
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>corner and there is more grit than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can imagine.</v>

146
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.643
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

147
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.493
<v Speaker 2>there's so much grit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truck of the car is stuck to the </v>

148
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 2>track with such grip that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt this before in your life.</v>

149
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 2>This grip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't slide across that track.</v>

150
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 2>That or the tires and the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hold of the track,</v>

151
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>so tough and tight that nothing going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

152
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>It just goes around there like it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest thing.</v>

153
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 2>And so now today when I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.713
<v Speaker 2>when I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got this two seater car and we take </v>

155
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 2>people for rides and they get in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

156
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

157
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:35.924
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do to explain to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody what this is going to feel </v>

158
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:37.994
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether I will tell you things to pay </v>

159
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay attention to the grip.</v>

160
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to believe how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>grip this car has.</v>

161
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

162
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.393
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll stick to the track the way it </v>

163
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.244
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pay attention to that and pay </v>

164
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

165
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>bumpy and violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

166
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drive a cadillac or a any car down </v>

167
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.111
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

168
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 2>it's six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight inches off the ground.</v>

169
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>These big old inflated tires and big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant sidewalls.</v>

170
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to feel nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

171
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.803
<v Speaker 2>when it hits a little bumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our cars are rigid and stuck to the </v>

172
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:10.870
<v Speaker 2>ground and don't have much travel in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspension and you know,</v>

173
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

174
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 2>it's built to hand to go fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to feel good,</v>

175
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's gonna it's rough as hell and </v>

176
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 2>shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shakes the hell out of you.</v>

177
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I remember about that.</v>

178
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I got over that initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

179
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the only time I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>had any real fear of driving a car.</v>

180
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

181
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>

182
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.533
<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else is going to be as scary as </v>

183
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

184
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.313
<v Speaker 2>Driving a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been flipping and when I </v>

185
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 2>flipped for the first time and our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 2>the car's tumbling and flying parts </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying off the air,</v>

187
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 2>my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself that I wasn't scared</v>

188
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:55.090
<v Speaker 2>or I never was scared of flipping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thought was I just did something.</v>

189
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people never get to experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I did something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 2>that only a few people know what that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

192
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel safe,</v>

193
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt incredibly safe inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>

194
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

195
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 2>especially with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

196
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:11.714
<v Speaker 2>in the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this safety stuff has really been </v>

197
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>focused on and improved and better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and better.</v>

198
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>But I'll look at the interior of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars today versus 20 years ago.</v>

199
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.733
<v Speaker 2>And it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe some of the stuff that </v>

200
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>we used to climb into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you felt calm while it was flipping?</v>

201
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always will have seen cars flipped,</v>

202
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it for years.</v>

203
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I know it's possible.</v>

204
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>So I get in there and I got turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>around at a race in 1998.</v>

205
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:43.331
<v Speaker 2>I was racing at Daytona and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got turned around and the car,</v>

206
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 2>so I'm flipping for the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and this car is like over 3000,</v>

207
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.040
<v Speaker 2>3000 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

208
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 2>But it flies up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's paper,</v>

209
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the craziest thing in the world.</v>

210
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's so weightless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v Speaker 2>and what it felt like to me [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the car rolled on its side and came </v>

212
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.534
<v Speaker 2>down kind of on its side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt like somebody wrote a prop wall </v>

213
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 2>of grass up against the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

214
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 2>When I was on my side and I could see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

215
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was right side up because </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you're flipping,</v>

216
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.033
<v Speaker 2>the force pushes you down in the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you feel internally you feel gravity </v>

217
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

218
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a cars flipping your.</v>

219
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.930
<v Speaker 2>You're pushed into the seat so you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

220
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 2>You feel weight of yourself in the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That never changes.</v>

221
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>You never kind of come up out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city like that,</v>

222
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like somebody wrote a prop</v>

223
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.863
<v Speaker 2>Walla grass up against the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car and then against the roof and then </v>

224
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 2>against that side and then this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.314
<v Speaker 2>it kept doing that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the weirdest feeling and you </v>

226
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:46.490
<v Speaker 2>feel completely safe and you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 2>nothing's going to harm me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

228
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.020
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

229
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

230
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we always talk about,</v>

231
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:57.291
<v Speaker 2>it's like get your hands on to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the spinning makes your arms and</v>

232
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.103
<v Speaker 2>you just go like this and if you watch a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of old wrecks from the sixties and </v>

233
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:03.414
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see the guy's arms come flying </v>

234
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 2>out the window and they're just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>flopping around.</v>

235
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:10.850
<v Speaker 2>They can't pull it spinning so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't pull it in and uh,</v>

236
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.693
<v Speaker 2>your arms go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as you know you're going </v>

237
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:13.974
<v Speaker 2>upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grabbed the bottom of the steering </v>

238
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:15.890
<v Speaker 2>wheel and just Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.070
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

240
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.513
<v Speaker 2>I flip my pickup truck one time on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas Day and I wasn't holding on </v>

241
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the steering wheel and my arm went out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the window,</v>

242
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a split second.</v>

243
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It banged around in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

244
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 2>in the window seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

245
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I got it back in and grabbed a hold the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steering wheel with both my hands.</v>

247
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.310
<v Speaker 2>And so ever since then I've like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

248
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.153
<v Speaker 2>now I know like anytime I'm in a crash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have your hands a hold of </v>

249
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>something because that's the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't control.</v>

250
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 2>You're strapped in with your seat belt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>

251
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:50.950
<v Speaker 2>but your arms are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.843
<v Speaker 2>can go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that moment when the car's </v>

253
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.320
<v Speaker 2>rolling or barrel rolling or flipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

254
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 2>it's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't,</v>

255
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 2>your arms just go this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the craziest thing in the world.</v>

256
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.953
<v Speaker 2>That's the only fear I guess is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your arm could get outside the window </v>

257
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:08.640
<v Speaker 2>and get crushed or something because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys have had that happen.</v>

258
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

259
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you flip when you were on </v>

260
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Christmas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>On Christmas Day?</v>

261
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.180
<v Speaker 2>My sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 2>she knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just won't be news to her,</v>

263
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.600
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

264
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.463
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not fun for her to hear </v>

265
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 2>every time I tell it.</v>

266
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 2>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a pickup truck with a tape deck in</v>

267
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.204
<v Speaker 2>it and I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got me the Walkman cd with the </v>

268
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 2>adapter for the tape tape deck that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick into you,</v>

269
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said adapter.</v>

270
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 2>And she bought me the Walkman extended </v>
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

271
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>

272
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an extended cab as 10.</v>

273
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving from my house to my memos </v>
<v Speaker 2>house where a farmer union is.</v>

274
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's,</v>

275
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 2>their whole family's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little late,</v>

276
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm driving down the road and I got </v>

277
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 2>to mess around with that Walkman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I drove off into the ditch and I hit</v>

278
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.234
<v Speaker 2>a driveway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>covert pipe drainage pipe in a driveway </v>

279
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 2>and went like seven flips and destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>this truck in the middle of the flip.</v>

280
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 2>And I remember that happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

281
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>All my change jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that was loose in the car,</v>

282
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 2>ended up down in one corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like flow board.</v>

283
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Everything sort of collects into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One corner is spinning and it crushed </v>

284
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 2>the windshield down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mirror was down into the radio,</v>

285
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we was,</v>

286
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 2>it crushed the roof down real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really lucky.</v>

287
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.683
<v Speaker 2>I had my hands on top of the steering </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel and the windshield kept slapping </v>

288
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.570
<v Speaker 2>my knuckles and knocked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>busted all my knuckles real bad.</v>

289
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 2>And so then I let go and my hands went </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way and then I finally got him back</v>

290
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 2>in and grabbed the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steering wheel.</v>

291
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.433
<v Speaker 2>The tires were broken and busted off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truck and this I got out of the truck </v>

292
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 2>and I was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have any injuries other than just</v>

293
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 2>the knuckles kind of being scraped up </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

294
00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 2>this newly married couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just are either got engaged or just</v>

295
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.264
<v Speaker 2>got married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're driving the other way and saw the </v>

296
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 2>whole thing and they stopped and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

297
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:07.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

299
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.873
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there's this line of cars </v>

300
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 2>behind me stopped on the road and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one lady pulls up and I was like,</v>

305
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:21.064
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to borrow my cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she walked to the next car and I got </v>

306
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 2>a cell phone from this person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so me and dad put the truck on the </v>

337
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 2>flatbed and we're driving back and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>started laughing and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was a fiery kind of dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:50.644
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>pull the belt out and go to town,</v>

342
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:53.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

343
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 2>he was a rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strict,</v>

344
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 2>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough dude.</v>

345
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought I was going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

346
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 2>a good customer at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he started laughing and I said,</v>

347
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:04.121
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the funny?</v>

348
00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 18 when this happened.</v>

349
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 18 years old,</v>

350
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I've flipped my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

351
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

352
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm just glad you ain't got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

353
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.413
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>

354
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>So we drove back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took pictures of it and uh,</v>

355
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 2>got me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got any insurance for it.</v>

356
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:21.554
<v Speaker 2>Got like 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 gram for the insurance to be able to </v>

357
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 2>buy another truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it all worked out.</v>

358
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 2>So that was the first time you ever flip</v>
<v Speaker 2>something or did you,</v>

359
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 2>were you the first time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was not the race car was next.</v>

360
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 2>So the race car is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

361
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I've been here before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

362
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing in the race car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

363
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not as bad as a passenger car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only got that strap,</v>

364
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:40.004
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving around and banging around </v>

365
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the race car,</v>

366
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 2>you're in there pretty tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

367
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.733
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel weird when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>passenger car to is for the lack of </v>

368
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.650
<v Speaker 2>support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of support and safety?</v>

369
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do because compared to the way our cup</v>

371
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 2>cars are now or the race cars are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man were cocooned in their,</v>

372
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.960
<v Speaker 2>the seat and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The headrests,</v>

373
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you got six slash seven point harness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a street car,</v>

374
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 2>you really just got the strap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's um,</v>

375
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

376
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more,</v>

377
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more cautious as I get older on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highway and people were like,</v>

378
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it?</v>

379
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Speaker 2>How do you drive on how you drive a race</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and then go 45,</v>

380
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 2>55 on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really easy actually,</v>

381
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:22.094
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kinda chill out all your fast </v>

382
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:25.124
<v Speaker 2>driving out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was younger I was getting </v>

383
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:27.554
<v Speaker 2>speeding tickets all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when as I got older I just didn't </v>

384
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 2>care to be in a hurry anymore.</v>

385
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would figure the way you drive for a </v>

386
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get it out of your system.</v>

387
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>action and hi jinks on the race track.</v>

389
00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I calmed down the road.</v>

390
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 2>What kind of car do you drive in real </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

391
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They just look kind of basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the new ones are really sweet,</v>

400
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 2>look under character lines and the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>

401

<v Speaker 2>It's just a good looking truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what I was driving before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a 48,</v>

<v Speaker 2>faded all messy and ugly looking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>drive train in.</v>

407
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 2>It drives good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy to work on and I just love</v>

408
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 2>fooling with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took the original banks bench seat out</v>

409

00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had a 69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

442
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.593

<v Speaker 2>all those things will always hold their </v>

443
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 2>rightful place in history.</v>

444
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 2>But these cars like that car right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

445
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't very cool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>

447
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.813

<v Speaker 2>I was a freshman in high school and she </v>

461
00:19:46.921 --> 00:19:47.754
<v Speaker 2>had this bear coat and it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>classic car and it was like a classic </v>

462
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:51.140
<v Speaker 2>muscle car.</v>

463
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the only 11 years old.</v>

464
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had a car today from 2007,</v>

465
00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.030
<v Speaker 2>whether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

466
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be a class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

467
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

468
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>

469
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Like a 1969 when I was in high school in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1969,</v>

470
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:10.440
<v Speaker 2>which is only an 11 year old car was </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

471
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would stop and stare at it.</v>

472
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Do look at that 69 Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

473
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I got an 88 s 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first pickup truck.</v>

474
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I owned or had,</v>

475
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.653
<v Speaker 2>that was like the car I got when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>16 years old and I got one and restored </v>

476
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 2>it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a terrible investment,</v>

477
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:30.520
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense for me because it,</v>

478
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was my first truck boat and I</v>

479
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 2>didn't think anybody would give a shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

480
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's an Stn,</v>

481
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.513
<v Speaker 2>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the barrel and pickup </v>

482
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:41.740
<v Speaker 2>trucks for Chevrolet in 1988 and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

483
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 2>but I drive that thing around and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

484
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.693
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the cleanest as 10 I've seen in </v>

485
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.943
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

486
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

487
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:50.224
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

488
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.430
<v Speaker 2>And so what's something about seeing one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those,</v>

489
00:20:53.431 --> 00:20:55.720
<v Speaker 2>it's in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that it made it through.</v>

490
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not many of them left.</v>

491
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for good reason.</v>

492
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.380
<v Speaker 2>But what was your first car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My first car was a 73 Chevelle.</v>

493
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>

494
00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 2>But I got it out on anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good car man.</v>

495
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>

496
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.980
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would you buy,</v>

497
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.500
<v Speaker 2>would you get a 73 and restore it to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 70?</v>

498
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 2>So that's my favorite year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty nine and 70 are my favorite years.</v>

499
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I go back and forth between six slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 70 with Chevelles.</v>

500
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Both amazing years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked those cars.</v>

502
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:25.430
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're uh,</v>

503
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 2>they're a big muscle car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big.</v>

504
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than the Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

505
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I have a 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69 Nova.</v>

506
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.861
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

507
00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I would just like a smaller.</v>

508
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that right there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>stripes come out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

513
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I liked Novas because their light is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>light car and because you know,</v>

514
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you put a big engine in it and new </v>

<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

533
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.943

<v Speaker 2>kid and all that stuff is not nothing </v>

534
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 2>like I thought it'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no one can explain it to you.</v>

535
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Especially a kid part.</v>

539
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 2>to figure this out until it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

540
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had people,</v>

541

<v Speaker 2>everybody tries to tell you this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be like,</v>

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.083
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>November when you guys have a spot in </v>

<v Speaker 2>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

579
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Me and one of the best white tail spots </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the country.</v>

580
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddy Martin,</v>

581
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Martin truex Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He races too.</v>

582
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.453
<v Speaker 2>And uH,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just been buddies a long time and </v>

583
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 2>he's hard core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's heavy duty into the hunting and so,</v>

584
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got,</v>

585
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to hunt but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

586
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be going every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.713
<v Speaker 2>but I knew he was probably interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably buying some land and us </v>

588
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:44.210
<v Speaker 2>managing it together and learn and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>that process goes.</v>

589
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 2>So we bought this land and we've put the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crop,</v>

590
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 2>we've put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've put the food plots in,</v>

591
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:49.790
<v Speaker 2>not per,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not ourselves,</v>

592
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:50.624
<v Speaker 2>but we've managed the land on how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to change it and I'm sort of </v>

593
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:54.914
<v Speaker 2>managing the hurt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a really educational </v>

594
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:00.750
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

595
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 2>And I got a lot of people don't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even understand what we're talking</v>

596
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:04.280
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

597
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.520
<v Speaker 2>the whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

598
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Like if you buy a nice piece of land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are,</v>

599
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.520
<v Speaker 2>especially if you look at like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of organizations that uh,</v>

600
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:18.490
<v Speaker 2>piece of property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but laying out food plots and,</v>

602
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.453
<v Speaker 2>and people buy these big chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>property specifically for whitetail </v>

652
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.663

<v Speaker 2>never hunted before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is an enough sit in the stand?</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's still good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is good.</v>

693
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.453
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's therapeutic even though nothing's </v>

694
00:29:11.261 --> 00:29:14.020
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of cleansing in a way.</v>

695
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a weird way.</v>

696
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:16.723
<v Speaker 1>Just I think human beings have a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of requirement for time in </v>

697
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:20.590
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

698
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.423
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't realize you have that </v>

699
00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:23.990
<v Speaker 1>requirement until you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't.</v>

700
00:29:23.991 --> 00:29:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know it until you go sit in</v>

701
00:29:25.611 --> 00:29:26.240
<v Speaker 1>the stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

702
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.590
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed a little bit of this.</v>

703
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I think even a park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:29.863
<v Speaker 1>and even people that go to central park </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York city that go to that park </v>

705
00:29:32.211 --> 00:29:34.310
<v Speaker 1>and sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that tree and they just feel better.</v>

706
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

707
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.830
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>

708
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

709
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 1>your work environment is a concrete </v>
<v Speaker 1>slab.</v>

710
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're drIving how fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the fastest?</v>

711
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:49.801
<v Speaker 1>You go to 15 when that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that passes,</v>

712
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:54.630
<v Speaker 1>you realize how fast to 15 really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>

713
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Sit in that car and do it long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You forget.</v>

714
00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.923
<v Speaker 1>Do you have apprehension about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower wars with just modern </v>

715
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 1>consumer cars?</v>

716
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.643
<v Speaker 1>Because I look at some of these cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're putting out that are </v>

717
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:08.344
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the new core of that [inaudible] </v>

718
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.690
<v Speaker 1>700 plus horsepower right from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory that dodge demons,</v>

719
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.543
<v Speaker 1>like 800 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they are putting out these insane </v>

720
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 1>race cars right from the factory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>any dummy like me,</v>

721
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I could just go to a stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the cash.</v>

722
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.063
<v Speaker 1>I go to a corvette dealership and pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>one up and all of a sudden I'm on the </v>

723
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:30.170
<v Speaker 1>highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

725
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with it now until</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a common occurrence where </v>

726
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:37.080
<v Speaker 1>people don't know how to control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 1>or know how to manage what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the wheel of something like that.</v>

728
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 1>But until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until that's like a common issue.</v>

729
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it'll need regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

730
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think of.</v>

731
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.480
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised though that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day maybe you know,</v>

732
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.650
<v Speaker 1>regulated because everything gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.590
<v Speaker 1>governance.</v>

734
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe too much.</v>

735
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should just appreciate that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>

736
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.313
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I want to be able to build </v>

737
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:04.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever I want to build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

738
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want that in production,</v>

739
00:31:07.471 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 1>ought to be able to produce whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

740
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like I feel at the same way I</v>

741
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:15.460
<v Speaker 1>feel about guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm very pro second amendment.</v>

742
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

743
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.793
<v Speaker 1>I am a responsible gun owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of friends that are </v>

744
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 1>responsible gun owners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've used guns for hunting.</v>

745
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you should have a gun for </v>
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

746
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

747
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.123
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it would be a bad idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have some sort of course that you </v>

748
00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:31.024
<v Speaker 1>have to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you understand all the aspects of </v>

749
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>safety and precautions that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>take and how to correctly loaded gUn and</v>

750
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:38.480
<v Speaker 1>clean and gun.</v>

751
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.313
<v Speaker 1>AbSolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

752
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but this is not really the case right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

753
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not necessarily.</v>

754
00:31:43.121 --> 00:31:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about gun control as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I'm talking about gun safety and</v>

755
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 1>gun responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the same way about a car.</v>

756
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you're going to go out </v>

757
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:52.144
<v Speaker 1>and buy a corvette z r one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the kind of body mashing </v>

758
00:31:56.411 --> 00:31:57.244
<v Speaker 1>acceleration that g forces you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from something like that right from the </v>

759
00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero to 60 in under three seconds.</v>

760
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.483
<v Speaker 1>That's an insane automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe someone should like take you </v>

761
00:32:06.221 --> 00:32:08.530
<v Speaker 1>around a track a little bit and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great idea.</v>

762
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would be the case if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to buy something like that or</v>

763
00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:12.484
<v Speaker 1>getting a car like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would need some kind of a trainer </v>

764
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:14.824
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to pass her three hours on a </v>

765
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>

766
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.493
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to have particular licensed </v>

767
00:32:18.991 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 1>to drive 18 wheelers down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interstate,</v>

768
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you know there should be a style or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of license that you need to achieve</v>

769
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 1>to have a certain type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

770
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you want to go buy a viper acr and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on the road.</v>

771
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Those crazy race car vipers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could juSt drive.</v>

772
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 1>She'd probably know how to drive hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

773
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Those things are a little bit a handful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a little too happy.</v>

774
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.793
<v Speaker 1>They're pre dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so crazy too that the race car </v>

775
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 1>one with all the vents and all the arrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around it.</v>

776
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.223
<v Speaker 1>That was just an insane thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just go buy that and take that on </v>

777
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:50.931
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

778
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the giant as v 10 in it.</v>

779
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.770
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

780
00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

781
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.800
<v Speaker 1>So do you drive like fast cars on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road ever,</v>

782
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:05.540
<v Speaker 1>or do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly are you just like,</v>

783
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 1>just mostly driving normal relaxed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

784
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.460
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

785
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of speeding tickets when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was younger.</v>

786
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a shocker.</v>

787
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

788
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 2>and it seemed like it would just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>

789
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Anytime I got behind the wheel of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corvette or anything like that,</v>

790
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll be getting pulled over for rolling </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

791
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Lights are rolling through a stop sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>or reckless driving or whatever.</v>

792
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.170
<v Speaker 2>And I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

793
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:35.690
<v Speaker 2>it happened as recently as two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

794
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I got pulled over for a rolling through </v>
<v Speaker 2>a stop sign and speed and uh,</v>

795
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 2>and the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

796
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you don't need these tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

797
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:49.400
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

798
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell I'm doing.</v>

799
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be driving this damn car</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what's up.</v>

800
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I need to get out of stupid car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to a corvette with all this</v>

801
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

802
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

803
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.020
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got this original,</v>

804
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this original,</v>

805
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:09.403
<v Speaker 2>a 65 impala that's been in my family </v>
<v Speaker 2>since it was brand new and it's kind of </v>

806
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:14.444
<v Speaker 2>been the community car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was passed around and got banged up </v>

807
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 2>on the corner corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right front corner,</v>

808
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.210
<v Speaker 2>couple of crashes here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of crisis area.</v>

809
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:23.210
<v Speaker 2>You just gotta needed a car because his </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke down so that he used it for awhile</v>

810
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.103
<v Speaker 2>and such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just pat and I finally got </v>

811
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:26.054
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought it for two grand from my dad </v>

812
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 2>and I've fixed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a two barrel to 83.</v>

813
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't go anywhere,</v>

814
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just as much rather drive that car</v>

815
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.740
<v Speaker 2>is a little low powers it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

816
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:41.903
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I won't get myself into any stupid </v>

817
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:44.710
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

818
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.060
<v Speaker 2>being in a hurry or being impatient.</v>

819
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.010
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:51.950
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>

821
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 2>that's what I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

822
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about as much what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power the car has as much.</v>

823
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I like a driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

824
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I like nice cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked know,</v>

825
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.543
<v Speaker 2>frame off restorations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd rather have a driver that's </v>

826
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.790
<v Speaker 2>reliable and easy to work on and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I liked that 48 pickup truck.</v>

827
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.490
<v Speaker 2>It's got the vortec motor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a,</v>

828
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:16.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

829
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not a powerhouse is just dropped in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and out of a job out of,</v>

830
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 2>out of a junkyard crash and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to work on,</v>

831
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.160
<v Speaker 2>like a me and a buddy of mine put </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric wiper motor in it the other day</v>

832
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.840
<v Speaker 2>because it had the little vacuum on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just didn't,</v>

833
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

834
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.300
<v Speaker 2>and it's easy to.</v>

835
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put,</v>

836
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.823
<v Speaker 2>we put these seats in it and we put a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got old ammo box for a console and </v>

837
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.220
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you just enjoy,</v>

838
00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 2>because it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

839
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's sort of related to</v>

840
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:49.050
<v Speaker 2>what you do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

841
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 2>not in kind of just a project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automobile.</v>

842
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

843
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why I like to work on</v>

844
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:03.920
<v Speaker 2>cars is because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

845
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.320
<v Speaker 2>that makes you a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts,</v>

846
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.233
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you a little invested in the car </v>

847
00:36:07.271 --> 00:36:08.350
<v Speaker 2>and there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a pin,</v>

848
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.110
<v Speaker 2>there was a point of time where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kinda like,</v>

849
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 2>that's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to buy that,</v>

850
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll drive that a year now.</v>

851
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's cool.</v>

852
00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I want to buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get rid of this one,</v>

853
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.573
<v Speaker 2>get this one.</v>

854
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.850
<v Speaker 2>And that got old real fast for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started to,</v>

855
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.993
<v Speaker 2>that's when I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I put a little more time in </v>

856
00:36:25.131 --> 00:36:27.180
<v Speaker 2>that 65 and palette and fixed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

857
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.510
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

858
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I've never let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that car.</v>

859
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Never gonna sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm that 48 truck.</v>

860
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll never sell it just because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work I put into the,</v>

861
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

862
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:40.640
<v Speaker 2>the time that I've spent with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

863
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

864
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

865
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.243
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are helping me work </v>

866
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:46.470
<v Speaker 2>on these cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy of mine that,</v>

867
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.240
<v Speaker 2>that actually helps me work on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

868
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I finished that novel wagon,</v>

869
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably never sell it even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably nothing special if someone</v>

870
00:36:56.941 --> 00:36:58.740
<v Speaker 2>else were to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's what I,</v>

871
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I put into it.</v>

872
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got sweat equity and the more you</v>

873
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:04.704
<v Speaker 2>work on these cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more confidence you get and trying </v>

874
00:37:06.421 --> 00:37:07.254
<v Speaker 2>to do more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into the jobs that you didn't </v>

875
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:10.134
<v Speaker 2>think you were capable of doIng.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about a buildup </v>

876
00:37:12.631 --> 00:37:13.464
<v Speaker 2>straight from scratch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably this little a nova </v>

877
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 2>wagons going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

878
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I wanted a nomad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my dad had a nomad and uh,</v>

879
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing had polished aluminum on the,</v>

880
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.933
<v Speaker 2>on the underneath floor pan and mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He parked it on a mirror in the shop so </v>

881
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:34.330
<v Speaker 2>you can look underneath it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.750
<v Speaker 2>and look how good the damn thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a boat.</v>

883
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 2>It was frame off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardly ever seen the road.</v>

884
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just clean as it could be from indian.</v>

885
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.460
<v Speaker 2>And I love road trips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nova wagon.</v>

886
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:47.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

887
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nomad is the perfect road trip car,</v>

888
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.433
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to spend the money on </v>

889
00:37:54.061 --> 00:37:55.110
<v Speaker 2>a black on the nova.</v>

890
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nomad chassis and body is,</v>

891
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:03.711
<v Speaker 2>they're just ridiculous to buy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to build the car.</v>

892
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a expert mater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this nova wagons,</v>

893
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:13.140
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wagon.</v>

894
00:38:13.141 --> 00:38:14.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not a nomad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little smaller,</v>

895
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>which I liked and if I screw it up it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

896
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 2>If I screwed up a nomad build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pissed.</v>

897
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Why are nomad so expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

898
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.880
<v Speaker 2>They're just rare and it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like the old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the old 55 chevy wagon.</v>

900
00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just put into my head what a nomad </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>

901
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 2>What year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at 55.</v>

902
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Fifty six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty seven.</v>

903
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Pull up while you're 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nomad.</v>

904
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that to me is my ultimate car.</v>

905
00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But damn man,</v>

906
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're just so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful car.</v>

907
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a different era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

908
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:52.683
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the muscle cars of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 sixties and then you go to something </v>

909
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a whole different world.</v>

910
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different kind of thing.</v>

911
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

912
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.093
<v Speaker 2>there was this one nomad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy chopped up and narrowed up and </v>

913
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 2>they made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those things.</v>

914
00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a rat rod.</v>

915
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

916
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was an idea for this nova wagon.</v>

917
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:16.834
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm gonna chop it up and </v>

918
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 2>then we'll keep it as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in high school,</v>

919
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:20.344
<v Speaker 2>there was a man in the neighborhood when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid that had a 55 chevy and it </v>

920
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 2>was the greatest thing anybody has ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in their lives.</v>

921
00:39:27.521 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And we would all wait while this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove by and his 55 chevy,</v>

922
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 2>we just couldn't believe it was a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>car that someone could own this.</v>

923
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.570
<v Speaker 2>It was black and meant it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful car,</v>

924
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 2>manual transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would dress drive by and that thing.</v>

925
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.670
<v Speaker 2>And we would all just have our jaws </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>

926
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.533
<v Speaker 2>When I was a little boy had hot wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite hot wheel was the 55 </v>

927
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.960
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>55 chevy that had to flip hood diff.</v>

928
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 2>The flames on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like an original hot wheel.</v>

929
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 2>that's kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kinda been my car.</v>

931
00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Speaker 2>But I went from the regular sedan to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wagon.</v>

932
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

933
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.993
<v Speaker 2>that nomads pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like a full garage set up </v>

934
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:09.790
<v Speaker 2>where you can do repairs on things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a farm shop.</v>

935
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dirty.</v>

936
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 2>We fix lawnmowers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do some modeling on our cars.</v>

937
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Whatever needs to be done in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I parked my uh,</v>

938
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.520
<v Speaker 2>apart my bus in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a busted would take the racetrack.</v>

939
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.463
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's kind of kind of just a big </v>

940
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:26.044
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

941
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.020
<v Speaker 2>We got a sandblaster in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a big ole,</v>

942
00:40:29.021 --> 00:40:34.021
<v Speaker 2>we get a sheer in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do anything to manage vendor.</v>

943
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever man shop.</v>

944
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me aboUt your book from you.</v>

945
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:42.663
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was surprising </v>

946
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 2>that I had heard was you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your experience with concussions,</v>

947
00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

948
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.833
<v Speaker 2>tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I've had concussIons in that </v>

949
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 2>flip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about 1998.</v>

950
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:57.640
<v Speaker 2>They tell him I got a concussion from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that crash.</v>

951
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd had concussions throughout my career</v>

952
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 2>at many different points and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think anything of them.</v>

953
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I thought when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.043
<v Speaker 2>when you got a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you joked about it with your buddies </v>

955
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.873
<v Speaker 2>about how it made you feel and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>rested until it was gone and you race </v>

956
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.590
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

957
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 2>and eventually go away and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

958
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just something that would go </v>

959
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:21.304
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you never thought anything about </v>

960
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 2>steve never thought about seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

961
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:26.710
<v Speaker 2>You never thought about getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>

962
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.770
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know there was even treatment</v>
<v Speaker 2>available for concussion.</v>

963
00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:31.570
<v Speaker 2>You just thought it was something like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bruise.</v>

964
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.433
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is going on throughout my whole </v>

965
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:34.544
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

966
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I was racing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was testing at Kansas,</v>

967
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.943
<v Speaker 3>a motor speedway in 2012 blue right </v>
<v Speaker 3>front tire hit at 185 miles an hour and </v>

968
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.230
<v Speaker 3>it screwed me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was a really not,</v>

969
00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't a typical crash,</v>

970
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:57.700
<v Speaker 3>not something that drivers deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually in their career.</v>

971
00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:59.650
<v Speaker 3>This was something that was unique to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

972
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just a terrible impact at a </v>

973
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:04.450
<v Speaker 3>bad angle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a very,</v>

974
00:42:04.451 --> 00:42:05.284
<v Speaker 3>very fast rate of speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got out of the car and I knew </v>

975
00:42:10.271 --> 00:42:11.980
<v Speaker 3>something was wrong with me and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't,</v>

976
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt,</v>

977
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like I'd been hit in the head with </v>

978
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:18.664
<v Speaker 3>a bat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shocked and shell shocked in a way or </v>

979
00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:23.920
<v Speaker 3>just couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>

980
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.043
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

981
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 3>shake it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

982
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:29.570
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of wanted to shake your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and get it out,</v>

983
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was and you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

984
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 3>that's why I failed immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immediately after that crash,</v>

985
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:37.124
<v Speaker 3>we went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark test was done because the car was </v>

986
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:39.524
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we went over to this place to get </v>

987
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:44.360
<v Speaker 3>some lunch and we're sitting there and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>started getting sick,</v>

988
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 3>nauseous before we ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

989
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.650
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't eat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just ordered,</v>

990
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.740
<v Speaker 3>just sat down and I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting with my team,</v>

991
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.000
<v Speaker 3>all my guys and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of them and I'm getting nervous and I </v>

994
00:42:58.941 --> 00:42:59.774
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't said to them that I feel this </v>

995
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:02.451
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

996
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 3>so I don't want to tell them I feel this</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

997
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.770
<v Speaker 3>but my crew chief evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like my,</v>

998
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:08.943
<v Speaker 3>like a brother.</v>

999
00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1000
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.443
<v Speaker 3>steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am getting sick and something's wrong </v>

1001
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's wrong with me,</v>

1002
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:15.884
<v Speaker 3>but I got to get out of this room is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>business lunch hour full of full of </v>

1003
00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:20.320
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>noises,</v>

1004
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 3>talk and chatter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shit going on.</v>

1005
00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:25.910
<v Speaker 3>And I got to get the hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1006
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.180
<v Speaker 3>and as I was getting up to leave my wife</v>
<v Speaker 3>come walking in,</v>

1007
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was coming to get me.</v>

1008
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.370
<v Speaker 3>We were going to Washington redskins </v>
<v Speaker 3>monday night game and uh,</v>

1009
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.710
<v Speaker 3>sitting on a box with dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not or whoever else there.</v>

1010
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 3>So we had them plans to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1011
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 3>amy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a good lay down in the car.</v>

1012
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.013
<v Speaker 3>I just got to lay down in a car for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute and I laid down all the way in </v>

1013
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 3>the car all the way to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>

1014
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.670
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is bad,</v>

1015
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 3>this is worse than I've ever failed </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1016
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:55.340
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully it's going to go away.</v>

1017
00:43:55.670 --> 00:44:00.020
<v Speaker 3>And so we get the game we get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went and the redskins game,</v>

1018
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:02.310
<v Speaker 3>we watched the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1019
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:03.523
<v Speaker 3>did that whole thing and I went about </v>
<v Speaker 3>four weeks of feeling bad and sick for </v>

1020
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 3>about four weeks and it finally went </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1021
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.573
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that was unusual for it to be </v>

1022
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 3>that long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my mind I wasn't thinking doctor.</v>

1023
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.860
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think in treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't thinking anything like that.</v>

1024
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.670
<v Speaker 3>It ain't cross my mind to tell anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>or that I really needed.</v>

1025
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1026
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I thought that I had been dishonest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a,</v>

1027
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't,</v>

1028
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.400
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't been honest with everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the way I was feeling,</v>

1029
00:44:37.401 --> 00:44:40.040
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't ever think that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to cost me anything.</v>

1030
00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.990
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

1031
00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

1032
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Go to this race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been racing the whole time.</v>

1033
00:44:45.441 --> 00:44:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally four weeks later I'm great.</v>

1034
00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:49.160
<v Speaker 3>I go to another race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm racing,</v>

1035
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I crashed and it all came right back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as bad as it was,</v>

1036
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 3>if not worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I said I gotta go to the</v>

<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1042
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:12.963

<v Speaker 3>like my attitude and my emotions and </v>

1043
00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:17.294
<v Speaker 3>shit was out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't control mY anger and I </v>

1044
00:45:19.371 --> 00:45:20.204
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody would anybody say something I </v>

<v Speaker 3>So I go there and I'm like,</v>

1079
00:46:53.121 --> 00:46:55.370
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how it happened.</v>

1080
00:46:55.371 --> 00:46:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hid it.</v>

1081
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I didn't tell anybody about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sick for four weeks.</v>

1082
00:46:59.121 --> 00:46:59.954
<v Speaker 3>I got better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I crashed in this race and I feel sick </v>

1083
00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:02.420
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1084
00:47:02.421 --> 00:47:03.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are two different injuries of,</v>

1085
00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 3>to two different parts of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first injury you bruised this,</v>

1086
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.013
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right front edge of your brain when you </v>

1087
00:47:10.011 --> 00:47:12.010
<v Speaker 3>hit the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said this,</v>

1088
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.883
<v Speaker 3>the second crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you twisted the base of your brain and </v>

1089
00:47:16.581 --> 00:47:17.414
<v Speaker 3>injured some things in the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and that's why you're having the </v>

1090
00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:21.710
<v Speaker 3>emotional and different things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1091
00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:22.920
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1092
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:24.860
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went deeper into it than that.</v>

1093
00:47:24.861 --> 00:47:25.940
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1094
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 3>we did all these tests and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>digital</v>

1095
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.250
<v Speaker 2>tests and all kinds of stuff for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1096
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.970
<v Speaker 2>and I'd go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1097
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.813
<v Speaker 2>we did this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went through the gamut for a whole </v>

1098
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:42.721
<v Speaker 2>day of doing tests and then I went back </v>
<v Speaker 2>every week before I,</v>

1099
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in two weeks I was back racing again</v>

1100
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 2>as clear and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

1101
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.793
<v Speaker 2>he took an injury that I hid and took </v>
<v Speaker 2>four weeks to heal and healed it in two </v>

1102
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:55.730
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he do to him?</v>

1103
00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me.</v>

1104
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I never took any medication on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular issue.</v>

1105
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 2>He gave me a home exercises and eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises.</v>

1106
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:08.944
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had problems with focusing and making </v>

1107
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 2>my eyes work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracking in an object,</v>

1108
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 2>like a bird flying across the sky or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

1109
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes couldn't stay on it.</v>

1110
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:19.720
<v Speaker 2>If I looked at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1111
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 2>eyes would bounce off of you and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just wouldn't stay,</v>

1112
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said,</v>

1113
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:26.231
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

1114
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:27.064
<v Speaker 2>take a picture and you held up a camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to look at the lens and </v>

1115
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:30.170
<v Speaker 2>smile.</v>

1116
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 2>My eyes would want to jump off of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>object they would want,</v>

1117
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:34.743
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to look at what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted them to look at and track </v>

1118
00:48:36.971 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 2>anything going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was the cause of that.</v>

1119
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1120
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
<v Speaker 2>the brain has the ocular stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1121
00:48:48.911 --> 00:48:49.744
<v Speaker 2>you can have injury to that part of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain or you can have an injury to the </v>

1122
00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 2>vestibular parts of your brain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1123
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:55.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may have,</v>

1124
00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>like if you have bad balance then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ads in your balance work together.</v>

1125
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:05.670
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have a vestibular issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can create ocular issues and um,</v>

1126
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.493
<v Speaker 2>that can create that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can affect your anxiety and </v>

1127
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 2>depression and things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all these,</v>

1128
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you can have an injury to one part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain that affects for other areas.</v>

1129
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talk about that in the book.</v>

1130
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Mickey comes into the book and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk,</v>

1131
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this is what I was feeling.</v>

1132
00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:29.164
<v Speaker 2>This is what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And mickey will come in behind me and </v>

1133
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:33.370
<v Speaker 2>say this is the medical science behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1134
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:34.204
<v Speaker 2>And this was how we treated it and why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would have an injury to one </v>

1135
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:39.580
<v Speaker 2>singular area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain,</v>

1136
00:49:39.581 --> 00:49:40.414
<v Speaker 2>but I would have four different symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting for different parts of my </v>

1137
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 2>brain for different senses and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1138
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:51.940
<v Speaker 2>he would have to hone in on the one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was broken and then know to fix it.</v>

1139
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:52.803
<v Speaker 2>And when he started fixing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other ones would start </v>

1140
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Speaker 2>communicating together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain would start working again.</v>

1141
00:49:57.311 --> 00:50:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Balance and visual and all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>would start to work again.</v>

1142
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And anxiety and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You begin to come back in tune.</v>

1143
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you said he fixed it,</v>

1144
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.080
<v Speaker 2>like what is he doing?</v>

1145
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.970
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1146
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:15.730
<v Speaker 2>so he gave me physical exercises to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some balance issues.</v>

1147
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:17.943
<v Speaker 2>Basically if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I turned my head a or looked up and </v>

1148
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get dizzy and sick.</v>

1149
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Like my stomach would turn if I turn my </v>
<v Speaker 2>head left it right.</v>

1150
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 2>If I looked up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there,</v>

1151
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 2>like the best thing for me was to sit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the couch and not move.</v>

1152
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 2>And so like literally not move and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt fine then.</v>

1153
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:39.730
<v Speaker 2>But if I moved an inch man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like my,</v>

1154
00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:44.550
<v Speaker 2>it'd make your stomach nauseous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I did a lot of,</v>

1155
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of exercises that created a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of motion with my head.</v>

1156
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm lifting heavy balls up and passing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them over my shoulder this way or that </v>

1157
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:54.494
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a ball and turning around and </v>

1158
00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.453
<v Speaker 2>heading this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the ball and turn around and </v>

1159
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing that for,</v>

1160
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.450
<v Speaker 2>for hours and hours and hours.</v>

1161
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:06.380
<v Speaker 2>And so I would train basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1162
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I was training myself to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to balance again,</v>

1163
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training my training,</v>

1164
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body to balance itself again.</v>

1165
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.193
<v Speaker 2>And in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I couldn't see a horizon or a flat </v>

1166
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:21.660
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1167
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell which way was up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1168
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1169
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 2>the visual stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was these,</v>

1170
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:33.434
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a string with these balls on it </v>

1171
00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:38.810
<v Speaker 2>and I would hold the string on my nose </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hold it out here.</v>

1172
00:51:38.811 --> 00:51:41.270
<v Speaker 2>and I had to look at all those balls and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>

1173
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1174
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.003
<v Speaker 2>my eyes are focusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just all it's doing is really just </v>

1175
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:45.704
<v Speaker 2>making my eyes change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focus from one to the next to the next </v>

1176
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 2>and back onto the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next and back.</v>

1177
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.793
<v Speaker 2>And there was this add chart on the wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it had all these letters and all </v>

1178
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:55.124
<v Speaker 2>these numbers on it.</v>

1179
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to look at that.</v>

1180
00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.990
<v Speaker 2>I chart and turned my head back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth this way.</v>

1181
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:04.991
<v Speaker 2>But look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chart and count and count do from a to</v>

1182
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 2>z but backwards knew the alphabet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd have to look for the letters.</v>

1183
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.950
<v Speaker 2>and go backwards or one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one to 20,</v>

1185
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all are you shaking your head too three </v>

1186
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.530
<v Speaker 2>standing up and walking backwards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking forward.</v>

1187
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.870
<v Speaker 2>And what is this doing to your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does,</v>

1188
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 2>how does this fix your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the process?</v>

1189
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the real.</v>

1190
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.133
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's the I've had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with me was my vestibular </v>

1191
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:32.714
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my ability to understand balance and </v>

1192
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:36.584
<v Speaker 2>understand horizons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was putting my mind in a </v>

1193
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:44.090
<v Speaker 2>perplex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1194
00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 2>in a complex environment or making my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind do complex things that you don't do</v>

1195
00:52:48.801 --> 00:52:49.510
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

1196
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.343
<v Speaker 2>And it's just firing your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like stretching this </v>

1197
00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:54.120
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:54.973
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they used to say when you </v>

1199
00:52:56.661 --> 00:52:59.320
<v Speaker 2>would get hurt to go into a dark room </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hide and er,</v>

1200
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1201
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.180
<v Speaker 2>no electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tv,</v>

1202
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.780
<v Speaker 2>just sit in a dark room and wait and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're,</v>

1203
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.093
<v Speaker 2>what they believe today is that exposure</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what helps pushing yourself into </v>

1204
00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:11.204
<v Speaker 2>these complex environments and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are really challenging for </v>

1205
00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:14.630
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even doing that,</v>

1206
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 2>if I put you in front of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chart made you turn your head back and</v>

1207
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:18.890
<v Speaker 2>forth and walk walking two steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

1208
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:21.860
<v Speaker 2>two steps back and doing it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd been difficult for you.</v>

1209
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1210
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for an injured person,</v>

1211
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:29.010
<v Speaker 2>it's super difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be really challenging,</v>

1212
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:33.540
<v Speaker 2>but it just sort of tunes to mind are </v>
<v Speaker 2>retrains the brain to do balance,</v>

1213
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.543
<v Speaker 2>to balance it retrains the eyes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to track on objects and to lock on </v>

1214
00:53:37.481 --> 00:53:38.700
<v Speaker 2>objects and stay on them.</v>

1215
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And what's crazy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like physical rehab,</v>

1216
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 2>what if you had a knee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a physical.</v>

1217
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of physical rehab to it.</v>

1218
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:46.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of it and don't think </v>

1219
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:49.470
<v Speaker 2>about that when it comes to the mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1220
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually think of the mind is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that needs to be healed with </v>

1221
00:53:52.081 --> 00:53:53.010
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1222
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1223
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.173
<v Speaker 2>the probably 85 percent of the work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did was physical therapy doesn't </v>

1224
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.273
<v Speaker 2>change your diet or anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they see inflammatory causing </v>

1225
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:08.400
<v Speaker 2>foods or inflammation causing foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

1226
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I did not change our drank strictly </v>
<v Speaker 2>drank water.</v>

1227
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't drink anything other than water</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1228
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.503
<v Speaker 2>I incorporated and bananas and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that into my diet that I never ate </v>

1229
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:20.480
<v Speaker 2>before it of potassium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:21.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would affect his potassium have on </v>

1231
00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.373
<v Speaker 2>just recovering?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hear that it's good for your </v>

1232
00:54:25.801 --> 00:54:27.880
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for your brain is her.</v>

1233
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

1234
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 2>My doctor didn't say start eating this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1235
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 2>So it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1236
00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tidbits,</v>

1237
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 2>like when you go and get injured like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1238
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:36.924
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get people texting you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and giving you the information here and </v>

1239
00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 2>there and you kind of take what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1240
00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:41.041
<v Speaker 2>And go and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1241
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever mess with cbd at all?</v>

1242
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Cbd?</v>

1243
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:46.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1244
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.630
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

1245
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:52.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cbd is a non-psychoactive form of hemp.</v>

1246
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1247
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.193
<v Speaker 4>it's a radical inflammation fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people that have some pretty </v>

1248
00:54:58.221 --> 00:54:59.054
<v Speaker 4>significant injuries to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of fighters take it like right </v>

1249
00:55:02.481 --> 00:55:04.820
<v Speaker 4>after fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It used to be,</v>

1250
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:08.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still questionable federally.</v>

1251
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're trying to,</v>

1252
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.373
<v Speaker 4>there's some pushes to try to make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal just because of pharmaceutical </v>

1253
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:15.314
<v Speaker 4>drug companies kind of putting pressure </v>
<v Speaker 4>on that doesn't do anything in terms of </v>

1254
00:55:18.021 --> 00:55:19.130
<v Speaker 4>like get you high or anything?</v>

1255
00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually inflammation.</v>

1256
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.593
<v Speaker 2>I actually read a little bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a couple of weeks ago because </v>

1257
00:55:25.161 --> 00:55:28.370
<v Speaker 2>it controls anxiety and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1258
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:29.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's helped a lot of people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1259
00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:32.590
<v Speaker 2>One of my biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems that I faced just on</v>

1260
00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.610
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a regular everyday is,</v>

1261
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.580
<v Speaker 2>is where my anxiety is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that because of being famous?</v>

1262
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it comes from like your </v>

1263
00:55:41.601 --> 00:55:42.434
<v Speaker 2>childhood and just things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced in life and what are you </v>

1264
00:55:45.501 --> 00:55:46.334
<v Speaker 2>anxious about?</v>

1265

<v Speaker 2>Even if I love the band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

<v Speaker 3>when you're younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>takes a long time for that to go away.</v>

<v Speaker 3>she likes that and I take that every </v>

1300
00:56:58.251 --> 00:56:59.960
<v Speaker 3>once in a while and I think that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>works pretty good.</v>

1301
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:02.460
<v Speaker 3>It kind of keeps you calm and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1303
00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.580
<v Speaker 3>but I've never tried the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read about when I was reading about</v>

1304
00:57:07.581 --> 00:57:10.160
<v Speaker 3>ashwagandha is when I read about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff you're talking about.</v>

1305
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:12.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll get you some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll help cbds.</v>

1306
00:57:12.931 --> 00:57:13.910
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1307
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.753
<v Speaker 4>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some muscle balms that work </v>

1308
00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:18.510
<v Speaker 4>really good on sore joints and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1309
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:22.110
<v Speaker 4>but like nothing I've ever used before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Better than anything.</v>

1310
00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Cbd just gets right into the muscles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just relaxes all the inflammation.</v>

1311
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:30.270
<v Speaker 4>And the best part about it is it's 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent natural and no side effects.</v>

1312
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:32.180
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of like,</v>

1313
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of different cbd oils </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can take,</v>

1314
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 4>they chill you out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't get you high or anything.</v>

1315
00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:38.903
<v Speaker 4>You're not weirded out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they just just calm me down and I </v>

1316
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:44.970
<v Speaker 4>wonder how much that calming down is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of inflammation.</v>

1317
00:57:44.971 --> 00:57:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Just reducing inflammation and just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

1318
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.760
<v Speaker 4>it seems to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body has a,</v>

1319
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.080
<v Speaker 4>your body knows what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>

1349
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.230
<v Speaker 4>part of the drug that's my friend's son </v>
<v Speaker 4>has.</v>

1350
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.143
<v Speaker 4>It's a type of epilepsy brendan shop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he started giving his kid cbd oil </v>

1351
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.130
<v Speaker 4>and it stopped the epilepsy and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tracks.</v>

1352
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I read where they are.</v>

1353
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been used for that for years.</v>

1354
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1355
00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1356
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.030
<v Speaker 3>To hail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1357
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:16.450
<v Speaker 3>for um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god seizures and stuff.</v>

1358
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For seizures.</v>

1359
00:59:17.611 --> 00:59:18.444
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a radical inflammation </v>

1360
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.413
<v Speaker 4>decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just figures out a way it does as some </v>

1361
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 4>sort of interaction with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which reduces inflammaTion.</v>

1362
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.070
<v Speaker 4>But it's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also calms people down,</v>

1363
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.220
<v Speaker 4>alleviates anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and no side effects.</v>

1364
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 4>That's the most important one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>

1365
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 4>it gives them a weird stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't like the way,</v>

1366
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:39.674
<v Speaker 4>but I think they'll probably take it too</v>
<v Speaker 4>much or maybe it's expired or something </v>

1367
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:43.180
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YeAh.</v>

1368
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.503
<v Speaker 4>I've never had those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'll get you something to look into </v>

1369
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:47.180
<v Speaker 4>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1370
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.730

<v Speaker 4>So what else did they do with you?</v>

1371
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:50.564
<v Speaker 4>Did you do any cryotherapy or anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that that also would reduce </v>

1372
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:54.584
<v Speaker 4>information?</v>

1373
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:55.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1374
00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:59.010

<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So With all these crazy exercises you're</v>

1382
01:00:23.371 --> 01:00:24.204
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did you feel like it had settled </v>

1383
01:00:25.531 --> 01:00:26.161
<v Speaker 4>in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1384
01:00:26.161 --> 01:00:27.240
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is really working?</v>

1385
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:29.343
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1386
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.391
<v Speaker 3>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1387
01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:33.280
<v Speaker 3>and if it was a two week period it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

1388
01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a day or two,</v>

1389
01:00:34.601 --> 01:00:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1390
01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:36.664
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember that far back a day or </v>

1391
01:00:39.491 --> 01:00:40.181
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:00:40.181 --> 01:00:41.014
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine it was feeling pretty good </v>

1393
01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:43.270
<v Speaker 3>after a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to.</v>

1394
01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1395
01:00:45.461 --> 01:00:47.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that affected me right </v>
<v Speaker 3>away or,</v>

1396
01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:51.010
<v Speaker 3>but I know I was by the time we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take an impact test,</v>

1397
01:00:51.011 --> 01:00:53.650
<v Speaker 3>which is basic kind of measures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>memory and Things like that,</v>

1398
01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:56.560
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my,</v>

1399
01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:00.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>measurements had come back to my norm,</v>

1400
01:01:00.241 --> 01:01:01.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my basic,</v>

1401
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1402
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:05.841
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1403
01:01:05.841 --> 01:01:06.674
<v Speaker 3>they kind of make you take the impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>test beforehand so that gets your </v>

1404
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:09.643
<v Speaker 3>blueprint of how you are and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then whenever you get injured you </v>

1405
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 3>take it again and they align that up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>

1406
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 3>against that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1407
01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:18.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're deficient here.</v>

1408
01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:21.380
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not diagnosing a concussion,</v>

1409
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:24.290
<v Speaker 3>but it wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's asking us to look in this area.</v>

1410
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have a baseline and then you have</v>

1411
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:29.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1412
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:33.980
<v Speaker 3>your injury or post crash a baseline is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1413
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:34.814
<v Speaker 3>so I was matching all my normals on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>impact test and that was kind of the </v>

1414
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 3>trigger for them to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1415
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 3>if you feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look good here.</v>

1416
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.180
<v Speaker 3>All the thIngs are saying that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

1417
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1418
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I felt pretty good.</v>

1419
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Is it a strange feeling knowing that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't see what the damages,</v>

1420
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.380
<v Speaker 4>like a brain injury is a strange one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1421
01:01:59.381 --> 01:02:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Because it's affecting everything in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>

1422
01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see it.</v>

1423
01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have a broken arm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at it,</v>

1424
01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in a cast that gets fixed,</v>

1425
01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1426
01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.300
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're aware of it,</v>

1427
01:02:10.301 --> 01:02:11.134
<v Speaker 4>you're doing rehab on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at it while you're doing </v>

1428
01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:13.144
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about the brain where </v>

1429
01:02:14.711 --> 01:02:18.220
<v Speaker 4>it's all like you can kind of mind fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and say,</v>

1430
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:19.083
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>

1431
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.093
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay.</v>

1432
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.773
<v Speaker 2>So in the book I talk about these notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started taking after that crash in </v>

1433
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:25.734
<v Speaker 2>2012 when I would wreck after that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get sick and I wouldn't tell </v>

1434
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>anybody and so I started writing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes in my journal,</v>

1435
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.353
<v Speaker 2>in my phone and from 2013 all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 I had this long journal of crashes </v>

1436
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:39.683
<v Speaker 2>and how I felt and I would crash on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunday and I'd ride in the journal and </v>

1437
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:45.800
<v Speaker 2>sunday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monday morning,</v>

1438
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 2>monday at lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money at night,</v>

1439
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every three times a day every day until </v>

1440
01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.053
<v Speaker 2>whenever I felt good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is usually either wednesday or </v>

1441
01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:54.084
<v Speaker 2>thursday of that week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was writing these notes because I </v>

1442
01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:58.554
<v Speaker 2>couldn't tell if I was getting better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the brain injury or any type of </v>

1443
01:03:02.131 --> 01:03:02.964
<v Speaker 2>head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you said how's it feel monday </v>

1444
01:03:06.271 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Speaker 2>and then you asked me again tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be.</v>

1445
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I really don't fucking know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1446
01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's better,</v>

1447
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:12.503
<v Speaker 2>I just feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would try to write as detailed </v>

1448
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:18.330
<v Speaker 2>as I could on a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a monday.</v>

1449
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:19.164
<v Speaker 2>And then try to write as detailed as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could on tuesday and reread monday and </v>

1450
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Speaker 2>see is this better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see in the comments or you know,</v>

1451
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't really remember exactly what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was feeling monday,</v>

1452
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.290
<v Speaker 2>but in the comments it seems better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would write these notes right.</v>

1453
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.513
<v Speaker 2>And so I kept doing this and I thought I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was treating myself and eventually it </v>

1454
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:37.524
<v Speaker 2>caught up with me like I had about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dozen concussions in a period of about </v>

1455
01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>two and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got to where I couldn't walk and I</v>

1456
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 2>called my owner and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1457
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I need to talk to you.</v>

1458
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't race this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't hardly walk.</v>

1459
01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:51.923
<v Speaker 2>And my balance is so bad that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get up off the couch without holding on </v>

1460
01:03:54.511 --> 01:03:57.540
<v Speaker 2>to something and walking across the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>without grabbing stuff as I go.</v>

1461
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1462
01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:02.220
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta go back to the doctor,</v>

1463
01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:03.600
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was mad.</v>

1464
01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:04.320
<v Speaker 2>He was lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1465
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.880
<v Speaker 2>what do you fucking do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And getting to the doctor,</v>

1466
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.460
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you at the doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1467
01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:09.600
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to go to a doctor.</v>

1468
01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean a concussed person doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>good judgment and self awareness,</v>

1469
01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:13.794
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

1470
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:14.663
<v Speaker 2>you're just in a brick and you're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like being hung over the worst </v>

1471
01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:20.820
<v Speaker 2>hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make decisions.</v>

1472
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.673
<v Speaker 2>And so I went back to pittsburgh and saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>mickey again and I had to stay out the </v>

1473
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 2>entire whole half of the year in 2016 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get better.</v>

1474
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 2>It took me five months to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well instead of two weeks.</v>

1475
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that time I was on,</v>

1476
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.223
<v Speaker 2>they put me on medication that will drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>my anxiety levels so the anxiety levels </v>

1477
01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:40.974
<v Speaker 2>would stay down so that I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the injury and what </v>

1478
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>medications I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly the names,</v>

1479
01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:51.930
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was uh,</v>

1480
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 2>it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small doses and it would take about</v>

1481
01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.810
<v Speaker 2>three weeks for just kind of kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to take it for awhile before it</v>

1482
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:01.644
<v Speaker 2>started working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it just made me real chill and it </v>

1483
01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:10.371
<v Speaker 2>made me not analyzing myself every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single day when I got up,</v>

1484
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>when I got up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go,</v>

1485
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.530
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it still there?</v>

1486
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.393
<v Speaker 2>Is it as bad as it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me walk across the room and see how </v>

1487
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:17.274
<v Speaker 2>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me go do this and test this and trY </v>

1488
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:21.770
<v Speaker 2>this and try this and try this all day </v>
<v Speaker 2>long and see how I feel.</v>

1489
01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It made me stop doing that because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving myself crazy.</v>

1490
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me a lot more physical therapy,</v>

1491
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>basketball movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that got my head moving.</v>

1492
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do those exercises for about tWo </v>

1493
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.453
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them would stop triggering </v>

1494
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go back to this place in pittsburgh,</v>

1495
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>we'd go through about 30 more exercises </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd take home about 15 that made the</v>

1496
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>symptoms trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do them for about two,</v>

1497
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 2>three weeks and some of them would stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

1498
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.313
<v Speaker 2>I'd go back to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd go through more physical exercises </v>

1499
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.400
<v Speaker 2>to kept doing that process over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over.</v>

1500
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I took the medication for about a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

1501
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a lot of,</v>

1502
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 2>they gave me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a computer program for my eyes and I was</v>

1503
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.533
<v Speaker 2>wearing these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would wear these three d glasses and </v>

1504
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:14.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1505
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.304
<v Speaker 2>this computer program would try to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>these three d objects and go to two d </v>

1506
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:21.040
<v Speaker 2>and three d and my eyes would literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>try.</v>

1507
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It would've felt like it was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rip my eyes apart.</v>

1508
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:24.663
<v Speaker 2>It hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like physically hurt when this object </v>

1509
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.700
<v Speaker 2>would try to go from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a three d to two d and it was going</v>

1510
01:06:30.701 --> 01:06:31.534
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very slowly and it felt like it was </v>

1511
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:36.940
<v Speaker 2>trying to rip my eyes apart and imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ads are tethered together.</v>

1512
01:06:36.941 --> 01:06:38.710
<v Speaker 2>So when you look left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they both go there,</v>

1513
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they both go wherever you look,</v>

1514
01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:41.710
<v Speaker 2>they go together like they're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1515
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.950
<v Speaker 2>And mine didn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine.</v>

1516
01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:47.380
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't physically see my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>towed out or going the wrong way.</v>

1517
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:50.320
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I try to look over here,</v>

1518
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.560
<v Speaker 2>they both didn't go to the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was that action or that,</v>

1519
01:06:57.370 --> 01:07:01.930
<v Speaker 2>that computer program was strengthening </v>
<v Speaker 2>that activity of my eyes,</v>

1520
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:06.190
<v Speaker 2>trying to do something together and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would walk.</v>

1521
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.143
<v Speaker 2>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got these buffalo on my property </v>

1522
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:11.580
<v Speaker 2>and they're across the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1523
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:12.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,</v>

1524
01:07:12.191 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>300 yards out across the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the back window of my living room.</v>

1525
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.013
<v Speaker 2>And if I walked across the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every step I took would knock my eyes </v>

1526
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:21.874
<v Speaker 2>off of the buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're way out there and I could </v>

1527
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:25.120
<v Speaker 2>look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I took a step,</v>

1528
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.390
<v Speaker 2>my eyes would shake and I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to find them again,</v>

1529
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was,</v>

1530
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.820
<v Speaker 2>that computer program would strengthen </v>
<v Speaker 2>my ability.</v>

1531
01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:37.030
<v Speaker 2>It's called gaze stabilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would make it to where when I walk,</v>

1532
01:07:37.031 --> 01:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm walking or bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the room,</v>

1533
01:07:39.501 --> 01:07:40.334
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could still look at you in the eyes </v>

1534
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:41.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1535
01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a normal person.</v>

1536
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>And if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in my,</v>

1537
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:47.800
<v Speaker 2>at my worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that.</v>

1538
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1539
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 2>but that took a long time to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1540
01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:53.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book basically is me admitting </v>

1541
01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>making those mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1542
01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I should have went to him as soon as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got sick again the first time instead of</v>

1543
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:02.494
<v Speaker 2>trying to document it myself and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hide it and manage it myself and </v>

1544
01:08:06.131 --> 01:08:08.800
<v Speaker 2>trying to get to whatever the end of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career was.</v>

1545
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.633
<v Speaker 2>Whenever that moment was in retire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking I was going to walk away </v>

1546
01:08:12.101 --> 01:08:15.420
<v Speaker 2>without anybody ever knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1547
01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had to retire after that.</v>

1548
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:18.884
<v Speaker 2>After that 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're missing half a season and going </v>

1549
01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 2>through all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go through it again.</v>

1550
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I had one more year on my contract in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2017,</v>

1551
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:29.610
<v Speaker 2>so I'll finish that season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was that.</v>

1552
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Were you apprehensive while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>finishing that sense?</v>

1553
01:08:31.561 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get hurt.</v>

1554
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go back through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole process again.</v>

1555
01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:37.820
<v Speaker 2>It goes through that rehab again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get sick again.</v>

1556
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Me and my wife just got married on new </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of 2016,</v>

1557
01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:44.270
<v Speaker 2>17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're newlyweds were getting,</v>

1558
01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.220

1560
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.903

<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go through any of that </v>

<v Speaker 2>so well.</v>

1563
01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was ill in the hospital or when I</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have any symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to even be thinking about </v>

1573
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:32.204
<v Speaker 2>my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reminded about it and one in a moment </v>

1582

<v Speaker 4>effects?</v>

1583

1590
01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:23.920
<v Speaker 2>stories about what these guys have went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1591
01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:24.754
<v Speaker 2>what their families have went through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been impossible not to read that </v>

1592

<v Speaker 2>stuff and fear that is that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to me?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do,</v>

1598
01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:44.523
<v Speaker 2>it took me the longest time to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>that concussion movie because I just </v>

1599
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.030
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to know what he had to tell </v>

<v Speaker 2>thought I'm after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to mickey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he shut down some player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the guy's name,</v>

1607
01:11:09.881 --> 01:11:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether he was a hockey player,</v>

1608
01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 2>a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guy was making millions of dollars</v>

1609
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>and he was in his mid twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mickey had to say,</v>

1610
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:18.504
<v Speaker 3>you can't play anymore and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make you to tell me that I didn't want </v>

1611
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 3>to have to go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out the room and say,</v>

1612
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:25.040
<v Speaker 3>y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm retired.</v>

1613
01:11:25.041 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say y'all.</v>

1614
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Mickey said I got to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1615
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 3>but he wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1616
01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not where that guy is and I don't</v>

1617
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:34.344
<v Speaker 3>see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see anything going on with you </v>

1618
01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 3>that tells me you can't race if you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to race.</v>

1619
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:38.041
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1620
01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:38.950
<v Speaker 3>what if I get hurt again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1621
01:11:38.951 --> 01:11:39.930
<v Speaker 3>he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1622
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:41.430
<v Speaker 3>if you get hurt again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can fix it,</v>

1623
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:43.110
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's up to you.</v>

1624
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.560
<v Speaker 3>If you want to go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1625
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.820
<v Speaker 3>you're just as likely to get hurt as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were before the injury.</v>

1626
01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:51.090
<v Speaker 3>You're going to race and racing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>racing is dangerous.</v>

1627
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:52.403
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta make up your mind whether you </v>

1628
01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 3>want to go out there and risk getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt again and if you do I'll fix it,</v>

1629
01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 3>can come right back here and we'll fix </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all over again and us like.</v>

1630
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.060
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1631
01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.473
<v Speaker 3>if you're not shutting me down then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>must not be worried about my longterm </v>

1632
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:08.480
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>AnD he's like,</v>

1633
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.313
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried about your long term </v>

1634
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:11.880
<v Speaker 3>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing going on here that I see</v>

1635
01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Speaker 3>that would make me concerned about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm health.</v>

1636
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.360
<v Speaker 3>And so with all that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got married,</v>

1637
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.313
<v Speaker 3>I had a little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting there on them days at home </v>

1638
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:23.663
<v Speaker 3>with them and I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I'm sitting here worried about </v>

1639
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:31.110
<v Speaker 3>cte or my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1640
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 3>going away and it never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1641
01:12:36.271 --> 01:12:37.104
<v Speaker 3>am I gonna wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I going to sit here and worry about </v>

1642
01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 3>that at 44 all the way through my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties and sixties and seventies?</v>

1643
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:43.920
<v Speaker 3>And then one day wake up at 80 and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

1644
01:12:43.921 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I lived pretty good life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did I worry about all that?</v>

1645
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:47.783
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't I enJoy what was in front of </v>

1646
01:12:49.351 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the other.</v>

1647
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to enjoy what's in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1648
01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:56.963
<v Speaker 3>not going to worry about cte,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to worry about my longterm </v>

1649
01:12:58.711 --> 01:13:01.380
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's another thing too,</v>

1650
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.633
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversation about concussions is </v>

1651
01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:10.140
<v Speaker 3>really just skyrocketed into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1652
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 3>into warp speed over the last five or </v>
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>

1653
01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:14.543
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they treated me in 2012 to the </v>

1654
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:21.870
<v Speaker 3>way they treated me in 2016 was </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely 180 degrees because they know</v>

1655
01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 3>so much more and they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1656
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:26.130
<v Speaker 3>they understand so much more about </v>
<v Speaker 3>treating the injury.</v>

1657
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 3>And so if I do have any problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever that is,</v>

1658
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:32.543
<v Speaker 3>I'm confident that there'll be something</v>
<v Speaker 3>there for me that there'll be something </v>

1659
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 3>there to give me a good quality of life.</v>

1660
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I've had a hell of a run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of fun.</v>

1661
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I raised hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I partied,</v>

1662
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost.</v>

1663
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 3>And if it all ended now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be,</v>

1664
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have missed out on anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than my wife and my little girl.</v>

1665
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.720
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm content with where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>content with where I am.</v>

1666
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:01.430
<v Speaker 3>All I want to be able to do is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1667
01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:06.450
<v Speaker 3>be a good father and be a good husband.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1668
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:07.463
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to have that </v>

1669
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:10.110
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if anything does happen to me,</v>

1670
01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that there'll be some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some information,</v>

1671
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.323
<v Speaker 2>some medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that would give me a good </v>

1672
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 2>enough quality of life that I would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to enjoy those things.</v>

1673
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.170
<v Speaker 4>I think you made the wise choice in </v>
<v Speaker 4>retiring.</v>

1674
01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I Think that I'm,</v>

1675
01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:26.270
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very familiar with head injuries.</v>

1676
01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:30.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm around people that have had them all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and I think it's um,</v>

1677
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:34.220
<v Speaker 4>it's something that we are understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>now more than ever before,</v>

1678
01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:38.360
<v Speaker 4>but someone like you writing a book </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this and your experience with it I</v>

1679
01:14:38.361 --> 01:14:39.194
<v Speaker 4>think is really important for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to help a lot of </v>

1680
01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:42.104
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna help a lot of people </v>

1681
01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:46.580
<v Speaker 4>understand it and the more we talk about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this more,</v>

1682
01:14:46.581 --> 01:14:47.414
<v Speaker 4>this gets out there in the public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more it helps just regular folks </v>

1683
01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:53.960
<v Speaker 4>that have had concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Understand what a significant thing this</v>

1684
01:14:53.961 --> 01:14:54.550
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1685

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.223
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book is to not discourage you from </v>

1687
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:02.230

<v Speaker 2>play football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not discouraging anybody from doing </v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm encouraging you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you ever do find yourself with a </v>

1694
01:15:14.981 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 2>injury,</v>

<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

1697
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I never would have known about mickey </v>
<v Speaker 2>had somebody not taking me to him.</v>

1698
01:15:27.431 --> 01:15:28.264
<v Speaker 2>I would've never even considered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that there was treatment for head </v>

1699
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 2>injury had I not met mickey.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the information that they know today,</v>

1711
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 2>even if this injury was 10 years ago or </v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago.</v>

1718
01:16:22.261 --> 01:16:23.094
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1719
01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're live.</v>

1720
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:24.913
<v Speaker 2>We're living in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're living in this big learning </v>

1721
01:16:27.711 --> 01:16:28.700
<v Speaker 2>experience right now.</v>

1722
01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1723
01:16:29.281 --> 01:16:32.440
<v Speaker 4>They're starting to do some stuff with </v>
<v Speaker 4>stem cells as well and you know,</v>

1724
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:33.293
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy named dr neil riordan that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had on the podcast before that he </v>

1725
01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:38.483
<v Speaker 4>did wonders for mel gibson's dad and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>mel gibson came on and went to talk </v>

1726
01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:42.264
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to do treatment and Panama </v>

1727
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:45.653
<v Speaker 4>because they can't do a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>treatments here in the United States </v>

1728
01:16:48.511 --> 01:16:49.344
<v Speaker 4>because they're not legal yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the effects that they're having on </v>

1729
01:16:51.451 --> 01:16:53.880
<v Speaker 4>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're bringing down to Panama,</v>

1730
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.040
<v Speaker 4>it's just mind blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1731
01:16:56.041 --> 01:17:01.041
<v Speaker 4>and I'm hoping that's gonna also help </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with traumatic brain injuries and</v>

1732
01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:03.510
<v Speaker 4>cte and some other things as well.</v>

1733
01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:17:04.441 --> 01:17:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited for them to find a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1735
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>to take cte in living human being.</v>

1736
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.943
<v Speaker 4>They already have figured out ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've figured out a way to do that </v>

1737
01:17:12.931 --> 01:17:13.890
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

1738
01:17:13.891 --> 01:17:16.710
<v Speaker 4>very recently started to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1739
01:17:16.711 --> 01:17:17.544
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a major concern obviously for </v>

1740
01:17:19.561 --> 01:17:22.020
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would imagine that someone in your</v>

1741
01:17:22.021 --> 01:17:24.480
<v Speaker 4>line of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not thought about the same way.</v>

1742
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if people think About it with football,</v>

1743
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.233
<v Speaker 4>they don't think about in terms of they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't directly associate boxing with </v>

1744
01:17:30.511 --> 01:17:31.344
<v Speaker 4>head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't directly associate race card </v>

1745
01:17:33.670 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1746
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1747
01:17:35.121 --> 01:17:35.954
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hopeful that there aren't a lot of </v>

1748
01:17:37.911 --> 01:17:38.744
<v Speaker 2>drivers that have experienced what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced and crash the way I've </v>

1749
01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:44.240
<v Speaker 2>crashed and there there's drivers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will raise their lives without it,</v>

1750
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:45.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1751
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 2>without ever having that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad for that.</v>

1752
01:17:47.991 --> 01:17:50.120
<v Speaker 2>But for the guys that have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>

<v Speaker 4>wild,</v>

1799
01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 4>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful way to make a living.</v>

1803
01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I ran a race and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>sponsored by xfinity and basically our </v>

1807
01:20:07.741 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 2>college</v>

1808

<v Speaker 3>And so I ran in a race at richmond to </v>
<v Speaker 3>scratch the itch a little bit and had a </v>

1814
01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.840
<v Speaker 3>blast.</v>

1817
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:34.794
<v Speaker 3>another track and probably do that every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year until I just don't feel like doing </v>

1818
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 3>it anymore.</v>

01:21:09.181 --> 01:21:13.530
<v Speaker 3>years off and fought khabIb normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's good point.</v>

1834
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he probably would've lost anyway </v>

1835
01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.590
<v Speaker 3>It could be just a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1837
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.990
<v Speaker 3>But who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might not have.</v>

1838
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.000
<v Speaker 3>If I would go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>

1839
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 3>it would take me six months just to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to speed,</v>

1840
01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:31.150
<v Speaker 3>not even really even get competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to get up to speed physically and,</v>

1841
01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.053
<v Speaker 3>and mentally bring yourself to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>agent and it ain't something you just </v>

1842
01:21:35.461 --> 01:21:37.300
<v Speaker 3>get out of and go back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1843
01:21:37.301 --> 01:21:38.650
<v Speaker 3>the people on the outside looking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1844
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 3>you steering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just shifting.</v>

1845
01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:40.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big deal.</v>

1846
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit the gas.</v>

1847
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a man.</v>

1848
01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:46.530
<v Speaker 3>If you take a week off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just get so behInd.</v>

1849
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you get behind what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>

1850
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>

1851
01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.220
<v Speaker 3>So our sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

1852
01:21:55.221 --> 01:21:57.390
<v Speaker 3>I was telling him about this with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend today and he made a good point.</v>

1853
01:21:57.391 --> 01:22:02.391
<v Speaker 3>He said there was a guy that he says our</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport is the only one where the,</v>

1854
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.850
<v Speaker 3>where the ball is governed and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle is inspected,</v>

1855
01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:07.170
<v Speaker 3>like the race car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the car,</v>

1856
01:22:07.171 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The physical card itself.</v>

1857
01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.713
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so technology is one of the things that </v>

1858
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 3>is like what's fast today will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsolete and slow six months from now.</v>

1859
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:23.010
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even think about running it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and six months really?</v>

1860
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1861
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1862
01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1863
01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:32.540
<v Speaker 3>it's constantly evolving and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>next door,</v>

1864
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:33.503
<v Speaker 3>the guy next to you and the guy next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and the guy next town's always </v>

1865
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:38.030
<v Speaker 3>constantly trying to build a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouse trap and,</v>

1866
01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:39.063
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's in what's new and bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass today is going to be okay and not </v>

1867
01:22:43.351 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 3>very good six months from now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly,</v>

1868
01:22:48.241 --> 01:22:49.074
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the teams are constantly working and </v>

1869
01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 3>if you're not in those cars and current </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in that flow,</v>

1870
01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.120
<v Speaker 3>in that changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that cycle,</v>

1871
01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:02.130
<v Speaker 3>in that we'll um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can't,</v>

1872
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:03.600
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're behind.</v>

1873
01:23:03.601 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Like when you geT in the car and you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>around a team,</v>

1874
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.470
<v Speaker 3>like you're behind on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on what's,</v>

1875
01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's in the car,</v>

1876
01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:12.520
<v Speaker 3>what's happening with the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>

1877
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 3>it's just not something you just jump in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and out of cars.</v>

1878
01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.870
<v Speaker 3>You're not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not really the,</v>

1879
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>the key component like your body is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is a fighter,</v>

1880
01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:25.130
<v Speaker 2>you know your body and your body is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tool.</v>

1881
01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

1882
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>quarterback his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tool right in racing.</v>

1883
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:31.504
<v Speaker 2>It's the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not in it and around </v>

1884
01:23:35.231 --> 01:23:36.064
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>

1885
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.590
<v Speaker 2>you will be behind</v>

1886
01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.613
<v Speaker 3>on technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding what's happening and what </v>

1887
01:23:41.091 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 3>teams are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're,</v>

1888
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.183
<v Speaker 3>what you need to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The damn dash is full of switches with </v>

1889
01:23:45.381 --> 01:23:47.920
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this needs to be on.</v>

1890
01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.690
<v Speaker 3>This needs to be off and this needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be back on and off and own.</v>

1891
01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And there's a levers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's brake levers,</v>

1892
01:23:54.531 --> 01:23:56.510
<v Speaker 3>some drivers have for fucking brake </v>
<v Speaker 3>levers,</v>

1893
01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:59.990
<v Speaker 3>or you can shut off the left front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right rear,</v>

1894
01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:02.720
<v Speaker 3>the right front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can put all the breaks from the back</v>

1895
01:24:02.721 --> 01:24:03.800
<v Speaker 3>to the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the back,</v>

1896
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.240
<v Speaker 3>from the left of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1897
01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:08.510
<v Speaker 3>that's just the breaks and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just so many.</v>

1898
01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:11.210
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just a lot going on</v>

1899
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:12.783
<v Speaker 2>that it would take you awhile to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back up to speed if you were to take </v>

1900
01:24:17.201 --> 01:24:19.300
<v Speaker 2>some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1901
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:20.913
<v Speaker 2>it's just not as easy as it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea there were that many </v>

1902
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:24.163
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1903
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:26.491
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1904
01:24:26.491 --> 01:24:29.160
<v Speaker 3>you could have as many as you own or as </v>
<v Speaker 3>little as you want.</v>

1905
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.083
<v Speaker 3>Some guys really think that that stuff's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good tool for them to be able to </v>

1906
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.593
<v Speaker 3>adjust the brakes and change how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brakes work on all four corners of the </v>

1907
01:24:35.551 --> 01:24:36.384
<v Speaker 3>car and some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move them during the race while </v>

1908
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:39.931
<v Speaker 3>they're racing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1909
01:24:39.931 --> 01:24:41.310
<v Speaker 3>they're changing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fooling with them,</v>

1910
01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:42.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an indy car,</v>

1911
01:24:42.511 --> 01:24:44.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can adjust the roll bars and all the</v>

1912
01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:47.760
<v Speaker 3>wings and all that stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those cars and stuff like that.</v>

1913
01:24:47.761 --> 01:24:49.810
<v Speaker 3>So I mean there's a race car driver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1914
01:24:49.890 --> 01:24:51.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a ton</v>

1915
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:54.360
<v Speaker 2>of stuff going on in that car that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't even know about.</v>

1916
01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:56.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1917
01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.030
<v Speaker 2>So it would just take you a while to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

1918
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Automatic mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.533
<v Speaker 2>I would get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get in the car and forget about </v>

1920
01:25:05.191 --> 01:25:10.191
<v Speaker 2>those tools and forget that I had those </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustments and knowledge and be getting</v>

1921
01:25:10.321 --> 01:25:13.710
<v Speaker 2>beat by guys that are using it everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1922
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.713
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1923
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.980
<v Speaker 2>how much time are you in a car in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>race?</v>

1924
01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.680
<v Speaker 2>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably three and a half hours.</v>

1925
01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:20.723
<v Speaker 2>Do you do anything or do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you take anything to keep you </v>

1926
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.610
<v Speaker 2>concentrating at your full potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time?</v>

1927
01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Vitamins or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never did.</v>

1928
01:25:31.621 --> 01:25:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I just mixed water and orange gatorade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm your electrolytes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>several of those guys do energy,</v>

1932
01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:44.910
<v Speaker 2>choose different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of gatorade oriented stuff.</v>

1933
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Gatorade's a sponsor for jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's going to have the gatorade chews</v>

1934
01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:50.130
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must be sweating like a pig in those</v>

1935
01:25:50.131 --> 01:25:50.640
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1936
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You sweat a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you lose,</v>

1937
01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you lose anywhere from six to eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds race.</v>

1938
01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:56.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all just water weight and he just </v>

1939
01:25:58.201 --> 01:26:01.140
<v Speaker 2>put it right back on in a day or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it really hot in the car?</v>

1940
01:26:01.141 --> 01:26:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm in</v>

1942
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.903
<v Speaker 3>chicago this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a hundred and 50 degrees in the </v>

1943
01:26:06.111 --> 01:26:08.250
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So it's a sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.513
<v Speaker 3>we had a template.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had these temperature gauges in the </v>

1946
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:13.064
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're seeing them on from the </v>

1947
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:16.700
<v Speaker 3>broadcast booth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can see you're in the,</v>

1948
01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:17.543
<v Speaker 3>in car camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be pointed at a temperature gauge </v>

1949
01:26:20.781 --> 01:26:21.614
<v Speaker 3>and all of the guys cars were 150 </v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees inside all the drivers and it </v>

1950
01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:26.850
<v Speaker 3>was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1951
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.830
<v Speaker 3>So is there any fear of people blacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out from,</v>

1952
01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.113
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something that I've always kind </v>

1953
01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:32.900
<v Speaker 3>been concerned with.</v>

1954
01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I think that we don't have that concern </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

1955
01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:46.230
<v Speaker 3>but it is coming and we need to like if </v>
<v Speaker 3>we had 150 degree incar temperatures,</v>

1956
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that we need to think about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to try not to have that,</v>

1957
01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:53.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to do something to where man,</v>

1958
01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:55.960
<v Speaker 3>is that really necessary that we put the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drivers through that.</v>

1959
01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.173
<v Speaker 3>Is it because the engines in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you as you're driving the heat from the </v>

1960
01:27:00.461 --> 01:27:03.580
<v Speaker 3>engine just blows in danvers compartment</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in the brakes,</v>

1961
01:27:03.581 --> 01:27:04.730
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The breaks spring,</v>

1962
01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.570
<v Speaker 3>the breaks are going to be a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees on,</v>

1963
01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:09.400
<v Speaker 3>on the calipers and that heat radiating </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the car.</v>

1964
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.020
<v Speaker 3>The drivers can open up these knack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naca ducks,</v>

1965
01:27:14.021 --> 01:27:14.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1966
01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:16.240
<v Speaker 3>to allow air into the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

1967
01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.110
<v Speaker 3>that's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1968
01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:19.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to slow you down.</v>

1969
01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:21.550
<v Speaker 3>It's going to hurt the performance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the car and so,</v>

1970
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:23.023
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drivers try to trim the cars out so </v>

1971
01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:27.430
<v Speaker 3>much that there's not a lot of air </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving around in the car and it's so low</v>

1972
01:27:27.431 --> 01:27:28.264
<v Speaker 3>to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no air moving around under the </v>

1973
01:27:30.281 --> 01:27:30.730
<v Speaker 3>car either.</v>

1974
01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:31.563
<v Speaker 3>So that air under the cars just got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baking in there and just sitting in </v>

1975
01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.380
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1976
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:38.080
<v Speaker 3>so they're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're miserable,</v>

1977
01:27:38.081 --> 01:27:39.680
<v Speaker 3>miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miserable car.</v>

1978
01:27:40.090 --> 01:27:42.130
<v Speaker 3>That's when I watched races and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1979
01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to get out there and do that </v>

1980
01:27:44.501 --> 01:27:46.300
<v Speaker 3>for a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but damn,</v>

1981
01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:48.910
<v Speaker 3>running three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>150 degree race car,</v>

1982
01:27:48.911 --> 01:27:53.110
<v Speaker 3>it's miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the worst experience.</v>

1983
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine being in a sauna just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there for three hours.</v>

1984
01:27:56.090 --> 01:28:00.430
<v Speaker 3>never mind driving her car around a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of heavy focus on something.</v>

1985
01:28:00.431 --> 01:28:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going 200 miles an hour.</v>

1986
01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:06.340
<v Speaker 3>the worst part is when you slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the caution comes out cause that it</v>

1987
01:28:06.341 --> 01:28:08.410
<v Speaker 3>gets hotter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it just when the car,</v>

1988
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.253
<v Speaker 3>when the coach comes out and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come in and change tires and you're </v>

1989
01:28:11.051 --> 01:28:15.220
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and you go about eight or </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 pace laps at 50 miles an hour,</v>

1990
01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.500
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you get to think about it,</v>

1991
01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you're sitting there going,</v>

1992
01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.000
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is hot while you're racing.</v>

1993
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.270
<v Speaker 3>You're almost so hyperfocused on what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>

1994
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:25.363
<v Speaker 3>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kinda doesn't bother you as bad </v>

1995
01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:27.723
<v Speaker 3>distracts you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything they can do to cool </v>

1996
01:28:30.671 --> 01:28:32.460
<v Speaker 3>you off with your suit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does your suit.</v>

1997
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:33.903
<v Speaker 3>There's these new vests that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has a jail in it and it's a you </v>

1998
01:28:36.881 --> 01:28:37.714
<v Speaker 3>plug into a little machine that pumps it</v>
<v Speaker 3>in so you unplug it to get out of the </v>

1999
01:28:41.621 --> 01:28:42.454
<v Speaker 3>car and those work really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually we use the usable in the last </v>

2000
01:28:46.090 --> 01:28:48.910
<v Speaker 3>year of my career and it was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable.</v>

2001
01:28:48.911 --> 01:28:51.040
<v Speaker 3>So there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some innovative stuff out there.</v>

2002
01:28:51.041 --> 01:28:53.680
<v Speaker 3>They have a helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cooler,</v>

2003
01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.780
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hose that plugs in top of your</v>

2004
01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:58.180
<v Speaker 3>helmet and it blow some air in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit cooler,</v>

2005
01:28:58.690 --> 01:29:03.210
<v Speaker 3>but it draws those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>draw much amps that the teams don't want</v>

2006
01:29:03.211 --> 01:29:05.160
<v Speaker 3>to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drivers want to use them,</v>

2007
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.173
<v Speaker 3>but the crew chiefs don't want you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>draw on that many amps off the rate off </v>

2008
01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:08.934
<v Speaker 3>the alternator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to use amps for other things </v>

2009
01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 3>that are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make the car go faster.</v>

2010
01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:13.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2011
01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:15.070
<v Speaker 4>make you comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why there's no ac.</v>

2012
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

2013
01:29:16.511 --> 01:29:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2014
01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:18.963
<v Speaker 4>Now when you think back of on doing all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff that you did do and think </v>

2015
01:29:24.701 --> 01:29:25.534
<v Speaker 4>about those kinds of races and think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about all the endurance and all the </v>

2016
01:29:28.331 --> 01:29:31.660
<v Speaker 4>different aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it ever seem kind of crazy that you</v>

2017
01:29:31.661 --> 01:29:32.494
<v Speaker 4>did it?</v>

2018
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that I,</v>

2019
01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.290
<v Speaker 3>that I raised.</v>

2020
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean now that you're not racing,</v>

2021
01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.570
<v Speaker 4>like whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a wild way to make a living.</v>

2022
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't believe it happened to me.</v>

2023
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.950
<v Speaker 3>No shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2024
01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:50.570

<v Speaker 3>my dad was a sort of this</v>

2025
01:29:51.190 --> 01:29:52.023
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2026
01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:58.120
<v Speaker 3>invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote and I wanted to do what he did.</v>

2027
01:29:59.751 --> 01:30:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think I was going to get to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2028
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:04.820
<v Speaker 3>When I started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking to myself,</v>

2029
01:30:04.821 --> 01:30:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe this is happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I started to,</v>

2030
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:09.740
<v Speaker 3>when I won a few races,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>

2031
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:10.723
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never.</v>

2032
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:13.820
<v Speaker 3>So when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 20 years old,</v>

2033
01:30:13.821 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2034

<v Speaker 3>don't be a champion.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kick some ass.</v>

2036
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:21.343
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sure would love to do this and pay my </v>

2037
01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:24.224
<v Speaker 3>bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I w I would love to do this just for a </v>

2040
01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't where I wanted to be.</v>

2041
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:35.510
<v Speaker 3>A workinG in a service department was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>

2042
01:30:35.511 --> 01:30:36.344
<v Speaker 3>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be a race car driver and so </v>

2043
01:30:39.051 --> 01:30:41.300
<v Speaker 3>when I made it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really.</v>

2044
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but damn,</v>

2045

<v Speaker 4>what propelled you.</v>

2056
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:19.150

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2176
01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:50.090
<v Speaker 3>we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're outside.</v>

2177
01:36:50.091 --> 01:36:50.924
<v Speaker 3>We're going to play outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My dad's standing over there and there </v>

2178
01:36:53.091 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 3>was a bucket full of shit and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2179
01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.370
<v Speaker 3>come here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And pope junior pick that bucket up,</v>

2180
01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.233
<v Speaker 3>move it over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went over there and tried to pick </v>

2181
01:37:00.831 --> 01:37:02.150
<v Speaker 3>it up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't lift it.</v>

2182
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 3>And he got so pissed off at me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew I didn't try.</v>

2183
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 3>And he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said to my buddy ryan,</v>

2184
01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:09.740
<v Speaker 3>he was ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come here,</v>

2185
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:11.390
<v Speaker 3>pick the bucket up and take it over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2186
01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:15.260
<v Speaker 3>And he turned around and gave me this </v>
<v Speaker 3>look of pure fricking disappointment.</v>

2187
01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:19.460
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like that set the tone for </v>
<v Speaker 3>our relationship.</v>

2188
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For one bucket.</v>

2189
01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that that was the,</v>

2190
01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:25.953
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was our relationship in a nutshell </v>

2191
01:37:29.181 --> 01:37:33.490
<v Speaker 3>for most of my teenage years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2192
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.200
<v Speaker 3>he looked at me as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2193
01:37:36.201 --> 01:37:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's going to mount </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2194
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:40.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what this gives you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>

2195
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:41.593
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2196
01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:42.463
<v Speaker 3>what skills he has or what is it you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't ever get his act together or </v>

2197
01:37:45.351 --> 01:37:46.940
<v Speaker 3>whether he's ever going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself out,</v>

2198
01:37:46.941 --> 01:37:47.774
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I probably didn't give him much </v>

2199
01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.440
<v Speaker 3>reason to think different.</v>

2200
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when we got,</v>

2201
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.080
<v Speaker 3>when I started racing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2202
01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:02.370
<v Speaker 3>when I started racing late models,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran 159 races and he never came to one</v>

2203
01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:05.280
<v Speaker 3>a through 94,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95,</v>

2204
01:38:05.281 --> 01:38:06.270
<v Speaker 3>96,</v>
<v Speaker 3>97.</v>

2205
01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:07.104
<v Speaker 3>I raced at myrtle beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>South Carolina every weekend and he </v>

2206
01:38:09.181 --> 01:38:10.014
<v Speaker 3>never once came down there to watch me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he didn't know whether I was a </v>

2207
01:38:13.531 --> 01:38:15.930
<v Speaker 3>good race car driver or a bad race car </v>
<v Speaker 3>driver.</v>

2208
01:38:15.931 --> 01:38:17.700
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know whether I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2209
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.940
<v Speaker 3>working on my car or understanding how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2210
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:21.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2211
01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:22.883
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

2212
01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 3>how to build the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix the car.</v>

2213
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.920
<v Speaker 3>And when I would do good I'd come home </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd have a trophy and I'd say,</v>

2214
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:29.820
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want.</v>

2215
01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:30.361
<v Speaker 3>And he'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2216
01:38:30.361 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 3>who wasn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2217
01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.313
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2218
01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.073
<v Speaker 3>He really did the first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember coming home With the trophy </v>

2219
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and I could not wait until he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would walk.</v>

2220
01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I kept my car in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2221
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:45.833
<v Speaker 3>in this building that was his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he put all his deer head up there </v>

2222
01:38:48.401 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 3>and call it a deer hit shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking 35,</v>

2223
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.610
<v Speaker 3>40 minutes in this place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of elk.</v>

2224
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:55.223
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd come in here every monday morning </v>

2225
01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:00.960
<v Speaker 3>before lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had that trophy sitting up.</v>

2226
01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:04.050
<v Speaker 3>We'd brought it home and it was right in</v>
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

2227
01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:04.963
<v Speaker 3>Soon as he walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the car working on my car and he </v>

2228
01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 3>comes in there and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2233
01:39:18.151 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 3>must have not been there because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this one guy and then robert,</v>

<v Speaker 3>robert bus not been there.</v>

2236
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:25.261
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2237
01:39:25.261 --> 01:39:26.460
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't there.</v>

2238
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I was so pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2239
01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.613
<v Speaker 3>I finally won a damn race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that he was going to come in </v>

2240
01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:35.490
<v Speaker 3>there and slap me on the back and man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2241
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me an,</v>

2242
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.480
<v Speaker 3>give me a good talk and give you more </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation that he didn't do that.</v>

2243
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:44.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it did.</v>

2244
01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it made me want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did not make me want to win more.</v>

2245
01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then one day,</v>

2246
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:58.190
<v Speaker 3>so right around the end of 1997,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was out of money.</v>

2247
01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:00.030
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2248
01:40:00.031 --> 01:40:01.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out of money and race.</v>

2249
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2250
01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:05.010
<v Speaker 3>my life is coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as I know it.</v>

2251
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess my racing career,</v>

2252
01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:08.220
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2253
01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.900
<v Speaker 3>It's coming to an end in 1997.</v>

2254
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was sitting down and talking to a.</v>

2255
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.073
<v Speaker 3>He had a car that races in the xfinity </v>
<v Speaker 3>series that I told you about on </v>

2256
01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:21.054
<v Speaker 3>saturdays and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his driver was leaving to go to a cup </v>

2257
01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:27.030
<v Speaker 3>car and he was talking to his best </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>

2258
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Tony senior is the guy's name that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually crew chiefs that car.</v>

2259
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.004
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who we're going to get to drive this </v>

2260
01:40:33.481 --> 01:40:34.980
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who should we get?</v>

2261
01:40:34.981 --> 01:40:37.380
<v Speaker 3>We got to hire a driver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tommy senior said,</v>

2262
01:40:37.381 --> 01:40:38.850
<v Speaker 3>why don't you put dale junior and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2263
01:40:38.851 --> 01:40:41.640
<v Speaker 3>what are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really think so?</v>

2264
01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.533
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to spend a little money on </v>

2265
01:40:43.411 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 3>this car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you spend it on your own kid?</v>

2266
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:46.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you just put may,</v>

2267
01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:48.760

<v Speaker 3>I can probably make a driver out of him.</v>

2268
01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Tony senior says so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made the decision to put me in this</v>

2269
01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:56.140
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the xfinity series.</v>

2270
01:40:57.070 --> 01:41:01.960
<v Speaker 3>You'd think that dad would come tell me </v>
<v Speaker 3>or we would have press conference.</v>

2271
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 3>Not be a press release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least I walked into.</v>

2272
01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 3>This is the month before the season </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts.</v>

2273
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm out of or I think I'm out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>racing.</v>

2274
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2276
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.010
<v Speaker 3>couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's dried up.</v>

2277
01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Opportunities are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll walk into the shop to get something</v>

01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.940
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2290
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:56.650
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I was thrilled,</v>

2291
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:57.431
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2292
01:41:57.431 --> 01:41:59.650
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the way I found out,</v>

2293
01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 3>not from my own dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2294
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:05.440
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm racing the car.</v>

2295
01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like days later when I see him,</v>

2296
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to race the car.</v>

2297
01:42:10.501 --> 01:42:11.170
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yep,</v>

2298
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:12.010
<v Speaker 3>yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2299
01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Birgit get ready and said yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it waS,</v>

2300
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:20.170
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the strangest dude when it came.</v>

2301
01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:21.910
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really.</v>

2302
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:23.853
<v Speaker 3>But once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I started racing that car and I had </v>

2303
01:42:25.930 --> 01:42:29.320
<v Speaker 3>had great success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won six or seven races the first year</v>

2304
01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:30.154
<v Speaker 3>we won another six or seven races the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second year of championships in both </v>

2305
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:33.641
<v Speaker 3>seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2306
01:42:33.641 --> 01:42:34.474
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the choice to put me in that car worked </v>

2307
01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:38.290
<v Speaker 3>out better than he probably ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined,</v>

2308
01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:39.993
<v Speaker 3>ever in 159 and late model races that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>ran from 94 to 97 and one slash four in </v>

2309
01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.770
<v Speaker 3>159 late model races I won for.</v>

2310
01:42:48.130 --> 01:42:48.963
<v Speaker 3>So he put me in this car on a whim and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>prayer and we ended up winning the </v>

2311
01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.960
<v Speaker 3>championship two in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he is thinking,</v>

2312
01:42:55.990 --> 01:43:00.130
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little shit can drive a car.</v>

2313
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's when our relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely changed.</v>

2314
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.320
<v Speaker 3>That's when I hit his arm around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were doing shit together.</v>

2315
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.060
<v Speaker 3>We were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were doing,</v>

2316
01:43:10.061 --> 01:43:12.220
<v Speaker 3>we had sponsored deals and promotions </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2317
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.233
<v Speaker 3>We were doing photo shoots together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him all the time and we talked </v>

2318
01:43:16.811 --> 01:43:17.950
<v Speaker 3>about all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2319
01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:21.970
<v Speaker 3>we talked about life girls and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything,</v>

2320
01:43:21.971 --> 01:43:22.631
<v Speaker 3>but racing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2321
01:43:22.631 --> 01:43:24.490
<v Speaker 3>we didn't talk about race in much but </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fine.</v>

2322
01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:27.400
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>

2323
01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:30.880
<v Speaker 3>And so not eight 99 and in 2000 I went </v>
<v Speaker 3>to cup.</v>

2324
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.590
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2325
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:36.220
<v Speaker 3>he built a team around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had budweiser come in for $10,000,000</v>

2326
01:43:36.221 --> 01:43:37.054
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the biggest sponsorship </v>

2327
01:43:37.751 --> 01:43:41.040
<v Speaker 3>anybody had and at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2328
01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:43.210
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2329
01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.000
<v Speaker 3>And then he got killed in 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One and two.</v>

2330
01:43:45.001 --> 01:43:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Started the season in daytona 500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those three years,</v>

2331
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:48.221
<v Speaker 3>98,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99,</v>

2332
01:43:48.221 --> 01:43:51.680
<v Speaker 3>2000 were as good as it could get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2333
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:52.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:56.143
<v Speaker 4>That must have been amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It must have been amazing for you to </v>

2335
01:43:58.401 --> 01:43:59.270
<v Speaker 4>turn that corner.</v>

2336
01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a light switch he went from.</v>

2337
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:06.590
<v Speaker 3>He went from not really engaging with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2338
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Me not a comfortable around him feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>ashamed.</v>

2339
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May not measuring up.</v>

2340
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:17.330
<v Speaker 3>He's because he's 10 foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowboy boots,</v>

2341
01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:19.490
<v Speaker 3>black hat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tougher and shit.</v>

2342
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intimidate her.</v>

2343
01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.160
<v Speaker 3>That was his nickname and I was blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pale short as hell.</v>

2344
01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Not a muscle on me and had accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

2345
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:35.370
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it.</v>

2346
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:36.343
<v Speaker 3>But it overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like completely changed when we </v>

2347
01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:43.310
<v Speaker 3>started running great and people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up to me,</v>

2348
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2349
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.540
<v Speaker 3>you're freaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing awesome.</v>

2350
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.400
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's.</v>

2351
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.280
<v Speaker 3>And he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was really happy with that.</v>

2352
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:53.143
<v Speaker 3>He was pretty proud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that he never talked to you </v>

2353
01:44:55.731 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 3>about race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2354
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:58.430
<v Speaker 3>That's just so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him.</v>

2355
01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.050
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that was one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only one time that he did that.</v>

2356
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:05.230
<v Speaker 3>We were at a track called bristol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tennessee.</v>

2357
01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.740
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were at a track in bristol,</v>

2358
01:45:06.741 --> 01:45:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Tennessee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2359
01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:12.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a half mile high banked racetrack </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we run 15 second laps around there.</v>

2360
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:13.184
<v Speaker 3>It's really fast and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of technical and tough to get </v>

2361
01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:16.940
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2362
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.620
<v Speaker 3>and I had been raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there practicing and I wasn't,</v>

2363
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got up on the uh,</v>

2364
01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:26.773
<v Speaker 3>he got up on one of the haulers and got </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the radio and started talking to me </v>

2365
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2366
01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you how to drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this one day,</v>

2367
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 3>one time in this one practice for about </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes,</v>

2368
01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:40.003
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna tell you how to drive his </v>

2369
01:45:40.971 --> 01:45:42.790
<v Speaker 3>track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm out there driving and um,</v>

2370
01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:45.770
<v Speaker 3>when he's like lift right here and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>lift and he getting the gas,</v>

2371
01:45:45.771 --> 01:45:46.604
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm turning the area and he's just </v>

2372
01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:48.494
<v Speaker 3>telling me how to drive the track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the only time he ever did </v>

2373
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:54.310
<v Speaker 3>that to just think of how much it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve.</v>

2374
01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I know it really helped me there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2375
01:45:56.870 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when he told me how to do it,</v>

2376
01:46:00.171 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

2377
01:46:01.401 --> 01:46:02.234
<v Speaker 3>this is what I would have never thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing it this way and this is way </v>

2378
01:46:04.431 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2379
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:09.380
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could have given me a few more</v>
<v Speaker 3>tips on some things.</v>

2380
01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

2381
01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:14.283
<v Speaker 4>That's how that has to be so crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's your profession or your </v>

2382
01:46:17.111 --> 01:46:18.610
<v Speaker 4>dad is a superhero.</v>

2383
01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I finally made it a cup and</v>

2384
01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:23.933
<v Speaker 3>I think had he lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have been in my ear all those </v>

2385
01:46:27.691 --> 01:46:28.650
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2386
01:46:28.710 --> 01:46:29.521
<v Speaker 3>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this,</v>

2387
01:46:29.521 --> 01:46:31.590
<v Speaker 3>don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the best decision today.</v>

2388
01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:33.683
<v Speaker 3>So maybe he just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't in a hurry to do it because he </v>

2389
01:46:35.611 --> 01:46:37.290
<v Speaker 3>didn't know that he wasn't going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>around for it,</v>

2390
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:38.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how hard was it to race after he was </v>

2391
01:46:40.831 --> 01:46:45.270
<v Speaker 3>gone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about whether I should quit or</v>

2392
01:46:45.271 --> 01:46:46.460
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2393
01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably,</v>

2394
01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.513
<v Speaker 5>if it hadn't paid a lot of money and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't have partners and people that </v>

2395
01:46:57.211 --> 01:47:01.410
<v Speaker 5>were depending on me are counting on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably could have easily walked away</v>

2396
01:47:01.411 --> 01:47:02.244
<v Speaker 5>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we had a great partner in budweiser </v>

2397
01:47:06.481 --> 01:47:09.740
<v Speaker 5>that was incredibly supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2398
01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:11.913
<v Speaker 3>I had a lucrative opportunity in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of me personally to be a be a race car </v>

2399
01:47:15.341 --> 01:47:16.174
<v Speaker 3>driver for as long as I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I wanted and I just had to go </v>

2400
01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.890
<v Speaker 3>through missing him really bad for a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

2401
01:47:23.891 --> 01:47:24.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to,</v>

2402
01:47:24.670 --> 01:47:27.460
<v Speaker 3>I had to go to the race track and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere I looked,</v>

2403
01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's dad,</v>

2404
01:47:29.050 --> 01:47:31.990
<v Speaker 3>there were fans morning,</v>

2405
01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:33.133
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2406
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:37.900
<v Speaker 3>there were signs and paintings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2407
01:47:37.901 --> 01:47:38.734
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was just markings and </v>

2408
01:47:39.850 --> 01:47:42.700
<v Speaker 3>acknowledgements and just shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere for like a year.</v>

2409
01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I appreciated it.</v>

2410
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I knew why it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2411
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:53.310
<v Speaker 3>but it took awhile for me to sort of get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to where I didn't.</v>

2412
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2413
01:47:56.381 --> 01:47:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a little period of me,</v>

2414
01:47:58.391 --> 01:48:03.391
<v Speaker 3>the period of time where I was real self</v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive and just like a mad,</v>

2415
01:48:03.491 --> 01:48:05.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2416
01:48:05.291 --> 01:48:08.260
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2417
01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.610
<v Speaker 3>took me awhile to calm down and get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

2418
01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2419
01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.430
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for awhile there,</v>

2420
01:48:15.431 --> 01:48:17.650
<v Speaker 3>it was just sort of going through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motions,</v>

2421
01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.490
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2422
01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:21.363
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it must have always known mean everyone </v>

2423
01:48:23.591 --> 01:48:26.170
<v Speaker 4>knows there's dangers involved in racing</v>
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

2424
01:48:26.171 --> 01:48:27.004
<v Speaker 4>but when it hit someone so close as your</v>
<v Speaker 4>own father that had to change what </v>

2425
01:48:32.081 --> 01:48:33.400
<v Speaker 4>racing felt like to you.</v>

2426
01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:38.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2427
01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:41.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it would have completely been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different experience.</v>

2428
01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:42.723
<v Speaker 3>I'm emotionally had that not happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had racing for me would have meant </v>

2429
01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:51.200
<v Speaker 3>something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2430
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:54.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just was,</v>

2431
01:48:55.130 --> 01:48:56.740
<v Speaker 3>he was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was this,</v>

2432
01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:03.040
<v Speaker 3>he was this invincible god that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to get hurt,</v>

2433
01:49:03.801 --> 01:49:05.090
<v Speaker 3>wasn't supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2434
01:49:05.091 --> 01:49:06.050
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2435
01:49:06.110 --> 01:49:08.840
<v Speaker 3>he was supposed to get hurt and drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt and be tough.</v>

2436
01:49:08.841 --> 01:49:09.674
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't supposed to get killed and </v>

2437
01:49:13.311 --> 01:49:15.050
<v Speaker 3>leave us all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2438
01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.880
<v Speaker 3>he left the whole sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2439
01:49:16.881 --> 01:49:18.980
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one knew what to do.</v>

2440
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Like that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole sport was sitting there going,</v>

2441
01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.360
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we do?</v>

2442
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:27.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy for everyone.</v>

2443
01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:30.710
<v Speaker 3>And even in even the competitors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2444
01:49:30.711 --> 01:49:32.660
<v Speaker 3>looked up to him like he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2445
01:49:32.690 --> 01:49:34.430
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the man.</v>

2446
01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:35.353
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was tough on the whole sport to </v>

2447
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:40.820
<v Speaker 3>big giant void for the whole sport.</v>

2448
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:42.723
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2449
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:45.950
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2450
01:49:47.650 --> 01:49:49.360
<v Speaker 3>we just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huddled together,</v>

2451
01:49:49.361 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 3>me and my team in our company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are rice for my dad's company,</v>

2452
01:49:52.451 --> 01:49:54.400
<v Speaker 3>so that whole company kinda just kinda </v>
<v Speaker 3>held,</v>

2453
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:57.070
<v Speaker 3>held itself together and everybody kinda</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled,</v>

2454
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:57.933
<v Speaker 3>pulled together and worked our way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it that first year and </v>

2455
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] just that year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2456
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:04.300
<v Speaker 3>that he was killed now that was just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a tough year.</v>

2457
01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't even really remember anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>much about What happened that year.</v>

2458
01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>won a couple races,</v>

2459
01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:13.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2460
01:50:13.721 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise,</v>

2461
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:16.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the races where we didn't win.</v>

2462
01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:21.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember much about them,</v>

2463
01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just retaining too much from.</v>

2464
01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 3>It was just kind of a daze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2465
01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four was a great year.</v>

2466
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 3>I think we kind of finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're coming out of the funk,</v>

2467
01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:30.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around 2004 kind of coming out of the </v>

2468
01:50:32.411 --> 01:50:33.244
<v Speaker 3>cloud of that.</v>

2469
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:39.150
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that being a race car </v>
<v Speaker 4>driver and having your dad be who he was</v>

2470
01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.433
<v Speaker 4>always carried a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But did it carry more weight after he </v>

2471
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:46.750
<v Speaker 4>was gone with her more eyes on you?</v>

2472
01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought so.</v>

2473
01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knoW,</v>

2474
01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:51.690
<v Speaker 3>I thought he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was tough.</v>

2475
01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.340
<v Speaker 3>He knew who he was to the sport and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew,</v>

2476
01:50:57.990 --> 01:51:02.990
<v Speaker 3>he knew that he carried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he carried a big massive fan base and he</v>

2477
01:51:03.631 --> 01:51:06.150
<v Speaker 3>knew that people listen to when he spoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all those things.</v>

2478
01:51:06.151 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 3>And so when he was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people are,</v>

2479
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:12.960
<v Speaker 3>some people kind of looked at me to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to carry that same load and even be that</v>

2480
01:51:12.961 --> 01:51:14.850
<v Speaker 3>same person and I just wasn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

2481
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2482
01:51:17.191 --> 01:51:18.360
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be me.</v>

2483
01:51:18.361 --> 01:51:20.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2484
01:51:20.401 --> 01:51:22.640
<v Speaker 3>like I said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's this template,</v>

2485
01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:27.650
<v Speaker 3>tall black hat and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm this short scrawny pail kid.</v>

2486
01:51:28.770 --> 01:51:29.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2487
01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:30.893
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't be who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have been faking it and I couldn't </v>

2488
01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:35.280
<v Speaker 3>be the intimidator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2489
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.593
<v Speaker 3>so I just have always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever since then been me and if that's </v>

2490
01:51:42.181 --> 01:51:43.320
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you'd like that.</v>

2491
01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

2492
01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've been relatable,</v>

2493
01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:50.910
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genuine,</v>

2494
01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:56.790
<v Speaker 3>and the fan base that I gained when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he passed away,</v>

2495
01:51:56.791 --> 01:51:57.624
<v Speaker 3>I thought we nurtured that and grew that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we did a lot of great </v>

2496
01:52:00.151 --> 01:52:01.140
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2497
01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.960
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and outside the sport to,</v>

2498
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:05.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

2499
01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:07.763
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm kind of proud of all those </v>

2500
01:52:09.721 --> 01:52:13.230
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I handled that well.</v>

2501
01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:18.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm considering there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different avenues to go at that time and</v>

2502
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:19.343
<v Speaker 3>I think I chose some good ones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly probably could have made some </v>

2503
01:52:22.291 --> 01:52:27.291
<v Speaker 3>different decisions and have regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part I was able to,</v>

2504
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:30.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>add to his legacy a little bit.</v>

2505
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:32.670
<v Speaker 3>That was something that was important to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2506
01:52:32.850 --> 01:52:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go out there and win 90 day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm racist.</v>

2507
01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't win seven championships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't hurt his legacy.</v>

2508
01:52:39.631 --> 01:52:41.520
<v Speaker 3>I added to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2509

<v Speaker 3>made a lot of people happy.</v>
