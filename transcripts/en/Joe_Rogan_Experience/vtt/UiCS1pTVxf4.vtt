00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.930
Hey fuckers,

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.170
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by Tang dog and

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.840
trust.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.290
Did you know that 98% of people would save money with Ting?

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.960
Now,

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.390
why?

7
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.860
It's because they do mobile different ways.

8
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.620
I mean it sounds so insurance have to write things like that.

9
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.250
If you have a company you have to actually like have like sentences that people

10
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.084
can repeat.

11
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.830
But this is what I can tell you about Tang.

12
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.820
What's good about Tang is that ting is a website,

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.833
a um,

14
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.950
a company rather that provides you with cell phone service without a lot of the

15
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.380
bullshit that's usually attached to cell phone service.

16
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.120
Like for instance,

17
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.250
hidden costs,

18
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.870
early termination fees,

19
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:47.130
cancellation fees,

20
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:48.240
which are actually really,

21
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.650
you're buying the phone.

22
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:49.811
It's,

23
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.970
it's cancellation fees are really weird because it's um,

24
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.380
what they're doing.

25
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:58.410
Like if you buy a phone and across you 200 bucks,

26
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.090
it doesn't really cost you 200 bucks.

27
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.561
Probably Cross,

28
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.410
you're like six,

29
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.930
but he'd take four of that hundred and they sort of defer it over a few years.

30
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.460
Now if you want to get out of your contract,

31
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:08.671
they say,

32
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:08.821
no,

33
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:08.931
no,

34
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.041
no,

35
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:09.201
no,

36
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:09.391
no.

37
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.980
You've got to give us money buddy.

38
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.300
You'll owe less money.

39
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.030
So this phone that you thought you were buying for 200 bucks,

40
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:16.170
it's really 500 bucks.

41
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.370
Tingles isn't bullshit you,

42
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.930
they sell you the best android phones you could possibly buy all the newest,

43
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.640
coolest android phones and,

44
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.960
and there are a ton of them.

45
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.880
There's a Samsung Galaxy note three,

46
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.110
which is the one that I use,

47
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.900
which is just excellent,

48
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:31.410
is this big giant ass screen.

49
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.380
And he used to be one time that if you didn't have an iPhone,

50
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.214
you were fucked.

51
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.360
It used to be that,

52
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.811
you know,

53
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.440
I phones were just through technology.

54
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:40.530
It was so much more advanced in the android phones.

55
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.690
I had an early android phone and it was like a,

56
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.340
like a drunk.

57
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.610
It was just like a dumb drunk that you were trying to get to work for you.

58
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.370
You come on stupid like pressed a button over and over again.

59
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.480
Oh you fuck head.

60
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.890
And I come from an iPhone,

61
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.360
which is just glorious.

62
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:55.710
It was just amazing.

63
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.940
But now there's,

64
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:01.080
there's no difference in using them and you most certainly can save money with

65
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:01.914
Ting.

66
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.000
Go to rogan.ting.com and save 25 bucks off of a,

67
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.161
uh,

68
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.730
for one of your first devices.

69
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.660
Um,

70
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.680
and like I said,

71
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.270
we know several people that use it.

72
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.991
Chris Ryan,

73
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:13.680
he uses it.

74
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.660
He uses Tang cause of this podcast.

75
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.050
That's how influential this ting Ghana try believe it bro.

76
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.820
I'm jump convincing PhDs,

77
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.950
Yo and Chris,

78
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:23.930
Ryan and Dunkin.

79
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:25.800
I will do a round,

80
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:26.221
what is it,

81
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:27.390
five or something like that?

82
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.740
Four or five.

83
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.240
Four or five real soon.

84
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.370
We're going to be doing that on April 8th.

85
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.090
Is that what it is?

86
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.690
I think it is.

87
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.580
I think it's April eight.

88
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.340
April 8th.

89
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.970
Yeah.

90
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.890
You need your volume turned down there and just say it.

91
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.511
Sorry,

92
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.380
I don't want to interrupt.

93
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:41.640
You don't have to worry about it man.

94
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.290
We'll call how many times you've been here.

95
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.890
It doesn't matter.

96
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.790
I'm scared

97
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.910
to move in.

98
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.800
Go to [inaudible] dot com check.

99
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.730
Save yourself some money.

100
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.970
Some money guys come on and an excellent cell phone company.

101
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.481
And by the way,

102
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:55.620
they use the sprint backbone.

103
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:56.550
That's an important point.

104
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.890
It's not like some wonky ass system.

105
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.801
They use sprint,

106
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.070
you pay

107
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v 1>for sprint,</v>

108
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.830
the sprint service,

109
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.540
but you get it and under like,

110
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.650
you know,

111
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.981
tings,

112
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:06.700
ideas,

113
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.590
the weighting wants to run things which are very cool.

114
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.270
They also recently cut their rates,

115
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.660
cut the rates just to celebrate their second anniversary and they uh,

116
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:13.990
they,

117
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.180
they addressed them even further to uh,

118
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.140
for heavy users like looking at lower cost because some you freaks out there,

119
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:24.340
can't stop looking at Shit online and you get ridiculous cell phone bills with a

120
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.290
lot of companies if you go like way over here.

121
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.383
<v 2>Oh your limit.</v>

122
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.820
I've been hammered by them.

123
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.250
Do you ever hear about that guy in Canada who,

124
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.091
I don't know.

125
00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:36.170
He was an idiot and he watched porn on his phone and Canada didn't have the

126
00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:37.070
right thing set up.

127
00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:38.790
I guess he watched porn for a few days,

128
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.753
left it on.

129
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.150
He got a cell phone bill for like $80,000,

130
00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:47.480
like some insane cell phone bill where he had to go to court cause he's like,

131
00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:49.250
there's no way this could have caused you that much.

132
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:53.360
But then yeah you left his phone on or I don't remember how it happened but wow,

133
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.770
that shit can happen man.

134
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.250
It's almost like an old joke that people say that they would uh,

135
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.130
call China from your house and leave the phone off the hook.

136
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.151
I remember like,

137
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:05.390
cause long distance was so expensive we had to call somewhere.

138
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:08.720
It was so expensive from places cost different amounts.

139
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:13.340
Like you could call three counties away and it'd be like a nickel more for some

140
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.181
unknown reason.

141
00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:16.460
Like the power lines were more dangerous there,

142
00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:17.294
whatever,

143
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.340
whatever it took for your voice to get there.

144
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:20.600
It was a little more expensive.

145
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.650
They had us,

146
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.330
what it was was they had us,

147
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.960
<v 1>no way you could get any kind of service and then cell phones came along and</v>

148
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:31.610
then slowly but surely people started using cell phones as their main phone.

149
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.260
And then the other thing happened,

150
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:35.720
his cell phone stopped charging for roaming.

151
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.210
You kind of use your phone anywhere now they just let it go.

152
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.740
So it was just like this mad competition scramble and that's opened the door for

153
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.660
companies like ting cause with Tim has done it.

154
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:46.610
They rent time on the sprint backbone.

155
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.910
So you get sprint type service but you get an under tanks rules.

156
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.420
<v 2>That sounds so weird.</v>

157
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.831
Why does it sound weird?

158
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:54.750
Renton time on a backbone.

159
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.760
I don't understand what a backbone is.

160
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.650
It's all just noise.

161
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.230
A D it sounds like a demon runs team.

162
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.340
His name is teeing or at the very least some chance.

163
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:05.040
That spirit.

164
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.410
It's a controlling the called the sprint spine.

165
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.130
Yeah.

166
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.920
I live on the spine of sprints.

167
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.390
Like I'm picturing like a whispery ghosts,

168
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.283
like character.

169
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.250
It doesn't have like a real form,

170
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:18.330
but you know it's there.

171
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.400
We could never put it in the glass though.

172
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.800
Couldn't like hold it down.

173
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.800
It's not like a genie.

174
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:27.480
You mean some vapers spirit just to science to cling to the spine.

175
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:31.920
For some reason you got a demon on your spam boy Mris and they see this fucking

176
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:33.030
thing moving around,

177
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:34.740
hiding from the cameras and shit.

178
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.101
Oh,

179
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.650
it's like a kind of holding its ears because it doesn't like the sound,

180
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:38.121
the Mri.

181
00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:38.550
I don't,

182
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.383
don't tell him.

183
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.740
Tell him man.

184
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.220
I don't know.

185
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.570
Do you believe in demons?

186
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.620
No.

187
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.453
Anyway,

188
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.480
Rogan gutting Dotcom,

189
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.500
you believe in phone spines were also brought to you by on it on it.

190
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:54.090
Makers have a one 80,

191
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:55.440
which is what we're drinking right now,

192
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.320
son.

193
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.570
Uh,

194
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.650
what one is,

195
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:57.891
is,

196
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.220
uh,

197
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.510
<v 0>it's my favorite shit to take when I fly because flying is a motherfucker on</v>

198
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.270
your immune system and your brain for some weird reason.

199
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.240
And what we came up with for people that are just a little bit jet lagged a

200
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.791
little bit,

201
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:11.624
um,

202
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.340
a little bit whacked out of system.

203
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.473
Um,

204
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.600
the idea is to give you the neurotransmitter support of Alpha brain and the best

205
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.650
adaptogens from shroom tech sport,

206
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.050
little five HTP from new mood and some minerals for the immune system and all

207
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:27.560
these,

208
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.801
you know,

209
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:30.760
these nutrients in water scares you a little boost.

210
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:32.030
It gives your brain what you need,

211
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:33.530
especially when you're coming from me.

212
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.100
It's a big one.

213
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.210
I take two of these actually.

214
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:36.170
I'm mixed them together.

215
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.801
When I,

216
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:37.100
uh,

217
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.060
when I fly anywhere,

218
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.400
it's just when I land I always feel like shit.

219
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.030
And this is the only thing that I've ever found that gets me out of it.

220
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.550
This and exercise exercise is another one that gets you out of it.

221
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.780
And when I say feel like shit,

222
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:49.340
like not really bad,

223
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.580
but I don't feel awesome and that's what we're trying to do with the things that

224
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:55.754
we sell it on it.

225
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.900
Everything we're trying to do,

226
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.450
we're trying to sell things that we find that a beneficial,

227
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.570
whether it's beneficial for cognitive function and whether it's beneficial for

228
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.680
your recovery,

229
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.650
from training for strength and conditioning equipment.

230
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.903
Ecstasy,

231
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.080
dude,

232
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.500
dude,

233
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.771
dude,

234
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:11.900
that's what we used to sell back in the day.

235
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.250
That was one of the first ideas.

236
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.930
It was called roll on.

237
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:15.764
Roll off.

238
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.150
Yeah.

239
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.691
It was one,

240
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:20.270
one set of pills was to enhance the ecstasy experience.

241
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:24.380
But Pri providing you with a additional neurotransmitter's

242
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.190
<v 2>poor man,</v>

243
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:26.560
I,

244
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.540
I can't do it anymore.

245
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:28.440
I take ecstasy,

246
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.640
ecstasy now,

247
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:32.640
and it's just like I get depressed for a week.

248
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.110
When I was a kid,

249
00:07:34.111 --> 00:07:35.130
I used to gobble it,

250
00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:37.440
I could gobble it and the next day everything's fine,

251
00:07:37.441 --> 00:07:39.780
but now it's just maybe the ecstasy has gotten worse.

252
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.181
Well,

253
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:40.560
it's also,

254
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.370
is it pure?

255
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.290
Because Brian says that if it's pure,

256
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.400
you don't ever feel it.

257
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.650
Like he says that like the next day you're fine.

258
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.490
I get the feeling with pure ecstasy is the same thing with gluten free bread.

259
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.840
Somebody figured out.

260
00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:52.000
Yeah,

261
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.220
just say it's pure charged him more dollars because no one is testing gluten

262
00:07:56.221 --> 00:07:56.581
bread.

263
00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.031
No one's like,

264
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:57.241
oh,

265
00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:58.620
is this truly gluten free?

266
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.060
But they aren't testing ecstasy.

267
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:02.250
Like that's one thing that people do at some raves,

268
00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:06.240
so it'd be a classic ecstasy for gluten free bread is better than regular bread.

269
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.540
Better.

270
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.510
I mean you feel you feel better.

271
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.380
It's a better trip.

272
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:10.861
Yes.

273
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:11.940
It's definitely a better trip,

274
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.790
but it's not enough for me to eat.

275
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:16.230
It just grows.

276
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.260
It just tastes like shit of never funny.

277
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.320
Gluten free bread,

278
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.703
not,

279
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.580
I've had some good gluten free stuff though.

280
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.620
I've had good gluten free stuff.

281
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.790
<v 0>I've had some really good gluten free cookies.</v>

282
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:30.280
I've had some really good gluten free pasta,

283
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.420
like fresh pasta.

284
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.040
There's a company that makes it,

285
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:33.940
I don't remember the name,

286
00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:35.080
but they make it and like those,

287
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.370
those plastic covered little tubs where it's like they're fresh noodles.

288
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.090
They're not like they're not hard plastic that you boil like you boil them for a

289
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:44.110
very short amount of time,

290
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.390
but they taste a lot like regular noodles.

291
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:47.890
It tastes like normal spaghetti.

292
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.050
<v 2>I had these gluten free pancakes at Millie's on sunset boulevard and silver</v>

293
00:08:52.051 --> 00:08:52.884
lake.

294
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.350
There's,

295
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.880
they taste exactly like pancakes and that made me think,

296
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.360
oh these are just regular pancakes are just suspicious.

297
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:00.961
There's so good.

298
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.590
I'm suspicious because usually gluten tastes like stale,

299
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:06.510
like when you're desperate for all free.

300
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.200
Does gluten free tastes like it's stale usually are like,

301
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:11.070
it's not that good,

302
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:11.940
but yeah,

303
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:12.774
I don't know man.

304
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.350
I don't know about gluten free or organic.

305
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.320
I mean I know it's better when it is gluten free or organic,

306
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.770
but how often is that really gluten free?

307
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.510
Well with gluten free,

308
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:26.350
it's pretty obvious because what,

309
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.600
what are the ingredients?

310
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.620
Why would they lie about it?

311
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.020
Because he charged you be getting sick if it wasn't.

312
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:31.261
Yeah,

313
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:33.570
you can't do that because some people have like legit,

314
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.520
I don't have a legit gluten allergy,

315
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.900
but some people do,

316
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.670
they have crones disease.

317
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.330
Those people get really sick if you start eating gluten right.

318
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.900
And they have like real bowel issues too apparently from that stuff,

319
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.220
just their body just doesn't,

320
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.290
their intestines stretch out.

321
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.360
Their intestines are apparently like,

322
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.800
it's like someone took your intestines and like pulled them too far out and they

323
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:56.250
just,

324
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.350
they're like wire he and stretched.

325
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.050
Imagine if you are a doctor and you know,

326
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:01.470
to explain to someone what was wrong with him.

327
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.510
He met with that like show off like,

328
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.403
God,

329
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.930
I'm fucking diagnosis.

330
00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:08.764
Is that,

331
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.470
can you like can stretch them?

332
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.791
Jesus,

333
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:12.121
man,

334
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:13.100
tell me some good news.

Boom.

350
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.090
That's it.

351
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.361
Cues,

352
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:35.930

<v 3>good</v>

357
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.530
<v 0>trustless and idea the night we worked at the comedy Magic Club.</v>

358
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:55.370
We had a great time,

359
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.383
very fun.

360
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.350
And then um,

361
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.220
I drove dunk it back to his house and we sat around and we uh,

362
00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:02.630
we watched a bunch of TV together,

363
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:03.880
which is something I'd never get to do,

364
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.310
man.

365
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.150
Well not even TV.

366
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:08.670
We watched the Internet and I got to watch uh,

367
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.861
some,

368
00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:09.501
a dog stuff.

369
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:11.810
I got to watch God Doug Pound Pound House.

370
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.710
Really,

371
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.970
really fucking funny stuff.

372
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.500
We were laughing really hard.

373
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.360
How many of we watch at least four or five,

374
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:17.610
right?

375
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.391
<v 2>Blanche man,</v>

376
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.410
we went through a bunch.

377
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:22.290
It's so good because you just want to eat it because it's got like a through

378
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:25.080
line happening and you just want to keep seeing what happens next.

379
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.963
So weird.

380
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.630
I don't give them chances to like,

381
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:28.464
hang on,

382
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.960
<v 0>what if I'm not on the road?</v>

383
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.440
Yeah.

384
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.830
We don't have obligations enough to be somewhere so after the show.

385
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:34.660
That was so fun.

386
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.493
So fun to do.

387
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.921
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

388
00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:36.191
man,

389
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:37.090
that was a blast.

390
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.231
Yeah.

391
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:37.480
Yeah.

392
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.240
It's so weird how easy it is in Los Angeles.

393
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:45.241
Did just get sort of like reclusive and separated or that stuff doesn't happen

394
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:46.670
that much and it's,

395
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.990
it was a blast but doesn't have as much as well.

396
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.030
Just how everyone is so self involved.

397
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:52.930
We're all so busy and we're adults.

398
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.560
Yeah.

399
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:53.741
I mean,

400
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.371
let's face it,

401
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:56.260
it's not like we're 16 year olds.

402
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.741
We can't,

403
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:58.930
like you don't get a chance to get reclusive.

404
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.220
What do you mean?

405
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.060
Is that what you were saying?

406
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.421
No,

407
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:01.661
no,

408
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:01.871
no.

409
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:02.990
He's saying you get recruited,

410
00:12:02.991 --> 00:12:04.210
you don't get a chance to hang.

411
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:05.230
You don't get a chance to hang.

412
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.680
Okay.

413
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:05.870
Right.

414
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.250
Because people get so sucked into their business and their jobs and their

415
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.084
families.

416
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:10.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

417
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.201
You put,

418
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:12.340
it really becomes,

419
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.000
there's that,

420
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.850
that old cliche that really does hold true.

421
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:17.380
It's like w what?

422
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.820
What's more valuable to you?

423
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.270
Money or happiness because sometimes you do have to make that sort of

424
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:22.751
distinction.

425
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:23.080
Yeah.

426
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.913
Like you have to say,

427
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.401
look,

428
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:24.541
I,

429
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:26.110
I could use some more money,

430
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:26.651
but you know what?

431
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.070
I will have a great fucking time if I hang out with my friends right now.

432
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.750
How much,

433
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.970
how much should I spend trying to collect money?

434
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.830
How much should I spend hanging out with my friends?

435
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.500
Because it seems like the friends part makes me happier.

436
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.270
So like how do you figure that out?

437
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.201
And along the line,

438
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:45.160
I think a lot of us get obligations and mortgages and what have you.

439
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:49.510
That starts leaning you towards the money side instead of towards the fun side.

440
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.510
And that's like really what turns people in.

441
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:53.350
The old men.

442
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.101
<v 2>Yes.</v>

443
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:54.970
That's how you get home.

444
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:55.480
Hunched,

445
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.010
hunched down and sick.

446
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.431
Yeah.

447
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:58.120
I like to,

448
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.953
uh,

449
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.700
<v 0>say no to jobs.</v>

450
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.890
Um,

451
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.350
I,

452
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.050
my main Gig is like editing and,

453
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:05.170
uh,

454
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.880
it's hard to say no to a job when they're offering you money in it.

455
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:08.710
Right.

456
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.330
But you work a lot.

457
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.950
I've been working too much the last few years,

458
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:16.330
but now I came to this realization that I gotta start saying no to jobs.

459
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:16.961
Now I'm here,

460
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:19.030
I have today off and I can come in and do this.

461
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.840
Yeah.

462
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.680
It's just fun.

463
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.450
It's fun to just be able to chill,

464
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.380
to have a day off.

465
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.610
That's one of the things that I kind of really scared me about doing that Scifi

466
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:28.211
show again.

467
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:28.601
It was like,

468
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:30.670
I don't want to be in that position again where I'm just like,

469
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.160
every minute of every day is completely filled up.

470
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.821
That's,

471
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:34.361
that's not,

472
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:35.430
that's not enjoyable.

473
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.333
You know?

474
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.880
It's not enjoyable to be that busy like that shit could fuck with your head at a

475
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:40.631
certain point in time.

476
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:41.560
You brain wants a break,

477
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.960
<v 2>needs a break and you,</v>

478
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.480
but then when you're working on stuff that you want to be working on it,

479
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.440
it's your own thing.

480
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:48.940
It doesn't feel like work at all.

481
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:49.840
It just feels,

482
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.380
I don't know exactly.

483
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.110
Something completely different and that's what it's all about.

484
00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:54.260
Okay.

485
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.130
<v 0>Going into that zone,</v>

486
00:13:55.131 --> 00:13:58.250
but then you have to stop that zone and just do nothing for a while.

487
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.730
Yeah.

488
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.440
Can only be in crazy work load it.

489
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.050
That's very smart of you.

490
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.190
You got to recover.

491
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.520
Cause some people don't get that and they get frazzled or then they find

492
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.383
Adderall.

493
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.350
Yeah.

494
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.560
No.

495
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.870
Then they start hating their work.

496
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.520
They hate what they're doing.

497
00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:13.760
Yeah.

498
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.061
Yeah.

499
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:14.811
That can happen too,

500
00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:15.220
for sure.

501
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.320
<v 2>Or even worse when they're not working,</v>

502
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:20.830
they start feeling guilty when they're not working on the time because they're

503
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:21.670
so used to that.

504
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:23.020
So even when they get a break,

505
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.070
that break is just riddled with this sense of despair and guilt and like,

506
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:27.851
oh fuck man,

507
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:28.450
I hope,

508
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.100
I hope the next job comes.

509
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.650
<v 0>I used to totally be like that with vacations.</v>

510
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:34.090
I can never enjoy vacations.

511
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.650
I couldn't just relax,

512
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.820
couldn't just sit around.

513
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.010
I think I should be doing something right now.

514
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.280
Yeah.

515
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.260
I can't enjoy vacations most.

516
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.790
I mean they're mostly a pain in the ass.

517
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:43.990
Especially when you travel.

518
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.680
Yeah.

519
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.513
Like a trip.

520
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:50.500
So now I think of being on vacation is staying at home and like trimming a Bush

521
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.120
or something like for me that's,

522
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.060
that's relaxing,

523
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.481
right?

524
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:55.040
Well that's because he's worked so much.

525
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.410
I think if you got tired of the same spot though,

526
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:58.730
a real vacation is fun.

527
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.170
Vacations are fun.

528
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.330
If you're going with the right people,

529
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.261
you know,

530
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:06.470
as long as they're not work too and you can all enjoy each other's company so

531
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:06.860
much.

532
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.640
You forget about the work aspect of like hug hall and all the luggage and all

533
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:12.450
the bullshit and going to the airport.

534
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.323
But if you could,

535
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.240
if you go on vacation with people that you really love and they're fun to be

536
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:17.540
with,

537
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.410
it's really fun.

538
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.323
It's a blast.

539
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.200
It's really fun.

540
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.260
And if he can get away from a place that has cell phone service,

541
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.960
so at least he can dip out,

542
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.260
you can dip out of it for a little bit.

543
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.730
My friends at two junky fide,

544
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.810
they're never going to do that.

545
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.320
I can't.

546
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.071
But you can click it.

547
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:32.450
You can pick an up place that's,

548
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:32.781
you know,

549
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:33.890
that's going to be off the grid.

550
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.131
Well,

551
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:35.960
my friend Steve doesn't have a phone at all.

552
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.230
He doesn't have,

553
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.180
he doesn't have a phone.

554
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:38.910
It doesn't use,

555
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.930
does he have a land line?

556
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.550
Doesn't,

557
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.400
you know,

558
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.000
his wife has phones.

559
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.601
She has a phone.

560
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:45.770
She actually works for Google.

561
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.360
It's got a hilarious,

562
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.021
you know,

563
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:50.640
she's dope ass Google phones and um,

564
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:51.650
he's,

565
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.730
he's very bright guy,

566
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.600
very smart guy,

567
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.140
but he just feels like the intrusion.

568
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.490
He's a professor at Stanford.

569
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.890
He feels like the intrusion of technology in his life is unacceptable and he

570
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:04.461
won't accept to it.

571
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:06.140
And I really loved the fact that he's like that.

572
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:06.631
You know,

573
00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:06.800
it's,

574
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.300
it's one of those contrarion things.

575
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.860
It's sometimes it's annoying when people go,

576
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:11.030
I don't even have a TV.

577
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.320
But yeah,

578
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.011
this guy,

579
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:14.620
I know what he's really all about.

580
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.120
It really is a brilliant guy who has thought this through.

581
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:17.840
It was like,

582
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.673
fuck you,

583
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.200
my friend Brent find me every minute of every day.

584
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:21.610
Yeah.

585
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.600
My friend Brent Wine Bach doesn't have a phone,

586
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.493
a cell phone.

587
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.900
We only has a land line and an answering machine too.

588
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:27.471
Good for him,

589
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:28.010
man.

590
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.480
Look if you can pull it off.

591
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:30.314
Good for you.

592
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.640
I can pull it off though.

593
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.450
I love it.

594
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.330
I know sometimes I'm sitting there and hanging out with him and I'm looking at

595
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:36.500
my phone and I look over at him.

596
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.011
I'm like,

597
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.970
he's just content.

598
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.890
Just having his surroundings.

599
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.240
Just being in that.

600
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:41.781
Yeah,

601
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:42.650
he's better than us.

602
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.960
No,

603
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.441
but I'm like,

604
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:46.251
I love my phone.

605
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:47.120
I'm not going to get rid of it,

606
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:48.140
but like he wins.

607
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.770
Okay.

608
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.360
What we win because we get phones.

609
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:51.291
Yeah.

610
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:52.930
You get to be the guy that everybody talks about.

611
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.420
He lives on the mountain and he chops wood.

612
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.540
He doesn't have water.

613
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.490
He gets his water from the river and get the fuck out of him.

614
00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.390
He doesn't flaunt it.

615
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:00.410
I'm not saying he flaunts it.

616
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:00.501
No,

617
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:00.921
I mean I'm not.

618
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:02.150
The guy in the mountain doesn't either.

619
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:03.110
Everybody talks about them.

620
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.530
Oh,

621
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.920
right,

622
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.810
so he wins because they know he's up there.

623
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.900
He becomes legend thousand 14.

624
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.870
<v 4>I've been listening to that Pressfield's book,</v>

625
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.520
the war of art again,

626
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:18.030
he says that checking your phone over and over again is a resistance to the

627
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:21.070
artistic impulse because you,

628
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.530
you can't handle the fact that you're,

629
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.520
all of this stuff wants to come out of you and it's painful and it comes out or

630
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:28.360
it's just intense.

631
00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:32.980
So you try to avoid that by looking at your phone all the time cause it keeps

632
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:34.360
you from seeing him.

633
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.440
What if

634
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.520
<v 0>Twitter is your art?</v>

635
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.331
Yeah,

636
00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:37.031
but is it really,

637
00:17:37.031 --> 00:17:37.890
it's a very good point.

638
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:38.101
No,

639
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:41.280
for some people it is Jenny high five for her it is.

640
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.140
She says hilarious Shit.

641
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.910
Um,

642
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.430
uh,

643
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.570
any comedian who's making jokes on there and me and I was sort of making a joke

644
00:17:48.571 --> 00:17:48.781
there,

645
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:50.100
but it is some truth to that.

646
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.791
<v 5>Like my friend,</v>

647
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:51.750
my friend slash lean.

648
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:53.300
You met her from Toronto.

649
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.770
W W W do you did Toronto with me.

650
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:56.011
Did you,

651
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:58.410
did Toronto just caught her in Chicago with me.

652
00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.340
You never met her?

653
00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.881
I haven't met her.

654
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:00.714
She's very funny.

655
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.940
But she's just an internet comedian.

656
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:03.991
I mean she,

657
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.430
she's never gone on stage.

658
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.510
Like she was like trying to work her way to getting on stage and doing it,

659
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:10.300
but said look,

660
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:10.951
some health problems,

661
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:13.660
she broke her hip and they have to like take some rods out of her hip was go

662
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.590
real thing where she can't walk for like a long time after they do the

663
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:17.110
operation,

664
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.943
she's putting it off.

665
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.230
Um,

666
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.650
but she's fucking hilarious and she's got a shit load of Twitter followers and

667
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.970
it's all just that.

668
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.870
So in that sense he can't be right about that cause she has like a regular job.

669
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.030
She does use Twitter as her art.

670
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.630
I think there's,

671
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.680
yeah of course there's some like digital artists or something just being about

672
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:35.280
semantics.

673
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.780
But I think that like there's a kind of processing that goes on in your life

674
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:41.460
where you're absorbing stuff,

675
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.500
you're seeing things and hearing things.

676
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:46.410
A lot of this stuff you don't even know you're seeing and hearing and it's

677
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.050
something inside of you is kind of processing.

678
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.480
And then when you like are always looking at the internet,

679
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.630
not tweeting those moments where you aren't making those great,

680
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.120
but what if you're absorbing barn doors and stuff that's,

681
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.163
that's not a bad thing.

682
00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.680
What if you're reading things and learning new stuff because then things that

683
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:05.520
you're reading are often like you're absorbing this kind of like,

684
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:09.420
did you see how a computer generated the first news story about the earthquake?

685
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.790
It just spit out a news story about the earthquake.

686
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.730
Like it's computer and it looked like a person wrote it.

687
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.640
It's that easy to mimic that kind of variety,

688
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.580
but that kind of writing is like so empty.

689
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:25.200
It's empty calories where if you start absorbing other shit like really good

690
00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:25.621
writing,

691
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:26.311
like really,

692
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:30.000
really good writing or awesome nonfiction like that.

693
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:30.711
Truman Capote,

694
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.250
he book in cold blood.

695
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:34.200
If you start like bringing that stuff in,

696
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.560
then that whatever it was processing inside of you,

697
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:38.760
those are the ingredients.

698
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.511
You know what I mean?

699
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.890
It's like you're providing yourself with richer ingredients to flavor your life

700
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:44.161
with,

701
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:44.761
to flavor,

702
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:48.210
whatever that next bout of inspiration is.

703
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:50.250
You know the next thing that comes out of you?

704
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.630
It.

705
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.130
Do you want it to be flavored with lifeless,

706
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:56.430
CNN articles about the fucking Malaysian plane disappearing.

707
00:19:56.431 --> 00:19:58.470
Makes them with like read it today.

708
00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:01.320
I learned that there's one chicken and Cuba.

709
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.180
Do you like that shit's cool,

710
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.750
but he got to like pepper it with some.

711
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.511
It's nice to have.

712
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:06.870
Oh yeah.

713
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.900
Then you get the book reader APP and you get in cold blood on your phone.

714
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.243
Well yeah.

715
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.340
You're talking about an audible book when you're talking about audible.com

716
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:17.581
anyway,

717
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:20.750
how amazing it is to use audible.com no,

718
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:20.971
look,

719
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:21.804
you're totally right.

720
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.681
You're totally right.

721
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:23.311
I agree with you,

722
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:24.360
but I don't think it's neat.

723
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.250
I don't think it's a one or the other thing.

724
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.240
I think it's both.

725
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.330
I think for sure there's a lot of times when I'm distracting myself when I'm

726
00:20:30.331 --> 00:20:31.164
looking at my phone,

727
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.160
but there's other times where I'm actually like writing in a way.

728
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.400
Right.

729
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:35.581
You know,

730
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:36.800
because like someone will say something.

731
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.260
I'll say what's a funny thing to say back to that her and then I'll come up with

732
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:42.960
something like I'm exercising my create end.

733
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.590
I'm also interacting with people we show I think is important.

734
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.693
I really do.

735
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.400
I think

736
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.920
<v 1>at the very least putting stuff out there,</v>

737
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.450
it's like it's very important.

738
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.950
It's very important that people,

739
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.630
if someone wants to like you,

740
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:58.690
if they want to like you for comedy or they want to like you for you know,

741
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:02.770
videos that you put online and they know you and they like you actually like

742
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:02.861
you,

743
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.490
like you,

744
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.250
like they like you from you talking and they like you from you.

745
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:07.390
Writing things on Twitter,

746
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.190
like there's a connection there,

747
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.820
you know,

748
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.490
that I think is valuable for all of us.

749
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:12.881
You know,

750
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:14.740
I get a lot out of other people's tweets.

751
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.720
I get a lot out of other people's blogs.

752
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.030
I got a lot of other people's podcasts,

753
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:19.660
you know,

754
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.140
it's not just something that you and I are a part of like the distribution of

755
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:23.291
it.

756
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:24.220
We receive it a lot.

757
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:25.150
I listen to podcasts.

758
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.280
I was listening to radio lab all the way up here.

759
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:29.200
He ever listened to that radio lab.

760
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:31.180
And then why say it's fucking fantastic?

761
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.350
That's really good.

762
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.370
It's about,

763
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.090
um,

764
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.530
do you know that expression?

765
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.190
Uh,

766
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.930
you can neither confirm nor deny.

767
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.040
I heard that one.

768
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.910
That's a great episode.

769
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.271
Yeah,

770
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:40.691
it was,

771
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:40.961
wasn't,

772
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:42.070
it really is amazing.

773
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.950
It's that that expression came from a Russian submarine that the,

774
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.170
the government found and it was a nuclear submarine that sank.

775
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.750
The Russians couldn't find any Americans found it and they,

776
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.230
they pulled it out of the ocean and when they were pulling it out of the ocean,

777
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.681
the,

778
00:21:56.681 --> 00:22:00.490
there was like a freedom of Information Act request to find out what they had

779
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:04.660
gotten or what had happened and they couldn't figure out how to deal with it

780
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:08.380
because it was in 1974 and it was post Watergate and everybody's kind of

781
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:11.050
freaking out about privacy and about,

782
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.500
you know,

783
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.310
uh,

784
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.910
transparency in the press and about just distribution of information that was

785
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.330
important and constitutional really kind of interesting in this day and age to

786
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:20.200
listen to this story.

787
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.590
So the CIA had a real issue because on one hand they have an obligation to keep

788
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:26.530
secrets,

789
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.540
especially if they think that those secrets could,

790
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.470
if they got out,

791
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.080
could somehow another endanger the safety of Americans.

792
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.760
So they have that on one hand.

793
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.930
And then on the other hand,

794
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.380
they had the freedom of information act that said that they had to tell the

795
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:41.980
people what was going on because they had requested is a freedom of information.

796
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:43.180
You can't hold this information back.

797
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.830
Did you find the nuclear submarine?

798
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.100
So what they said was we can neither confirm nor deny that we have found this

799
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:51.304
sub,

800
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:56.430
but we can say that hypothetically if we were to find a sub that we would not

801
00:22:56.621 --> 00:22:58.870
talk about it for interest of national security,

802
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.520
which is hilarious.

803
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.570
And that became what they called a Glo Mar response because it was global marine

804
00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:09.160
was the company that was pulling this,

805
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.970
this submarine out submarine that was by the way,

806
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.260
some insane like miles deep in the,

807
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.200
in the ocean.

808
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.820
Like they had to pull this fucking thing out.

809
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.800
It was like insanely heavy.

810
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:22.960
Something like 6 million pounds.

811
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.180
And they're pulling a submarine out,

812
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.800
like with a giant claw out of the back of a boat.

813
00:23:27.801 --> 00:23:28.960
That's huge rescue mission.

814
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.950
They involve evolved.

815
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:34.150
Howard Hughes had to pretend that he was mining for oil there so that he could

816
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:38.230
have cover for why they're there with his giant call so that the Soviets didn't

817
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:41.110
think that they had found it and they intercepted them in the middle of their,

818
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.550
their extraction.

819
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.680
It's like a white ally without lying.

820
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.320
Exactly.

821
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.010
It's basically a way

822
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.843
<v 5>to say yes,</v>

823
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.110
but you can't say yes.

824
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.650
Radio Lab NYC got you guys got to download.

825
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.120
They're all excellent.

826
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:54.050
They're so good.

827
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.150
A nurse turned me onto it at this,

828
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:56.351
uh,

829
00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:59.570
the clinic where I get my back treated at and she was just raving about it.

830
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:01.400
So much so that I had to check it out.

831
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.611
Yeah,

832
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:02.570
they're really good,

833
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:02.901
man.

834
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:04.580
They're very refined yet.

835
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:05.840
It's totally different than what we do,

836
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.450
but it's very nicely edited.

837
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.490
Yeah.

838
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:09.800
Yeah.

839
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.400
It's good.

840
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.911
But they do it.

841
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:12.920
The sound and the sound design.

842
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.720
It's really cool.

843
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:13.970
Yeah.

844
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.140
It's really creative,

845
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:16.310
but not intrusive.

846
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.200
It doesn't intrude in the story.

847
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.260
It doesn't intrude.

848
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.480
It actually picks it up.

849
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.700
It actually enhances it.

850
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.380
Yeah,

851
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.860
yeah,

852
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.020
yeah.

853
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.831
With podcasts,

854
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:27.320
you're getting a kind of first draft.

855
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.310
That's all you're getting.

856
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:29.144
You don't get,

857
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.680
you mean podcasts like this?

858
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.630
Unedited.

859
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.463
Yeah,

860
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.910
unedited podcasts are all a first draft.

861
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.650
And then with Twitter too,

862
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:37.520
it's like you're,

863
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.040
it's like a lot of what the Internet is,

864
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:44.600
is the preliminary phases of making something awesome but they never go on to

865
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:45.321
anything else.

866
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:46.120
Whereas like,

867
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.540
it's good to take in stuff like radio lab or stuff where people have tortured

868
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.051
themselves.

869
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:52.850
I don't know if they've towards you themselves with radio lab,

870
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:53.780
but you know what I mean.

871
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:56.300
We're probably have people have agonized over.

872
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.700
That's what standup is when you're seeing is a joke.

873
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.780
You're seeing something that's been refined and refined and refined and in the

874
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:03.890
process of that,

875
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.000
somewhere in the middle of becoming whatever it's going to become as opposed to

876
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:09.800
that first thing that just pops out.

877
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.240
And it seems like people are more into that first thing that pops out right now

878
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:15.710
than they are the ro,

879
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.230
the refining process because refining is,

880
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.200
uh,

881
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.510
is,

882
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.020
is not instant gratification.

883
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:21.321
Well,

884
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:22.154
it's also,

885
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.390
it's definitely that,

886
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.420
but there's a very different experience to listening to radio lab or Dan

887
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.751
Carlin's hardcore history,

888
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:33.020
which is another one that they put together like a show very well edited.

889
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:33.961
There's a very,

890
00:25:33.961 --> 00:25:38.210
it's a big difference between those and a conversation where you're seeing the

891
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:41.720
actual thought process play out with more than one person.

892
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.670
You're seeing them bounce thoughts back and forth.

893
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:46.160
You Wa you feel like you're part of the conversation.

894
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.090
That's what's very different about something like this where they know there's

895
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.590
absolutely no scripting whatsoever.

896
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.360
They know that we're going in here and we,

897
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.600
we didn't know what the fuck we're going to talk about one second to the next,

898
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.980
but there's so much to talk about.

899
00:25:57.981 --> 00:26:01.010
It's impossible to run out of material and go.

900
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.250
So they're watching it all sort form lot.

901
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.580
So even though it is sort of a first draft or in some sort of a way it off,

902
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.850
it provides you a very different experience in something that is polished.

903
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.820
When you watch an anchorman talk and tell you something on the news,

904
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.290
who is that guy?

905
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:16.640
Why is he talking like that?

906
00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:17.410
What's going on.

907
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:17.770
Yeah.

908
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:18.800
That guy's putting on a show.

909
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.030
If you watch your very best friend give you that same piece of information and

910
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:24.230
the privacy of your own home,

911
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.610
it's much more impactful.

912
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:26.630
It's much more real.

913
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:27.464
It feels,

914
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:27.801
you know,

915
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:32.090
if a guy tells you something horrible happened on the news and he's a guy that

916
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.830
you don't even know if he's a fucking human,

917
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:36.350
he's wearing makeup and he's got a tie on,

918
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:37.880
why is he have to wear that outfit?

919
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.670
Why is that outfit so important to distribute information?

920
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.560
I did all I needed to be taken seriously.

921
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.150
We'll be right back.

922
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.340
Well,

923
00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.850
you more Malaysian airline mysteries.

924
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.320
It seems like it used to be newscasters were more trying to fade into the

925
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.010
background.

926
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:53.251
You know,

927
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:55.680
they want it to be like they wanted,

928
00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:56.221
they were there,

929
00:26:56.221 --> 00:26:56.851
but they weren't there.

930
00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:58.170
They were like talking furniture.

931
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.010
But now it's moving more where it's their personalities that were into,

932
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:02.311
you know,

933
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:05.610
especially on Fox News and they get those like super hot.

934
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:06.853
Uh,

935
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.880
of course Nancy Gray.

936
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:10.410
So I know what you're saying.

937
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.920
Dark in and you're out of line.

938
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.960
Not a space of me.

939
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.980
I'm a former prosecutor.

940
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.690
She wears those handcuffs on her neck.

941
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:22.860
Sometimes she does,

942
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.671
but you've seen that,

943
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:23.890
right?

944
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.160
It always makes me think she's,

945
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.610
she might be in the s and the fuck.

946
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:26.801
Yeah,

947
00:27:26.801 --> 00:27:27.210
she is.

948
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.680
I don't really watch a lot of Nancy grace.

949
00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:29.580
She's in the gluttony.

950
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.830
Look at her fucking piano.

951
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:32.011
I mean,

952
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:34.190
she's a tie me up with soap.

953
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.610
She's loves everything.

954
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:36.930
She just takes it all in.

955
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.450
As soon as she gets out of that stiffs tight job,

956
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.920
she just gets oil poured over and their toes massage and shit.

957
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.710
She probably just a phenom for attention.

958
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:47.910
After you try her toilet.

959
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:50.020
Paper's probably just pictures of kidnapped,

960
00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.973
you know,

961
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.680
she's probably not gluten free.

962
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.501
The opposite,

963
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:57.780
like exclusive gluten exclusive.

964
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.470
What's fascinating about a show like hers or Bill O'reilly's is that they,

965
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:03.240
the personalities become like the,

966
00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.380
the main thing.

967
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.130
And people want to tune in every week to see what the personalities have to say

968
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.061
about the news.

969
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:10.740
So it's not just about,

970
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.830
I'm Walter Cronkite and here's the news today,

971
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:15.720
like very professional,

972
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:17.070
but sort of impartial.

973
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.560
What people want is like these editorial type shows.

974
00:28:20.561 --> 00:28:21.780
He's bill O'Reilly shows.

975
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:22.950
We get to hear opinions.

976
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.590
It's on a news channel,

977
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.210
but is it news?

978
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.010
Um,

979
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.230
I guess it's kind of news ish.

980
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.093
No,

981
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.690
it's a fucking opinion piece,

982
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:34.230
man.

983
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.410
You're telling me that during that half hour you have to talk about dead kids.

984
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.850
That's the only thing you could talk about.

985
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:41.340
You have to talk about dead kids every week during the same half hour.

986
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.293
What are you doing?

987
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.800
Is there a lot of shit going on in the world?

988
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.620
Not just one dead kid in Florida.

989
00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.830
You keep fucking harping on.

990
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.880
Not that there's anything.

991
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.490
I mean it's important to talk about dead kids in Florida.

992
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.460
It's important to talk about,

993
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.450
especially when you're selling cars,

994
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.250
you got to lure people in,

995
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:56.491
man,

996
00:28:56.491 --> 00:28:56.731
nothing.

997
00:28:56.731 --> 00:29:00.270
We'll sell a car faster and a cliffhanger where he'd come back to find out how

998
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:01.170
the kid got raped.

999
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:03.840
How do you explain the duck tape?

1000
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:06.450
All of that child's rests.

1001
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.480
We will talk more about how baby Eugene was sodomized in Australia after this

1002
00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:12.520
break.

1003
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.580
Cuts do a fucking Ford commercial.

1004
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:15.480
He never go to Australia.

1005
00:29:15.481 --> 00:29:16.051
They don't have to.

1006
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:17.820
They just data mine in Florida.

1007
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.020
Why leave Florida?

1008
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.760
But Florida has everything you want.

1009
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:22.580
If you're CNN or Fox News.

1010
00:29:22.581 --> 00:29:25.350
Is anybody looking for some fucking shit to get mad about?

1011
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.820
Have you seen that Twitter,

1012
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:27.540
uh,

1013
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.970
Florida man until,

1014
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.833
yeah,

1015
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.520
I'm going to Florida tomorrow.

1016
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.890
I'm going to Miami.

1017
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.783
It's going to be fun.

1018
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.480
But I,

1019
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.870
the thing that I like to think about it,

1020
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.160
like I know that ad space costs money and so that means the story

1021
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.370
<v 4>before the ad space is making the news money.</v>

1022
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.990
So like when a plane crashes and some kind of way distant way,

1023
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:54.520
but in some kind of way that plane crash is going to make CNN some money because

1024
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:57.580
it's selling ad space and when a disaster happens,

1025
00:29:57.581 --> 00:29:59.320
they have more viewers watching.

1026
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.320
So then just a regular Newsweek with general.

1027
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:02.651
Yeah,

1028
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:03.280
I think,

1029
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:03.940
oh fuck.

1030
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.400
Yeah.

1031
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.310
And that's why everyone's getting angry at them.

1033
00:30:07.311 --> 00:30:09.440
Like Jon Stewart did like a whole,

1034
00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:10.040
Oh yeah.

1035
00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.630
Take off of um,

1036
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.990
CNN and they're non news coverage of the Malaysian Airlines,

1037
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.010
how insane it is.

1038
00:30:16.011 --> 00:30:16.520
Are they,

1039
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.540
there's no news,

1040
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:18.001
but they,

1041
00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:21.830
they'll will make new stories out of nothing just because they know you're going

1042
00:30:21.831 --> 00:30:22.320
to tune in.

1043
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.153
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.551
Yeah.

1045
00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:24.230
And that's kind of,

1046
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.441
it's,

1047
00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:27.540
it's something about that is it's like black alchemy,

1048
00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:27.881
you know,

1049
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:29.080
it's like vulture.

1050
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.450
It's,

1051
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.671
yeah,

1052
00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:34.140
you're taking disaster and catastrophe putting it through this lens called the

1053
00:30:34.141 --> 00:30:34.890
news.

1054
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:38.490
And at the other side you're getting paychecks and it's all email.

1055
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.630
<v 1>There's almost nothing positive on in the news.</v>

1056
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:43.880
If you stop and look at the national news,

1057
00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:44.930
whether it's CNN,

1058
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.190
all they're focusing on crisis after crisis after crisis.

1059
00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.350
But that's our fault as people.

1060
00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.860
Cause that's probably what we'd look,

1061
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.490
want to look at more honestly,

1062
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:55.041
click on more.

1063
00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:56.750
I don't think we have enough power.

1064
00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.510
I don't think we have enough power as consumers.

1065
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.021
I think,

1066
00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:00.460
um,

1067
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:00.620
the,

1068
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.070
the idea that it's our fault that they push this on television,

1069
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.190
it's much more their fault than it is our fault.

1070
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.960
The reason being is that one,

1071
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.823
a,

1072
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.180
they're profiting.

1073
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.200
Okay.

1074
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.130
And B,

1075
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.400
they are choosing what to broadcast.

1076
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.620
And when you get people in a loop,

1077
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.960
any kind of thinking or behavior loop,

1078
00:31:20.961 --> 00:31:23.990
it's very hard to get them out of that loop and if they're in a fear loop,

1079
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.060
they were in a fear,

1080
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.090
destruction,

1081
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.631
downfall.

1082
00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:29.330
The economy loop war was Syria,

1083
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.201
this and that,

1084
00:31:30.201 --> 00:31:34.590
and I ran his got of that and Hitler's fucking cloned.

1085
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:35.241
Yeah.

1086
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:36.500
When you get in that loop,

1087
00:31:36.501 --> 00:31:36.801
man,

1088
00:31:36.801 --> 00:31:39.890
that's a hard loop to extract yourself from from,

1089
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.610
it's like it's why ideologues on either side,

1090
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:44.900
especially like on the right,

1091
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.180
like when it comes to certain subjects,

1092
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.020
like they lock onto those subjects and there's no wiggle room at all.

1093
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.500
Like at least CNN will have something like doctor Sanjay Gupta turns around

1094
00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.080
totally on weed.

1095
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:03.110
I mean at 180 degrees now is promoting it now is talking about all these

1096
00:32:03.111 --> 00:32:07.250
children that have had horrible diseases and they found cannabis is the only

1097
00:32:07.251 --> 00:32:09.410
cure for kids with seizures.

1098
00:32:09.411 --> 00:32:13.070
One kid was getting like 300 seizures a week and they got it down to one.

1099
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.720
With marijuana.

1100
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.920
It's Cuba was like seizuring constantly all day and the parents were helpless

1101
00:32:18.921 --> 00:32:20.720
watching it and marijuana curate it.

1102
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.650
At least got it down to one minor seizure and now she's developing all these,

1103
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.940
all this muscular control and she can walk in ways that she's never been able to

1104
00:32:28.941 --> 00:32:29.540
walk before.

1105
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:29.710
I mean,

1106
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.760
it's an incredible story and that would never be on Fox News.

1107
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.540
They just,

1108
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.870
they just wouldn't go with that.

1109
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.561
No,

1110
00:32:36.561 --> 00:32:37.520
I wouldn't go with that.

1111
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.510
No.

1112
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:39.890
They found some reason why

1113
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.200
<v 2>gun control might be a good idea.</v>

1114
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.330
Like if there was some study that came out,

1115
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.430
they wouldn't even be considered a debated,

1116
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.881
you know,

1117
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:48.140
it'd be just attacked,

1118
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.340
attacked,

1119
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:53.450
like you couldn't have someone come on that was like a really brilliant,

1120
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:55.370
thoughtful Republican and said,

1121
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:55.731
listen,

1122
00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:57.530
I never thought about gun control before,

1123
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.860
but this new study tells me like maybe we do need much more stringent set of

1124
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:04.100
guidelines.

1125
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:09.100
It's fucking cool how if you go back and watch early Fox News howling about

1126
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:10.400
Obama,

1127
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.410
who I wished didn't blow people up with drones,

1128
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.200
but there's some good things about him too.

1129
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:18.380
You there is,

1130
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.340
it's not all black and white,

1131
00:33:19.341 --> 00:33:19.851
but they were like,

1132
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:21.530
this guy's going to ruin the country.

1133
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.450
It's going to crash the economy.

1134
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.740
We're all fucked.

1135
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.310
Meanwhile the economy is doing much better right now.

1136
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.090
Is that true?

1137
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.670
Yeah,

1138
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:30.500
sure.

1139
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.861
Yeah.

1140
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:31.694
I don't understand it.

1141
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.110
Well the stock market's doing pretty good.

1142
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:33.351
Yeah.

1143
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:33.610
But I've,

1144
00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:33.780
I've,

1145
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.390
I keep hearing it's inflated.

1146
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.600
I keep hearing that there we're ready for another bubble that collapsed and

1147
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:39.950
they've just sort of built up the economy.

1148
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.730
Oh Man.

1149
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:41.750
I don't know either.

1150
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:42.580
That's why I'm confused.

1151
00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.650
Confusing cause you don't know how much of that is just more Fox News.

1152
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:50.651
People desperately trying to ignore the fact that the worst nightmare for many

1153
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:51.770
of them happened,

1154
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.730
which is that a black man got elected and then on top of that he fixed the

1155
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:59.960
crater that George Bush had put on the country.

1156
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:01.910
Like when George Bush left office,

1157
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:07.030
he left office like a villain and a Batman movie walking away from a buildings

1158
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.860
that had been just trashed.

1159
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.440
He got us into this shit war and,

1160
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:15.970
and remember that you got us in this shit war for no reason.

1161
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.430
Administration definitely was pretty fucking gross and embarrassing war and he

1162
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:22.400
stood on the aircraft carrier with victory in the background.

1163
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:26.030
Like having accomplished came out of a fucking helicopter is something like

1164
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:26.541
drunk.

1165
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:27.680
He seemed like he was drunk.

1166
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:28.161
He'd been like,

1167
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.690
snort and blow all night and then like,

1168
00:34:29.691 --> 00:34:30.051
fuck it,

1169
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:30.590
let's,

1170
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.300
let's have a victory celebration.

1171
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:34.160
Neither confirm nor deny.

1172
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.470
I agree with Doug on this.

1173
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.141
I thought of a,

1174
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:38.450
uh,

1175
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:39.710
he's demonizing towards Bush.

1176
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:40.850
It wasn't George W.

1177
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.060
Bush.

1178
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.541
Fuck that.

1179
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:42.290
George W.

1180
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.190
Bush was a fucking demon.

1181
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:44.390
Look at that evil man.

1182
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.830
He was an evil little wizard.

1183
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.600
Put a black robe on that son of a bitch.

1184
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.590
Mission accomplished.

1185
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:48.841
Yeah.

1186
00:34:48.841 --> 00:34:49.281
Come on,

1187
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:50.000
look at that guy.

1188
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.350
Put a black robe on him and,

1189
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.520
and it just fits.

1190
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:52.971
Well,

1191
00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:54.770
I'll tell you what he is certainly,

1192
00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.330
I'm a classic historic figure when all sudden done it go back in time,

1193
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.751
you know,

1194
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:00.220
like they'll,

1195
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.860
they'll go back in time and tell stories about the George Washington Cherry tree

1196
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:05.410
incident and you know,

1197
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.680
I cannot tell a lie and all that nonsense.

1198
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.930
And then the dumbest president.

1199
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:09.651
Yeah,

1200
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:12.050
well he was a symbol of,

1201
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.560
you know,

1202
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.490
the excess of this era and we never learned from the stories of,

1203
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:17.031
of history.

1204
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:17.241
Like,

1205
00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:19.070
no one's learning from Rome.

1206
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.520
No one's learning from the,

1207
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.540
from,

1208
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:21.860
you know,

1209
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.440
ancient civilizations that collab due to excess,

1210
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.500
but he's learning.

1211
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.540
It wasn't just excess.

1212
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.440
George W.

1213
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.580
Bush seemed dumb and remember everyone started getting dumb.

1214
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.780
Like not only is like country,

1215
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.950
the whole country started getting dumb because dumb people were like,

1216
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.130
this is

1217
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.180
<v 4>our time.</v>

1218
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.530
We can be presidents.

1219
00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:41.251
Now look,

1220
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:42.960
if one of us has made it to the top,

1221
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.520
any of us can make it to the top.

1222
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:44.741
<v 1>Well,</v>

1223
00:35:44.741 --> 00:35:47.300

Yeah,

1227

let's keep our gut like,

1228
00:35:51.471 --> 00:35:52.304

1229
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.110
I think I'm going to lose some weight,

1230
00:35:54.111 --> 00:35:54.351

1231
00:35:54.351 --> 00:35:55.220
Come on Bro.

1232
00:35:55.221 --> 00:35:56.480
Have a fucking beer.

1233
00:35:56.481 --> 00:35:57.760
Don't go to the gym like a home.

1234
00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.090
All you know there's people like that and you mentioned like however you lost

1235
00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:02.540
it,

1236
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.373
like whatever,

1237
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.603
Paleo Diet,

1238
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.740
Paleo Diet and everything you do,

1239
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.541
that's the,

1240
00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:07.731
yeah,

1241
00:36:07.731 --> 00:36:08.750
that shit ain't good for you,

1242
00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:09.290
Bro.

1243
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:10.790
You're going to get osteoporosis.

1244
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.040
Yeah,

1245
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.630
it's not good enough.

1246
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.411
Fucking calcium.

1247
00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:14.210
B12 seven in there.

1248
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.280
I think that's real similar.

1249
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.630
I think it's real similar.

1250
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.310
People are fucking ridiculous,

1251
00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:22.640
man.

1252
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.660
They want to slow you down.

1253
00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:24.850
If the president's stupid look,

1254
00:36:24.851 --> 00:36:25.311

1255

Yeah.

1262
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:32.921
<v 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1263
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:34.300
probably when the cameras were off,

1264
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.730
he probably had a British actor,

1265
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.673
<v 1>Sam.</v>

1266
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.300
I was watching the fucking inside.

1267
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.590
I'm walking dead.

1268
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.191
Oh yeah.

1269
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:43.470
They have those things where they talked to the cast members.

1270
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.050
Rick is fucking English.

1271
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:46.884
What a great actor.

1272
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.410
He speaks in a proper English accent.

1273
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.200
There's a moment in the show where,

1274
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:51.960
and you're like,

1275
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.830
wait a minute.

1276
00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:56.280
I thought you were Rick would talk like this.

1277
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:56.850
Yeah.

1278
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.541
That's a fake,

1279
00:36:57.541 --> 00:37:00.750
completely fake cowboy Georgia accent.

1280
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.060
I thought he was really a southern guy.

1281
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.381
It was so good.

1282
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:05.490
I thought he was from the south.

1283
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.001
Do you,

1284
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:07.200
have you been watching walking dead?

1285
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.130

1287
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:09.840
I've been getting in the house of cards.

1288
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.490
I want to do one show at a time.

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:13.450
Great.

1292
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:14.283
Yeah.

1293
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.880
You know what else is amazing?

1294
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.340

1295
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.950
Where can people watch that?

1296
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:20.220
Man?

1297
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.180
We're going to watch your show.

1298
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:21.750
Um,

1299
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.820
if you go to youtube and just type in pound house,

1300
00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:24.654
it'll show up.

1301
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.950
Do you have a website for it?

1302
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.540
Is it just youtube or,

1303
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.273
um,

1304
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.093
but uh,

1305
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.330
because we watched it on Dunkin's x-box really?

1306
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:33.441
Sure.

1307
00:37:33.441 --> 00:37:34.274
I've never done before.

1308
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.730
I have an APP that if you go,

1309
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.571
if you have an iPhone,

1310
00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:39.540
there's an as a powerhouse app and you can watch all the episodes on the APP.

1311
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.140
Really?

1312
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:40.441
Yeah.

1313
00:37:40.441 --> 00:37:41.850
Why don't you make an android one bitch?

1314
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.600
My wife fucking why only eyes?

1315
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.453
My friend,

1316
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.350
my friend just made it for me.

1317
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.340
He doesn't know android,

1318
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.560
but powerhouses that Jascha.

1319
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.941
Yeah,

1320
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:53.310
Josh is like a youtube channel network.

1321
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.780
And then they also have this other network called [inaudible] and it's on that

1322
00:37:57.781 --> 00:37:58.614
one.

1323
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.410
There's youtube channel networks.

1324
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.640
Oh,

1325
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.473
that's the new thing.

1326
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.171
Whoa.

1327
00:38:04.171 --> 00:38:05.070
That's kind of weird.

1328
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:05.630
Why don't,

1329
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.720
I don't know how I feel about that.

1330
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:07.820
I'm confused.

1331
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.601
<v 4>It's pretty cool.</v>

1332
00:38:08.601 --> 00:38:09.260
I mean they fight,

1333
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.130
it's cool cause it like they get money from somewhere to fund this crazy shit,

1334
00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:14.060
which is kind of awesome.

1335
00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:14.411
<v 1>Right.</v>

1336
00:38:14.411 --> 00:38:15.250
So how are they doing that?

1337
00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:15.641
So they're,

1338
00:38:15.641 --> 00:38:19.150
they're becoming like a network online.

1339
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:19.780
Yeah.

1340
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.613
Huh.

1341
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.330
I think it's cool because,

1342
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:24.460
I mean,

1343
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.180
they,

1344
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.270
my show probably wouldn't have happened unless someone funded,

1345
00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:30.190
they were like write some episodes of this

1346
00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.240
<v 4>because you need that.</v>

1347
00:38:31.241 --> 00:38:34.870
You need Weirdos with money to make sure to let good stuff come.

1348
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.070
Cause like that.

1349
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v 2>If you pitch,</v>

1350
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.910
imagine pitching pound as to like some normal square.

1351
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:40.361
Oh,

1352
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:41.080
that would ruin it.

1353
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.231
Yeah.

1354
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:41.681
They'd be like,

1355
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:42.130
well,

1356
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:42.401
you know,

1357
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:45.790
make it be like this and for this demographic and blah blah blah.

1358
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.990
Make it more for girls.

1359
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.680
Remember me and Duncan got that note once.

1360
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:51.910
Can you skew female?

1361
00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:52.091
Oh,

1362
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:52.421
come on,

1363
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:53.980
please tell me the context.

1364
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.990
Uh,

1365
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.810
well,

1366
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:57.150
well,

1367
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.401
you know,

1368
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.050
the cool thing is it totally worked out,

1369
00:38:59.051 --> 00:38:59.980
which is that we were,

1370
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.290
it's this show that is coming out on MTV other um,

1371
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.740
at the end of April,

1372
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.860
which is another youtube sort of like online whatever web channel called story

1373
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:12.010
pig.

1374
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.280
But we had originally pitched it to them as a show called creeps.

1375
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.110
Creeps was the name of the show.

1376
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:17.501
And we're like,

1377
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:20.530
we just want to do really dark comedy sketches.

1378
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.970
And one of the questions we got.

1379
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.090
Oh,

1380
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.570
they were like,

1381
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.260
what's the show about?

1382
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.411
Well,

1383
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:23.831
it's like,

1384
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:23.990
you know,

1385
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.560
I mentioned like a serial killer.

1386
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.120
We had like a list of stuff like serial killers.

1387
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.280
Like what if it's serial killer made a sketch show,

1388
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.630
like something like that.

1389
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.130
And then the one of the things like,

1390
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:33.341
cool,

1391
00:39:33.341 --> 00:39:33.761
we love it.

1392
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:34.900
And then like next week they were like,

1393
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:36.000
can you say it?

1394
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.270
Can you skew female to make it more female friendly?

1395
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.240
It's called creeps like creep.

1396
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:44.530
What kind of conversation is that?

1397
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.760
Like they bring you in.

1398
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.350
Like it described to me the scenario,

1399
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.250
are you in a room with these guys?

1400
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.130
Like an email?

1401
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.810
It's an email.

1402
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:50.501
But then we said,

1403
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:51.221
no we can't.

1404
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:52.840
And what's cool is they let us do it.

1405
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:53.470
And they were,

1406
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.180
they were really cool and I didn't give us any,

1407
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:57.670
they bet they didn't really give us notes that many.

1408
00:39:57.671 --> 00:39:58.211
They didn't give us.

1409
00:39:58.211 --> 00:39:58.391
No,

1410
00:39:58.391 --> 00:39:59.224
they were totally cool.

1411
00:39:59.300 --> 00:39:59.981
Super Cool.

1412
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:01.210
So that was awesome.

1413
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:01.841
But you get that,

1414
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:03.910
that's what you get from the Internet and that's what you get.

1415
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:04.750
So while you just say,

1416
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:05.380
I can't,

1417
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:05.591
you know,

1418
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.424
it's not going to work.

1419
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.600
I have to do my own thing.

1420
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.490
And if they let you do it,

1421
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:10.270
it turns out good.

1422
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.103
Like townhouse.

1423
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.490
I didn't get any notes or anything.

1424
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:13.150
They just said,

1425
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.110
is your episode done?

1426
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:14.920
And I just turned it in.

1427
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.510
So that's why it's so weird.

1428
00:40:16.511 --> 00:40:16.900
You know,

1429
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.090
you really tell it's one guy's vision.

1430
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.800
There was too many people involved in that.

1431
00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:20.971
They would,

1432
00:40:20.971 --> 00:40:22.060
it would get fucked up.

1433
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.170
And it's not that it's,

1434
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:23.471
again,

1435
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:24.400
it's not an either or thing.

1436
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:25.570
It's not that too many people.

1437
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.440
Like sometimes a bunch of people can work together and they can produce a

1438
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:30.274
masterpiece.

1439
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:30.690
You know,

1440
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:31.130
they just,

1441
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.470
they just work together great.

1442
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:34.300
And they know how to do it and they enhance each other.

1443
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.280
But a lot of times a show like yours,

1444
00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:39.730
like the only way to really do it and have it that unique and interesting.

1445
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:40.451
It's got to,

1446
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:41.900
you got to have nobody fucking with you.

1447
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.690
Can we watch an episode he didn't watch?

1448
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:43.830
You?

1449
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.260
Sure.

1450
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.910
Can we watch the skateboard episode?

1451
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:47.680
It's,

1452
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.330
it's like kind of a music video though.

1453
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.530
It's so funny though,

1454
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:50.741
man.

1455
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:51.574
We should,

1456
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.913
but it's your shit.

1457
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.720
If you feel weird of watching something with us,

1458
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.190
we don't have to do it.

1459
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.360
It's up to you.

1460
00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.590
We'll leave it up to you.

1461
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:00.880
Why don't you watch it,

1462
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.241
Dunkin,

1463
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:02.740
if you think that's a good one to watch.

1464
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:04.270
But which one do you think's a good one?

1465
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.440
Did you see the one with Dunkin?

1466
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:06.191
No,

1467
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:06.670
I didn't.

1468
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:07.540
I only saw one

1469
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:09.940
very briefly.

1470
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.721
That story.

1471
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:11.590
That's more story.

1472
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:12.790
The skateboard you could watch.

1473
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.920
I only said that one cause he's,

1474
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.040
I think people would appreciate it.

1475
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:16.930
That one based on the things you've served me.

1476
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.801
Yeah,

1477
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:18.551
it's pretty good.

1478
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:19.720
But I don't know man.

1479
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:20.290
You know,

1480
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:20.940
whatever.

1481
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.660
How about I know p and you play whatever you want.

1482
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.081
Yeah,

1483
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:23.914
you go pee.

1484
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:24.580
Go Pee.

1485
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.480
Don't jerk off man.

1486
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:27.100
That's not necessarily,

1487
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.340
if you get tense sometimes that's the best way to handle it out.

1488
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:30.611
Okay,

1489
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:32.140
so what does the episode called?

1490
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.680
What's skateboarding?

1491
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:34.514
Video

1492
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.191
<v 5>powerhouse.</v>

1493
00:41:35.191 --> 00:41:35.600
Skate.

1494
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.390
Townhouse Gate.

1495
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.930
All right,

1496
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:40.740
we're going to watch this and we're going to talk shit about the listeners while

1497
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.480
I was going on.

1498
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.190
We'll shut her mics off and enjoy this.

1499
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.143
All right,

1500
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.470
and if you're a listening,

1501
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.330
it's not as good as watching it right now.

1502
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.883
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1503
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.820
<v 5>Might not even work.</v>

1504
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.241
Oh yeah,

1505
00:41:51.241 --> 00:41:52.051
I forgot about this.

1506
00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:53.460
Is the listeners in there are people watching?

1507
00:41:53.461 --> 00:41:54.031
We can't show it.

1508
00:41:54.031 --> 00:41:54.391
You're right.

1509
00:41:54.391 --> 00:41:54.930
Doug,

1510
00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.830
why didn't I listen to you?

1511
00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.581
There's not,

1512
00:41:56.581 --> 00:41:57.191
you didn't show it.

1513
00:41:57.191 --> 00:41:58.770
Show the one w that urine.

1514
00:41:59.130 --> 00:41:59.461
Okay.

1515
00:41:59.461 --> 00:41:59.881
Showed you.

1516
00:41:59.881 --> 00:42:00.300
Okay.

1517
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:00.931
Which one's that?

1518
00:42:00.931 --> 00:42:01.350
Dinner.

1519
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:01.950
Dinner.

1520
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.491
Thank God.

1521
00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:03.360
We were thinking ahead.

1522
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.230
What did you spend on under,

1523
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:06.300
yeah,

1524
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.650
and people say pot flux.

1525
00:42:07.651 --> 00:42:08.490
Were you thinking,

1526
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.140
<v 6>okay.</v>

1527
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.040
<v 5>It doesn't at all.</v>

1528
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:11.791
Not at all.

1529
00:42:11.791 --> 00:42:12.570
Never has.

1530
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.870
Not once we forgot about fucking iTunes.

1531
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.253
We forgot about,

1532
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.240
I forgot there was an audience.

1533
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.400
9 million people every month.

1534
00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.110
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1535
00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:25.381
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1536
00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:26.214

1537
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.063
Cooking dinner.

1538
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.021
It's today.

1539
00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:35.021
My guest on the pound cast is comedian and annoying friend Brendan Walsh.

1540
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.650
Shots fired.

1541
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:39.830
<v 7>How's things with you and the lady?</v>

1542
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.450
She's kind of mad at me right now.

1543
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.440
Why is she mad at you?

1544
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.730
A ticket into my friend's mansion and she wanted to stay in it.

1545
00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:47.570
You know how girls get all pissed off of us stuff?

1546
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.640
Well if you really like or you should do something special,

1547
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.200

1548
00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:51.701
Cookie guys.

1549
00:42:51.701 --> 00:42:52.534
An intimate dinner.

1550
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.503
Who's frog?

1551
00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.531
This frog.

1552
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:56.960
He's like the number one la celebrity chef.

1553
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:59.630

Food is totally mind blowing.

1559
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.510
He uses ingredients that you didn't even know where ingredients.

1560
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.200

1561
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.033

1566
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:15.650
Why will you be there?

1567
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:16.130
Ooh.

1568
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.230
See you guys help frog plate the food.

1569
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:19.490
Make sure you're good on refills.

1570
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.300
Okay,

1571
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.370
well if my girlfriend doesn't like it,

1572
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:23.204
I'm going to have to.

1573
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.483
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1574
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.110
<v 5>This is a lot of shit you people are missing if you're not watching this.</v>

1575
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.431
<v 6>Hi.</v>

1576
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:38.630
So this is how it's going to work.

1577
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.280
There's not going to be a manual or anything.

1578
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:41.170
Frogs.

1579
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:42.410
She's going to bring out the food.

1580
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.730
It might look kind of weird,

1581
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.070
but just eat it because trust me,

1582
00:43:46.071 --> 00:43:47.600
it's going to be amazing.

1583
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.460
Awesome.

1584
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.090
Okay,

1585
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:49.923
three times.

1586
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.403
Hi,

1587
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.400
my name's frog.

1588
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.760
What we have here is any poison oak salad.

1589
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.400
It's topped with sun dried acorns.

1590
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.910
Those are cactus needles,

1591
00:43:59.911 --> 00:44:00.744
sprinkles.

1592
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.980
The whole thing has been drenched in a rattlesnake venom.

1593
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:08.981
Vinegarette and here's an Amazonian Iowasca t to wash it all down.

1594
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:11.973
I'm sure.

1595
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.620
I don't know about an salad.

1596
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.720
You're so boring was talking about you never want to try anything new.

1597
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:25.920
I'll try it.

1598
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.191
I'll try.

1599
00:44:26.191 --> 00:44:27.300
It looks good.

1600
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.003
Thank you.

1601
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.970

1604
00:44:51.401 --> 00:44:51.680
Yeah.

1605
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.570
They really have to watch.

1606
00:44:52.571 --> 00:44:53.710
The IOS is kicking in.

1607
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.533
It's almost over.

1608
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.071
<v 6>This bad shit.</v>

1609
00:44:57.071 --> 00:44:58.780
Battered hamster tenders were amazing.

1610
00:44:58.781 --> 00:44:59.760
Why did you not eat any?

1611
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.020
How's everything tasting guys?

1612
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:02.854

Oh,

1620
00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.090

1621
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:29.100
stuff on top that seaman frogged all over before I brought it out.

1622
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.781
I'm sorry.

1623
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:32.300
My friend says stupid.

1624
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:35.921
Well,

1626
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.320
I don't think it's working out between you two,

1627
00:45:38.321 --> 00:45:38.560
right?

1628
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.250
You know what?

1629
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.030
I think you're right.

1630
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.930
You want to go get a burger?

1631
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:41.903
Oh,

1632
00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.533

1634
00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:50.330

1635
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:54.943

1636
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.010
<v 2>It's fine.</v>

1637
00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.100
It's basically over

1638
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.773
<v 9>one more part.</v>

1639
00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:06.123
<v 10>Oh Shit.</v>

1640
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:08.690
I'm ready for my dance.

1641
00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.650
That's somebody's watch.

1642
00:46:09.651 --> 00:46:13.270
I'll peer the music watching all that play out on him.

1643
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.620
So that's a new addition.

1644
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.060
What you guys are listening.

1645
00:46:17.061 --> 00:46:17.101
Yeah.

1646
00:46:17.101 --> 00:46:17.180
And

1647
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.220
<v 2>you gotta watch it cause it's so much of it is so weird.</v>

1648
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.690
David Lynch like and just cool.

1649
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.180
Lynchian I believe it's very,

1650
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.110
very visual,

1651
00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:25.981
very visual,

1652
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:27.570
but really,

1653
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:28.020
uh,

1654
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.840
distinctly you like,

1655
00:46:29.841 --> 00:46:32.130
you could really see like the same vision,

1656
00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.800
the same sense of humor in every episode.

1657
00:46:34.801 --> 00:46:35.610
It's really fun.

1658
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.120
Thanks man.

1659
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.420
You know,

1660
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.900
that's one of the cool things about something like that where one guy is doing

1661
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:40.351
the whole thing.

1662
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:42.260
I got to give it up to Brent wine back cause he kind of,

1663
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.600
he's kind of like my co writer on it.

1664
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.250
So he's hilarious.

1665
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:47.990
He's hilarious.

1666
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.721
That character.

1667
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:50.750
She plays it.

1668
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.093
So sorry.

1669
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:53.610
I love that one line.

1670
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.563
Whether you in the,

1671
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.391
I was telling him the,

1672
00:46:55.391 --> 00:46:55.981
the line,

1673
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:58.140
when you're doing the open mic in your living room,

1674
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.030
we should collaborate together.

1675
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:00.391
Oh,

1676
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:01.224
that's what's up

1677
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.520
in the context of that fucking strange character.

1678
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.950
And you're watching him for a couple episodes in a row.

1679
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:12.370
It's like all my God,

1680
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:13.590
I couldn't stop giggling.

1681
00:47:13.591 --> 00:47:14.161
It's really,

1682
00:47:14.161 --> 00:47:15.150
really funny stuff,

1683
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:15.480
man.

1684
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:15.751
Man,

1685
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:20.190
I think that TV is he just going to get better and better because the staff like

1686
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:23.370
that because it creates competition and people they can,

1687
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.280
they get to see what's happening without the big risk because when you're making

1688
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:26.821
a TV show,

1689
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.190
there's so much risk involved that you can't really,

1690
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.410
<v 4>there's so much money at stake rather than it is to take a big risk is insane.</v>

1691
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:36.850
You want to just go by the median,

1692
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.820
what then like middle of the road because that's going to sell the most

1693
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:40.690
advertisements,

1694
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:44.920
but when they start seeing people actually liked stuff like that and respond to

1695
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:46.510
it than TV is just going to keep,

1696
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.820
hopefully we'll get better.

1697
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.131
<v 1>Well,</v>

1698
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:48.321
it's,

1699
00:47:48.321 --> 00:47:51.800
the Internet has changed the whole fucking game because the same people that

1700
00:47:51.801 --> 00:47:55.970
watch the Big Bang Theory Watch decapitations,

1701
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.601
you know,

1702
00:47:56.601 --> 00:47:57.830
it's like the same people.

1703
00:47:57.831 --> 00:48:00.380
The same people watch Kim Kardashian sex tape.

1704
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:01.850
Same people will.

1705
00:48:01.851 --> 00:48:03.170
It's just humans.

1706
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:03.620
All right.

1707
00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.810
Just give humans act as to what they want,

1708
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:06.411
you know,

1709
00:48:06.411 --> 00:48:09.690
and when you limit shit because you think somehow or another it's going to

1710
00:48:09.691 --> 00:48:12.320
bottleneck the amount of money you're able to suck out of a show.

1711
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.530
All you're doing is you're limiting how many people are gonna Watch that thing.

1712
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:16.160
Yup.

1713
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.800
I want to see decapitations on that Big Bang theory.

1714
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.810
That would be amazing.

1715
00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.940
I can imagine that she ended it like a red wedding.

1716
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.350
Fuck.

1717
00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.760
All the characters are and they all have their own guillotine.

1718
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:28.460
Yeah,

1719
00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.800
like 12 g and teens all lined up and just be great.

1720
00:48:30.801 --> 00:48:30.891
The,

1721
00:48:30.891 --> 00:48:35.891
I'll just get kidnapped somehow by like a real actual killer who's like doesn't

1722
00:48:36.051 --> 00:48:37.340
understand what they're saying.

1723
00:48:37.341 --> 00:48:38.510
He doesn't even speak English.

1724
00:48:38.511 --> 00:48:41.360
He's thinking he doesn't even get their jokes.

1725
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:47.060
Just starts chopping their hands off and their feed off.

1726
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:48.990
<v 4>He's crying while he's doing it.</v>

1727
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:53.550
That'd be so great.

1728
00:48:53.551 --> 00:48:55.890
It would be so artistic and beautiful and wonderful.

1729
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.730
It's that.

1730
00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.720
That's what's weird about like bill O'Reilly or the Big Bang theory or any of

1731
00:49:00.721 --> 00:49:05.310
those shows is they have this perfect opportunity at any moment to blow people's

1732
00:49:05.311 --> 00:49:09.180
minds by just making 180 degree turn.

1733
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.000
Just turning in some complete opposite direction.

1734
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.230
But imagine if bill had

1735
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:15.280
<v 1>direct an episode of Big Bang theory.</v>

1736
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:15.951
No notes.

1737
00:49:15.951 --> 00:49:16.784
Yes.

1738
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.190
It's going to be a lot of activity.

1739
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.340
You'd have to write it to.

1740
00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.200
You couldn't know I can I,

1741
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.650
if I,

1742
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.210
if I have creative liberties with the script and if I can get any as my and many

1743
00:49:26.211 --> 00:49:26.871
gay teens is,

1744
00:49:26.871 --> 00:49:27.651
I want God,

1745
00:49:27.651 --> 00:49:28.730
that'd be so fun.

1746
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.220
<v 4>That'd be so fun.</v>

1747
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:32.170
If like they had to do that at once a year.

1748
00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:36.910
They had to let underground artists edit and direct their shows just to see what

1749
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:37.651
it would turn into.

1750
00:49:37.651 --> 00:49:37.780
Yeah.

1751
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.201
<v 1>Why?</v>

1752
00:49:38.201 --> 00:49:39.520
That would be a terrible idea.

1753
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.413
Be Fun.

1754
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.480
Yeah.

1755
00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.281
It'd be fun for you,

1756
00:49:42.281 --> 00:49:44.560
but match those stakes shows like sitcoms,

1757
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:45.310
you know,

1758
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:49.780
it's not low stakes because imagine if it was your show and then some fucking Dj

1759
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.890
Doug pound comes on and he's like,

1760
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:52.630
I'd like to direct your show for a week and be like,

1761
00:49:52.631 --> 00:49:53.650
fuck you man,

1762
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.850
we're going to kill your whole cast.

1763
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.031
No,

1764
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:55.990
you're not man.

1765
00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:56.321
No.

1766
00:49:56.321 --> 00:49:57.400
Who wants to watch that shit?

1767
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.031
Listen man,

1768
00:49:58.031 --> 00:49:58.451
trust me.

1769
00:49:58.451 --> 00:50:01.090
Seven 18 it's going to be awesome.

1770
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:03.100
They wake up and it's all a dream though.

1771
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.640
That's the,

1772
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.361
that's the caveat.

1773
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:05.770
Blossom becomes a demon.

1774
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:06.890
Yeah.

1775
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.290
They all start eating babies.

1776
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.000
Ah,

1777
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.120
baby salad every day.

1778
00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:11.860
But we'll just use like rubber baby dolls.

1779
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:12.780
Don't worry.

1780
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.410
<v 4>But if bill O'Reilly came out for one show in drag</v>

1781
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.220
and just it's like this is who I am now.

1782
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.840
It doesn't really explain it.

1783
00:50:21.841 --> 00:50:23.280
Same Guy and he's the same guy.

1784
00:50:23.281 --> 00:50:23.671
He's just like,

1785
00:50:23.671 --> 00:50:24.720
this is who I am.

1786
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.090
This is how I've changed deal with it.

1787
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.010
That would be as

1788
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.000
<v 2>big as GE are,</v>

1789
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:29.900
be as big as Jesus.

1790
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.690
That is how Jesus will come back.

1791
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.980
It will be below right now.

1792
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:38.900
Wilamena we'll Amena O'Reilly and he starts slowly beginning a transformation

1793
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:40.490
until to the female gender.

1794
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:41.690
Yeah,

1795
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.080
that would be incredible.

1796
00:50:43.081 --> 00:50:45.390
It just tells you like the reason why he was like that.

1797
00:50:45.391 --> 00:50:45.681
It was just,

1798
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:46.520
he was scared.

1799
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.670
I was scared all the time that people find out that he identifies with being a

1800
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:52.160
woman and that's where all the hate came from,

1801
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:53.270
the homophobia,

1802
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:54.590
all the Jesus' love,

1803
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:55.780
all that craziness that was,

1804
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:56.860
he was into.

1805
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:57.640
It's really just,

1806
00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.260
I wanted to be a woman and then he just starts putting pictures of his new

1807
00:51:01.261 --> 00:51:05.990
surgical crusty bill O'Reilly pussy up on the screen and people just itch,

1808
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:07.910
causes waves of suicide.

1809
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:09.140
But here's what's crazy.

1810
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.020
People still spot him out at night,

1811
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.340
like dress like a man and he looks perfectly normal and they realize it's just a

1812
00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:17.151
fucking scam.

1813
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:18.350
Like everything else he does.

1814
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.880
He's not really becoming a woman.

1815
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:20.930
It's just a bullshit artist.

1816
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.300
That would be one of the greatest salvage.

1817
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:23.571
No,

1818
00:51:23.571 --> 00:51:25.940
it's what happens is you realize someone's blackmailing him.

1819
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.760
You realize somebody has something worse than that and they're like,

1820
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.181
listen,

1821
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:29.630
bill,

1822
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:30.870
that's like a house of cards move.

1823
00:51:30.871 --> 00:51:33.230
Here's what I want you to do on your show.

1824
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.160
What do you think?

1825
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.053
Oh my God,

1826
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.730
I've got these pictures of you fisting

1827
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.800
<v 5>pansy change the chimps wanted.</v>

1828
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:43.770
I was doing it for Jesus.

1829
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.960
Tie goes in and tide goes out.

1830
00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:46.351
You don't know why.

1831
00:51:46.351 --> 00:51:47.184
I just chimps

1832
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.003
who can explain it.

1833
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:59.510
God moves in mysterious ways while their fist and they did.

1834
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:00.600
Or I don't wear a dress.

1835
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.130
You fucking Cock sucker,

1836
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:03.511
but I'm not.

1837
00:52:03.511 --> 00:52:04.290
When I go out.

1838
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.130
That's my deal.

1839
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.300
My personal life.

1840
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:08.501
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1841
00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:08.951
It's so,

1842
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:10.060
it's so fascinating,

1843
00:52:10.061 --> 00:52:10.301
man.

1844
00:52:10.301 --> 00:52:11.110
And that's the descent.

1845
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:11.401
That's it.

1846
00:52:11.401 --> 00:52:12.520
It's like deceptive.

1847
00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.370
I get it with artists and actors,

1848
00:52:15.371 --> 00:52:17.980
they don't have to reveal their personal lives to anybody.

1849
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:18.280
They don't.

1850
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.001
They don't have to.

1851
00:52:19.001 --> 00:52:21.880
But when you have someone who's an actor like bill O'Reilly,

1852
00:52:21.881 --> 00:52:23.980
and we don't know who he is or what he's really like,

1853
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.460
but when you have somebody who's an actor portraying themselves in this way,

1854
00:52:27.461 --> 00:52:28.870
is this unchanging?

1855
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:34.390
Just monolith of of conservativism then it's,

1856
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:34.931
I think it's,

1857
00:52:34.931 --> 00:52:37.930
it's not fair because you know that guy's got serious fucking problem.

1858
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.141
Yeah.

1859
00:52:38.141 --> 00:52:40.660
But doesn't bill O'Reilly think doesn't,

1860
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.490
he doesn't think of himself as an actor.

1861
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.151
He doesn't,

1862
00:52:43.151 --> 00:52:44.780
I don't think that's being him.

1863
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.300
He thinks he's being,

1864
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.261
or maybe he is,

1865
00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:47.501
you know,

1866
00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:50.290
genuinely being just who he thinks he is.

1867
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.533
Certainly.

1868
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.030
Uh,

1869
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.500
there's certainly moves.

1870
00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.030
He did certainly makes moves.

1871
00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.190
Like the whole tag goes into tacos out thing.

1872
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.420
The guy went to Harvard.

1873
00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.260
Okay.

1874
00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.280
He's not an idiot.

1875
00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.500
He knows fucking gravity causes that.

1876
00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:05.260
He knows the moon because he knows that he knows.

1877
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.360
So when he's saying shit like that,

1878
00:53:07.361 --> 00:53:08.290
you can't explain that he's,

1879
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.153
he's trolling,

1880
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.380
he's getting ratings and he's getting ratings.

1881
00:53:11.381 --> 00:53:12.790
Is getting people on his team.

1882
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.431
I mean he,

1883
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:13.840
he,

1884
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.950
he most certainly is.

1885
00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.760
Do you think it's possible that the whole missing Malaysian airlines thing was

1886
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.730
the plane was hijacked by CNN for ratings?

1887
00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.010
I don't know that a possibility to Dunkin the money

1888
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.691
<v 4>follow the money.</v>

1889
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.660
Who made the most money off this Malaysian plane crash scene and there it's

1890
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:31.680
definitely CNN.

1891
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.840
CNN is raking in the dough.

1892
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:38.370
Everybody who like had those last moments of like plunging into the ocean,

1893
00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:40.350
looking at the person next to them screaming,

1894
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.650
registering that this truly is their last moment in this dimension.

1895
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.150
They're spirits can take comfort knowing that they didn't die for nothing.

1896
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.230
CNN has made probably $300,000 on that plane.

1897
00:53:53.231 --> 00:53:54.180
It never existed.

1898
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.010
And those people in the plane never existed.

1899
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.960
They were completely fabricated names

1900
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.500
and that plane will never be found.

1901
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:02.490
It was an enlist

1902
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.910
<v 1>endless amount of,</v>

1903
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.133
you know,

1904
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.060
completely preposterous.

1905
00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.830
But you know that that was actually what they proposed during operation

1906
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:12.873
Northwoods.

1907
00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:13.660
What is that?

1908
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.110
What was that one in north document was the thing that they,

1909
00:54:17.111 --> 00:54:17.380
uh,

1910
00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:17.810
the,

1911
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:20.130
the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed and uh,

1912
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:25.120
President Kennedy vetoed and the idea was to fake a bunch of attacks on America

1913
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:26.230
to blame on the Cubans.

1914
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:30.910
And one of their ideas was to take a drone airliner and they were going to say

1915
00:54:30.911 --> 00:54:33.310
that a bunch of people were on board and then they take the people off and they

1916
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:36.100
put them in buses and they shuttle them off to somewhere cause they fucking

1917
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.550
finagle people who work for the government in the 1960s every bunch of fake

1918
00:54:39.551 --> 00:54:40.240
names.

1919
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.950
Fly the plane up in the air and explode it,

1920
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.270
blow the plane up.

1921
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.990
And then they were going to have like fake relatives like Ooh I lost a little

1922
00:54:46.991 --> 00:54:47.760
Billy.

1923
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.320
Meanwhile a little Billy doesn't even exist standard with a real person.

1924
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.080
So this plane blows up cause it's a drone.

1925
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.980
And then they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack wanton

1926
00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.940
them obey and they're gonna use all this.

1927
00:54:57.941 --> 00:54:59.140
Blame it all on Castro's.

1928
00:54:59.141 --> 00:55:01.030
We can invade man.

1929
00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:03.550
I listened and that reminds me of your awesome joke.

1930
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.941
I,

1931
00:55:03.941 --> 00:55:04.990
it's an old joke.

1932
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.150
But the thing about like,

1933
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.560
like if we ran it like a Roman emperor,

1934
00:55:08.561 --> 00:55:09.430
if we just decided,

1935
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.173
<v 4>you know like that's,</v>

1936
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:15.650
it's like the empire is hogtied right now because it's got to pretend to be a

1937
00:55:15.651 --> 00:55:16.610
democracy.

1938
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.320
So it's got to come up with shit like that instead of what they used to be able

1939
00:55:20.321 --> 00:55:20.531
to look.

1940
00:55:20.531 --> 00:55:22.400
It could have done back in the old days,

1941
00:55:22.401 --> 00:55:23.234
which is there wouldn't even,

1942
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:24.260
it wouldn't be a question.

1943
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:25.040
<v 1>Yup.</v>

1944
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.360
You just go take the island.

1945
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.930
We were scared because then they would also take us,

1946
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:30.611
you know like we,

1947
00:55:30.611 --> 00:55:31.444
we need,

1948
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.440
we need a populace that is very complacent and we need a populace that's

1949
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:37.580
terrified of violence.

1950
00:55:37.581 --> 00:55:41.120
Even though violence is like super important in order to keep control of the

1951
00:55:41.121 --> 00:55:41.954
populace.

1952
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:42.560
But we need a,

1953
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.880
we need a populace that's looking for civilization.

1954
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:49.910
We don't need a fucking tiredly armed group of 300 million savages that are

1955
00:55:50.421 --> 00:55:52.580
ready to fuck people up and take their oil.

1956
00:55:52.581 --> 00:55:53.840
That's the last thing we want.

1957
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.490
So we want some sort of surrogate taking the oil and some people that we know

1958
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.080
there are heroes and they're over there somehow are involved in oil,

1959
00:56:03.081 --> 00:56:08.081
freeing people free and people from their need to pay more for oil or control or

1960
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.490
whatever the fuck it is.

1961
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:15.650
But as long as the general population is wearing a nice ties and listening to

1962
00:56:15.651 --> 00:56:18.920
the men on the news and not freaking out and wanting to cut his throat,

1963
00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.580
as long as they're not all going fucking barbarian Mongol style.

1964
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:24.040
Because once they start killing

1965
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.750
<v 5>a few people kill a little here,</v>

1966
00:56:25.751 --> 00:56:28.180
killed a little there and people get used to it.

1967
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.350
They get used to a pretty God damn easy.

1968
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.030
And then they start thinking about these cons that are running the government.

1969
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.020
They start thinking about the shitheads like abusive cops.

1970
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:39.340
You see that video that,

1971
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:39.700
uh,

1972
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.690
the thing in a,

1973
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:41.650
was it Arizona,

1974
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.610
Arizona riot,

1975
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.320
this caught blind sides.

1976
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:45.154
This kid,

1977
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:46.330
a little girl.

1978
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.650
What young girl?

1979
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:47.981
Oh,

1980
00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:48.491
play it.

1981
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:49.810
It's fucking horrific.

1982
00:56:49.811 --> 00:56:50.970
So fuck that.

1983
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:53.260
That cop,

1984
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:53.931
what happens to you?

1985
00:56:53.931 --> 00:56:54.371
I don't know.

1986
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:55.091
We'll find out,

1987
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:55.590
but what,

1988
00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:58.300
what I'm getting from people that were there,

1989
00:56:58.301 --> 00:56:59.890
a lot of people that were there tweeted at it,

1990
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:02.080
they were saying the kids were definitely out of control.

1991
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:02.920
Kids were drunk.

1992
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:03.490
It was getting at,

1993
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:08.140
but he was saying that the cops seemed like they were enjoying fucking people

1994
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:08.381
up,

1995
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:12.370
like they were running around and just randomly fucking people up.

1996
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:14.660
<v 1>And uh,</v>

1997
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.540
a lot of people have a real problem with that.

1998
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.400
A lot of people have a real problem with they're,

1999
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:20.240
they're not,

2000
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.400
they're not finding like the dangerous people.

2001
00:57:22.401 --> 00:57:22.790
Look at that.

2002
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:23.031
Oh,

2003
00:57:23.031 --> 00:57:24.740
that girl that mean,

2004
00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:25.640
come on man.

2005
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:27.501
<v 5>How,</v>

2006
00:57:27.501 --> 00:57:29.010
how is that even possible?

2007
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.880
Watch that again.

2008
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:30.743
Watch that again.

2009
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.070
There's a little girl,

2010
00:57:32.071 --> 00:57:32.311
I mean,

2011
00:57:32.311 --> 00:57:33.660
she's not big at all,

2012
00:57:33.661 --> 00:57:34.081
man.

2013
00:57:34.081 --> 00:57:35.550
I don't know what she could have done,

2014
00:57:35.551 --> 00:57:39.720
but that cop just blind sides her and sensor over a bike rack.

2015
00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:40.261
I mean,

2016
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:41.910
that is fucked.

2017
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:45.540
There's no way on earth that guy needed to do that.

2018
00:57:45.541 --> 00:57:46.560
There's no way.

2019
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:50.880
The only way would be if that woman was coming at him with a weapon or coming at

2020
00:57:50.881 --> 00:57:54.180
someone else with a weapon and he was saving someone's life.

2021
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:59.390
What he just did there is like either some PTSD that he's like,

2022
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:03.870
he's fucked or he's a sadist or whatever the fuck it is.

2023
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:05.610
That guy does not need to be a cop.

2024
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.230
They need to remove that guy.

2025
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:07.711
That's,

2026
00:58:07.711 --> 00:58:11.580
there's no way a man in that position of power should be able to do that.

2027
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.990
That woman was not a threat.

2028
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.280
He was a big guy.

2029
00:58:14.281 --> 00:58:15.540
She was a small woman.

2030
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.940
There's no way that she had a reason that he should have done it.

2031
00:58:17.941 --> 00:58:22.941
Maybe he's a time traveler and at that moment she was at Baptist meet this guy

2032
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.450
and that he was going to get her pregnant with the next antichrist.

2033
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.760
So he knew that if he just slammed her down,

2034
00:58:29.761 --> 00:58:32.400
that once he might've saved millions of people's,

2035
00:58:32.401 --> 00:58:33.031
you might be right.

2036
00:58:33.031 --> 00:58:34.200
He might be in jail right now,

2037
00:58:34.201 --> 00:58:35.340
handcuffed behind his back.

2038
00:58:35.341 --> 00:58:36.330
Speaking in tongues.

2039
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:36.920
Yeah,

2040
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.190
you're,

2041
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:41.130
you can only like stay in this time for like a couple of days to you start going

2042
00:58:41.131 --> 00:58:41.611
crazy.

2043
00:58:41.611 --> 00:58:41.940
Yeah.

2044
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.380
The,

2045
00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:42.601
yeah.

2046
00:58:42.601 --> 00:58:44.700
The further you get away from your original timeline,

2047
00:58:44.701 --> 00:58:45.810
the more insane you get.

2048
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:49.060
Spacetime continuum just fries your hard drive and like that.

2049
00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:49.760
I was happy to do,

2050
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.400
I don't want to hurt you.

2051
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.040
Bad guys fucking handcuffs and speaking in tongues.

2052
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.870
What's that famous time traveler?

2053
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.441
I'm sorry,

2054
00:58:55.441 --> 00:58:57.300
I didn't mean to derail John t door.

2055
00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:57.830
Yeah.

2056
00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:58.830
Jayanti door.

2057
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:59.051
Yeah.

2058
00:58:59.051 --> 00:58:59.910
It's all bullshit.

2059
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:01.320
I know it's bullshit.

2060
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:02.670
There's a famous time traveler,

2061
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.453
but it's a great story.

2062
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.090
It said bullshit if you think it's real,

2063
00:59:06.091 --> 00:59:06.990
but it's a story.

2064
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.220
It's cool man.

2065
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.650
Because the way he dealt with the,

2066
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.490
the way he dealt with going back and killing your grandfather or whatever the

2067
00:59:14.491 --> 00:59:17.310
way paradox is by saying that,

2068
00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:21.000
it's like there's multiple timelines and you can go back in time.

2069
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.040
You're not on the exact

2070
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.840
<v 1>same timeline that you are on.</v>

2071
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:27.230
And so things are slightly different in that timeline.

2072
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:31.340
So t door would say that like he would get colds all the time here.

2073
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:33.540
Like colds were a little worse in this dimension.

2074
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.281
This guy,

2075
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.510
he said he was from another time.

2076
00:59:35.511 --> 00:59:36.650
It's a time traveler folks.

2077
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:37.910
He's a fucking writer.

2078
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.641
He's a writer,

2079
00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:39.620
is not a bad one,

2080
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:40.580
not a bad one at all.

2081
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.960
And he wrote something that he thinks would be a fun troll and he came up with

2082
00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:45.251
this,

2083
00:59:45.251 --> 00:59:45.500
uh,

2084
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.110
he's got a patent file for John teeters time machine,

2085
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.020
like an asshole.

2086
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.460
If anybody ever says like,

2087
00:59:52.461 --> 00:59:52.701
Hey,

2088
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:53.840
well there's a patent for it,

2089
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:54.081
you know,

2090
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:54.920
it must be real.

2091
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.590
You need to go and look at what a goddamn patent is.

2092
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:58.490
Shut your mouth.

2093
00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.110
Because there's a lot of fucking patents.

2094
01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.630
There's patents for all sorts of ridiculous shit.

2095
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:03.570
There's,

2096
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:07.730
or at least a pull applications patent pending time travel or go back in time

2097
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:08.840
and patent everything.

2098
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.090
Yeah.

2099
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:14.390
How come you going back in time when you got to just fucking everybody with your

2100
01:00:14.391 --> 01:00:15.560
knowledge from the future?

2101
01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.093
Yeah,

2102
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.380
the whole thing's ridiculous.

2103
01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:23.240
But the idea of a bunch of different timelines is actually not that ridiculous.

2104
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:23.631
Well,

2105
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:27.530
they're saying now with that new discovery that apparently it doesn't,

2106
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:31.730
it like point to the idea that there's a multiverse or bubbled universes or

2107
01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:32.510
something,

2108
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:33.350
inflation theory,

2109
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:35.420
whatever that new discovery is.

2110
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.100
There's so many of these,

2111
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:38.180
I don't know,

2112
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.770
I wouldn't say competing theories,

2113
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:42.260
but ultimately they're all just,

2114
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:43.123
they're there.

2115
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.650
They're sort of coincide that you don't know.

2116
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.300
You don't know like who's right,

2117
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:51.290
who's wrong or whether or not they're all right and that there's like a billion

2118
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:55.910
different examples of what a universe is or an infinite number of examples of

2119
01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:58.100
what could take place at any different timeline.

2120
01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:02.570
They say that infinity is so intense like the idea of infinity and this is the

2121
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:03.920
best way to wrap your head around it.

2122
01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.510
If infinity Israel,

2123
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.320
that means that in the universe not only has everything that we've said in the

2124
01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:16.991
exact same order and the exact same pauses in the exact same

2125
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:23.000
timeframe and fuck up of words or slip of the tongue,

2126
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:27.620
it's happened exactly that way in exactly that order.

2127
01:01:27.621 --> 01:01:29.270
An infinite number of times,

2128
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.620
not just one,

2129
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:35.570
but an infinite number of times that everything that's ever taken place down to

2130
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:39.740
the millisecond has not just happened once somewhere else,

2131
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:42.350
but infinite times somewhere else.

2132
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:42.890
Wow.

2133
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:44.480
That's how big infinity is.

2134
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.220
That's what no end means.

2135
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.360
That's so weird.

2136
01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:51.470
Like it just like when you're doing some mundane thing like jerking off,

2137
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:52.610
coming to porn,

2138
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.070
just thinking this is infinite infinite loop of jazz that's happening.

2139
01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:58.851
Oh,

2140
01:01:58.851 --> 01:01:59.421
shins,

2141
01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:00.610
oceans of jazz.

2142
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.620
You could just see like just a universe filled with you squirting ah,

2143
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:09.563
fractal.

2144
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.410
Like literally a universe that's real.

2145
01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:17.620
Like so the sky would be absolutely filled from horizon to horizon with with you

2146
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.870
<v 5>coming more than this.</v>

2147
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:22.723
It's

2148
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.840
all the come from all the Dunkin's in all over the world.

2149
01:02:27.841 --> 01:02:28.471
At once.

2150
01:02:28.471 --> 01:02:29.310
Drench the earth.

2151
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:30.920
We would drown in semen.

2152
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:31.171
Oh,

2153
01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:33.120
how's the entire population would drown.

2154
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:37.440
We would be coded in like a million miles thick of com because if you think

2155
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:39.180
about what infinity means,

2156
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.440
how many different Dunkin's would be coming,

2157
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.990
there's no end to it.

2158
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:48.110
So one ounce of calm equals 100 billion oceans filled with come instantaneously

2159
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.330
raining down upon those oceans would be filled with more me's coming.

2160
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:55.230
Not only that,

2161
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:59.520
the universe itself would not be big enough to contain the earth size.

2162
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.650
Just from the sheer amount of calm it was covered it.

2163
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.820
It would push the atmosphere way past the sun.

2164
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:10.290
It would light the earth on fire and turn it into a big come one of those.

2165
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.850
What are those fucking hush puppy.

2166
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:16.851
It was a big come hush puppy when the come got so big it touch the sun in a deep

2167
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:18.600
fryer just so big.

2168
01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.250
It touches the sun and then puts the sun out and presses out into the outer

2169
01:03:23.251 --> 01:03:24.084
galaxy.

2170
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:29.390
That's how much com infinite amount of people coming and then some like you,

2171
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.070
some God chef would just come and eat it.

2172
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:34.020
It's just not a cooking show and,

2173
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.160
and then you know,

2174
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:39.750
he lives in another world where you're coming on and it just goes on forever.

2175
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.111
No,

2176
01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:41.460
that's how you impregnate the sun.

2177
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.720
You fill a planet with come to the stop up a black hole.

2178
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:47.370
We don't know what to do about a black hole.

2179
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.950
We're going to get an infinite amount of Dunkin's to come in it.

2180
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.211
Well,

2181
01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:51.421
it's,

2182
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:51.900
you know,

2183
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.240
mass broken down to the smallest part.

2184
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:54.930
Uh,

2185
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:56.850
it's not going to stop an infinite amount of come.

2186
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:57.923
Trust me.

2187
01:03:59.240 --> 01:03:59.371
Well,

2188
01:03:59.371 --> 01:04:00.930
there's a whole nother university side.

2189
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:03.630
They're still not big enough for infinite amounts of calm.

2190
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:04.523
Sorry.

2191
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.490
The black holes.

2192
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.140
Like what the fuck please?

2193
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.780
Top comm

2194
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.880
the black polos like Sasha gray with the fucking giant black cock being force

2195
01:04:15.881 --> 01:04:17.610
fed while she's lying on her back.

2196
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:20.460
Snots going down into her eyelashes.

2197
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.150
That's the universe.

2198
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:27.883
Yeah,

2199
01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:32.460
it'd be so symbolic.

2200
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.140
So some bog of gag porn,

2201
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.590
you're coming into a black hole.

2202
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:37.680
Those,

2203
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.020
the fucking whole event horizon starts sputtering.

2204
01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:41.310
No,

2205
01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.330
that's spinning.

2206
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:47.100
The spinning of the black hole absorbing matter just gets all choked up like a

2207
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:47.670
fucking,

2208
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:48.000
like a,

2209
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.940
like a dishwasher disposal system with a spoon in it.

2210
01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:52.590
You know when those garbage disposals,

2211
01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:54.530
the spoon drops in it

2212
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:01.680
and you're scared to put your hand in there to try to unstop it,

2213
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:02.903
do you think,

2214
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.030
and that's how the universe was created.

2215
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:11.640
His infinite come and if it come loop went into a black hole.

2216
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.050
Do you think that ever ever come into a black hole in the future?

2217
01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:16.831
Oh yeah.

2218
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:17.770
If we live long enough,

2219
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:18.100
someone's

2220
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:18.731
<v 1>going to want to do that.</v>

2221
01:05:18.731 --> 01:05:18.881
I think.

2222
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:19.810
I don't want to be the first guy.

2223
01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:21.390
Some Richard Branson type asphalt.

2224
01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:24.940
What do you mean the first guy to show the world?

2225
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.620
I want to inspire you,

2226
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.900
but you two can come in a black hole.

2227
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:32.170
Him with a fucking black socks on.

2228
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.250
So I always come,

2229
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.310
he sends like a shuttle from his pod.

2230
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.910
Yeah.

2231
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.460
And he's got like,

2232
01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.500
it's like a glory hole into the next shuttle and he's wearing an aqua man t

2233
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:41.810
shirt.

2234
01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.510
It's way too small and he's

2235
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.090
a little,

2236
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:48.630
slightly embarrassing roll of fat pulls out of the Bar,

2237
01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.750
like a little waterfall.

2238
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:54.040
It's just jerking off with his black socks on into it until black.

2239
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.530
<v 2>Hey,</v>

2240
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:58.050
you never know til you try.

2241
01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:59.500
I seek to inspire.

2242
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:03.970
I'm seeking to inspire you that you too humble man.

2243
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:05.690
Um,

2244
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.930
him.

2245
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:06.310
You see,

2246
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.040
did you edit the Tim and Eric Sketch the universe?

2247
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.210
What is that called?

2248
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:11.980
The one where they're talking about space.

2249
01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:12.843
I don't think I did.

2250
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.070
God funny you seen that man?

2251
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:15.520
No.

2252
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.000
Can you,

2253
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.410
can you pull up to the 10 minute,

2254
01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:17.981
what's it called?

2255
01:06:17.981 --> 01:06:18.814
Space.

2256
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:19.743
Just the universe.

2257
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.733
The universe.

2258
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.280
This is one of the funniest fucking one.

2259
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.240
This is one of my favorite comedy sketches.

2260
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.700
Really good.

2261
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:28.841
All right.

2262
01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:29.674
Yeah,

2263
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:33.730
<v 7>the universe.</v>

2264
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:35.883
What a concept.

2265
01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:39.790
You know the universe is a little bit like the human hand.

2266
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.421
For example,

2267
01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:45.421
you have Grumman's center right here and then you have undiscovered worlds and a

2268
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:52.800
sector eight and up here it's a Tillman's crest so you can be,

2269
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:57.931
can kind of picture that it's a little bit like a leaf or it's not a bowl.

2270
01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.520
The Universe is beautiful.

2271
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:04.810
Something like a new woman that I was going to date.

2272
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.550
You're dark and your your massive and you have a black hole.

2273
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:14.200
All of those elements I want to explore just like you would explore on a new

2274
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.610
date is facial expression.

2275
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:18.890
He's been to that and feel around and just see,

2276
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:20.620
see what's going to come out of that.

2277
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:25.630
The time it takes to get from one star to another star is in c you need to

2278
01:07:25.631 --> 01:07:26.830
travel at the speed of light.

2279
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.031
And I'll assume as,

2280
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:32.440
can't even fathom the concept of that kind of time because it's really,

2281
01:07:32.441 --> 01:07:32.801
really,

2282
01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:33.221
really,

2283
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:33.761
really,

2284
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:34.241
really,

2285
01:07:34.241 --> 01:07:34.691
really,

2286
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:35.231
really,

2287
01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:36.100
really fun

2288
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.033
light ride.

2289
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.613
Ah,

2290
01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.440
if you could put the universe into a two,

2291
01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.290
you'd end up with a very long too.

2292
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:52.180
You've got to watch this folks doing twice the size of the universe because when

2293
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:54.130
you collapsed the universe,

2294
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:55.510
it expands.

2295
01:07:55.511 --> 01:07:56.344
And it would be,

2296
01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.920
you wouldn't want to put it into a tube

2297
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.180
picture of a hot dog bun and through all the stars,

2298
01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.010
the hundreds of stars that there are in the universe,

2299
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:06.670
into a pet,

2300
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.610
into a bag and put the universe into a bag.

2301
01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:12.130
And you all of a sudden they become,

2302
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.333
um,

2303
01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:16.083
<v 9>uh,</v>

2304
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:22.543
<v 5>I was a child,</v>

2305
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920
but there are now

2306
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.660
<v 11>90 planets,</v>

2307
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:29.860
you know,

2308
01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.250
the ultimate fate of the universe.

2309
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:36.490
So dark and mysterious that it generates butterflies in my stomach and that goes

2310
01:08:36.641 --> 01:08:37.810
to tickles in my spine.

2311
01:08:37.811 --> 01:08:39.250
And that creates goose pimples.

2312
01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.020
And then that penetrates my mind.

2313
01:08:41.021 --> 01:08:41.680
And then the,

2314
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.780
the whole big banks.

2315
01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:47.220
Ooh,

2316
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:56.650
<v 9>ah,</v>

2317
01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.353
<v 11>no,</v>

2318
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:09.750
<v 7>stars can be fun.</v>

2319
01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.800
A lot of people say,

2320
01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.490
Donna,

2321
01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:13.590
you get so wrapped up in the physics of it.

2322
01:09:13.591 --> 01:09:14.371
Don't you have any fun?

2323
01:09:14.371 --> 01:09:14.641
I say,

2324
01:09:14.641 --> 01:09:14.821
well,

2325
01:09:14.821 --> 01:09:17.550
I go up and I look at the stars through my telescope and I see the little

2326
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:18.390
dumpster,

2327
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:19.440
or I see the big dip stir.

2328
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.430
Every star has,

2329
01:09:20.431 --> 01:09:21.730
it's has a sister starr,

2330
01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.880
a little bit like two eyeballs.

2331
01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:24.714
If you can imagine,

2332
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:26.100
if,

2333
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:26.933
if,

2334
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:28.550
if you could see the other side of my eyeball,

2335
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:30.820
you'd see a 360 degree eyeball.

2336
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:34.740
<v 11>Do you know that when you look at a planet and you see that light,</v>

2337
01:09:34.741 --> 01:09:35.021
that plan,

2338
01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:36.060
it's not even there.

2339
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:37.920
That's just a light.

2340
01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:41.130
That's just your neighbor shine the flashlight right in to your yard.

2341
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.280
Fuck looking for coons.

2342
01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.553
And he says,

2343
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:48.480
what are you doing in my backyard with that flashlight?

2344
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:49.913
And I told him,

2345
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:50.730
I'm shining.

2346
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:53.760
I'm shining in your window so I can teach your son about the universe.

2347
01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:54.541
He said,

2348
01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:56.910
get out of my yard and why are you communicating to my son?

2349
01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:59.700
Why are you in all black behind my bushes?

2350
01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:01.320
Shining a light into my house and I said,

2351
01:10:01.321 --> 01:10:03.090
I'm teaching your son about the universe.

2352
01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:04.050
I'm shining a light,

2353
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:10.010
shiny light right in there and exploring his room as he's looking out and

2354
01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:11.180
exploring the universe.

2355
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:15.440
I turned the light off and I see your son go to bed and I turned the light back

2356
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:18.860
on and I do swirls on his wall like a comet's tail.

2357
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.560
I do this every night.

2358
01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.493
<v 5>It's your son.</v>

2359
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:23.880
Fuck man.

2360
01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.213
Fuck.

2361
01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.210
Oh my God.

2362
01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:28.890
There's so weird

2363
01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:32.730
that those guys have the weirdest style.

2364
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.653
Yeah.

2365
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:34.370
It's uh,

2366
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:38.640
it's such an interesting style of comedy because you really have no fucking idea

2367
01:10:38.641 --> 01:10:39.474
where they're going.

2368
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:43.860
It's very refreshing because it's really hard to watch something where you,

2369
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:45.390
even if it's well written,

2370
01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:46.470
he know where it's going.

2371
01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.820
Like you know where everything's going.

2372
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:48.810
Yeah.

2373
01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.070
How long did you work on that show,

2374
01:10:50.071 --> 01:10:50.341
man?

2375
01:10:50.341 --> 01:10:51.180
For the whole time.

2376
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:52.463
Yeah.

2377
01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:53.701
Wow.

2378
01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:54.150
That's fun.

2379
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:54.983
That's so cool.

2380
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:56.550
He's so lucky to have been on that show.

2381
01:10:56.551 --> 01:10:57.384
That was like a,

2382
01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.770
that was like,

2383
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.090
I don't know,

2384
01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:00.250
I,

2385
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.320
it reminds me of,

2386
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.920
of Monty python or something or like a more modern version of that.

2387
01:11:04.921 --> 01:11:05.250
You know,

2388
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.480
it's just such a revolutionary.

2389
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.240
It's a revolutionary show and that's a gross word.

2390
01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:10.074
Use.

2391
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440
Everybody hates it is,

2392
01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:12.990
it is.

2393
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.520
You're right,

2394
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.150
cause it's so

2395
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:15.860
<v 4>far out there that it's like it push it.</v>

2396
01:11:15.861 --> 01:11:16.491
Like you know,

2397
01:11:16.491 --> 01:11:16.881
that's,

2398
01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:21.881
that challenges people to not be so stuck in like normal square types of

2399
01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:22.971
sketches.

2400
01:11:22.971 --> 01:11:24.410
That's why I love writing with you man.

2401
01:11:24.411 --> 01:11:28.790
Because you're always like pushing it so far outside of where I would go with

2402
01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:29.624
it.

2403
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.201
<v 1>Well you know,</v>

2404
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:32.670
you got to try to do something different.

2405
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:33.960
Yeah.

2406
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.261
Yeah.

2407
01:11:34.261 --> 01:11:34.981
You have to,

2408
01:11:34.981 --> 01:11:38.760
in this day and age to so many premises have been beaten to death,

2409
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:41.280
especially when you're dealing with like human interactions.

2410
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.290
Like how many Goddamn sitcoms are there been?

2411
01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:44.400
How many movies are that have been,

2412
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:45.263
how many,

2413
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:48.750
how many dramatic shows that have comedic scenes?

2414
01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:49.021
I mean,

2415
01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:50.010
how much,

2416
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.480
how many subjects can be covered the same way over and over again.

2417
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.260
You know,

2418
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.280
after a while it's like,

2419
01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:57.480
oh my fucking God.

2420
01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.373
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2421
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:59.340
Yeah.

2422
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.720
It's weird too when you start thinking about like how much of what I'm doing and

2423
01:12:03.721 --> 01:12:08.721
how much of what I'm saying day to day is original and how much of it is just me

2424
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:10.830
regurgitating something I heard yeah.

2425
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:11.590
<v 1>Before.</v>

2426
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.741
Well,

2427
01:12:11.741 --> 01:12:13.300
there's definitely gonna be some of that.

2428
01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.560
Oh ways that,

2429
01:12:14.561 --> 01:12:15.510
I mean that is the,

2430
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:19.180
the big knock on the concept of flip of plagiarism.

2431
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.571
You know,

2432
01:12:19.571 --> 01:12:19.810
the,

2433
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:20.800
the knock on,

2434
01:12:20.801 --> 01:12:21.041
you know,

2435
01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:21.821
when someone accuses,

2436
01:12:21.821 --> 01:12:22.720
especially Comedians,

2437
01:12:22.721 --> 01:12:23.554
plagiarism,

2438
01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:24.543
essentially,

2439
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:29.610
there's no way anybody has a unique thought and if you have a unique thought,

2440
01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:34.420
it is merely a combination of your thoughts and all the knowledge that all the

2441
01:12:34.421 --> 01:12:36.580
human beings before you have left behind,

2442
01:12:36.581 --> 01:12:40.990
including the language that you're communicating in every single idea that

2443
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.580
formulates this thought,

2444
01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:46.630
every single piece of information that's been accumulated long before you were

2445
01:12:46.631 --> 01:12:47.231
ever born,

2446
01:12:47.231 --> 01:12:48.064
most likely.

2447
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:51.190
And that's what's led to this being able to talk.

2448
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.750
The difference being,

2449
01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:53.584
of course,

2450
01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.800
differences use someone who kind of acknowledges that but comes up with it on

2451
01:12:56.801 --> 01:13:00.190
their own and someone who just sits around and waits for other people to come up

2452
01:13:00.191 --> 01:13:04.600
with it and then steals those ideas because would they are as a fake antenna?

2453
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:05.151
You're not,

2454
01:13:05.151 --> 01:13:06.040
if you're not an antenna,

2455
01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:07.210
you like an agent,

2456
01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:11.920
you're like you're stealing the actual creative idea instead of tuning into it.

2457
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:12.220
Yeah,

2458
01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:15.700
and we like it when we find someone like a Joey Diaz,

2459
01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.620
like someone who's just tuning into it,

2460
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:21.010
he figured out how to tune into it and that Sam and you like to be around him

2461
01:13:21.011 --> 01:13:23.020
because he says funny shit all the time.

2462
01:13:23.021 --> 01:13:23.500
Yeah.

2463
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.370
And then someone else who just waits to hear what Joey Diaz says and then just

2464
01:13:27.371 --> 01:13:28.204
repeat it.

2465
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:28.660
Okay.

2466
01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:28.901
<v 4>Dude,</v>

2467
01:13:28.901 --> 01:13:29.620
when I was at,

2468
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.310
I used to,

2469
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:33.970
I go to a summer camp and I remember talking to this kid and he was telling me

2470
01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:36.900
about is like we got to kind of be frenzy.

2471
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:38.950
Tell me about his like childhood.

2472
01:13:38.951 --> 01:13:43.951
And I remember it seemed weirdly familiar and then I was thinking about it and

2473
01:13:43.991 --> 01:13:44.720
he live,

2474
01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.070
he told your story of your childhood yet?

2475
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.400
I'd be fucking weird.

2476
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:49.120
No,

2477
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.530
he lifted it from a movie,

2478
01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:51.131
like some,

2479
01:13:51.131 --> 01:13:52.120
I can't remember what it was,

2480
01:13:52.121 --> 01:13:56.140
but he like kind of went into details and he had just lifted it from a movie

2481
01:13:56.141 --> 01:13:56.660
that he saw.

2482
01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.460
He was just sort of,

2483
01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.191
oh my God,

2484
01:13:58.191 --> 01:13:58.791
it was okay.

2485
01:13:58.791 --> 01:13:58.861
Hey,

2486
01:13:58.861 --> 01:13:59.070
that's

2487
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:01.790
<v 1>all kids learn how to be themselves.</v>

2488
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:02.260
Yeah.

2489
01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:02.740
This kid,

2490
01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.573
they get to make it.

2491
01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:06.570
Yeah,

2492
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.590
I think you're right man.

2493
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:08.670
I think it's okay.

2494
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:10.530
Nothing weird about it at all.

2495
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.070
Not at all.

2496
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.390
<v 4>Except when we were like,</v>

2497
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:17.350
I remember like swimming at free swim and he did this awful thing.

2498
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.340
This is like the end of our summer camp friendship because I had already like

2499
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:22.870
found out that he'd been like he'd been lying about,

2500
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:24.020
um,

2501
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.121
his childhood,

2502
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:26.140
which is already kind of weird.

2503
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:29.320
But then we were like swimming back to shore and I remember he stuck his ass out

2504
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:29.801
of the water.

2505
01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:33.400
He'd pulled his shorts down and he stuck his ass out of the water and like

2506
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:36.580
pulled his butt cheeks apart to like moon.

2507
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:41.060
Everybody in one way belongs in a zoo.

2508
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:42.910
People logs in an asylum.

2509
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:43.431
Like,

2510
01:14:43.431 --> 01:14:45.550
what was this awful kid like?

2511
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:46.570
Why was he doing this?

2512
01:14:46.571 --> 01:14:47.750
He's lying about his childhood.

2513
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:50.200
He's like hard buying everyone.

2514
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.430
It's like saying it's a cry for help when people pull their bug apart.

2515
01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.810
It's like that's what it is,

2516
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:56.683
that they read your palm,

2517
01:14:56.690 --> 01:14:59.950
they tell you that and that kid drowned and then his mom came back and killed

2518
01:14:59.951 --> 01:15:00.371
everybody.

2519
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:01.204
That camp,

2520
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.153
it

2521
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.230
was just named Jason.

2522
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.193
I knew that kid

2523
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.880
was the story from a famous movie.

2524
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.680
I can't remember the movie,

2525
01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:17.440
but I remember thinking about it later and realizing like,

2526
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:18.220
oh,

2527
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.510
he lied that that,

2528
01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:21.760
that's definitely from a movie like it was.

2529
01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.490
I mean I was probably,

2530
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.393
I wasn't idiot.

2531
01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.360
I am an idiot.

2532
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.890
But like then I was especially,

2533
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:27.401
I don't have a kid.

2534
01:15:27.401 --> 01:15:28.180
I'm an idiot,

2535
01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:30.550
but like a 27

2536
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:38.980
that's such an easy joke when anyone asks me that says it's,

2537
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:39.833
it's funny.

2538
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:40.630
Look,

2539
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:41.201
it's good.

2540
01:15:41.201 --> 01:15:42.034
It's good.

2541
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:43.960
It's there.

2542
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.261
It doesn't,

2543
01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:45.910
just because it's easy doesn't mean it's not good.

2544
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.810
Um,

2545
01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:47.081
no,

2546
01:15:47.081 --> 01:15:47.980
I was probably,

2547
01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:48.814
let's see,

2548
01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.570
I was in cabin three I guess.

2549
01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:52.991
I don't know,

2550
01:15:52.991 --> 01:15:53.950
cause at a Christian camp,

2551
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.910
well,

2552
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:56.200
it wasn't a Christian camp,

2553
01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:58.360
but they did have church on Sundays and stuff,

2554
01:15:58.361 --> 01:15:58.991
but it was cool.

2555
01:15:58.991 --> 01:16:01.960
I mean it wasn't like they were like beating you over the head whether it was a

2556
01:16:01.961 --> 01:16:02.170
girl.

2557
01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:04.330
I went to that camp and became a camp counselor.

2558
01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:04.750
That camp,

2559
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:09.310
this is Camp Pinnacle in North Carolina and I went to that camp since I was like

2560
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:13.450
probably nine or 10 and just kept going back every summer.

2561
01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:14.770
That stuff's good for kids,

2562
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:15.011
man.

2563
01:16:15.011 --> 01:16:16.870
Getting away from home,

2564
01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:19.630
hanging out with like other people being outdoors.

2565
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:21.340
And I think this camp now,

2566
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.580
I think Camp Pinnacle now that won't let kids keep cell phones there.

2567
01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:25.391
So when you come,

2568
01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:26.140
the kids have to put,

2569
01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.160
you have to give up your phone.

2570
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.053
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2571
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.880
That's probably good for some kids.

2572
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.280
I went to a camp that was not good for kids.

2573
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.120
It was dangerous.

2574
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.530
It as a bunch of little criminals.

2575
01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.031
I went to a,

2576
01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:38.260
it was Jamaica plain,

2577
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:42.580
which was a kind of a sketchy area in Boston and it was the boy scout troop.

2578
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.860
When you went to New Hampshire for two weeks,

2579
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:48.340
kids are at tying kids up and taking their fucking cots and leaving them in the

2580
01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:50.500
woods because it was pitch black at night.

2581
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.520
They tried to do it to me,

2582
01:16:51.521 --> 01:16:51.791
to what?

2583
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:55.530
I woke up fucking yelled at them and people would pour toothpaste.

2584
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:55.930
All everybody,

2585
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:59.650
one's close like it was like very fucking sketchy,

2586
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:03.700
like there's a little criminal camp and so I would just disappear every day and

2587
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:04.241
go fishing.

2588
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:05.470
I didn't do any of the activities.

2589
01:17:05.471 --> 01:17:06.820
I just got the fuck out of there.

2590
01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:08.980
I remember up bullet ricocheted by me once.

2591
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:10.010
It was only at 22 but

2592
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.660
<v 1>there was a shooting range and someone hit a rock and a bullet fuck up like we</v>

2593
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:15.240
heard the polo.

2594
01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.220
What the fuck is that?

2595
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.581
Someone goes,

2596
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:17.211
it's a ricochet.

2597
01:17:17.211 --> 01:17:19.130
I was like a fucking ricochet.

2598
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:20.241
I could,

2599
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:21.230
we can get hit by bullets.

2600
01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:22.100
We can get hit by bullets,

2601
01:17:22.101 --> 01:17:22.461
and they were like,

2602
01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:22.591
no,

2603
01:17:22.591 --> 01:17:23.391
we can get hit by bullets.

2604
01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:23.990
I'm like,

2605
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:25.760
I am so fucking adding here.

2606
01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:28.010
And so every morning I would just take off and go fishing.

2607
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:31.220
So for two weeks I went fishing and they even know I was gone.

2608
01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:32.600
Like they barely paid attention.

2609
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:36.170
I went to band camp you place was ruthless man.

2610
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.060
Like I was a freshman in high school.

2611
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.021
Day One,

2612
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.200
they're like off like on your way in that,

2613
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:41.391
you know,

2614
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:42.290
you're getting all these warnings.

2615
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:42.830
Like you know,

2616
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:45.980
every freshman gets their underwear ripped right out of their pants by the

2617
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:46.814
seniors.

2618
01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.080
They're going to raid your cabins.

2619
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.281
It was scary.

2620
01:17:49.281 --> 01:17:50.114
I was like,

2621
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:51.520
I was hiding under the cab,

2622
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:53.420
under the bunk and uh,

2623
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.450
one of the guys was a sympathetic to me.

2624
01:17:56.451 --> 01:17:57.284
He let me go.

2625
01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.370
Really?

2626
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:59.030
Wow.

2627
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:00.260
So they were trying to do that though.

2628
01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:01.200
They were trying to pull everybody.

2629
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.300
I was like extra small.

2630
01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:02.571
They're like,

2631
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:03.530
we can't pick on this kid,

2632
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.250
Tim.

2633
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:05.660
That's a good way to get stabbed.

2634
01:18:05.661 --> 01:18:07.490
Somebody gets really mad at you fucking,

2635
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:10.580
you can pull underwear on the wrong kid and he waits till you're asleep and

2636
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.220
sticks up for help your ass.

2637
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.990
So people are so grows.

2638
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:18.420
The fact that that you give like that,

2639
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:20.510
that's an obvious supervision issue.

2640
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:23.390
Like you can't just leave older kids with younger kids,

2641
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:26.030
there's too much of a tendency to bully you.

2642
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:26.331
Just key.

2643
01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:27.290
You don't know those kids.

2644
01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:31.130
And these are young kids and you'll like trusting of some fucking 11 year old

2645
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:33.530
around some 16 year old like don't do that.

2646
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.453
Like you don't,

2647
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:36.240
there's always one cut head.

2648
01:18:36.241 --> 01:18:40.250
16 year old is going to do stupid shit to kids and if your 11 year old son is

2649
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:41.720
around some 16 year old boys,

2650
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:45.050
they're probably going to smack him around or do something fucked to him.

2651
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:45.741
You know,

2652
01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:46.071
it's just,

2653
01:18:46.071 --> 01:18:47.690
it's a bad supervision issue.

2654
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:48.111
Yeah,

2655
01:18:48.111 --> 01:18:48.930
that is all it is.

2656
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:49.611
It's all it is.

2657
01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:50.361
And when I was there,

2658
01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:51.290
I was 11,

2659
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:52.040
uh,

2660
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.890
in Florida or in Jamaica plain rather.

2661
01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.290
I was like 11 or 12 because I had moved,

2662
01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:59.150
I lived in Florida from um,

2663
01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.970
11 actually 13.

2664
01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:04.790
I was probably 13 because I live in Florida from 11 to 13 and when I was 13 is

2665
01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:05.720
when I lived in Jamaica Plain.

2666
01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:06.890
So that's definitely how old I was.

2667
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:08.121
And you know,

2668
01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:10.400
these kids were like 17 there was like some,

2669
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:12.770
some kids that were like eagle scouts there were older.

2670
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.880
And for them it was like this wild vacation thing and they would get away and

2671
01:19:16.881 --> 01:19:18.410
just fucking torture.

2672
01:19:18.411 --> 01:19:22.400
Kids get crazy and she rocks and stuff and that's sacks.

2673
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.230
It was fucking sketchy as hell,

2674
01:19:24.231 --> 01:19:24.650
man,

2675
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:28.330
because it wasn't that many like people running it like you looked around and

2676
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:31.310
how many kids there were and he looked at how many counselors there where it's

2677
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:31.820
like,

2678
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.421
whoa,

2679
01:19:32.421 --> 01:19:35.720
there's like fucking 20 kids through each person that is in boy scouts.

2680
01:19:35.721 --> 01:19:39.050
Kind of like mo Millie militant about like barely.

2681
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:40.400
They just don't want gays.

2682
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:43.600
It's all to keep the gaze out and just fucking have at it.

2683
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:43.881
Well,

2684
01:19:43.881 --> 01:19:45.620
at least what with a camp that I went to,

2685
01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:47.330
I mean they had some things that you did,

2686
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:50.810
like you met for breakfast and you know they had activities that you were

2687
01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:51.860
supposed to be doing,

2688
01:19:51.861 --> 01:19:52.740
but I wasn't fucking dude.

2689
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.830
That was like about keeping people in line,

2690
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:56.310
like scout's honor and all that stuff.

2691
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.051
Not at night,

2692
01:19:57.051 --> 01:19:57.321
man.

2693
01:19:57.321 --> 01:19:58.250
The guy goes to sleep.

2694
01:19:58.251 --> 01:19:58.371
No,

2695
01:19:58.371 --> 01:20:00.440
it's fucking kids are running around time people up.

2696
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.730
I mean that was just reality.

2697
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.450
It was,

2698
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:03.650
it was fucking dangerous.

2699
01:20:03.651 --> 01:20:05.390
You want to send your kid to camp,

2700
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.380
that's old.

2701
01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.770
That's the like findings.

2702
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.130
Cause there's

2703
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.260
<v 4>some camps that are all like this camp was,</v>

2704
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:11.360
I think it was,

2705
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.170
it was 80 or a hundred years old.

2706
01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:15.960
It had been around for a while and they knew how to do it many,

2707
01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:19.210
many summers and there's traditions and there's people who've been there and he

2708
01:20:19.211 --> 01:20:20.740
was kind of sounds scary or actually,

2709
01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.410
I mean it's like some old time shit like Joe's old camp,

2710
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.790
Bohemian Grove type shit.

2711
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.481
Well No,

2712
01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:28.314
I mean there,

2713
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.190
yeah,

2714
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:30.210
that's what I'm saying.

2715
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:31.080
Like there was a fee.

2716
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:31.920
There were like,

2717
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:32.963
there was like,

2718
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.060
you know like there were traditions there.

2719
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:37.970
There was like I was old and there it did.

2720
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:39.150
You know who the fuck knows.

2721
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:39.781
It did have that.

2722
01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:40.471
Whenever I look at,

2723
01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:43.380
I swear to God when I see videos of the Bohemian Grove,

2724
01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.790
I think it can't pinnacle.

2725
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.870
I always think I'm like,

2726
01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.480
oh that's just a summer camp for tyrants.

2727
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.860
That's what the Bohemian Grove is.

2728
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:53.550
It's clearly just a summer camp where you go to if you're an oil billionaire,

2729
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:54.893
what is this?

2730
01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.041
Oh Wow.

2731
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:56.701
Look at what is it?

2732
01:20:56.701 --> 01:20:57.340
What are they doing?

2733
01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:58.021
I asked Duncan.

2734
01:20:58.021 --> 01:20:58.380
I don't know.

2735
01:20:58.380 --> 01:20:58.831
I don't know.

2736
01:20:58.831 --> 01:20:59.970
That wasn't there when I was there.

2737
01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:02.340
It looks like some sort of a wrestling match or a game or something.

2738
01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:02.481
No,

2739
01:21:02.481 --> 01:21:03.151
that's that's,

2740
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:07.090
this is where you would have the kids fight and the survivor

2741
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:11.760
teach you about heart.

2742
01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.713
It's what I'm here.

2743
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:15.720
I'm here to make a man out of you,

2744
01:21:15.721 --> 01:21:16.554
doctor.

2745
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:17.551
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2746
01:21:17.551 --> 01:21:18.120
My camp,

2747
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.380
I don't remember what the fuck it was called.

2748
01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:22.010
I just remember it was in New Hampshire and at nighttime it,

2749
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:22.861
it was a,

2750
01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:26.850
there was no moon out one night when we were there and I couldn't believe that

2751
01:21:26.851 --> 01:21:29.430
it could get so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

2752
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.840
You put your hand from your face.

2753
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.070
You literally couldn't see it.

2754
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:34.410
Couldn't say it was so dark.

2755
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:36.240
It was unbelievable how dark got at night.

2756
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:37.830
How could you see the kids you're trying to tie up?

2757
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:38.581
That's the problem.

2758
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:39.820
These content flashlights,

2759
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.140
he's a little fuck heads.

2760
01:21:41.150 --> 01:21:42.520
Had flashlights and you,

2761
01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:46.810
you'd hear footsteps and flashlights and giggles and they actually know someone

2762
01:21:46.811 --> 01:21:48.240
was touching you in the middle of the night and you're like,

2763
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:51.190
get the fuck off me and scream and yell and you got,

2764
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.230
you had a scream and yell.

2765
01:21:52.231 --> 01:21:54.360
Cause if you just tried to play it like play cool.

2766
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:55.283
Come on guys.

2767
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:56.570
They'd fucking gag you.

2768
01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:58.680
Tell you tighter sounds terrible.

2769
01:21:58.710 --> 01:21:59.543
It was not good.

2770
01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.533
It was not good.

2771
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.470
It was definitely not good for me because being a 13 year old around 17 year

2772
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:07.170
olds is Zoe's sketchy dudes are dickheads,

2773
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:08.070
you know,

2774
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.500
especially if you give them enough leeway,

2775
01:22:10.501 --> 01:22:11.550
you give enough room,

2776
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.530
they don't know any better and they're just getting,

2777
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.630
especially if they have older brothers that fuck with them.

2778
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:16.471
That's a big one,

2779
01:22:16.471 --> 01:22:16.771
man.

2780
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:18.030
That's a real big one.

2781
01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:21.240
If you run into some kids that have older brothers that beat them up,

2782
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:25.260
there's a good chance that they're going to have some pent up resentment and

2783
01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:27.180
looking to get there is in on someone else.

2784
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:27.571
All right.

2785
01:22:27.571 --> 01:22:28.720
That's what they say about abuse.

2786
01:22:28.721 --> 01:22:30.420
So a lot of kids that abused their kids,

2787
01:22:30.630 --> 01:22:32.520
they got abused and it's just sort of,

2788
01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:35.250
it just passes on generation to generation.

2789
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.810
How do you stop that cycle?

2790
01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:38.150
Yeah,

2791
01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:38.750
it's good question.

2792
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:43.290
I have a third party intervene during their teenage years or something.

2793
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:46.590
There's probably some counseling ways that you could do it.

2794
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:50.100
Some ways of recognizing what sort of a pattern you've fallen to.

2795
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.510
You want to look at yourself.

2796
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:57.010
<v 4>If you're an abuser and recognize that you actually are the crest of the wave of</v>

2797
01:22:57.261 --> 01:23:02.261
the universe and you have a chance to stop this disease that affected you from

2798
01:23:02.661 --> 01:23:04.040
spreading into infinity,

2799
01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:05.030
you can stop it.

2800
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.210
I think that's what it takes.

2801
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.420
The,

2802
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.640
the people who are doing it,

2803
01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:13.540
I have to wake up to the fact that they can actually transform everything if

2804
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:17.650
they just stop this terrible flow of shit.

2805
01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:21.940
It's been going through from like just some asshole 200 years ago,

2806
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:27.120
punched his kid and then that kid punched his good and that kid punched his get.

2807
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:31.780
It's like an echo of this shitheads punch traveling through town to the punch.

2808
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:32.590
Someone could block it.

2809
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:33.250
Yeah.

2810
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.740
We didn't start punching our wives,

2811
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.330
but we can stop

2812
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.200
<v 0>gum for sure.</v>

2813
01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:46.490
This is a very unique time and that we're really aware of the repercussions of

2814
01:23:46.491 --> 01:23:50.360
all this stuff and the recidivism repercussions and the fact that it translates

2815
01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.010
from one generation to the next.

2816
01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.170
We're aware of that I think more than ever before.

2817
01:23:54.171 --> 01:23:56.960
And there's more of a backlash against it than ever before.

2818
01:23:57.290 --> 01:24:00.740
And you could clearly see that just about abuse in movies.

2819
01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.570
How about like abuse of,

2820
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:03.583
of women?

2821
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:07.970
I used to be normal for the lead of a movie to smack a woman in the face and it

2822
01:24:07.971 --> 01:24:08.804
was okay.

2823
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:10.160
It was like a man.

2824
01:24:10.161 --> 01:24:11.060
He's a man's man.

2825
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:12.650
Get a hold of yourself right in the kisser.

2826
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:13.700
I think Louise,

2827
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.230
start again.

2828
01:24:14.230 --> 01:24:17.470
<v 4>Louis C K is like opening monologue on SNL.</v>

2829
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.970
One of the things he said was like,

2830
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:20.000
there is a are,

2831
01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:20.171
you know,

2832
01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:21.520
an article of clothing,

2833
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:23.020
like a wife beater shirt.

2834
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:28.050
There's a article of clothing which is based the beating your wife,

2835
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:29.040
is it that offends?

2836
01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.060
Like you could just say that no one cares.

2837
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:32.001
That crazy.

2838
01:24:32.001 --> 01:24:32.151
Yeah.

2839
01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:33.890
Ever even thought of that is so true.

2840
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:34.511
Yeah,

2841
01:24:34.511 --> 01:24:34.991
it's crazy.

2842
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:35.980
It is crazy man.

2843
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.581
But you know,

2844
01:24:36.581 --> 01:24:41.260
like what I like sometimes a wife beater tee shirt.

2845
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:42.280
I got the boxer,

2846
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:44.350
a lot of violent clothing.

2847
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:45.850
Boxer briefs.

2848
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:46.391
Yeah.

2849
01:24:46.391 --> 01:24:47.710
But they just look like boxer shorts.

2850
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:49.300
Why Feeder?

2851
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:50.283
It's like,

2852
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:51.281
I know,

2853
01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:51.581
I know.

2854
01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:53.050
I just upon um,

2855
01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.810
<v 0>it would've been good if you started with boxer and then we worked up to</v>

2856
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:58.850
wifebeater Peter Wife beaters.

2857
01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.910
Definitely the closer though

2858
01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:00.960
<v 4>the the,</v>

2859
01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:02.781
you know,

2860
01:25:02.781 --> 01:25:03.614
when you're like,

2861
01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:07.190
sometimes you'll find yourself habitually being an asshole.

2862
01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.260
Like sometimes like I'll,

2863
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:13.261
I'll find myself like being a jerk to someone like an,

2864
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:14.930
and then I in my head,

2865
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:16.340
my mind will register,

2866
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.660
oh,

2867
01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.490
I'm acting like my mom right now.

2868
01:25:19.491 --> 01:25:20.360
And like my mom was,

2869
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:21.201
you know what I mean?

2870
01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:21.440
Like,

2871
01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.071
Oh shit.

2872
01:25:22.071 --> 01:25:22.790
Oh Shit,

2873
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:27.740
this is a habit I picked up from somebody else that I'm [inaudible] that I'm

2874
01:25:27.741 --> 01:25:28.670
pushing through time.

2875
01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:29.281
See.

2876
01:25:29.281 --> 01:25:30.290
And the idea is like,

2877
01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.820
when you recognize not everyone,

2878
01:25:31.821 --> 01:25:32.241
of course,

2879
01:25:32.241 --> 01:25:34.430
it's not all just violence and punching people.

2880
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:35.503
It's not all,

2881
01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.100
sometimes it's not so overt.

2882
01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:40.160
Sometimes the thing you're doing is just mildly conti,

2883
01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:40.791
you know what I mean?

2884
01:25:40.791 --> 01:25:44.810
But it's still something you learned from someone who is mildly conti to you.

2885
01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:46.730
It's like you could stop that.

2886
01:25:46.731 --> 01:25:51.731
You can actually stop that by going against the habit because sometimes you'll

2887
01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:54.320
realize I'm being this way for no reason,

2888
01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:57.320
but I still want to be this way because I feel comfortable acting this way.

2889
01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:57.930
You know,

2890
01:25:57.930 --> 01:25:58.160
just,

2891
01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.120
it's just a habit.

2892
01:25:59.121 --> 01:26:00.470
It's just a comfortable habit.

2893
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:00.790
Don't,

2894
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:01.880
I don't think they feel comfortable.

2895
01:26:01.881 --> 01:26:04.010
I think they just feel they don't know how to

2896
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:07.920
<v 1>not feel like that or how did they track?</v>

2897
01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:08.420
Scrapped.

2898
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:08.980
Yeah.

2899
01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:09.580
Yeah.

2900
01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.311
Cause that's the word,

2901
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:10.580
right?

2902
01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.510
It is trapped.

2903
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:12.830
I mean that's really what it is.

2904
01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.050
You're in a like a gambling thing.

2905
01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.210
You ever met a guy who's got a real gambling thing.

2906
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.590
It's like they're trapped in this pattern or thinking cause whatever rush they

2907
01:26:21.591 --> 01:26:22.430
get out of that,

2908
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:23.570
it's like undeniable.

2909
01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:27.860
And some people they get trapped and like almost seeking this rush of anger or

2910
01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:28.700
this rush of,

2911
01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.060
you know,

2912
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:33.740
being perturbed or just getting fucking frustrated with things and then they

2913
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:36.530
fall into that pattern and they just get trapped there.

2914
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:37.920
But I think we,

2915
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:40.820
we know that now more so than ever before.

2916
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:46.180
And it's like the lessons like you and I for sure learned something from what

2917
01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:48.320
our parents did wrong.

2918
01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:48.471
We,

2919
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:50.690
we certainly learned something from our parents did right.

2920
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.510
But we definitely also learned something from what our parents did wrong.

2921
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:54.920
And I think our children,

2922
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:55.754
my children,

2923
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:56.121
you,

2924
01:26:56.121 --> 01:26:57.050
if you ever have children,

2925
01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.590
are going to hopefully learn from shit that I do wrong to like things that

2926
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.860
affected them that I said to them that maybe I shouldn't have said that they're

2927
01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:04.550
gonna,

2928
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.740
they're gonna compartmentalize.

2929
01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:09.230
They're going to think about it more when they have a kid.

2930
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:11.300
They're going to be one step ahead of me,

2931
01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:11.810
you know,

2932
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:12.231
hopefully,

2933
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:12.531
I mean,

2934
01:27:12.531 --> 01:27:13.460
I'm doing my best,

2935
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:18.730
but we're just human beings and the process is ongoing and culture is evolving

2936
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.290
along with generation to generations learning all these lessons.

2937
01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:24.920
I mean,

2938
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.810
our actual human culture,

2939
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:30.560
it's just way more advanced and way more sensitive than it wasn't the 1950s

2940
01:27:30.561 --> 01:27:33.740
that's why he could have a movie where the lead guy smacks a woman in the mouth,

2941
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:36.440
get a holiday or south smack smack.

2942
01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:38.060
Whereas the guy today would go,

2943
01:27:38.061 --> 01:27:38.391
hey,

2944
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:39.224
you know,

2945
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:40.220
this is not necessary.

2946
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.180
Just relax.

2947
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.170
We're going to get through this.

2948
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:42.590
All right,

2949
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.030
let's just talk about why you're upset.

2950
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:44.361
You're like,

2951
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:45.650
that's what a normal person would do.

2952
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:46.850
Like you don't have to hit her.

2953
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:47.690
You don't have to Hook,

2954
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:49.580
get a holiday as tough SPEC.

2955
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:50.930
That is so weird.

2956
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.370
That used to be like a cure,

2957
01:27:52.371 --> 01:27:53.450
like snacking with,

2958
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:55.580
Oh and then you fuck the shit out of her.

2959
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:56.690
Cause that's what she really wanted.

2960
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.610
She wants you to just show you care.

2961
01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:01.160
Give her a couple up fucking knuckles across the mouth.

2962
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:01.820
A little bit of blood.

2963
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:02.570
Just a little,

2964
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:04.250
just enough to get her hot when you're kissing her.

2965
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.730
Whew.

2966
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:05.211
Wow.

2967
01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:06.200
People are nuts.

2968
01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.221
Crazy.

2969
01:28:07.221 --> 01:28:08.150
They were barbarians.

2970
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:12.650
They were basically just less than a hundred years removed from riding fucking

2971
01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:13.490
horses around.

2972
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.780
What did you expect?

2973
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.620
You know,

2974
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.350
what did anybody expect from those fucking monkeys?

2975
01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:19.184
They were apes.

2976
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:23.090
Remember when Barbara Walters got Sean Connery to talk about smacking my man?

2977
01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:23.900
Yeah.

2978
01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:24.230
Yeah,

2979
01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:24.711
he said it.

2980
01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:25.880
And it's really like it.

2981
01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:29.120
They like play that Chamie cause it's brilliant.

2982
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:30.590
I mean it's,

2983
01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.390
it's incredible the way,

2984
01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:32.661
I mean,

2985
01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:36.680
he is just got this no nonsense approach to the pim pan.

2986
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:40.700
And Barbara Walters tried to like check him on it and,

2987
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:43.040
and he just fucking owned up to it and,

2988
01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.080
and really fucked her up man,

2989
01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:48.620
because he kind of let her know that if she got a little crazy you might smack

2990
01:28:48.621 --> 01:28:48.830
her.

2991
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:49.760
She got scared.

2992
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:50.361
There was a,

2993
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:51.530
there was something to it,

2994
01:28:51.531 --> 01:28:52.130
man.

2995
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:53.390
There was something behind it.

2996
01:28:53.391 --> 01:28:54.640
It was this thing,

2997
01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.850
just slap a woman now.

2998
01:28:55.851 --> 01:28:58.400
And then as I remember you said you don't do it with a clenched fist.

2999
01:28:58.401 --> 01:29:01.260
It's better to do it with an open hand because she's looking away and then she

3000
01:29:01.261 --> 01:29:02.100
turns towards him.

3001
01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:03.220
<v 12>Yeah,</v>

3002
01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:03.710
I remember that.

3003
01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:04.543
I really love that.

3004
01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:05.850
I haven't changed my opinion.

3005
01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:06.660
You have it.

3006
01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.330
No other can you think it's good to slap a woman?

3007
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:09.760
No,

3008
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.650
I don't think it's good.

3009
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:11.803
It's bad.

3010
01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:14.000
I don't think it's that bad.

3011
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:17.460
I think that it depends entirely on the circumstances and if it marriage it.

3012
01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:18.523
Yeah.

3013
01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:19.890
Well,

3014
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:24.390
if you have tried everything else and women are pretty good at it,

3015
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:26.460
they can't leave it alone.

3016
01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.940
They don't want to have the last word.

3017
01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:31.000
Then you give them the laugh,

3018
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:31.771
last word,

3019
01:29:31.771 --> 01:29:33.240
but they're not happy with the last,

3020
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.880
they want to share it again and,

3021
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:39.810
and get into really provocative situation.

3022
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.393
Then

3023
01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:45.690
I think you're absolutely right.

3024
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:46.913
And what would

3025
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:52.540
<v 1>cause he can didn't dizzy.</v>

3026
01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:53.770
Elaborate any further than that?

3027
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:54.490
I don't,

3028
01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:55.360
I don't think so.

3029
01:29:55.361 --> 01:29:56.560
I think he just leaves it that,

3030
01:29:56.561 --> 01:29:56.951
but still,

3031
01:29:56.951 --> 01:29:57.340
man,

3032
01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:00.340
Sean Connery gets away with that cause he's handsome and he's got that cool

3033
01:30:00.341 --> 01:30:00.940
accent.

3034
01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.680
But imagine somebody else saying that.

3035
01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.693
Imagine law.

3036
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.220
Yeah,

3037
01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:04.931
it's just bad.

3038
01:30:04.931 --> 01:30:09.010
I mean ultimately Sean Connery is just hitting women like from an old school

3039
01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:09.401
era.

3040
01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:10.680
So it's kind of funny to hear them.

3041
01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:10.960
Yeah.

3042
01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.610
That's why because of like Jude law,

3043
01:30:12.611 --> 01:30:13.271
I don't know what I'm saying.

3044
01:30:13.271 --> 01:30:13.931
Jude law again,

3045
01:30:13.931 --> 01:30:16.390
but he has a proper accent is a handsome guy.

3046
01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:18.490
If he wound up saying that an interview,

3047
01:30:18.491 --> 01:30:20.470
it would ruin his career.

3048
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.570
Absolutely ruined his career.

3049
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:23.381
Like who's a,

3050
01:30:23.381 --> 01:30:24.070
um,

3051
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:26.350
a famous movie star today,

3052
01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:28.330
who's like a good example.

3053
01:30:28.331 --> 01:30:29.980
Like Ryan Reynolds,

3054
01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:31.720
I guess at the handsome guy.

3055
01:30:31.721 --> 01:30:32.980
I'm not sure that it is one of those.

3056
01:30:32.981 --> 01:30:33.700
Ryan Ryan,

3057
01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.391
Ryan Crest.

3058
01:30:34.391 --> 01:30:37.450
Imagine if Ryan Seacrest said that they would know he's gay.

3059
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:38.530
People would know.

3060
01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:38.771
They're like,

3061
01:30:38.771 --> 01:30:41.730
I know what you're doing right now.

3062
01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.573
I don't think so.

3063
01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.420
No,

3064
01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:47.141
I don't think he's gay.

3065
01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.250
I think he's a workaholic.

3066
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.620
Probably doesn't have time for sex.

3067
01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:50.831
Okay,

3068
01:30:50.831 --> 01:30:51.101
this guy,

3069
01:30:51.101 --> 01:30:51.940
that's why I'm Reynolds.

3070
01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.110
This handsome bastard.

3071
01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.153
If he said that,

3072
01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:56.460
if Ryan Reynolds said that sometimes you need to smack a woman,

3073
01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.050
Holy Shit with the backlash,

3074
01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.500
be extraordinary.

3075
01:30:59.530 --> 01:31:04.530
salon.com would dedicate months and months of of front page articles,

3076
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:06.790
but what about all the sites defending him?

3077
01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:07.480
None.

3078
01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.200
None.

3079
01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:08.620
None.

3080
01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:09.040
None.

3081
01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:09.730
None.

3082
01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.980
There'll be a few of those fucking men's rights.

3083
01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:12.821
Sean Connery,

3084
01:31:12.821 --> 01:31:13.690
Fan Clubs,

3085
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:17.560
few of those embarrassing men's rights sites where they did the right things

3086
01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:17.741
like,

3087
01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:18.060
okay,

3088
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:18.520
come on you.

3089
01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.600
Why is he I went too far.

3090
01:31:19.601 --> 01:31:20.141
You fucks.

3091
01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.370
You ruined the whole argument.

3092
01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.820
The whole argument is divorced laws.

3093
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:24.581
The whole argument,

3094
01:31:24.581 --> 01:31:28.240
the whole argument is how many guys get fucked over financial weird salon.com

3095
01:31:28.241 --> 01:31:30.280
started attacking patent Oswald.

3096
01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:30.971
You know,

3097
01:31:30.971 --> 01:31:32.710
it's not salon.com okay.

3098
01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:33.610
It's a writer.

3099
01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.720
A writer decided that they were going to pick a hot button topic that didn't

3100
01:31:37.721 --> 01:31:39.580
necessarily jive or make sense,

3101
01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:44.730
but they felt like because Patton Oswald was making fun of someone else's racism

3102
01:31:45.071 --> 01:31:49.510
by showing like this essentially very similar to a bear is getting in trouble

3103
01:31:49.511 --> 01:31:51.460
for except Patton.

3104
01:31:51.461 --> 01:31:56.461
Oswald is a fucking like obvious comedian and Avi and known as a pretty

3105
01:31:57.641 --> 01:32:00.100
sensitive guy.

3106
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:04.060
Like the idea that he would say something racist just for the joke,

3107
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:05.133
like he was,

3108
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.460
they knew what he was doing and they decided to go for it anyway and that's when

3109
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:11.920
he attacked them and he should have,

3110
01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.270
he should have their gross.

3111
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:15.250
Like there's something about their,

3112
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:15.521
uh,

3113
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:16.840
their articles too.

3114
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:20.800
If you go to salon.com one of the things is almost every article starts with a

3115
01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:21.640
question,

3116
01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:22.983
you know,

3117
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.560
is,

3118
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:23.891
you know,

3119
01:32:23.891 --> 01:32:26.190
is this the time to reconsider the,

3120
01:32:26.191 --> 01:32:29.890
the argument of WHO's funny or men or women question mark is this,

3121
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:30.930
you know,

3122
01:32:30.930 --> 01:32:31.480
this is,

3123
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:31.901
is this,

3124
01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:33.850
what's wrong with the right question mark?

3125
01:32:33.851 --> 01:32:34.001
You know,

3126
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:34.834
like this,

3127
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.181
it's,

3128
01:32:35.181 --> 01:32:36.020
it's weird there.

3129
01:32:36.021 --> 01:32:38.710
They're like opinion pieces that represent this article.

3130
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:39.850
It just is like,

3131
01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:40.021
it's,

3132
01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:40.854
it's amazing.

3133
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:41.740
This guess,

3134
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:42.581
guess what?

3135
01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:43.331
Chicken Butt does.

3136
01:32:43.331 --> 01:32:44.770
Anti Vegan shaming.

3137
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:45.970
Beginning preschool.

3138
01:32:50.110 --> 01:32:52.060
Is that they're a salon articles.

3139
01:32:52.061 --> 01:32:52.540
Yeah.

3140
01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:52.901
Hold on.

3141
01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:56.740
Mr. Show patriarchal hedge among and sketch show titles.

3142
01:32:56.770 --> 01:33:01.580
That's the man from Nantucket anti transgender subutex and classic Lillard.

3143
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.370
So true.

3144
01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.260
It's so true.

3145
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:09.790
Our knock knock jokes not inclusive to the homeless salon articles.

3146
01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.020
You dummies.

3147
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.430
You fucked with the wrong guy.

3148
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:13.541
Yeah you did.

3149
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:14.374
He lit him up.

3150
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:14.730
It's,

3151
01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:15.820
he's right man.

3152
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:16.561
I mean I,

3153
01:33:16.561 --> 01:33:18.220
I get angry sometimes.

3154
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:23.370
Like the other day they were comparing a Tina Fey too to Louis C K and like it's

3155
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:24.330
a,

3156
01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:26.050
the the age old argument.

3157
01:33:26.051 --> 01:33:27.370
Who's funny or men or women.

3158
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:28.480
Fuck you.

3159
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:29.620
Fuck you.

3160
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.251
Here's what's funny.

3161
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.420
You're funny people.

3162
01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:36.400
It's not men or women like Stop Amy Schumer's Hilarious Louis CK slayers and

3163
01:33:36.401 --> 01:33:39.510
Tina Fey by the way is in even a stand up or,

3164
01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:39.851
okay.

3165
01:33:39.851 --> 01:33:40.750
She's an actress.

3166
01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:41.530
She's funny.

3167
01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:41.831
Sure.

3168
01:33:41.831 --> 01:33:43.000
She's funny on shows.

3169
01:33:43.001 --> 01:33:44.740
She's funny and in movies,

3170
01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:46.590
but she's not Louis Ck.

3171
01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:48.070
Louie CK writes his own shit,

3172
01:33:48.071 --> 01:33:48.910
performed his own shit.

3173
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:51.360
It's all his opinions on the world to say that,

3174
01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:53.810
that there's some sort of a debate who's funnier.

3175
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:58.420
Her or him is completely distorting what the art form is in the first place.

3176
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:00.220
It's completely distorting it.

3177
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:03.040
Like you're just looking for a fucking salacious article title.

3178
01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:03.940
That's all you're doing.

3179
01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.630
I used to think,

3180
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:05.020
I thought,

3181
01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.340
I thought they were like,

3182
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:10.150
it seems like they were much more respected and now they've gone down this

3183
01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:12.790
spiral where everyone's just rolling their eyes at it.

3184
01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.770
They'll run out of shit to talk about what you,

3185
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:15.130
you know?

3186
01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:15.270
I mean,

3187
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:16.480
it's just ridiculous.

3188
01:34:16.481 --> 01:34:17.350
It gets to a certain,

3189
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:21.100
it gets a certain time when you're covering the same stories over and over and

3190
01:34:21.101 --> 01:34:22.330
over and over and over and over.

3191
01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.680
This cancel Cole bear,

3192
01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:24.543
cancel cold beer.

3193
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:29.500
One fucking joke has married like seven or eight headlines for articles from

3194
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:32.560
them like in the debate and why he needs to make it right.

3195
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:33.580
Make it right.

3196
01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:34.870
Jesus fucking Christ.

3197
01:34:34.871 --> 01:34:35.140
Like,

3198
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.430
what are you talking about?

3199
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:38.110
Make up a joke,

3200
01:34:38.111 --> 01:34:38.501
right?

3201
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:38.830
Mean,

3202
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:39.880
what was his joke?

3203
01:34:39.881 --> 01:34:40.061
I mean,

3204
01:34:40.061 --> 01:34:41.200
it was so fun.

3205
01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:41.530
Now,

3206
01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:42.160
first of all,

3207
01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.260
he's a character.

3208
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:45.760
He's a right wing,

3209
01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:48.940
ridiculous character that says dumb shit,

3210
01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:53.620
tongue in cheek every fucking step of the way it was it offensive to which Asian

3211
01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.570
people I'll,

3212
01:34:54.571 --> 01:34:54.811
I'll,

3213
01:34:54.811 --> 01:34:55.061
I'll,

3214
01:34:55.061 --> 01:34:58.190
I'll pull it up right now so we could see what the fuck and cold bear

3215
01:34:58.191 --> 01:34:59.660
controversy.

3216
01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:01.910
I'll,

3217
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:02.661
I'll pull it up,

3218
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:05.570
but people are asking like hash tagging,

3219
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:07.130
hashtagging,

3220
01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.250
cancel co bear because of a fucking joke.

3221
01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:11.151
Okay,

3222
01:35:11.151 --> 01:35:11.811
here's the,

3223
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:12.644
uh,

3224
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:13.650
here's the,

3225
01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:15.740
and he's apparently responded to it,

3226
01:35:15.741 --> 01:35:16.580
but let's find out what,

3227
01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:17.250
how many you,

3228
01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:19.250
how many people would respond to that Hashtag?

3229
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.361
Oh,

3230
01:35:20.361 --> 01:35:20.961
I don't know,

3231
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:22.190
but they were all gross.

3232
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.600
I don't know how many people wandering,

3233
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:24.141
how big,

3234
01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:26.970
if it's an actual big movement,

3235
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.500
is it,

3236
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.900
you can scan through it and it's not just cancel called bear.

3237
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:30.291
There's like,

3238
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:31.071
it's just like that.

3239
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:35.030
It's like a place where all the outrage people have gone to express their

3240
01:35:35.031 --> 01:35:35.700
outrage.

3241
01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.680
They're pissed about anything,

3242
01:35:36.681 --> 01:35:39.110
and they'll just Hashtag [inaudible] has a copy page right now.

3243
01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:39.591
Here's,

3244
01:35:39.591 --> 01:35:40.311
here's what they said.

3245
01:35:40.311 --> 01:35:41.144
Okay.

3246
01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.900
It all began Thursday evening when the cold Baer reports Twitter account,

3247
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.201
by the way,

3248
01:35:45.201 --> 01:35:46.100
which wasn't even him.

3249
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:48.230
It wasn't even him that wrote that with some of that handles,

3250
01:35:48.231 --> 01:35:49.130
that Kobe Colbert account.

3251
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:49.821
It's not,

3252
01:35:49.821 --> 01:35:54.140
it's not Steven Cole Bear quoted a joke from a segment on Wednesday's episode.

3253
01:35:54.141 --> 01:35:57.050
So they quoted a joke from a segment.

3254
01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:59.750
So they took it out of context and that's where the outrage came.

3255
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.080
Quoted a joke from a segment that a aired that mocked Washington Redskins owner

3256
01:36:05.421 --> 01:36:09.710
Dan Schneider for setting up a charity to aid native Americans in lieu of

3257
01:36:09.711 --> 01:36:11.150
changing the team's name,

3258
01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.100
the original bid Colbert Bear said he was inspired by Schneider to start his own

3259
01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:20.960
charity called the Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation for sensitivity to orientals

3260
01:36:20.961 --> 01:36:21.794
or whatever.

3261
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:27.490
That's in response to a guy who runs a team called the Washington Redskins,

3262
01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.920
which is an anti native American slur making a charity for,

3263
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:35.630
for for native Americans without changing the name.

3264
01:36:35.631 --> 01:36:39.350
Like it's the whole context to that joke.

3265
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:44.240
I mean he's not saying that there should be a Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation.

3266
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:49.360
He's mocking the racism of a guy who's team is called a racist name.

3267
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:51.020
Alright.

3268
01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:52.790
Donating without changing the name.

3269
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:55.310
I mean it's so obvious,

3270
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:59.060
but salon has had like seven fucking articles about it.

3271
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:00.140
Some supportive,

3272
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.240
but some that say he needs to make it right.

3273
01:37:02.241 --> 01:37:06.080
Maybe you just cannot put that string of words together in any content ever.

3274
01:37:06.081 --> 01:37:06.861
But I mean the Chung,

3275
01:37:06.861 --> 01:37:07.550
whatever he said,

3276
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:08.810
I think that's exactly what they're saying.

3277
01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:09.700
You can't say change.

3278
01:37:09.701 --> 01:37:10.491
You can't say that.

3279
01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:11.600
That's the n word.

3280
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:12.650
It's hilarious.

3281
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.050
I mean to to to,

3282
01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:19.120
to try to censor content content that much that you're taking tanks completely

3283
01:37:19.971 --> 01:37:20.804
out of context.

3284
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.420
Completely out of the meaning.

3285
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:26.420
But context is the reason why language exists in the first place.

3286
01:37:26.421 --> 01:37:31.421
It's everything to be able to expand past really simple things like eat fuck

3287
01:37:32.331 --> 01:37:32.930
shit.

3288
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:37.400
You need context to ha to have a goddamn language and communicate each other.

3289
01:37:37.401 --> 01:37:38.990
We have to recognize subtleties.

3290
01:37:38.991 --> 01:37:39.320
Yeah,

3291
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.850
and when you pretend they don't exist,

3292
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.860
that's when you get assholes sanctimonious fuck heads who get crazy about jokes.

3293
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:49.430
That's when you get people dedicated days and days of their life to something

3294
01:37:49.431 --> 01:37:53.330
that fucking that Tracy Morgan says about stabbing his gay son.

3295
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:54.830
They're crazy.

3296
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:59.550
Everything is taken completely out of context and everything is something that

3297
01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.650
warrants cancellation.

3298
01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.940
You need to be shamed.

3299
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:04.380
You need to be removed.

3300
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:07.050
This is over sensitive fucking moron.

3301
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:12.230
<v 4>It's weird how what you're expressing right now is you're offended.</v>

3302
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.010
They offend you.

3303
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:16.360
That's what's interesting is it's like they,

3304
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:21.830
what they are doing is so much more offensive than the thing they are offended

3305
01:38:22.201 --> 01:38:22.650
by.

3306
01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:23.190
Yes.

3307
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:28.190
The way they're expressing themselves is so vile and disgusting that it makes

3308
01:38:29.071 --> 01:38:33.900
whatever Tracy Morgan said or Patton Oswald said or cold bear say,

3309
01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:37.560
just seem like seems so tiny compared to what they are,

3310
01:38:37.561 --> 01:38:40.500
which is they're like embryonic fascists.

3311
01:38:40.501 --> 01:38:43.290
If you gave them power and they grew out of control,

3312
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:43.890
if that,

3313
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:46.260
whoever's like running the show at Salon,

3314
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.861
Matt,

3315
01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:51.360
whoever's running the cancel cold bear and somehow they took power.

3316
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.330
Imagine what kind of world

3317
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.970
<v 1>be living God if you,</v>

3318
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:58.830
they could decide what gets on these comedy shows.

3319
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:02.490
The satire shows what you can and can't get away with.

3320
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.980
How many transgenders need to be represented?

3321
01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:07.010
How many fucking gay people need to be as representative?

3322
01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:11.430
How many fucking straight white males need to be made fun of along with straight

3323
01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:12.300
white females.

3324
01:39:12.301 --> 01:39:12.630
I mean,

3325
01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:13.261
how's it going to be a,

3326
01:39:13.261 --> 01:39:18.120
a chart where everything's graft and made sure it's completely even across the

3327
01:39:18.121 --> 01:39:18.820
board.

3328
01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:19.800
Let's not life,

3329
01:39:19.801 --> 01:39:20.100
man.

3330
01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.890
Maybe they'll find something new to be pissed off about because that's really

3331
01:39:22.891 --> 01:39:25.110
what they love is being pissed off about stuff.

3332
01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:25.351
Oh,

3333
01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:27.870
they'd where they'd realize that they lost their love,

3334
01:39:27.871 --> 01:39:28.790
which is the problem.

3335
01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.450
It's when you say VA,

3336
01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.920
it's writers,

3337
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:33.750
it's writers that they're attracting.

3338
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:36.120
It's not necessarily logical people.

3339
01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.030
It's not necessarily like representative of the organization itself or

3340
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.670
individual writers who produce something and then somebody greenlights set.

3341
01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.200
But at a certain point in time,

3342
01:39:46.201 --> 01:39:48.900
you're doing more harm than good because you're so easy to mock.

3343
01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:53.730
Or if you're like super left wing when you get that far out on a fucking limb

3344
01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:56.100
and you want to cancel Koga Era Kobe or about,

3345
01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:56.430
uh,

3346
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:58.290
a really obvious joke like that,

3347
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.690
you're fucking up everything cause you're,

3348
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:03.330
you're making yourself look unbelievably silly,

3349
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.690
right?

3350
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:04.110
Like,

3351
01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:06.340
I know you feel right and I know the,

3352
01:40:06.341 --> 01:40:06.780
the,

3353
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:10.350
you have this righteous indignation behind what you're doing and you feel like

3354
01:40:10.351 --> 01:40:10.660
the,

3355
01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:11.820
the people need to know.

3356
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.100
You need to realize the harm that your word say.

3357
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.170
You need to realize that there's humor.

3358
01:40:16.290 --> 01:40:16.771
Okay.

3359
01:40:16.771 --> 01:40:17.670
And humor.

3360
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.653
People get hurt.

3361
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:18.961
Oh,

3362
01:40:18.961 --> 01:40:19.540
hiding.

3363
01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.670
<v 4>You're a bigot.</v>

3364
01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.780
Hiding behind the mask of a comedian.

3365
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.753
<v 1>People get hurt.</v>

3366
01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:24.780
People get hurt from jokes.

3367
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:25.351
And guess what?

3368
01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:26.280
If you get hurt from jokes,

3369
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:27.990
you're supposed to get hurt from those jokes.

3370
01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:30.420
If you can't make fun of something about yourself,

3371
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.820
that means you haven't acknowledged that something about yourself that may or

3372
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:33.900
may not be hilarious.

3373
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:37.680
And there's a big difference between someone saying something unbelievably cruel

3374
01:40:37.681 --> 01:40:40.680
and evil and someone's saying something where they're poking at you and

3375
01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:41.514
laughing.

3376
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.860
And obviously he was doing that.

3377
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:48.750
Obviously he was poking at the Washington Redskins guy and laughing and to deny

3378
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:49.584
that it's just,

3379
01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.240
it fucks up the whole argument.

3380
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:52.890
If it clouds the water was,

3381
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:53.801
yeah.

3382
01:40:53.801 --> 01:40:54.670
It's strange

3383
01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:57.220
<v 5>to see salon.com in some way,</v>

3384
01:40:57.221 --> 01:41:02.080
like converging with Nancy grace in some way,

3385
01:41:02.081 --> 01:41:02.351
right?

3386
01:41:02.351 --> 01:41:02.681
Yeah.

3387
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:03.910
Like they're meeting somehow.

3388
01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:05.820
Salon is like put itself in this terror.

3389
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:09.010
Whoever the writers are has put themselves in that awful position where it's

3390
01:41:09.011 --> 01:41:09.220
like,

3391
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.053
Oh shit,

3392
01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:11.080
I'm Nancy.

3393
01:41:11.081 --> 01:41:15.930
Grace and I are were like singing the same song and it's not all that.

3394
01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.320
There's a lot of great articles on there.

3395
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:19.540
I still go there because they have a lot of great articles.

3396
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:21.600
It's just sometimes they just go out along.

3397
01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:22.780
That's why you need a good editor man,

3398
01:41:22.781 --> 01:41:26.620
because you let a few writers fucking throw stuff out there and you do serious

3399
01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:29.650
damage to your website or magazine.

3400
01:41:29.651 --> 01:41:33.580
Like you can really fuck your shit up where you could develop a reputation.

3401
01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.200
You develop a bad reputation,

3402
01:41:35.201 --> 01:41:37.120
like a reputation for being ridiculous.

3403
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.460
Oswald is attacking you,

3404
01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.680
is it for fun and people are looking forward to it and it rings true.

3405
01:41:45.150 --> 01:41:46.960
That's the problem is raining is true.

3406
01:41:46.961 --> 01:41:47.740
What he's saying.

3407
01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:48.200
Yeah.

3408
01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.420
You read those titles.

3409
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:50.080
They're all,

3410
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.100
I mean those are great mock salon.com titles.

3411
01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:53.943
They're great,

3412
01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:54.401
you know,

3413
01:41:54.401 --> 01:41:54.791
but look,

3414
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:55.510
if you go to [inaudible],

3415
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:58.240
I get an email from them every day and there's some great things like the,

3416
01:41:58.370 --> 01:42:01.660
the thing with John Stewart mocking CNN for its continued coverage,

3417
01:42:01.661 --> 01:42:03.160
they've got that they've got,

3418
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:04.090
um,

3419
01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:08.020
an interesting thing on Chris Christie like the governor's talking about,

3420
01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:09.460
I'll bet I'll bet at all,

3421
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:09.911
you know,

3422
01:42:09.911 --> 01:42:10.770
not all about it all,

3423
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.160
<v 1>but a friend of mine hated vice for a while and he's like Fuck Damn magazine.</v>

3424
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:19.330
Cause because one article that he was offended by that came up five years ago,

3425
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.010
but I mean yeah,

3426
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:24.580
you can't blame the whole organization because one thing fucked up.

3427
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:25.031
Right.

3428
01:42:25.031 --> 01:42:25.600
Well there is,

3429
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.960
there's definitely been some articles that I didn't like that vice did and I

3430
01:42:28.961 --> 01:42:29.794
loved those guys.

3431
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:34.270
I saw one the other day that made me laugh that the liquid lap dance diapers,

3432
01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:35.373
what?

3433
01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:35.651
Yeah,

3434
01:42:35.651 --> 01:42:39.010
they have these diapers that people can wear and you fill it with Lube and you

3435
01:42:39.011 --> 01:42:39.830
go get your lap dance.

3436
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:43.390
You just in your pants [inaudible] shit.

3437
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.260
My friend,

3438
01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:44.740
one of the,

3439
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:45.550
one of the are,

3440
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:48.430
you know the whoever wrote it like warm and went to a strip club.

3441
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:50.860
Now that that's where it is.

3442
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:52.060
I wore a spend x diaper,

3443
01:42:52.061 --> 01:42:54.760
just strip clubs so I could come while receiving a lap dance.

3444
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:56.400
That is hilarious.

3445
01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:57.340
Great article.

3446
01:42:57.370 --> 01:42:58.121
Oh I had a friend.

3447
01:42:58.121 --> 01:42:59.410
That's the kind of journalism I want.

3448
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.850
That's a smart way of doing it too.

3449
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:02.740
I had a friend who did it that,

3450
01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:03.101
wait a minute,

3451
01:43:03.101 --> 01:43:04.990
that's a gay strip club back up.

3452
01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:07.510
But they're marketed club.

3453
01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:08.110
Their market.

3454
01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:09.850
I think the writer just happened to be gay.

3455
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:10.451
Yeah,

3456
01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:11.590
we've got a problem here.

3457
01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:14.410
This is a very different kind of lap dance they're receiving.

3458
01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.191
I didn't know that.

3459
01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:16.050
Totally different thing.

3460
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.320
Gay Strip clubs.

3461
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:19.810
Well now you know I have a friend who used to,

3462
01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:24.370
he used to shave his cock and balls and he used to take those nylon jogging

3463
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:28.660
pants and he would run sandpaper on him until like you can like hold it up to

3464
01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:32.770
the light and see how many fingers you had up and then he would lube up his cock

3465
01:43:32.771 --> 01:43:33.340
and balls.

3466
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:36.610
I'll shave down and he would put the really super thin,

3467
01:43:36.611 --> 01:43:38.650
like almost transparent jogging pants on,

3468
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:42.220
put a long shirt over it and go to a strip club and get lap dances and he would

3469
01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:43.054
call it shooting.

3470
01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:45.940
I'd go shooting and one time we fucked up.

3471
01:43:45.941 --> 01:43:48.640
I guess he put too much lube on and the girls sat on him.

3472
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:48.941
I was like,

3473
01:43:48.941 --> 01:43:49.840
what the fuck?

3474
01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.480
<v 4>He's like,</v>

3475
01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.313
oh sorry.

3476
01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.510
And he just gave her money.

3477
01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:56.330
<v 1>He ran.</v>

3478
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.490
He said I was so embarrassed I ran out of there.

3479
01:43:58.670 --> 01:43:59.001
He said,

3480
01:43:59.001 --> 01:44:02.420
but before he had been getting away with it like girls had gotten,

3481
01:44:02.421 --> 01:44:03.530
they were like okay.

3482
01:44:03.531 --> 01:44:08.120
They'd climbed on it and made him come in his pants and he said it was amazing.

3483
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:10.550
It was like a legal way to get hand job.

3484
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:13.040
<v 4>It's just thinking about like the lead up to that.</v>

3485
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:16.970
It's like how many times do you have to push down the thought I've gone insane.

3486
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:17.660
Maybe he,

3487
01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:20.330
he invented those diapers cause that's a good,

3488
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:21.440
I think someone,

3489
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.730
I think he may have,

3490
01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:23.660
he was an entrepreneur.

3491
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:24.980
I know cause there's already a market for it.

3492
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.251
Yeah.

3493
01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:27.500
Maybe it's possible the diaper is a good move.

3494
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:27.921
It's better,

3495
01:44:27.921 --> 01:44:28.970
it's more contained.

3496
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:30.050
But you know,

3497
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.990
but if your slot,

3498
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:31.191
if you,

3499
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:31.431
you know,

3500
01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:31.971
you're at home,

3501
01:44:31.971 --> 01:44:32.211
you're like,

3502
01:44:32.211 --> 01:44:32.541
you know what,

3503
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:33.950
I'm going to slide on my lubed up.

3504
01:44:33.951 --> 01:44:34.470
Diapers.

3505
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:36.290
You go get a lap dance.

3506
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:40.610
It's like you gotta stop for a second was like you got to think cause like if I

3507
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:43.430
was doing that I would add the alarm bells would be going up.

3508
01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:44.630
Like you've lost it man.

3509
01:44:44.631 --> 01:44:45.111
This is it.

3510
01:44:45.111 --> 01:44:48.360
You start wearing them to every everywhere cause you always wearing a lube

3511
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:49.520
deputize cause you would,

3512
01:44:49.521 --> 01:44:50.450
you'd start liking it.

3513
01:44:50.451 --> 01:44:54.830
You start liking the weirds feel as I lube healthier thing.

3514
01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.790
No more girlfriends.

3515
01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:57.350
We'd be the only way you can come,

3516
01:44:57.351 --> 01:45:00.440
it'd be in the middle of having sex with like do you mind if I put the to down?

3517
01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:03.940
<v 1>You're woman would be like,</v>

3518
01:45:03.941 --> 01:45:04.930
what the fuck man.

3519
01:45:04.931 --> 01:45:08.410
Really you want to not have sex so you can put a diaper on.

3520
01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.310
There's guys that get so into jerking off if they can't come any other way.

3521
01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:12.641
Yeah,

3522
01:45:12.641 --> 01:45:14.020
I've about to come jerking off

3523
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.611
<v 4>man.</v>

3524
01:45:14.611 --> 01:45:15.121
It's bad.

3525
01:45:15.121 --> 01:45:19.350
We've got a problem here and the problem is that that that hand jobs are illegal

3526
01:45:19.351 --> 01:45:20.390
at massage parlor.

3527
01:45:20.391 --> 01:45:21.091
So let's face it,

3528
01:45:21.091 --> 01:45:24.150
if guys have gotten to the point where they got to put on lubed up diapers,

3529
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:29.390
do you go to feel a human touch to feel like an orgasm and by another person?

3530
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:31.890
We've got to look at our laws.

3531
01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.240
You've got to like look at it.

3532
01:45:33.241 --> 01:45:34.630
This is repression managed,

3533
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:35.593
gotten to the,

3534
01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:39.750
it's like when the pigs go crazy in the cages and chew their feet off man.

3535
01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.140
Yes,

3536
01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.250
<v 1>some ancient fucking puritan bullshit because the idea that someone should be</v>

3537
01:45:44.251 --> 01:45:49.080
able to do something completely free and it's absolutely legal encouraged and

3538
01:45:49.081 --> 01:45:51.690
it's a foundation of our advertising.

3539
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:55.260
Selling sex is like almost everything we sell.

3540
01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:56.280
We sell it with sex.

3541
01:45:56.430 --> 01:46:00.330
How many cars have to have a woman's fantastic legs draped over the hood?

3542
01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:01.790
How many times have you,

3543
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:02.190
you know,

3544
01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:05.580
watch some sort of commercialism hot woman promoting something?

3545
01:46:05.581 --> 01:46:06.510
What's going on there?

3546
01:46:06.630 --> 01:46:08.790
There's sat there saying you want sex,

3547
01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:10.500
you can get sex for free.

3548
01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:12.510
But as soon as you give someone money for sex,

3549
01:46:12.690 --> 01:46:14.010
that's against the law.

3550
01:46:14.011 --> 01:46:17.670
And everyone can be locked in a cage for something that doesn't hurt anybody.

3551
01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.440
It's completely legal.

3552
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:22.410
If it's free or if there's a camera involved filming it.

3553
01:46:22.830 --> 01:46:23.550
That's true too.

3554
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.791
Yeah,

3555
01:46:23.791 --> 01:46:25.080
you can get all fucked up part.

3556
01:46:25.081 --> 01:46:26.640
I think you have to get permits though.

3557
01:46:26.641 --> 01:46:27.320
Now.

3558
01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.720
I think they have permits you perhaps to get a permit,

3559
01:46:29.721 --> 01:46:30.900
you probably have some sort of permit.

3560
01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.100
Maybe not for the Internet.

3561
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:32.880
Well I don't know.

3562
01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:33.870
I'm talking out of my ass.

3563
01:46:33.871 --> 01:46:37.020
But the bottom line is it's fucking sex.

3564
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.820
It's not like beating someone up.

3565
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:42.240
Imagine if you like had really poor people and you pay them to just,

3566
01:46:42.241 --> 01:46:44.670
you could beat the fuck out of them and they couldn't fight back.

3567
01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:45.050
Yeah.

3568
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.340
You just,

3569
01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:46.980
I just want to pick the fuck out of somebody,

3570
01:46:46.981 --> 01:46:47.371
man.

3571
01:46:47.371 --> 01:46:50.160
I can't beat the fuck out anybody because it's so

3572
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.700
<v 5>you go to some warehouse and they give you some poor immigrant that could barely</v>

3573
01:46:53.701 --> 01:46:57.750
feed himself and he just beat the shit out of him and the doctor comes in and

3574
01:46:57.751 --> 01:46:59.340
stops it before the guy dies.

3575
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.230
And then he put this guy like in the hospital,

3576
01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.310
his face all fucked up.

3577
01:47:02.311 --> 01:47:06.150
But you give them like five grand and it ain't a couple of weeks he's going to

3578
01:47:06.151 --> 01:47:09.060
be healed up and that five grand is going to come in handy and now he's going to

3579
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.920
pay for his green card and be able to get over this.

3580
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:12.510
That's a possibility,

3581
01:47:12.511 --> 01:47:13.020
man.

3582
01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:15.990
That's a fucking real possibility that someone could engineer something like

3583
01:47:15.991 --> 01:47:16.710
that.

3584
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:17.280
Like if,

3585
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.113
if what?

3586
01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.590
Well if someone just decides,

3587
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.700
someone just decides like,

3588
01:47:20.701 --> 01:47:21.121
Hey man,

3589
01:47:21.121 --> 01:47:21.331
you know,

3590
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:23.300
I know there's a lot of people that would love to beat the fuck out of like,

3591
01:47:23.530 --> 01:47:26.580
but it won't be your martial arts skills and the guy can't hit back.

3592
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.640
You just get that someone's not attack called bear does on the weekends he takes

3593
01:47:31.801 --> 01:47:32.634
the hits.

3594
01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:35.760
Don't fight club instead of putting yourself at risk,

3595
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:37.770
it's just beat up club.

3596
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.881
That's fucked up.

3597
01:47:38.881 --> 01:47:39.031
Yeah,

3598
01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:40.170
that's exactly man.

3599
01:47:40.171 --> 01:47:42.030
That's like a sick fucked up thing.

3600
01:47:42.031 --> 01:47:44.430
But like when you get a massage,

3601
01:47:45.330 --> 01:47:50.330
it does kind of seem like a hand job is like a natural conclusion to a massage

3602
01:47:51.150 --> 01:47:51.301
there.

3603
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:52.134
Rubbing your feet.

3604
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:53.520
They were rubbing your feet,

3605
01:47:53.521 --> 01:47:56.940
your body relaxed starts doing your toes.

3606
01:47:56.941 --> 01:47:57.900
It's almost sexual.

3607
01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.430
The squeezing your ass.

3608
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:00.413
That's a big one.

3609
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:01.560
They're always rubbing your ass.

3610
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:02.680
It's a Roger Anas.

3611
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:06.460
[inaudible] remember that shit that happened with a supposedly after or

3612
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:07.200
Travolta?

3613
01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:07.710
Yes,

3614
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:11.710
he got banned from a hotel because he would always try to get the Missoula to

3615
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.120
arch his back up in the air and she's like his ass up in their face.

3616
01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:16.560
I don't know if that's real.

3617
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:17.910
I don't know if it's really there.

3618
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.863
It's funny story though.

3619
01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.640
Hilarious story and probably not real massager.

3620
01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.210
Volta loves Scientology.

3621
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:26.640
Massages feel good everywhere your head.

3622
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.301
It feels good a year.

3623
01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:28.134
Head massage.

3624
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:29.700
You know they've rubbed your head sometimes.

3625
01:48:29.701 --> 01:48:30.570
That hardware your fingers.

3626
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:31.290
It feels great.

3627
01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:31.740
Yeah.

3628
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:32.640
Why can't they rub your Dick?

3629
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:33.870
That's all he knows.

3630
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:34.890
The danger zone.

3631
01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:35.940
Ah,

3632
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.670
way too dangerous.

3633
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:39.660
Can't touch it.

3634
01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.220
Pull that fucking towel open.

3635
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.960
What have we done?

3636
01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.430
And you have to comes.

3637
01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:45.540
We go to jail.

3638
01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.860
I wonder what percentage of massage massage men have boners when they're getting

3639
01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:50.350
massaged.

3640
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:52.860
80 because I don't think I can.

3641
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.130
I don't get massages cause I'm worried that I'm going to feel awkward the whole

3642
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:56.341
time.

3643
01:48:56.341 --> 01:48:58.110
Just like worried that I have a boner.

3644
01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:58.980
What are you communist?

3645
01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:00.630
Don't get you get jerked off.

3646
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:02.070
He needed to talk to Brian Redman.

3647
01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.570
They'll hook you up with rub maps.

3648
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:03.961
He knows.

3649
01:49:03.961 --> 01:49:04.501
He knows where to go.

3650
01:49:04.501 --> 01:49:05.300
It's gone beyond.

3651
01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.031
I've heard about that.

3652
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:06.864
I've heard about that.

3653
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:08.340
Brian has gone beyond.

3654
01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:09.510
Yeah.

3655
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:11.430
Brian knows like some pretty dark,

3656
01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:14.610
dark place and he's the guru when it comes to find spots where you can get your

3657
01:49:14.611 --> 01:49:15.444
dick sucked.

3658
01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.730
It's illegal.

3659
01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:19.320
It's so stupid that it's illegal.

3660
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.000
It's legal to have sex.

3661
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.810
It's legal.

3662
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:24.030
If you went outside right now,

3663
01:49:24.031 --> 01:49:25.080
walked out this door,

3664
01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.970
went to the door next door,

3665
01:49:26.971 --> 01:49:29.250
but went to the next office building and said,

3666
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:29.490
uh,

3667
01:49:29.490 --> 01:49:30.323
hey,

3668
01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:31.163
who wants to fuck?

3669
01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:32.071
And some girl goes,

3670
01:49:32.071 --> 01:49:33.510
I'm off work and this is my office.

3671
01:49:33.511 --> 01:49:34.344
Let's fuck.

3672
01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:35.760
That's totally legal.

3673
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:36.571
You go in there,

3674
01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:37.381
shut that door,

3675
01:49:37.381 --> 01:49:37.990
lock it,

3676
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:39.270
and no one can stop you.

3677
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.040
But if you walked in and said,

3678
01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:41.431
Hey,

3679
01:49:41.431 --> 01:49:41.671
uh,

3680
01:49:41.671 --> 01:49:43.980
I'm willing to give someone $1,000 if they fuck me.

3681
01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:47.040
And some girls like I could use $1,000 but I don't want to go to jail.

3682
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:47.913
Shit.

3683
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.341
<v 1>Okay,</v>

3684
01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:48.731
let's do it.

3685
01:49:48.731 --> 01:49:49.390
But shut up,

3686
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:51.660
get in here and then the cops break down to earth.

3687
01:49:51.661 --> 01:49:52.690
People are fucking for money.

3688
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:53.170
Bang.

3689
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:54.010
Get on the floor.

3690
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.970
Did you exchange cash?

3691
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.810
You did.

3692
01:49:55.810 --> 01:49:57.250
You're both going to a fucking cage.

3693
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:58.960
They could put you in a cage.

3694
01:49:59.100 --> 01:49:59.350
Yeah,

3695
01:49:59.350 --> 01:50:01.450
but if I went over there and said that,

3696
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:02.710
who wants to fuck?

3697
01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:05.450
They'll probably be cops involved anyway if I just,

3698
01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.160
you never know what if you look like Ryan Reynolds,

3699
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.270
if you look like Ryan,

3700
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:13.210
that Ryan Reynolds cat and you walked into an office building and just said who

3701
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:14.044
wants to fuck?

3702
01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:17.350
And maybe if you walked up to like one specific girl,

3703
01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:19.360
like maybe this is one everybody has.

3704
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:22.510
This is one girl at almost every office building.

3705
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.280
If there's an office building and has 10 floors,

3706
01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:25.480
there's one super slot in there.

3707
01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:26.260
There's one.

3708
01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:27.160
You just got to find her.

3709
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:28.323
I mean she's,

3710
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:30.040
she might be totally undercover,

3711
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.750
just a normal looking secretary.

3712
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:35.020
But she's got that fucking little hint of crazy in her eyes.

3713
01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:38.920
And if Ryan Reynolds walked in looking like that with his shirt open for some

3714
01:50:38.921 --> 01:50:41.950
reason and said he wants to fuck that girl would be there.

3715
01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.350
She'd be there and she'd be ready to throw it down.

3716
01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:46.600
We have to film this hidden camera show.

3717
01:50:46.601 --> 01:50:48.490
Just send me into an office building.

3718
01:50:48.690 --> 01:50:49.140
Oh my God.

3719
01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.800
You going to wants to fuck you get shot.

3720
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:51.880
It's pieces of security.

3721
01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.320
It's easy to get a gun.

3722
01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:56.560
It's too easy to get a gun in La.

3723
01:50:56.561 --> 01:50:57.220
You don't want to do that.

3724
01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:59.440
How many infinite universes would happen,

3725
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.520
Gatlin,

3726
01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.490
until I did get laid,

3727
01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:02.950
how many office buildings?

3728
01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:07.000
Not even what I would do like 400 buildings until finally you get laid every

3729
01:51:07.001 --> 01:51:08.560
time eventually,

3730
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:09.650
but just take rise.

3731
01:51:10.210 --> 01:51:11.680
I just got to get good at this cell.

3732
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:16.900
That selling Dj Doug Pounds supports rape culture live on [inaudible] dot com

3733
01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:20.620
[inaudible] dot com would just dedicate like to your show.

3734
01:51:20.650 --> 01:51:22.790
This show supports rape culture because it makes women,

3735
01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.950
I said it's wants to fuck.

3736
01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:24.491
Yeah,

3737
01:51:24.491 --> 01:51:27.370
because you make women think that it's okay for some threatening man to just

3738
01:51:27.371 --> 01:51:31.930
show up at the workplace and started threatening with there's penis.

3739
01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.790
He wants to use his penis.

3740
01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:34.720
He's letting everyone know.

3741
01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:35.920
We don't want to know that.

3742
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:37.900
You want to use your penis attention,

3743
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.740
attention.

3744
01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:40.480
I want to use my penis in this office.

3745
01:51:40.670 --> 01:51:41.370
It's Saturday.

3746
01:51:41.370 --> 01:51:42.203
Went interested,

3747
01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:45.850
but it is that how that could really almost be a show.

3748
01:51:45.851 --> 01:51:47.080
It'd be pretty hilarious.

3749
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:48.243
Yeah.

3750
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:49.930
Sin Dad to the zoo.

3751
01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:50.680
Yeah.

3752
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.670
It's hilarious.

3753
01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:52.780
It's hilarious.

3754
01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:54.341
It's hilarious.

3755
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:55.174
It's sad.

3756
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:56.560
That could be a show.

3757
01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:57.533
If you have good show,

3758
01:51:57.790 --> 01:52:00.070
just dug walking into spots and trying to fuck,

3759
01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.200
can we call the show hilarious and sad.

3760
01:52:02.230 --> 01:52:07.210
Some people would beat your ass brochures and every now and then just get laid.

3761
01:52:07.810 --> 01:52:10.880
We'd have to film the whole season before anybody knew about it.

3762
01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.250
Finally to you get that one.

3763
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:12.940
Yes.

3764
01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:14.260
It'd be like an Ali g thing.

3765
01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:15.161
I don't think you'd get,

3766
01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:16.360
I think you get many yeses.

3767
01:52:16.361 --> 01:52:17.500
I think you'd be amazed.

3768
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.360
I think if you did just took a chance,

3769
01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:20.760
I think is a lot of people out there,

3770
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:21.581
men and women,

3771
01:52:21.581 --> 01:52:22.361
you probably get a lot of men.

3772
01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:22.481
No,

3773
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:22.690
fuck.

3774
01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:23.740
You have to do both.

3775
01:52:23.850 --> 01:52:24.030
Yeah.

3776
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:24.590
You got to do both.

3777
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:25.640
This show to be good at Princeton,

3778
01:52:25.641 --> 01:52:26.380
a wide net.

3779
01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:27.730
It's whoever says yes.

3780
01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:30.940
That's the other part of the show is the first person to say,

3781
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:31.270
yes,

3782
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.661
that's it.

3783
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:32.471
You've got to be with it.

3784
01:52:32.471 --> 01:52:33.101
Doesn't matter.

3785
01:52:33.101 --> 01:52:34.060
I want to say game show.

3786
01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:34.841
Once they say yes,

3787
01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:35.111
I'm like,

3788
01:52:35.111 --> 01:52:36.490
you win $1 million.

3789
01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.473
Yeah.

3790
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.260
Yeah.

3791
01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.400
You gotta you got a B.

3792
01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:40.330
Maybe that's the move.

3793
01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.830
We've got to re re reward.

3794
01:52:41.831 --> 01:52:42.430
Slutty.

3795
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:43.060
Yes.

3796
01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:43.301
Yeah.

3797
01:52:43.301 --> 01:52:43.990
That's it.

3798
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.860
If a girl says

3799
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.240
<v 5>the sex with her shit,</v>

3800
01:52:47.241 --> 01:52:47.660
nevermind.

3801
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:47.961
No,

3802
01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:48.120
no,

3803
01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:48.301
no.

3804
01:52:48.301 --> 01:52:49.340
It's a reward.

3805
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:50.750
She wants a reward.

3806
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.550
She won for being the biggest whore.

3807
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:56.510
Now we're slut shaming will never go away.

3808
01:52:57.650 --> 01:52:58.730
We fucked up again.

3809
01:52:58.731 --> 01:52:59.900
I'm so sorry.

3810
01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:03.080
I do you know why that slut upping given her money.

3811
01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:03.501
Here we go.

3812
01:53:03.501 --> 01:53:05.180
I'm going to say something very unpopular.

3813
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:06.650
I don't like the word slut.

3814
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.761
Yeah,

3815
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:08.594
I don't like it either.

3816
01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:08.871
Well,

3817
01:53:08.871 --> 01:53:11.560
it implies that there's something wrong with a woman having sex.

3818
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:13.040
I think it's a fucked up word.

3819
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:13.874
I think it's,

3820
01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.350
yeah,

3821
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.751
I think it's,

3822
01:53:14.751 --> 01:53:15.200
yeah,

3823
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:15.850
it's,

3824
01:53:15.850 --> 01:53:16.371
it's weird.

3825
01:53:16.371 --> 01:53:17.630
That is a word I just like,

3826
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:18.650
it's fun to use though.

3827
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.670
It's funny you call them.

3828
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.620
There's nothing wrong with being a promiscuous woman at all.

3829
01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:24.820
No.

3830
01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:25.100
Just like,

3831
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:26.870
there's nothing wrong with being a promiscuous man.

3832
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.950
There was a,

3833
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:28.460
do you remember?

3834
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:28.720
Let's,

3835
01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.570
let's just call her,

3836
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:30.463
um,

3837
01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:32.010
uh,

3838
01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:33.140
waitress number one.

3839
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:33.531
Do you remember,

3840
01:53:33.531 --> 01:53:35.660
which is number one from the comedy store from Boston.

3841
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.780
She would always tell stories about banging all these different guys.

3842
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:39.410
She would,

3843
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:43.400
she was hilarious and she would tell stories about going out and banging all

3844
01:53:43.401 --> 01:53:47.390
these guys and almost always black eyes and she would just go and,

3845
01:53:47.391 --> 01:53:47.750
and,

3846
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:49.400
and not almost always,

3847
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:49.851
well,

3848
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:50.421
it was one,

3849
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:51.350
it was one joke.

3850
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:51.831
I go,

3851
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:53.140
when's the last time you fucked a black guy?

3852
01:53:53.150 --> 01:53:53.631
She was like,

3853
01:53:53.631 --> 01:53:54.090
forever.

3854
01:53:54.090 --> 01:53:55.880
Yos like seventh grade.

3855
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:57.040
Yeah.

3856
01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:57.873
Right.

3857
01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:59.150
But she would tell us,

3858
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.290
and we were all friends.

3859
01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:00.681
So it was,

3860
01:54:00.681 --> 01:54:01.370
it was fun.

3861
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:03.770
It was like a guy talking about banging chicks,

3862
01:54:03.771 --> 01:54:05.720
but it didn't seem nearly as gross.

3863
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:10.490
It was actually more humor filled because she was so free about it and it

3864
01:54:10.491 --> 01:54:10.851
wasn't,

3865
01:54:10.851 --> 01:54:11.120
I mean,

3866
01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:12.860
she was kind of bragging about it,

3867
01:54:12.861 --> 01:54:17.210
but it didn't hurt our feelings as men that she's out there fucking men and hurt

3868
01:54:17.211 --> 01:54:17.810
my feelings.

3869
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:19.490
She was hot and I could never hook out.

3870
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:21.710
And I remember,

3871
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:26.450
I remember when she's wearing a pair of like really nice jeans and she told me,

3872
01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:27.980
I fucked the guy for these jeans.

3873
01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:30.120
I,

3874
01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:32.960
that's so funny.

3875
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:34.011
And yeah,

3876
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:36.920
I mean you wouldn't even if you would use the word slut,

3877
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:39.050
you didn't meet it in a bad way with her.

3878
01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:40.070
You know,

3879
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:43.190
I think the idea that a woman being promiscuous as any different than a man

3880
01:54:43.191 --> 01:54:43.941
being promiscuous,

3881
01:54:43.941 --> 01:54:44.774
it's so stupid,

3882
01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:46.730
so stupid and it's just a shit.

3883
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:47.830
It terrifies.

3884
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:53.050
It just terrifies guys who want to be in control to imagine that a woman can do

3885
01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:55.220
that without having to feel guilty about it.

3886
01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.090
That's what it does.

3887
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:57.290
That's exactly what it is.

3888
01:54:57.291 --> 01:54:58.160
That's exactly what it is.

3889
01:54:58.161 --> 01:55:02.480
It's men who are worried about losing control over the woman that he loves body

3890
01:55:02.481 --> 01:55:07.481
or the idea that even before you guys hooked up that she had multiple sex

3891
01:55:07.821 --> 01:55:09.590
partners that will shame him.

3892
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.690
He's walking around holding her hand and knowing that these guys all saw her

3893
01:55:14.691 --> 01:55:15.830
naked and had sex with her,

3894
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.750
which is,

3895
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:17.583
I mean that's just,

3896
01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:18.820
yeah,

3897
01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.910
it does happen.

3898
01:55:19.911 --> 01:55:21.140
I mean that is the course.

3899
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.070
What happens?

3900
01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:23.660
Of course it's a test.

3901
01:55:23.661 --> 01:55:24.740
The Universe is testing.

3902
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.903
Are you a bitch?

3903
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.810
Okay.

3904
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:31.010
If you freak out about some guy who fucked your girlfriend before you ever even

3905
01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:31.840
met her,

3906
01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:32.540
what's Europe?

3907
01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.720
Bitch cause only bitches claim to the past.

3908
01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.430
Especially somebody else's past.

3909
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:39.170
What's wrong with you man?

3910
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:41.030
You're freaking out about she,

3911
01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.190
well I was going through this,

3912
01:55:42.230 --> 01:55:43.980
this thing in college and one time I tried

3913
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.521
<v 1>a threesome.</v>

3914
01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:45.520
Kicked the fuck Outta here.

3915
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.900
Yeah.

3916
01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:46.231
Yeah.

3917
01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:48.810
It was these two guys and it was really fun and I wanted to do it again,

3918
01:55:48.811 --> 01:55:49.291
but God,

3919
01:55:49.291 --> 01:55:50.100
I don't want,

3920
01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:53.490
then they fight over you and one guy doesn't like it when you're having sex with

3921
01:55:53.491 --> 01:55:55.380
the other guy and it was just too much.

3922
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.401
That's hilarious.

3923
01:55:56.401 --> 01:55:57.990
If you have that conversation with a chick you're dating,

3924
01:55:57.991 --> 01:55:59.040
it's kind of revealing.

3925
01:55:59.041 --> 01:55:59.620
It's cool.

3926
01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:00.090
Cool.

3927
01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:00.923
It's cool.

3928
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.870
But for some guys like fucking whore,

3929
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:06.480
you let those guts come you with this guy,

3930
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:07.770
fuck your mouth with call your ass.

3931
01:56:07.771 --> 01:56:08.850
You let them fuck your ass too.

3932
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:09.601
No big deal.

3933
01:56:09.601 --> 01:56:09.850
Yeah.

3934
01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:10.440
It's not like,

3935
01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.640
it's only like you're going to get married,

3936
01:56:11.641 --> 01:56:12.690
be the mother of my children.

3937
01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.830
<v 4>It's weird because maybe we,</v>

3938
01:56:14.831 --> 01:56:18.310
I would be saying the exact same thing but with a different tone in my voice.

3939
01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:19.450
Did you learn,

3940
01:56:19.450 --> 01:56:20.350
did they fuck your ass?

3941
01:56:25.630 --> 01:56:26.261
Oh Wow.

3942
01:56:26.261 --> 01:56:26.621
Really?

3943
01:56:26.621 --> 01:56:27.070
Oh,

3944
01:56:27.070 --> 01:56:27.640
let you do it.

3945
01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.570
Did you get off on it?

3946
01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:29.630
Yeah.

3947
01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:31.480
How Fun has it as it did that?

3948
01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:32.353
Was that like,

3949
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:32.980
yeah.

3950
01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:33.521
Yeah man.

3951
01:56:33.521 --> 01:56:33.850
I,

3952
01:56:33.850 --> 01:56:34.650
I um,

3953
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:34.871
yeah,

3954
01:56:34.871 --> 01:56:35.350
that's a,

3955
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:36.580
that's a really sad thing.

3956
01:56:36.581 --> 01:56:39.010
I just feel bad because I think it's like,

3957
01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:45.360
I mean imagine if there was a negative connotation associated with guys having

3958
01:56:46.631 --> 01:56:47.464
sex a lot.

3959
01:56:47.590 --> 01:56:51.820
Imagine if your whole life was defined not just by like your sex drive,

3960
01:56:51.970 --> 01:56:56.320
but also by the sense of guilt tied in with it where you had to be.

3961
01:56:56.321 --> 01:57:01.321
You'll have like a guy I can have sex as much as he wants with pretty much zero

3962
01:57:02.531 --> 01:57:03.220
guilt.

3963
01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:03.940
But uh,

3964
01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.181
if,

3965
01:57:04.181 --> 01:57:06.130
if a woman does that,

3966
01:57:06.131 --> 01:57:07.540
there's this sense of like,

3967
01:57:07.541 --> 01:57:07.810
you,

3968
01:57:07.810 --> 01:57:12.340
you're losing the value almost as though you're like,

3969
01:57:12.341 --> 01:57:12.551
you know,

3970
01:57:12.551 --> 01:57:12.790
like,

3971
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:14.230
like you're some kind of like,

3972
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:15.071
I don't know,

3973
01:57:15.071 --> 01:57:19.300
you're something that's like gradually losing its essence and it's such bullshit

3974
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:21.020
and so horrible to,

3975
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.420
to,

3976
01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:23.740
to think that that you have to deal with that guilt.

3977
01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:25.150
That's something women have to deal with in.

3978
01:57:25.151 --> 01:57:26.230
It sucks man.

3979
01:57:26.410 --> 01:57:30.380
Their whole life is spent with this like undercurrent of guilt and when,

3980
01:57:30.381 --> 01:57:31.480
when they're with the guy,

3981
01:57:31.690 --> 01:57:33.340
even if they don't think it,

3982
01:57:33.341 --> 01:57:35.800
they've been so conditioned by like,

3983
01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:36.843
what is it like,

3984
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:37.901
you know,

3985
01:57:37.901 --> 01:57:42.250
like virgin is like the cult of the verge and the idea that there is power in a

3986
01:57:42.251 --> 01:57:46.910
virgin or taking a girl's virginity or the untainted flower,

3987
01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:50.530
that bull shit still like every time you're like,

3988
01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.060
every time you're having sex,

3989
01:57:52.210 --> 01:57:55.390
you've been conditioned in some way so that it can,

3990
01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:57.400
you feel a little darker than you need to.

3991
01:57:57.401 --> 01:58:00.460
I'm sure many w I'm sure a lot of people have overcome that guilt,

3992
01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.470
but it's a guilt that guys don't have to deal with.

3993
01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.180
Right.

3994
01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:03.740
It's a,

3995
01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:04.141
<v 1>yeah.</v>

3996
01:58:04.141 --> 01:58:06.550
You don't have to go to therapy to be yourself,

3997
01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:07.170
right.

3998
01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:09.000
To satisfy your desires.

3999
01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:09.903
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4000
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:10.250
Yeah.

4001
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:11.083
It's,

4002
01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:11.841
<v 1>I read it,</v>

4003
01:58:11.841 --> 01:58:14.450
I saw a picture on Twitter where,

4004
01:58:14.451 --> 01:58:15.030
uh,

4005
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.863
it was like,

4006
01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:16.941
there was two pictures.

4007
01:58:16.941 --> 01:58:20.300
One was a woman asking and one was an ancient Asian guy,

4008
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:21.260
an old Asian guy,

4009
01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:23.840
wise zen master replying like,

4010
01:58:23.841 --> 01:58:26.450
why is it when a man has sex with many women?

4011
01:58:26.451 --> 01:58:27.230
He's a stud.

4012
01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:28.280
But if a woman does it,

4013
01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.233
she's a slut.

4014
01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.291
And he said,

4015
01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:31.110
because,

4016
01:58:31.110 --> 01:58:31.330
uh,

4017
01:58:31.330 --> 01:58:32.960
a key that,

4018
01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:33.350
uh,

4019
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:35.300
can open only open up,

4020
01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:35.631
oh,

4021
01:58:35.631 --> 01:58:38.570
a key that can open up many locks is a master key.

4022
01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:42.940
But a lock that works with any key is just a shitty lock.

4023
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:46.090
That zen master sounds like a dick.

4024
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:47.110
He just kind of an asshole.

4025
01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:47.740
He's a,

4026
01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:48.700
he's a slut chamber.

4027
01:58:49.130 --> 01:58:50.390
<v 4>Fucking slut shaming.</v>

4028
01:58:50.630 --> 01:58:51.111
Hey look,

4029
01:58:51.111 --> 01:58:51.681
I'm all for it.

4030
01:58:51.681 --> 01:58:55.150
salon.com I write an article about select shame and being bad.

4031
01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:55.791
<v 1>You know what,</v>

4032
01:58:55.791 --> 01:58:56.151
I think,

4033
01:58:56.151 --> 01:58:56.510
man,

4034
01:58:56.510 --> 01:59:00.590
I think what they're doing is they're responding to the injustices of the world

4035
01:59:00.591 --> 01:59:01.610
that are absolutely real.

4036
01:59:01.611 --> 01:59:03.590
They're just doing it in a way that I don't agree with.

4037
01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.110
And I think that what would be awesome is if these,

4038
01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:08.120
these things didn't exist at all.

4039
01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.710
If real sexism,

4040
01:59:09.711 --> 01:59:10.690
like real sexes,

4041
01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:13.430
we judge someone solely on the basis of their gender,

4042
01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:15.920
not their personality and their gender,

4043
01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.620
which automatically defaults to gender.

4044
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:20.570
If you have someone that has a shitty personality,

4045
01:59:20.571 --> 01:59:22.490
even if they're productive and in the job,

4046
01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:25.070
like you don't like their gender,

4047
01:59:25.190 --> 01:59:26.180
like if they're a woman,

4048
01:59:26.181 --> 01:59:27.650
if you have an issue with a woman at work,

4049
01:59:27.651 --> 01:59:28.940
you can become a woman hater.

4050
01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:31.940
Just because by virtue of you having this argument with that one person,

4051
01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:37.480
I think until like that is resolved in our culture with like whether it's racism

4052
01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:39.860
or whether it's homophobia,

4053
01:59:39.861 --> 01:59:40.790
whether it's sexism,

4054
01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:44.420
you're going to have to deal with backlash even from jokes because people are

4055
01:59:44.421 --> 01:59:48.380
going to automatically want you to stop even joking about things.

4056
01:59:48.590 --> 01:59:52.010
Because if you have even those thoughts in your head or even express those

4057
01:59:52.011 --> 01:59:52.550
words,

4058
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:53.540
you're hurting people,

4059
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:54.703
but

4060
01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.280
<v 4>you just can't be shrill man.</v>

4061
01:59:56.281 --> 01:59:57.620
If you're going to fight the wharf,

4062
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:58.440
don't be shy.

4063
01:59:58.440 --> 01:59:59.273
You know like don't,

4064
01:59:59.310 --> 02:00:00.143
if you do,

4065
02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:02.520
there is some merit and empathy.

4066
02:00:02.850 --> 02:00:04.680
If you're going to like go into a battle.

4067
02:00:04.710 --> 02:00:06.240
So wrong way of handling.

4068
02:00:06.241 --> 02:00:06.620
Yes.

4069
02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:06.810
Yeah,

4070
02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:11.730
use the right strategy because otherwise you end up doing the exact opposite of

4071
02:00:11.731 --> 02:00:12.690
what you intended,

4072
02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:17.670
which is that you come off looking like a moron and the issue itself begins to

4073
02:00:17.671 --> 02:00:18.870
seem even more relevant.

4074
02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.400
<v 1>It does seem more relevant,</v>

4075
02:00:20.401 --> 02:00:24.630
especially when you're not using humor and you're talking about humor.

4076
02:00:24.930 --> 02:00:27.300
Like you're discussing something in the context,

4077
02:00:27.301 --> 02:00:29.520
like as if it was said in court as an affidavit.

4078
02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.151
You know,

4079
02:00:30.151 --> 02:00:32.220
you're talking about it as if it's policy.

4080
02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.180
You're talking about it as if it's a statement like this is what I believe.

4081
02:00:36.181 --> 02:00:37.230
Let me sign there.

4082
02:00:37.231 --> 02:00:38.550
I've thought this through.

4083
02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:39.660
I've printed it out.

4084
02:00:39.661 --> 02:00:40.710
These are my views on the matter.

4085
02:00:40.711 --> 02:00:40.890
No,

4086
02:00:40.890 --> 02:00:41.431
you're no,

4087
02:00:41.431 --> 02:00:41.940
you're,

4088
02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:45.000
you're manipulating the context in which is even described.

4089
02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:45.853
Yeah.

4090
02:00:46.410 --> 02:00:47.243
Fucking dummies.

4091
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:48.070
Dumb dumbs.

4092
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:50.730
See you shit to get on to say dummy it pissing up the water.

4093
02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.550
I speak in a pissing off the water.

4094
02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:58.320
So how did you get involved with a Tim and Eric and how long you've been doing

4095
02:00:58.321 --> 02:00:59.154
it for?

4096
02:00:59.390 --> 02:01:00.223
Uh,

4097
02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.230
about nine years ago I,

4098
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:07.110
I moved out to la 10 years ago and then nine years ago I answered a craigslist

4099
02:01:07.111 --> 02:01:07.770
ad.

4100
02:01:07.770 --> 02:01:12.360
I wanted to work on a funny TV show and I answered one craigslist ad said funny

4101
02:01:12.361 --> 02:01:13.740
TV show needs an intern.

4102
02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:15.453
That was them.

4103
02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:16.231
That's it.

4104
02:01:16.231 --> 02:01:19.050
Funny TV show needs an answer like comedy show.

4105
02:01:19.051 --> 02:01:22.890
And it turned out to be this cartoon that used to do called Tom goes to the

4106
02:01:22.891 --> 02:01:23.580
mayor.

4107
02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:24.590
Time goes to the Tom,

4108
02:01:24.690 --> 02:01:25.710
Tom goes to the mayor.

4109
02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:26.573
What was that on?

4110
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:27.900
That was on adult swim too.

4111
02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:28.741
Oh,

4112
02:01:28.741 --> 02:01:29.160
okay.

4113
02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:29.341
Yeah.

4114
02:01:29.341 --> 02:01:30.570
So we did that show,

4115
02:01:30.630 --> 02:01:31.920
I think three seasons of that.

4116
02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:33.810
Um,

4117
02:01:33.810 --> 02:01:35.220
and then they started their sketch show,

4118
02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:35.731
Tim and Eric.

4119
02:01:35.731 --> 02:01:36.241
Awesome show,

4120
02:01:36.241 --> 02:01:37.074
great job.

4121
02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:40.040
And I just been working with those guys for a long time.

4122
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:42.890
<v 0>And you started out as an intern and then became a video editor?</v>

4123
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:44.210
Yeah.

4124
02:01:44.210 --> 02:01:48.430
After just a few months I already like had a bunch of experience and I brought,

4125
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:49.303
I just,

4126
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:50.480
they're kind of understaffed.

4127
02:01:50.590 --> 02:01:52.430
I just brought up my laptop and I just was like,

4128
02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.361
you guys need help.

4129
02:01:53.361 --> 02:01:57.770
I can help doing Photoshop stuff or whatever and let do a job.

4130
02:01:58.130 --> 02:01:59.810
Did you go to school for video editing?

4131
02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:02.030
I went to film school in Chicago,

4132
02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:05.810
Columbia College and I did do editing their,

4133
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:06.500
I guess.

4134
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:07.221
Oh that's cool.

4135
02:02:07.221 --> 02:02:09.860
So that's a great fucking Hollywood success story.

4136
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:11.600
You applied for an ad,

4137
02:02:11.601 --> 02:02:16.250
showed up at a show that needed work added your influence actually helped it and

4138
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:18.110
launched you it.

4139
02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:18.411
Yeah,

4140
02:02:18.411 --> 02:02:19.071
it was a great,

4141
02:02:19.071 --> 02:02:19.904
uh,

4142
02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.710
things kind of lined up.

4143
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:23.150
Timing was perfect on that.

4144
02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:26.900
Well those are great guys to work with too because of their choices are so

4145
02:02:26.901 --> 02:02:27.734
bizarre,

4146
02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:28.280
you know?

4147
02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.280
But their choices are so unique that you kind of like,

4148
02:02:31.281 --> 02:02:32.960
you get established like really early,

4149
02:02:32.961 --> 02:02:34.670
not to take that cliche path,

4150
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.350
whereas if you got like a gig that paid like really well but you had to do like

4151
02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:41.230
my three sons are,

4152
02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:41.660
what does that,

4153
02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:42.620
the two and a half men,

4154
02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:43.101
whatever the fuck.

4155
02:02:43.101 --> 02:02:43.850
Right.

4156
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:45.830
If you had to do something like that cookie cutter.

4157
02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:46.970
Well it really,

4158
02:02:46.971 --> 02:02:47.201
it,

4159
02:02:47.201 --> 02:02:48.080
it eats on you.

4160
02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.093
It eats.

4161
02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.980
That's what I had been going on when I lived in Chicago.

4162
02:02:51.981 --> 02:02:53.870
I was editing like commercial,

4163
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:54.681
not commercials,

4164
02:02:54.681 --> 02:02:59.681
but like just like stuff for like a pub publicity shit and stuff.

4165
02:02:59.750 --> 02:03:03.800
Like really just soul crushing boring stuff.

4166
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:06.950
I think that's one of the reasons why Charlie Sheen went fucking crazy.

4167
02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.170
Like a lot of people think I'm an asshole for saying that.

4168
02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:10.693
What else is new?

4169
02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:11.600
Um,

4170
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.600
but I was talking about mundane cause he's probably getting paid so much money

4171
02:03:16.881 --> 02:03:18.320
to do like the lamest.

4172
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.950
Yes,

4173
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:20.060
totally not challenging.

4174
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:21.080
Not Exciting,

4175
02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:21.913
not thrilling.

4176
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.561
No,

4177
02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:24.720
not creatively rewarding or right.

4178
02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:25.280
Whatever.

4179
02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:28.040
So he gets a little crazy and so to blow off steam,

4180
02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:28.611
what does he do?

4181
02:03:28.611 --> 02:03:31.430
He's just fucking getting cracked out and getting hookers and going nutty

4182
02:03:31.431 --> 02:03:33.230
Charlie Sheen cause it's two and a half men.

4183
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:34.050
Um,

4184
02:03:34.050 --> 02:03:35.210
Duncan just got back from being,

4185
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:38.180
I think that's party.

4186
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:39.081
That's partly,

4187
02:03:39.081 --> 02:03:41.270
I'm one of the reasons why he flew off the handle.

4188
02:03:41.271 --> 02:03:41.451
I mean,

4189
02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:41.721
yeah,

4190
02:03:41.721 --> 02:03:43.370
he's obviously got addictive personalities,

4191
02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:47.220
but I think working on a show like that is so soul sucking.

4192
02:03:47.250 --> 02:03:48.320
I think if it was me,

4193
02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.550
I would say,

4194
02:03:49.610 --> 02:03:50.031
okay,

4195
02:03:50.031 --> 02:03:51.830
I have $100 million.

4196
02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:52.800
Like right.

4197
02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:55.970
I can just do stuff I'm interested in,

4198
02:03:55.971 --> 02:04:00.100
but maybe he just had no kind of creative angle on something.

4199
02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:03.200
We'll look at the difference between him then and him now in his anger

4200
02:04:03.201 --> 02:04:03.831
management show.

4201
02:04:03.831 --> 02:04:05.240
You fucking never hear about them anymore.

4202
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.961
I mean,

4203
02:04:05.961 --> 02:04:09.110
he's not going crazy anymore when it seems to be a better show.

4204
02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.520
I keep hearing good things.

4205
02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.260
Eddie Bravo Lux and he thinks it's hilarious.

4206
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:12.560
I've,

4207
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.393
I haven't washed it,

4208
02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:14.450
but I hear it's funny.

4209
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:18.180
And so he's doing this new show now that is like more creative,

4210
02:04:18.181 --> 02:04:21.790
really refreshing or whatever or maybe just got burnt out.

4211
02:04:21.791 --> 02:04:22.630
Maybe we did so much coke.

4212
02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.473
He's just got to stop.

4213
02:04:23.690 --> 02:04:24.260
Yeah.

4214
02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:25.460
He knew it was almost over.

4215
02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:27.690
Maybe watch his own interviews and went,

4216
02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:28.380
Whoa,

4217
02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:29.213
Whoa,

4218
02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:31.011
whoa.

4219
02:04:31.011 --> 02:04:32.060
What the fuck was I doing?

4220
02:04:32.061 --> 02:04:32.894
Oh my God.

4221
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:33.411
Yeah.

4222
02:04:33.411 --> 02:04:33.750
Just how,

4223
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:34.551
that's how I roll.

4224
02:04:34.551 --> 02:04:34.940
What,

4225
02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:35.773
uh,

4226
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:37.500
he owns a piece of that too.

4227
02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:39.900
So he's making money even when Ashton Kutcher's on it.

4228
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:40.890
Yeah.

4229
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:41.790
I just don't understand.

4230
02:04:41.791 --> 02:04:42.990
Like for me personally,

4231
02:04:42.991 --> 02:04:43.350
I would,

4232
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:47.040
I wouldn't take a job if I thought I'd be doing six months,

4233
02:04:47.130 --> 02:04:48.880
cause I just recently got an offer to do it.

4234
02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:50.430
Something that went for nine months,

4235
02:04:50.431 --> 02:04:51.264
but it was like,

4236
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:54.090
it might be something that I kinda be bored with.

4237
02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.740
I'd rather take less money and do less jobs,

4238
02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.960
but just pick the ones that I really loved doing.

4239
02:05:01.130 --> 02:05:03.450
I don't think a lot of times you get involved in a sitcom,

4240
02:05:03.451 --> 02:05:06.030
you don't think it's going to be a piece of shit until you're actually working

4241
02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:06.864
on it.

4242
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:08.000
I was on a sitcom.

4243
02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:08.940
I'm not talking about it.

4244
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:10.170
A Sitcom or anything.

4245
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.220
Sitcoms are tricky.

4246
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:12.690
They're fucking tricky man.

4247
02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.390
I was on a sitcom that was a piece of shit and it started off really good.

4248
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:16.081
Uh,

4249
02:05:16.081 --> 02:05:17.010
it was called hardball.

4250
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:17.611
And these guys,

4251
02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:21.420
Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran who wrote for the Simpsons and they wrote from

4252
02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:22.254
married with children.

4253
02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:23.460
They were really good writers,

4254
02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:26.580
really funny guys and Fox didn't think that they can handle it,

4255
02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:30.600
so they took the show away from them and gave it to this hack from coach.

4256
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:31.890
You know that show coach?

4257
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:32.701
This guy,

4258
02:05:32.701 --> 02:05:34.110
I don't know what he did on coach,

4259
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:34.801
but whatever he did,

4260
02:05:34.801 --> 02:05:36.540
he fucked up anything that was good.

4261
02:05:36.541 --> 02:05:38.070
He brutalized the script,

4262
02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.510
he brutalized the,

4263
02:05:39.511 --> 02:05:40.590
the work environment.

4264
02:05:40.591 --> 02:05:41.280
He just,

4265
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:45.990
he alienated those guys from their own show and came in and rewrote everything

4266
02:05:45.991 --> 02:05:47.010
on his yacht,

4267
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:49.500
went to his yacht and rewrote everything.

4268
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:52.110
I mean it was diggity diggity dog shit.

4269
02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:56.610
It was one of the worst fucking changes from pilot to actual series ever.

4270
02:05:56.611 --> 02:05:57.720
No one was happy.

4271
02:05:57.721 --> 02:05:59.280
Everyone was like really,

4272
02:05:59.281 --> 02:06:02.490
really broken up about it and then they wound up firing him and then they gave

4273
02:06:02.491 --> 02:06:03.324
it back to the writers.

4274
02:06:03.450 --> 02:06:04.141
But it was too late.

4275
02:06:04.141 --> 02:06:04.411
The show,

4276
02:06:04.411 --> 02:06:04.681
isn't it?

4277
02:06:04.681 --> 02:06:06.330
Fucking four episode Tailspin.

4278
02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:10.710
We did it only wind up airing like five or six but I got to see that happen.

4279
02:06:10.770 --> 02:06:15.660
I got to see something that was really good or a bunch of dimwits came in and

4280
02:06:15.661 --> 02:06:16.860
threw in their 2 cents.

4281
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:18.690
It just shit all over it.

4282
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:19.770
That seems to happen a lot.

4283
02:06:19.771 --> 02:06:23.490
Where like the original creator gets like kicked off his own show.

4284
02:06:23.670 --> 02:06:24.930
Like you know John Crystalucci,

4285
02:06:24.931 --> 02:06:26.640
they guy who did ren and Stimpy.

4286
02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:27.661
Yeah,

4287
02:06:27.661 --> 02:06:28.650
he got that happened to him.

4288
02:06:28.651 --> 02:06:29.970
He like created this whole show.

4289
02:06:29.971 --> 02:06:31.020
He was like his thing,

4290
02:06:31.021 --> 02:06:32.220
his complete vision.

4291
02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:36.960
And then I think they fired him and like kept doing his show without the

4292
02:06:36.961 --> 02:06:37.590
creator.

4293
02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:38.341
Oh my God,

4294
02:06:38.341 --> 02:06:39.061
that's so crazy.

4295
02:06:39.061 --> 02:06:39.841
Harman Harman,

4296
02:06:39.841 --> 02:06:41.670
Dan Harmon and similar community.

4297
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:42.000
Right.

4298
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.080
They brought him back.

4299
02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:43.561
Yeah.

4300
02:06:43.561 --> 02:06:46.790
Well that's the only way you're going to get that show dummy like that.

4301
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.360
The thing about your show,

4302
02:06:48.361 --> 02:06:49.560
and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass,

4303
02:06:49.561 --> 02:06:51.360
but your show is so obviously you,

4304
02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:52.411
it's so,

4305
02:06:52.411 --> 02:06:56.310
you have this funny little smile in every episode where

4306
02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:59.370
you're not the best actor in the world.

4307
02:06:59.371 --> 02:07:00.450
You're not trying to be,

4308
02:07:00.690 --> 02:07:04.770
but it's half of what's funny about it is that you're,

4309
02:07:04.771 --> 02:07:05.161
you know,

4310
02:07:05.161 --> 02:07:05.421
you're,

4311
02:07:05.421 --> 02:07:09.390
you're going through these incredibly ridiculous scenarios over and over and

4312
02:07:09.391 --> 02:07:11.820
over again and I could recognize that you're,

4313
02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:12.181
you know,

4314
02:07:12.181 --> 02:07:15.990
you're enjoying the actual piece while you're a part of it.

4315
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:17.220
And it's really fun,

4316
02:07:17.221 --> 02:07:17.520
man.

4317
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:20.940
It's cool if somebody came in fucking started adding to it,

4318
02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:21.481
you know,

4319
02:07:21.481 --> 02:07:23.400
especially some suit from coach,

4320
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:27.030
they would just dick all over this shit.

4321
02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.670
What are you showing me right now is horrible.

4322
02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:30.630
I don't see why it's funny.

4323
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:34.920
I would love to just keep making these little youtube shows then have someone

4324
02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:36.310
have that situation happen,

4325
02:07:36.311 --> 02:07:39.580
like where some network changes it and I dunno.

4326
02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:43.510
Well I think your show ruins it in some way could probably become so big because

4327
02:07:43.511 --> 02:07:46.030
it's so good that they can't do that.

4328
02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.200
I think it's totally possible.

4329
02:07:47.201 --> 02:07:48.200
I think I,

4330
02:07:48.210 --> 02:07:49.540
I'm not blowing smoke up your ass again.

4331
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:53.020
I think your show is really fucking good and I think like letting all these

4332
02:07:53.021 --> 02:07:56.140
people know about it now you're going to get like more people downloading it and

4333
02:07:56.141 --> 02:07:57.220
letting more people know about it.

4334
02:07:57.221 --> 02:07:58.000
On Twitter.

4335
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.050
It's just a matter of time.

4336
02:07:59.080 --> 02:07:59.740
It's the,

4337
02:07:59.740 --> 02:07:59.871
the,

4338
02:07:59.871 --> 02:08:03.610
the finding finding it is what's hard sometimes it's like there's so much good

4339
02:08:03.611 --> 02:08:04.600
shit out there now.

4340
02:08:04.690 --> 02:08:06.220
It's hard for people to find stuff.

4341
02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:08.620
So what is true when you have a podcast,

4342
02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:10.450
it's one of the cool things that you get to be,

4343
02:08:10.451 --> 02:08:11.790
you get to be like a guy who likes,

4344
02:08:11.791 --> 02:08:12.071
shows,

4345
02:08:12.071 --> 02:08:13.570
people some cool stuff that you found,

4346
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:14.583
I guess to,

4347
02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:14.861
you know,

4348
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:15.970
open the door for them.

4349
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.490
So you're probably not going to need a network.

4350
02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:19.690
They'll just fuck it up.

4351
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:21.400
They would never let you get away with that.

4352
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:23.500
There might be a network that would let him,

4353
02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:25.720
there might be a network and adult swim maybe.

4354
02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.340
I mean they let Tim and Eric do their thing.

4355
02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:27.620
Yeah.

4356
02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:31.000
What kind of resistance did you guys have ever actually adult swim is,

4357
02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:31.961
is pretty cool.

4358
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:32.470
Like that.

4359
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:33.040
Yeah.

4360
02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:33.431
Yeah.

4361
02:08:33.431 --> 02:08:36.880
They kind of like Tim and Eric and a lot of freedom to obviously,

4362
02:08:36.881 --> 02:08:37.430
yeah,

4363
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:39.100
I mean fucking show.

4364
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:39.970
So crazy.

4365
02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:40.361
Yeah,

4366
02:08:40.361 --> 02:08:45.361
that shit was so fun to work on because I would do screwed up edits like chop

4367
02:08:45.431 --> 02:08:46.480
things up and like whatever,

4368
02:08:46.481 --> 02:08:50.320
like kind of make a joke out of it just to show them to so they could,

4369
02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:50.650
you know,

4370
02:08:50.650 --> 02:08:55.060
just almost to like surprise them thinking they're going to hate this but it'll

4371
02:08:55.061 --> 02:08:57.760
be funny to see them and then they'd be like do more of that,

4372
02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:58.001
you know,

4373
02:08:58.001 --> 02:08:58.800
they push,

4374
02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:02.560
push the weirdness and the network would be like that to like make it weirder,

4375
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:04.660
which is like a great note to get.

4376
02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:07.000
I found out about you guys from Eddie Bravo,

4377
02:09:07.001 --> 02:09:07.751
Eddie Bravo.

4378
02:09:07.751 --> 02:09:08.860
I'm like,

4379
02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:12.160
I don't know if he got it on online or on.

4380
02:09:12.230 --> 02:09:13.600
Is it available online?

4381
02:09:13.601 --> 02:09:14.170
Like how could you,

4382
02:09:14.170 --> 02:09:15.370
there's a DVD available,

4383
02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.420
anything like that and Eric stuff.

4384
02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:17.283
Yeah.

4385
02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:18.071
Yeah.

4386
02:09:18.071 --> 02:09:21.880
I think@adultswim.com they have like a ton of episodes and,

4387
02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:24.010
but there's DVDs somewhere.

4388
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:24.281
Yeah,

4389
02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:24.900
it must be.

4390
02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:29.900
I'm pretty sure I got DVDs because I remember him watching like a ton of them in

4391
02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:32.950
a row and having people over the house to watch him.

4392
02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:33.761
People look like,

4393
02:09:33.761 --> 02:09:35.140
what the fuck are you watching?

4394
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.771
I'm like,

4395
02:09:35.771 --> 02:09:36.221
and they're like,

4396
02:09:36.221 --> 02:09:36.701
he's like,

4397
02:09:36.701 --> 02:09:37.990
you got to understand what they're doing.

4398
02:09:37.991 --> 02:09:39.100
You're don't understand what they're doing.

4399
02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:41.800
And like he would have some people and he would try to show it to them out of

4400
02:09:41.801 --> 02:09:43.120
context and they just totally,

4401
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:44.770
they'll get really mad at it.

4402
02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:46.300
It's just not funny.

4403
02:09:46.301 --> 02:09:48.130
They get mad that people think it's funny.

4404
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:49.510
Yeah.

4405
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:50.230
That was,

4406
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:51.490
Eddie got some of those reactions,

4407
02:09:51.491 --> 02:09:53.200
but he fucking loves that show.

4408
02:09:53.230 --> 02:09:53.870
God Damn.

4409
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:55.090
He's always talking about that show.

4410
02:09:55.810 --> 02:09:57.010
It's just such a weird show.

4411
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:59.650
What was the one where they play like,

4412
02:10:00.130 --> 02:10:00.800
I think it was,

4413
02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:01.810
was it Eric?

4414
02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:03.670
The played the guy that was in the,

4415
02:10:03.671 --> 02:10:04.504
um,

4416
02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:04.991
the,

4417
02:10:04.991 --> 02:10:05.291
uh,

4418
02:10:05.291 --> 02:10:07.060
there was a trailer park and he got pregnant.

4419
02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:07.720
Uh,

4420
02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:08.230
that was,

4421
02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:09.910
that was for funny or die.

4422
02:10:09.911 --> 02:10:10.721
That was the ticket.

4423
02:10:10.721 --> 02:10:11.800
It's called the Terrys.

4424
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:12.071
Yeah,

4425
02:10:12.071 --> 02:10:12.680
the Terry.

4426
02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:13.960
That was intense.

4427
02:10:14.730 --> 02:10:15.790
Fucking crazy.

4428
02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:19.690
That was one of the craziest things I've ever seen.

4429
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:20.380
Yeah.

4430
02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:24.640
It was so ridiculous and preposterous and a perfect example of just taking

4431
02:10:24.641 --> 02:10:27.880
something to this incredibly weird place that you never saw common.

4432
02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:29.733
Yeah,

4433
02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.460
it's great.

4434
02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:31.030
Terry's.

4435
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.863
It's good one.

4436
02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:33.250
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

4437
02:10:33.250 --> 02:10:35.680
And where I'm does music videos now,

4438
02:10:35.681 --> 02:10:37.210
like really good music video.

4439
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:39.310
If you've seen what like,

4440
02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:39.821
oh yeah,

4441
02:10:39.821 --> 02:10:40.654
you should see somebody.

4442
02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:41.381
These music videos.

4443
02:10:41.381 --> 02:10:43.170
Have you ever seen some of the music videos?

4444
02:10:43.171 --> 02:10:43.440
He does.

4445
02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:44.273
Yeah.

4446
02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:46.120
You would love bubble Ba.

4447
02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:47.460
Ah God.

4448
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:48.580
You should watch bubble.

4449
02:10:48.581 --> 02:10:49.414
But man,

4450
02:10:49.710 --> 02:10:52.330
this pull that I did a music video with Eric.

4451
02:10:52.590 --> 02:10:54.470
I'm called back Bush.

4452
02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:55.451
Backpacker.

4453
02:10:55.451 --> 02:10:56.140
Bush.

4454
02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:56.710
Yeah.

4455
02:10:56.710 --> 02:10:58.870
Backpack or over back backpacker Bush.

4456
02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.580
<v 0>When we were at this backpacker bar and he was talking about</v>

4457
02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:08.890
the bushes there and we should make a song or a rap about it.

4458
02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.200
<v 5>Like if you've been fast pack,</v>

4459
02:11:10.530 --> 02:11:11.291
uh yeah.

4460
02:11:11.291 --> 02:11:12.190
Let's play that man.

4461
02:11:12.191 --> 02:11:13.024
I want to see that again.

4462
02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:14.250
Seen that in Hawaiian.

4463
02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:15.220
Crack me up.

4464
02:11:15.970 --> 02:11:16.301
Okay.

4465
02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:17.750
Put on backpacker Bush.

4466
02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:18.551
It's true,

4467
02:11:18.551 --> 02:11:19.240
man.

4468
02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:20.051
It's true though.

4469
02:11:20.051 --> 02:11:20.591
If you've been in the,

4470
02:11:20.591 --> 02:11:22.990
on the Appalachian trail and you're just hiking,

4471
02:11:22.991 --> 02:11:23.980
I'm sure you have a massive,

4472
02:11:23.981 --> 02:11:24.080
yeah.

4473
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:24.913
<v 0>Bush.</v>

4474
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:26.350
Is that what they were talking about?

4475
02:11:26.351 --> 02:11:27.550
Are they talking about bushes?

4476
02:11:28.330 --> 02:11:28.870
You'll see.

4477
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:29.350
Okay.

4478
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:30.183
Don't tell me.

4479
02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.250
Let's just watch it for folks at home.

4480
02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.780
Why is Doug Benson on their skip ad and the ad for what?

4481
02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:40.120
He has a show on that channel.

4482
02:11:40.170 --> 02:11:40.511
Oh,

4483
02:11:40.511 --> 02:11:41.321
getting Doug with high,

4484
02:11:41.321 --> 02:11:41.660
I think,

4485
02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:41.890
right?

4486
02:11:41.890 --> 02:11:42.723
Yeah.

4487
02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:46.810
Smell up here.

4488
02:11:46.811 --> 02:11:47.690
It's like a wait,

4489
02:11:47.691 --> 02:11:48.690
you got something else planned?

4490
02:11:48.850 --> 02:11:49.490
Oh,

4491
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:51.410
you fucking SAP.

4492
02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:53.173
What is that

4493
02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:55.941
guy?

4494
02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:58.110
A lot of tabs going right now though.

4495
02:11:58.760 --> 02:11:59.550
What is that?

4496
02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:00.383
That was the adult swim.

4497
02:12:05.330 --> 02:12:05.511
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

4498
02:12:05.511 --> 02:12:06.380
This takes a little minute.

4499
02:12:06.610 --> 02:12:08.300
13 just once into the club here.

4500
02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.150
There's a giant fat black guy with gold chains on.

4501
02:12:15.150 --> 02:12:17.120
Just looks like a pretty creative and funky place.

4502
02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:19.490
It's got to be some trim.

4503
02:12:19.491 --> 02:12:20.324
You hear from me tonight?

4504
02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.730
I'm looking for strange.

4505
02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.050
I'm hunting for sleep.

4506
02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:32.210
I like to choose my songs.

4507
02:12:32.211 --> 02:12:33.044
I'm a condom.

4508
02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:36.380
Linkous to please my lovers with my sexy.

4509
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:37.120
Nothing.

4510
02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:40.940
They always climax when I lift him like this.

4511
02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:47.650
I just won't stop until you come mocking.

4512
02:12:47.651 --> 02:12:49.880
Hit the G spy with my long hair.

4513
02:12:50.650 --> 02:12:51.431
<v 5>You have to see,</v>

4514
02:12:51.431 --> 02:12:52.000
man,

4515
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.270
you have to see how preposterous.

4516
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:55.560
He says we're missing so much of it and yeah,

4517
02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.620
we don't have to play the whole thing.

4518
02:12:56.621 --> 02:12:57.211
I just wanted to,

4519
02:12:57.211 --> 02:12:57.970
yeah,

4520
02:12:57.970 --> 02:12:59.730
let's not because otherwise it's just a bad rap.

4521
02:12:59.790 --> 02:13:00.340
It sounds like it.

4522
02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:00.551
Yeah.

4523
02:13:00.551 --> 02:13:05.350
It's like the context is that you've got this giant weird rapper in a backpacker

4524
02:13:05.351 --> 02:13:05.831
bars.

4525
02:13:05.831 --> 02:13:07.000
You're surrounded by hippies,

4526
02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:08.560
the opposite place.

4527
02:13:08.561 --> 02:13:10.330
Did he go to hook up with anyone?

4528
02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:10.990
Yeah.

4529
02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:11.970
It's pretty strange.

4530
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.351
You got it.

4531
02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:12.510
Yeah.

4532
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:12.780
Yeah,

4533
02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:13.081
it does.

4534
02:13:13.081 --> 02:13:13.460
It pride.

4535
02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.400
A little button is another one that I recommend.

4536
02:13:15.490 --> 02:13:16.300
I would check that out.

4537
02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:16.601
Yeah.

4538
02:13:16.601 --> 02:13:18.790
This is not something you should listen to it.

4539
02:13:18.791 --> 02:13:19.870
You should definitely watch it.

4540
02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:21.670
You got to watch all these.

4541
02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:22.001
Yeah.

4542
02:13:22.001 --> 02:13:23.980
Well that's the beautiful thing about their show.

4543
02:13:23.981 --> 02:13:24.814
The show is,

4544
02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:25.930
<v 0>you know the visually,</v>

4545
02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:26.800
it's so bizarre.

4546
02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:30.280
There's so much weird shit out now because of that.

4547
02:13:30.490 --> 02:13:30.731
You know,

4548
02:13:30.731 --> 02:13:35.731
because sort of opens up the doors to this observed sort of style of comedy.

4549
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:37.410
I think it's becoming more popular.

4550
02:13:37.411 --> 02:13:38.244
Right.

4551
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:39.211
I like that.

4552
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:39.391
Yeah.

4553
02:13:39.391 --> 02:13:39.871
I liked that.

4554
02:13:39.871 --> 02:13:40.261
The fact,

4555
02:13:40.261 --> 02:13:41.430
I like the fact that the inner,

4556
02:13:41.490 --> 02:13:43.980
like anyone can have their own thing and if it goes,

4557
02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:45.030
if it catches on,

4558
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:46.410
it kind of catches on.

4559
02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:46.801
Yeah.

4560
02:13:46.801 --> 02:13:47.670
Like we were talking about,

4561
02:13:47.671 --> 02:13:48.270
um,

4562
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:50.460
people that were on Twitter that are funny on Twitter,

4563
02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:51.810
it's very democratic,

4564
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:52.290
right?

4565
02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:52.710
Yeah.

4566
02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:52.861
Oh,

4567
02:13:52.861 --> 02:13:53.610
for sure.

4568
02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:53.791
Yeah.

4569
02:13:53.791 --> 02:13:55.140
All it needs is a,

4570
02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:56.670
what is this jammy?

4571
02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:57.481
Yeah.

4572
02:13:57.481 --> 02:13:59.310
Let's not play this while we're talking.

4573
02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:00.900
I won't know what the fuck you're doing.

4574
02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:02.033
Um,

4575
02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:02.761
I think it's,

4576
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:03.570
uh,

4577
02:14:03.570 --> 02:14:03.841
it's,

4578
02:14:03.841 --> 02:14:06.480
it's beautiful because all it takes is like one person to find it.

4579
02:14:06.630 --> 02:14:07.710
They send it to someone else.

4580
02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:08.791
That person says,

4581
02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:10.110
and it virally spreads.

4582
02:14:10.111 --> 02:14:10.560
I mean,

4583
02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:15.180
so many things that are made by regular folks just virally spread that don't,

4584
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:16.350
it doesn't even have to make sense.

4585
02:14:16.351 --> 02:14:17.100
Like there was,

4586
02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:20.880
there was some people that were not famous at all and they made some Christmas

4587
02:14:20.881 --> 02:14:21.900
rap about,

4588
02:14:21.930 --> 02:14:22.763
uh,

4589
02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:25.080
like doing something in their Christmas jammies.

4590
02:14:25.081 --> 02:14:25.661
It was like the,

4591
02:14:25.661 --> 02:14:26.281
the husband,

4592
02:14:26.281 --> 02:14:27.240
the wife and the kids.

4593
02:14:27.550 --> 02:14:30.120
It's kind of like fucking 30 million views or something like that.

4594
02:14:30.121 --> 02:14:33.240
And it was just totally homemade thing that they did.

4595
02:14:33.450 --> 02:14:37.080
And it's just people started sending to each other at work and then next thing

4596
02:14:37.081 --> 02:14:38.880
you know it's this gigantic,

4597
02:14:38.881 --> 02:14:40.200
huge fucking thing.

4598
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:42.780
Just a freight train running over America,

4599
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:44.700
spreading from email to email.

4600
02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:45.720
I did,

4601
02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:47.340
I did these videos.

4602
02:14:47.341 --> 02:14:48.570
Ever seen the Gi Joe,

4603
02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:52.680
a voiceover remix videos from now 10 years ago or so.

4604
02:14:52.681 --> 02:14:53.090
Good man.

4605
02:14:53.090 --> 02:14:53.250
Yeah.

4606
02:14:53.250 --> 02:14:54.990
My me and my friend made the first,

4607
02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:55.943
well it was like mate,

4608
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:57.630
really my friend Eric fencers idea.

4609
02:14:57.631 --> 02:14:59.010
But what is it?

4610
02:14:59.190 --> 02:15:01.200
They went like a viral,

4611
02:15:01.201 --> 02:15:03.710
there are these little 32nd you know what you know about those were,

4612
02:15:03.711 --> 02:15:05.010
I knew about this before.

4613
02:15:05.011 --> 02:15:06.390
I knew you had done it doc.

4614
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:08.760
Like I watch those when I was in,

4615
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:11.350
probably like in my last year of college,

4616
02:15:11.351 --> 02:15:14.160
it's like late nineties we made them for you tube.

4617
02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:19.110
They re voiced over GI Joe commercials more like what their lips would kind of

4618
02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:19.681
be saying,

4619
02:15:19.681 --> 02:15:21.360
but just mixed in with just weird.

4620
02:15:21.361 --> 02:15:22.021
It's just we,

4621
02:15:22.021 --> 02:15:24.750
it's the same stuff that you do manage just the same wholesome up.

4622
02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:25.531
God,

4623
02:15:25.531 --> 02:15:26.364
I don't know.

4624
02:15:26.370 --> 02:15:27.660
I hope it translates.

4625
02:15:28.110 --> 02:15:28.261
No,

4626
02:15:28.261 --> 02:15:30.150
those are good to listen to because there's 30 seconds.

4627
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:31.040
Okay.

4628
02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:31.420
All right.

4629
02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:32.370
What's smelled like best about,

4630
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.700
yeah,

4631
02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:34.260
Joe Public Service announcements.

4632
02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:36.843
<v 12>You're not my friend.</v>

4633
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.560
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

4634
02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:45.360
[inaudible] [inaudible]

4635
02:15:47.170 --> 02:15:48.310
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

4636
02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:48.731
<v 12>well,</v>

4637
02:15:48.731 --> 02:15:49.900
I'm just curious what you mean.

4638
02:15:49.901 --> 02:15:50.350
He said,

4639
02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.550
dude,

4640
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:51.161
you're talking to you.

4641
02:15:51.161 --> 02:15:51.994
Well,

4642
02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:53.050
my friends are here.

4643
02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:53.883
Oh cool.

4644
02:15:53.970 --> 02:15:54.760
See you later.

4645
02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:55.593
Okay.

4646
02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:57.910
<v 0>I get you.</v>

4647
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:59.190
Stop that you have,

4648
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:00.000
but I did that boys.

4649
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:00.811
Who's that weird dude?

4650
02:16:00.811 --> 02:16:01.644
You're talking to your brother?

4651
02:16:02.730 --> 02:16:03.630
Wow.

4652
02:16:04.770 --> 02:16:05.610
You'd have to see that.

4653
02:16:05.611 --> 02:16:05.991
That's another,

4654
02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:06.960
it's the cartoon,

4655
02:16:06.961 --> 02:16:09.440
the Gi Joe Cartoon with different voices over it.

4656
02:16:09.450 --> 02:16:09.601
Now.

4657
02:16:09.601 --> 02:16:10.500
I kind of remember it,

4658
02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:14.760
but we did those before youtube and we put them,

4659
02:16:14.850 --> 02:16:17.010
we made like a quick time of them.

4660
02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:17.281
You know,

4661
02:16:17.281 --> 02:16:19.260
back in the day you had to like watch a quick time.

4662
02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:22.780
What's more important before youtube or a BC?

4663
02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:25.860
That's the new,

4664
02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:27.210
let's hit reset on time.

4665
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:28.103
Yeah.

4666
02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:28.720
Where we are.

4667
02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:30.220
We are in the year five

4668
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:31.053
<v 1>right now.</v>

4669
02:16:31.330 --> 02:16:35.620
What year are we in Wendy's before youtube is the new BC.

4670
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:37.743
I mean it's fine.

4671
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:40.330
Like for historical reasons.

4672
02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:40.631
Yeah,

4673
02:16:40.631 --> 02:16:41.081
we got hit.

4674
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:41.980
We sat on the clock.

4675
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.990
If you really stop and think about it,

4676
02:16:43.991 --> 02:16:44.110
the,

4677
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:48.880
the ability to distribute information like that in video form never existed

4678
02:16:48.881 --> 02:16:50.350
before like that again.

4679
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:53.920
That's sort of a quick and easy to me really will have an impact.

4680
02:16:53.921 --> 02:16:56.590
It's similar to a messiah that is wild.

4681
02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:59.650
Youtube is the Messiah in a lot of ways.

4682
02:16:59.651 --> 02:17:00.970
While the Internet certainly is,

4683
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:02.290
and a lot of ways,

4684
02:17:02.650 --> 02:17:03.260
you know,

4685
02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:03.560
I mean the,

4686
02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.090
if the Internet wasn't a real thing and you talked about it,

4687
02:17:07.091 --> 02:17:09.400
if you were all sitting around a campfire and you're like,

4688
02:17:09.401 --> 02:17:13.250
one day there will be a discovery and the discovery will be that we can

4689
02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:14.500
communicate our ideas,

4690
02:17:14.501 --> 02:17:15.490
not just through our mouth,

4691
02:17:15.491 --> 02:17:20.140
but through wireless transmissions that can be picked up on the other side of

4692
02:17:20.141 --> 02:17:20.974
the world.

4693
02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.270
Internet could work not just on one continent,

4694
02:17:25.271 --> 02:17:27.340
but on all cops get tied up in that camp.

4695
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:28.833
They would go crazy.

4696
02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:30.480
They didn't get the flashlights out.

4697
02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:34.570
[inaudible] Donald Bruno guy on fire because he insisted that the universe was

4698
02:17:34.571 --> 02:17:35.404
infinite,

4699
02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:35.801
you know?

4700
02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:38.620
So imagine what the fuck they would do to you if you ever predicted the

4701
02:17:38.621 --> 02:17:39.340
Internet.

4702
02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.150
Oh my God.

4703
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:44.140
Anything that anyone could say right now that they would get thrown in jail for

4704
02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:46.060
like about a scientific concept?

4705
02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:46.860
No,

4706
02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:47.190
no,

4707
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.590
not done.

4708
02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:48.423
We're past that.

4709
02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:48.971
We're done.

4710
02:17:48.971 --> 02:17:51.190
Except if you're in like some shit hole that you know,

4711
02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:54.400
still wants to teach creation as I know what to throw you in jail because like

4712
02:17:54.430 --> 02:17:57.520
there's all these people that are freaking out because of what Neil Tyson said

4713
02:17:57.521 --> 02:17:58.360
on cosmos.

4714
02:17:58.840 --> 02:17:59.673
Wait,

4715
02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:01.660
they just don't want it there.

4716
02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:03.550
Their counterpoint is what they want.

4717
02:18:03.551 --> 02:18:03.821
Right.

4718
02:18:03.821 --> 02:18:05.220
They want it to also the creation.

4719
02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:06.130
His point of view too,

4720
02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:07.870
because he was saying pretty clearly,

4721
02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:08.710
you know,

4722
02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:11.200
we understand the creation is kind of ridiculous.

4723
02:18:11.201 --> 02:18:13.990
Like Biblical side of the universe is so tiny.

4724
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.770
What were you saying?

4725
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:15.370
What do I thought?

4726
02:18:15.370 --> 02:18:16.420
I read it in the Middle East.

4727
02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:19.390
They were gonna they atheism was being criminalized or something,

4728
02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:21.340
but I don't remember where I saw that in some parts of it.

4729
02:18:21.341 --> 02:18:24.760
Probably the CIA just trying to get us excited about going over there and

4730
02:18:24.761 --> 02:18:25.594
fucking things up.

4731
02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:26.770
You know,

4732
02:18:26.770 --> 02:18:27.790
like atheists.

4733
02:18:28.330 --> 02:18:28.900
Yeah.

4734
02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:29.400
I mean they're,

4735
02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:30.390
they're not even allowing atheist.

4736
02:18:30.391 --> 02:18:32.290
So then the liberals have to step in and go,

4737
02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:33.520
we have to protect the atheist,

4738
02:18:34.010 --> 02:18:34.843
you know,

4739
02:18:34.890 --> 02:18:38.830
in salon.com should we invade Syria since they're assaulting atheists,

4740
02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:44.350
should we now reconsider our invasion to protect atheism?

4741
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.100
I don't think that would sell as hard as if they were like,

4742
02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:48.520
you know,

4743
02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.960
black and Christianity or something.

4744
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:54.990
I think that propaganda should be like a crime of the highest order manipulation

4745
02:18:55.151 --> 02:18:55.481
like that.

4746
02:18:55.481 --> 02:18:56.530
If that was really true,

4747
02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:59.440
if someone actually really did do something like that in order to get people

4748
02:18:59.441 --> 02:19:03.280
excited about war and made up some bullshit about them attacking atheism in

4749
02:19:03.281 --> 02:19:06.520
order to get support on one side and that knowing that people were going to die

4750
02:19:06.550 --> 02:19:07.310
because of that,

4751
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:08.050
that should be true.

4752
02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:08.710
Yes.

4753
02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:12.280
It should be treated as like more than capital murder cause it's murder of

4754
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:15.670
possibly hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who knows.

4755
02:19:15.671 --> 02:19:20.230
Maybe cause you could cause with one engineered conflict it could cause a chain

4756
02:19:20.231 --> 02:19:21.850
reaction that would cause a nuclear war,

4757
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.840
which maybe ruin the environment forever like that.

4758
02:19:24.841 --> 02:19:25.840
You should be treated like that.

4759
02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:27.740
But anyone who instigates war,

4760
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.640
like we were so nonchalant about the idea that they were considering a false

4761
02:19:31.641 --> 02:19:33.170
flag attack on Iran,

4762
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:37.580
a false flag attack that I ran engineered on America right before the end of the

4763
02:19:37.581 --> 02:19:38.450
Bush administration.

4764
02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:39.380
You guys wear that?

4765
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:40.311
Yeah.

4766
02:19:40.311 --> 02:19:41.144
It was something.

4767
02:19:41.170 --> 02:19:42.460
Is it a known fact that,

4768
02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:44.720
I'm pretty sure I should probably Google it,

4769
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:45.620
but Cheney,

4770
02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:45.921
let's,

4771
02:19:45.921 --> 02:19:48.470
let's look up Cheney planned false flag.

4772
02:19:48.471 --> 02:19:49.430
Cheney plan.

4773
02:19:49.431 --> 02:19:50.240
False flag.

4774
02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.260
I Ran Cheney.

4775
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.460
I think it was pretty much established that they were considering it.

4776
02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:57.530
I heard he's a nice guy though.

4777
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:58.423
He's just shit

4778
02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:02.953
I hear he's like,

4779
02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:03.290
he's,

4780
02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:04.280
he's like so cool.

4781
02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:06.940
Like well if you're ever having to get rid of a beer with him,

4782
02:20:06.941 --> 02:20:07.774
he's a great guy.

4783
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:08.290
Yeah.

4784
02:20:08.290 --> 02:20:08.480
Yeah.

4785
02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:10.340
The media blackout on Cheney.

4786
02:20:10.341 --> 02:20:11.750
I ran false flag.

4787
02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:12.610
There's a guy,

4788
02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:13.443
um,

4789
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:14.413
Google it.

4790
02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:14.930
Um,

4791
02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:16.490
Jamie cause it's only four minutes.

4792
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:18.110
Who's a guy talking about it?

4793
02:20:18.770 --> 02:20:19.603
Um,

4794
02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:20.673
I really

4795
02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:24.140
<v 14>article that you wrote that I found actually most interesting in the article</v>

4796
02:20:24.141 --> 02:20:25.370
hasn't gotten that much attention.

4797
02:20:25.371 --> 02:20:27.900
But I want to get your take on this,

4798
02:20:27.901 --> 02:20:31.700
and this relates to a story or an incident that happened a couple of months ago

4799
02:20:31.701 --> 02:20:32.570
and many of you remember it.

4800
02:20:32.571 --> 02:20:33.950
It was in the straight of water moves.

4801
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:38.930
There was an incident where an American carrier almost blew a couple of Iranian

4802
02:20:38.931 --> 02:20:41.630
speed boats out of the water and perhaps would have started,

4803
02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:42.180
uh,

4804
02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:43.250
the next war,

4805
02:20:43.251 --> 02:20:44.170
a war against the law,

4806
02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:46.130
and I'll hop potentially a world war three.

4807
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:47.750
And it was a Verdad,

4808
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:49.210
thankfully at the,

4809
02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:49.851
at the last second,

4810
02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:53.630
we later learned that there was really nothing to be terribly concerned about.

4811
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:58.040
The incident was overblown and that there was a vice admiral in charge of the

4812
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:59.140
fleet and the,

4813
02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:01.520
and the Strait of Hormuz who said basically there was,

4814
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:04.070
there was no concern there that it was overblown.

4815
02:21:04.250 --> 02:21:04.791
But yeah,

4816
02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:05.451
the second part,

4817
02:21:05.451 --> 02:21:06.800
basically he is concerned,

4818
02:21:06.801 --> 02:21:07.634
but again,

4819
02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:08.220
we're blending.

4820
02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:09.270
It never threatened me.

4821
02:21:09.271 --> 02:21:09.900
He never threatened.

4822
02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:14.600
And you talk about this Jen vice admirals name is Kevin Cosgrove.

4823
02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:15.390
And,

4824
02:21:15.390 --> 02:21:18.800
and in your article you write nonetheless cost Crufts demeanor,

4825
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:22.970
angered Cheney according to the former senior intelligence official.

4826
02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:25.310
But a lesson was learned in the incident.

4827
02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:30.290
The public had supported the idea of retaliation and it was even asking why the

4828
02:21:30.291 --> 02:21:31.610
US didn't do more.

4829
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:34.640
The former officials said that a few weeks later,

4830
02:21:34.641 --> 02:21:37.820
a meeting took place in the vice president's office.

4831
02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:39.621
The subject was,

4832
02:21:39.621 --> 02:21:43.970
had to create a casus belli lie between Teflon and Washington.

4833
02:21:43.971 --> 02:21:44.804
He said,

4834
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:49.310
what you're writing there is that Cheney there was meeting in the White House,

4835
02:21:49.311 --> 02:21:49.911
were chaining,

4836
02:21:49.911 --> 02:21:53.420
presided over looking to cook up the next war,

4837
02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:57.380
like a false war based on false intelligence.

4838
02:21:58.130 --> 02:21:58.610
Uh,

4839
02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:01.890
my oldest son is a lawyer and when I fell,

4840
02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:05.090
I send them this story before it was published,

4841
02:22:05.170 --> 02:22:09.020
that basically in a final form it just a day and he wrote back and he said,

4842
02:22:09.021 --> 02:22:10.580
you really very deleted this one,

4843
02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:12.790
but casus belli um,

4844
02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:16.300
how many persevere?

4845
02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:18.710
Anyway,

4846
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:19.730
there was a meeting among the,

4847
02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:23.630
among the items among the items considered and rejected,

4848
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:27.120
which is why I did New York who did not publish it on grounds that it wasn't

4849
02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:28.013
accepted.

4850
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:30.860
One of the items was why not every,

4851
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:34.050
there was a dozen ideas profit out of how to trigger,

4852
02:22:34.051 --> 02:22:36.720
or the one that interested me the most was,

4853
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.980
why don't we bill,

4854
02:22:38.010 --> 02:22:40.200
we and our shipyard bill four or five,

4855
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:42.630
I weighed boats that look like Iranian PT boats,

4856
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:43.950
put Navy seals on them.

4857
02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:45.601
There's a lot of arms,

4858
02:22:45.601 --> 02:22:49.830
and the next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz start to shoot

4859
02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:54.300
up my cost some lives and it was rejected because you can't have Americans

4860
02:22:54.301 --> 02:22:55.170
killing Americans.

4861
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:55.620
But that,

4862
02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:56.340
that's the kind of,

4863
02:22:56.340 --> 02:23:00.000
that's the level of stuff we were talking about application,

4864
02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:01.393
but that was

4865
02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:02.370
<v 1>holy fuck.</v>

4866
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:03.210
That was rejected.

4867
02:23:03.210 --> 02:23:05.220
But the idea that that could ever even be discussed,

4868
02:23:05.221 --> 02:23:07.110
and you're not talking about the 1960s either.

4869
02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:08.820
You're talking about the 2000 come on,

4870
02:23:08.821 --> 02:23:10.350
we're just spit balling here.

4871
02:23:10.770 --> 02:23:11.610
We'll just throw it out like,

4872
02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:12.361
hey,

4873
02:23:12.361 --> 02:23:15.510
the only way to really got to be free box a little bit.

4874
02:23:15.511 --> 02:23:17.970
How come you guys are all for fucking freedom with chokes?

4875
02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:19.890
We can't be free with foreign policy.

4876
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:20.570
Yeah,

4877
02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:21.010
come on.

4878
02:23:21.010 --> 02:23:22.950
We got to be creative brainstorming,

4879
02:23:22.951 --> 02:23:23.910
throwing things around.

4880
02:23:23.911 --> 02:23:24.690
Man.

4881
02:23:24.690 --> 02:23:25.860
We're not committed to these things,

4882
02:23:25.861 --> 02:23:26.550
man.

4883
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:29.970
We're fucking free spirits here and that's the kind of outside the box thinking

4884
02:23:29.971 --> 02:23:31.150
that got you in that position.

4885
02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:31.830
Dick.

4886
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:34.200
He had a fucking fake heart for a while and you didn't even know it.

4887
02:23:34.201 --> 02:23:34.850
Pulse,

4888
02:23:34.850 --> 02:23:36.000
if that's not in the Bible,

4889
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:36.863
you tell me what it is.

4890
02:23:37.470 --> 02:23:42.330
A dude who was running the military as a constant blood pumping straight

4891
02:23:42.331 --> 02:23:42.660
through.

4892
02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:43.261
You touch him.

4893
02:23:43.261 --> 02:23:44.160
He doesn't have a pulse.

4894
02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:44.994
He's dead.

4895
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:45.961
There's even a real pump.

4896
02:23:45.961 --> 02:23:46.560
No,

4897
02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:46.771
no,

4898
02:23:46.771 --> 02:23:46.951
no,

4899
02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:47.071
he's,

4900
02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:47.310
yeah,

4901
02:23:47.310 --> 02:23:48.130
real heart.

4902
02:23:48.130 --> 02:23:49.230
He had a heart transplant.

4903
02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.460
He got somebody else's heart.

4904
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:51.480
I would've kept the fake one.

4905
02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:53.940
I just have a joke about it a lot in his heart.

4906
02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:57.180
That's what that operation was about.

4907
02:23:58.330 --> 02:24:01.830
I had a joke about how there was an extra secret service agent and the everybody

4908
02:24:01.831 --> 02:24:05.070
else was eating burgers that gave him Tofu and salad and it was like,

4909
02:24:05.071 --> 02:24:05.904
what the fuck?

4910
02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:06.451
And you're like,

4911
02:24:06.451 --> 02:24:07.320
jog more laps.

4912
02:24:07.321 --> 02:24:07.951
I don't want fucking,

4913
02:24:07.951 --> 02:24:12.390
you guys aren't jogging fucking jog more labs and they follow chain no matter

4914
02:24:12.391 --> 02:24:16.060
what with a a giant truck that had no markings on it.

4915
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.920
Like what's with the truck?

4916
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:20.130
Shut up and do more laps and then the moment Cheney dies,

4917
02:24:20.131 --> 02:24:21.330
they fucking tased this guy,

4918
02:24:21.331 --> 02:24:22.080
hold him down.

4919
02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:23.130
Got Him like a fish,

4920
02:24:23.430 --> 02:24:25.530
pull out his beautiful healthy Tofu,

4921
02:24:25.531 --> 02:24:26.364
written heart,

4922
02:24:27.210 --> 02:24:28.110
open Cheney up,

4923
02:24:28.111 --> 02:24:30.030
throw them in the back of the truck and stitch them together.

4924
02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:33.030
When you open up Cheney's chest cavity bats fly.

4925
02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:40.080
It's probably like that episode or that the scene in the movie,

4926
02:24:40.081 --> 02:24:42.090
the thing John Carpenter movie,

4927
02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:46.080
whereas chest opens up like a giant mouth and just fucking snaps your arms off.

4928
02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.260
It's its own mouth.

4929
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:54.210
Do you remember that scene and that thing that to the thing guide where they

4930
02:24:54.211 --> 02:24:57.280
first found out that there was a fucking monster amongst them.

4931
02:24:57.300 --> 02:24:58.230
Great movie.

4932
02:24:58.290 --> 02:24:58.801
Oh,

4933
02:24:58.801 --> 02:24:59.370
it was great.

4934
02:24:59.370 --> 02:24:59.551
You know,

4935
02:24:59.551 --> 02:25:00.870
there's a really old thing.

4936
02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:02.520
It's really kind of interesting.

4937
02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:03.660
That's the one I'm talking about.

4938
02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:04.640
I don't like the new one.

4939
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:05.030
No,

4940
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.151
no,

4941
02:25:05.151 --> 02:25:05.291
no,

4942
02:25:05.291 --> 02:25:05.411
no,

4943
02:25:05.411 --> 02:25:05.551
no.

4944
02:25:05.551 --> 02:25:06.384
So there's three.

4945
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:07.620
There's three,

4946
02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:08.090
yeah.

4947
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:11.100
There's one from the 1950s I believe it's,

4948
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:13.530
I think it's the fifties you're judge carpenter thing.

4949
02:25:13.531 --> 02:25:15.930
It's like a really legit scary movie that is.

4950
02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:16.471
Oh yeah,

4951
02:25:16.471 --> 02:25:17.550
the John Carpenter is great.

4952
02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:18.151
Hey man,

4953
02:25:18.151 --> 02:25:19.500
the new one's not bad either.

4954
02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:20.970
The new one is not bad.

4955
02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:22.590
The thing from another world,

4956
02:25:22.591 --> 02:25:25.030
it's called from 1951

4957
02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:26.200
<v 0>it's based on the,</v>

4958
02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:26.620
yeah,

4959
02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:27.760
that's the original story.

4960
02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:29.590
The original story is the same thing.

4961
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:31.120
They're out in the cold.

4962
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:34.180
It's fucking great because it's not just a movie.

4963
02:25:34.181 --> 02:25:36.400
It's also a time capsule like you.

4964
02:25:36.401 --> 02:25:39.940
You're watching like they didn't know shit about making movies back then.

4965
02:25:39.941 --> 02:25:40.774
Like the way they did it.

4966
02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:41.010
The,

4967
02:25:41.010 --> 02:25:41.740
here it is right here.

4968
02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:42.490
Look at this.

4969
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:45.310
There's still figuring out how to scare people with film.

4970
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:47.023
<v 2>Same Font.</v>

4971
02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:52.360
This is the spot where it was the first scene and these are the first people who

4972
02:25:52.461 --> 02:25:53.294
saw the thing.

4973
02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:54.410
This is a Tim and Eric Sketch.

4974
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:57.230
Where did it come from?

4975
02:26:00.390 --> 02:26:02.080
Did I hit it?

4976
02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:05.540
I know it happened to coming up and making it and he's like,

4977
02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:07.713
oh,

4978
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:10.743
<v 15>why did you</v>

4979
02:26:12.490 --> 02:26:13.190
smack him?

4980
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:17.510
Just like a woman going through water in their face to both of them.

4981
02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:20.140
<v 2>Just Tom didn't question.</v>

4982
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:24.260
That's not even the world's greatest scientific minds connoisseur.

4983
02:26:24.370 --> 02:26:24.880
Gentleman.

4984
02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.140
Do you realize what we found?

4985
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.891
Uh,

4986
02:26:26.891 --> 02:26:28.180
being from another world,

4987
02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:30.460
it's different from us is one pole.

4988
02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:33.810
You can only communicate with

4989
02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.073
greenhouse.

4990
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.751
I was working,

4991
02:26:40.751 --> 02:26:42.490
I couldn't see then.

4992
02:26:42.810 --> 02:26:44.970
Then a blast of cold air and I heard those screen.

4993
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:46.483
Come here.

4994
02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:47.643
Get my car.

4995
02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:49.000
<v 15>No,</v>

4996
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:49.650
this in front of you.

4997
02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:51.480
This will be in my Netflix queue.

4998
02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:51.781
Oh,

4999
02:26:51.781 --> 02:26:52.561
it's got to be,

5000
02:26:52.561 --> 02:26:52.831
man.

5001
02:26:52.831 --> 02:26:53.371
I'm telling you.

5002
02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:55.230
You just got to get super big to watch it.

5003
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:57.090
I get the monster's coming.

5004
02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:58.233
I'm going to shoot it.

5005
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:59.583
It's on fire.

5006
02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:03.900
So stupid planes cannot destroy the thing.

5007
02:27:04.470 --> 02:27:05.260
Oh my God.

5008
02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:05.410
No.

5009
02:27:05.410 --> 02:27:06.420
Our bullets killing

5010
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:13.050
a story of modern science that challenges our imagination.

5011
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.903
Okay.

5012
02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:17.640
<v 0>It's awesome though.</v>

5013
02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:18.780
Really the full movie.

5014
02:27:20.250 --> 02:27:21.480
I watched it on a plane.

5015
02:27:21.481 --> 02:27:22.200
I was trapped.

5016
02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:23.100
There was nowhere to go,

5017
02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:24.140
so I've watched it.

5018
02:27:24.141 --> 02:27:24.301
It was,

5019
02:27:24.301 --> 02:27:25.680
movies are always better on the plane.

5020
02:27:25.890 --> 02:27:27.750
A lot of times it was a,

5021
02:27:27.751 --> 02:27:28.650
it was available.

5022
02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:29.101
It was for,

5023
02:27:29.101 --> 02:27:33.090
I was flying to England and it was a long flight and they had like a pretty good

5024
02:27:33.091 --> 02:27:35.670
selection of movies that you could rent or you could watch rather.

5025
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:36.870
And this was one of them.

5026
02:27:36.871 --> 02:27:37.441
I find joy,

5027
02:27:37.441 --> 02:27:37.771
the shit,

5028
02:27:37.771 --> 02:27:38.604
I haven't met him.

5029
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:42.990
I was like in tears watching a Jennifer Aniston like Rom com.

5030
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.030
It made you cry like laugh.

5031
02:27:45.031 --> 02:27:46.350
Cause I was on a plane.

5032
02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:46.801
No,

5033
02:27:46.801 --> 02:27:50.340
for some reason I was like connecting with the story and like watering up.

5034
02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:51.901
Like why,

5035
02:27:51.901 --> 02:27:52.860
what is it about the plane?

5036
02:27:52.861 --> 02:27:54.930
Is it the oxygen on a plane?

5037
02:27:54.931 --> 02:27:55.950
I loopy you drunk.

5038
02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:57.960
I should have wore my diaper.

5039
02:27:57.961 --> 02:27:59.490
I should've wore my lubricated diaper.

5040
02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:03.720
I watched too woody Allen movies on a plane.

5041
02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:06.870
I haven't watched woody Allen movies forever and I watched two of them on a

5042
02:28:06.871 --> 02:28:07.704
plane,

5043
02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:10.160
a bunch of blue jasmine on a plane aren't,

5044
02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:11.220
did I watch it in a hotel room?

5045
02:28:11.430 --> 02:28:11.971
But I watched,

5046
02:28:11.971 --> 02:28:12.770
um,

5047
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:13.080
uh,

5048
02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:13.580
the other one,

5049
02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:15.270
I'm playing midnight in Paris.

5050
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.950
I like that one.

5051
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:17.731
It's a good fucking movie.

5052
02:28:17.731 --> 02:28:20.190
But I wouldn't never sat down and wash that if I wasn't trapped in a seat.

5053
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:21.710
It was a good movie,

5054
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.800
<v 1>but it was interesting watching Owen Wilson play woody Allen.</v>

5055
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:26.083
Have you seen it?

5056
02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:27.110
Yeah,

5057
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:28.650
I don't remember doing woody Allen's.

5058
02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:29.513
Oh that's we.

5059
02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:30.110
Um,

5060
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:33.030
I guess I wasn't paying attention when I watched the home cause you not pay

5061
02:28:33.031 --> 02:28:33.671
attention to that.

5062
02:28:33.671 --> 02:28:35.600
I mean it's like so obvious what he's doing.

5063
02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:37.850
He's doing his version of Woody Allen.

5064
02:28:37.851 --> 02:28:39.230
I mean he is woody Allen.

5065
02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.350
Woody Allen's too old to do that character anymore.

5066
02:28:42.351 --> 02:28:45.050
Nobody wants to see him talk about being in love anymore.

5067
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:49.070
So he has to have other people sort of play him like as avatars.

5068
02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:52.370
Owen Wilson is his essentially his Avatar in that movie.

5069
02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:54.530
It's a trippy movie.

5070
02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:56.360
It's a really trippy movie.

5071
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:57.230
Hmm.

5072
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:58.580
He's a weird case man.

5073
02:28:58.850 --> 02:29:00.680
Oh one no woody.

5074
02:29:00.810 --> 02:29:01.643
They both of them.

5075
02:29:01.690 --> 02:29:01.860
Yeah,

5076
02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:03.260
they're both long flight.

5077
02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:03.651
I was on,

5078
02:29:03.651 --> 02:29:06.170
I saw Barry Lyndon Kubrick film.

5079
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:07.220
Oh yeah.

5080
02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:08.510
It's like four hours long,

5081
02:29:08.511 --> 02:29:11.760
but I was flying to New Zealand so I had like all this time to kill and I,

5082
02:29:11.790 --> 02:29:14.780
that's like never a film that would ever watch cause it's like four hours long.

5083
02:29:14.830 --> 02:29:18.660
<v 4>But that's the one that they say that that's one of the ones that spine,</v>

5084
02:29:18.661 --> 02:29:19.540
it's cool man.

5085
02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:21.273
Huh?

5086
02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:22.760
Cause they say that the,

5087
02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:27.840
so that's how I wanted to film candle light without using um,

5088
02:29:27.970 --> 02:29:28.930
regular lighting.

5089
02:29:28.931 --> 02:29:31.420
So we needed a special kind of camera to do it.

5090
02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:36.520
And they say that NASA developed this Special Lens to film candle light or

5091
02:29:36.521 --> 02:29:37.001
something.

5092
02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:41.140
And then that's the beginning of the conspiracy theory that he traded this lens

5093
02:29:41.141 --> 02:29:41.974
for.

5094
02:29:42.370 --> 02:29:42.521
Yeah.

5095
02:29:42.521 --> 02:29:43.320
He invented his own

5096
02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:43.891
<v 1>on camera.</v>

5097
02:29:43.891 --> 02:29:44.071
He,

5098
02:29:44.071 --> 02:29:45.330
I don't know the exact details,

5099
02:29:45.331 --> 02:29:49.140
but he like took a NASA camera and like put his own special lens on it.

5100
02:29:49.141 --> 02:29:50.910
Or Barry Lyndon was 75

5101
02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:51.611
<v 4>no,</v>

5102
02:29:51.611 --> 02:29:52.280
but it was the,

5103
02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:53.200
in the setting,

5104
02:29:53.350 --> 02:29:53.921
you know what I mean?

5105
02:29:53.921 --> 02:29:55.510
Like you wanted to shoot candle light.

5106
02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:56.291
Oh right.

5107
02:29:56.291 --> 02:29:57.124
But the movie,

5108
02:29:57.310 --> 02:29:58.890
the movie came after the moon landing.

5109
02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:00.101
Tell me guys,

5110
02:30:00.101 --> 02:30:00.701
I didn't write it,

5111
02:30:00.701 --> 02:30:01.530
I don't know.

5112
02:30:01.530 --> 02:30:05.550
<v 1>16 between 69 and 72 where it was all the a moon missions.</v>

5113
02:30:05.580 --> 02:30:06.301
We went to the moon.

5114
02:30:06.301 --> 02:30:06.910
Right.

5115
02:30:06.910 --> 02:30:09.090
We went to London in [inaudible] 78 most likely,

5116
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:13.410
I would say 99% but it would be awesome if that 1% was true.

5117
02:30:13.411 --> 02:30:14.430
If they really faked it,

5118
02:30:15.210 --> 02:30:16.260
there'll be hilarious.

5119
02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:19.500
I'm still willing to hold that hope it'd be cooler if they fake data,

5120
02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:20.760
if they really went there for sure.

5121
02:30:20.761 --> 02:30:21.270
Faked it.

5122
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:21.651
Really?

5123
02:30:21.651 --> 02:30:21.850
Yeah.

5124
02:30:21.850 --> 02:30:22.081
Yeah.

5125
02:30:22.081 --> 02:30:22.920
At this point in time,

5126
02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:26.640
because it's even more of an accomplishment to know that people who have been in

5127
02:30:26.641 --> 02:30:27.474
space,

5128
02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:29.400
we know that people definitely can go to space.

5129
02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:32.400
We know that people definitely can go to space stations.

5130
02:30:32.401 --> 02:30:32.881
That's all.

5131
02:30:32.881 --> 02:30:34.050
Those are huge accomplishments.

5132
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:37.320
Going to the moon for sure is another huge accomplishment,

5133
02:30:37.530 --> 02:30:42.090
but faking that they went to the moon is a magnificent display of propaganda.

5134
02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:42.451
Yeah.

5135
02:30:42.451 --> 02:30:43.830
If they really did do that,

5136
02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:45.540
it would be incredible.

5137
02:30:45.570 --> 02:30:47.220
I was convinced for years that they fit,

5138
02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:48.150
<v 4>man.</v>

5139
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.990
That's something like,

5140
02:30:48.991 --> 02:30:53.280
do you ever get that weird ache when you realize like you'll never get to stand

5141
02:30:53.281 --> 02:30:56.270
on the moon or like you'll never get to stand on Mars?

5142
02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:56.831
That feeling of,

5143
02:30:56.831 --> 02:30:58.770
I don't want to ever stand in those places.

5144
02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:01.230
Those places do suck.

5145
02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:01.830
Fuck.

5146
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:04.650
Do you know how dare you would be amazing to,

5147
02:31:04.890 --> 02:31:05.011
oh,

5148
02:31:05.011 --> 02:31:05.380
I don't know.

5149
02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:05.671
I said,

5150
02:31:05.671 --> 02:31:07.680
how dare you about insulting Mars.

5151
02:31:08.670 --> 02:31:09.690
It will be cool though.

5152
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:10.650
It will be so like,

5153
02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:16.040
or like when you read about Titan and how it's like oceans of methane.

5154
02:31:16.290 --> 02:31:16.471
Yeah.

5155
02:31:16.471 --> 02:31:17.550
You can't live on their son,

5156
02:31:17.580 --> 02:31:18.211
but it'd be cool.

5157
02:31:18.211 --> 02:31:18.601
I know,

5158
02:31:18.601 --> 02:31:19.980
I'm just saying you are a mortal

5159
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.410
<v 2>that like see what an ocean of methane look like.</v>

5160
02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:23.273
They could make,

5161
02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:24.690
they could send a camera there.

5162
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:25.830
I'll watch the footage.

5163
02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:26.390
They'll be,

5164
02:31:26.390 --> 02:31:27.690
did they still be happy with that?

5165
02:31:27.691 --> 02:31:28.524
They did send the camera.

5166
02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:29.350
<v 1>Are they a yeah,</v>

5167
02:31:29.350 --> 02:31:31.180
I think that's the move from now on.

5168
02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:36.420
I think it's send a drone to get deep in film the stuff until we get so

5169
02:31:36.461 --> 02:31:37.480
advanced.

5170
02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:41.200
I mean we have to get so fucking advanced that we can just go places like

5171
02:31:41.201 --> 02:31:42.340
instantaneously.

5172
02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:43.720
Then it will be exciting,

5173
02:31:43.930 --> 02:31:44.141
you know,

5174
02:31:44.141 --> 02:31:45.130
because like look,

5175
02:31:45.131 --> 02:31:50.131
traveling to another country used to be some insane thing that no one did when

5176
02:31:50.441 --> 02:31:51.730
they had sailboats.

5177
02:31:51.940 --> 02:31:56.940
I mean we can't even wrap our head around how distant Australia was 500 years

5178
02:31:58.331 --> 02:31:58.750
ago.

5179
02:31:58.750 --> 02:31:59.041
We can.

5180
02:31:59.041 --> 02:31:59.710
We can't.

5181
02:31:59.710 --> 02:32:00.100
We can't.

5182
02:32:00.100 --> 02:32:01.600
It's not available to us.

5183
02:32:01.780 --> 02:32:05.410
The idea isn't even available that we didn't even know you were the average

5184
02:32:05.411 --> 02:32:06.790
person that lived here in America.

5185
02:32:06.791 --> 02:32:10.330
You have the concept of Australia was so alien to you,

5186
02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:15.600
but now it's a mean 20% of the people that you run into a bin Australia.

5187
02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:16.090
Right.

5188
02:32:16.090 --> 02:32:16.630
I mean,

5189
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:18.100
what I mean of us,

5190
02:32:18.101 --> 02:32:19.570
at least if you're traveling around with Comedians,

5191
02:32:19.571 --> 02:32:20.710
it's probably even higher than that.

5192
02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:22.510
I know a lot of people that have been Australia,

5193
02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:23.290
I know people,

5194
02:32:23.290 --> 02:32:23.921
Jim Jefferies,

5195
02:32:23.921 --> 02:32:25.060
who was on the podcast the other day,

5196
02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:26.980
he fucking is from Australia.

5197
02:32:26.981 --> 02:32:27.551
You know what I mean?

5198
02:32:27.551 --> 02:32:29.280
It's normal week.

5199
02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:33.070
We can't even imagine what it's going to be like a thousand years from now and

5200
02:32:33.071 --> 02:32:37.150
you probably can go to a planet easily when you can go to space easily.

5201
02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:40.930
It probably will be like a thousand years of innovation because I think that the

5202
02:32:40.931 --> 02:32:44.950
difference between getting out into space and then getting back pretty quickly

5203
02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:48.850
and actually going somewhere and living like Battlestar Galactica type shit.

5204
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:49.600
Yeah.

5205
02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:51.880
We're probably so fucking far from that.

5206
02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:53.080
We're so far from that,

5207
02:32:53.081 --> 02:32:58.081
that it's as far as the Internet is from people who are riding horses from the

5208
02:32:59.021 --> 02:33:00.390
Internet is before they invented the wheel.

5209
02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:01.030
Right.

5210
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:04.720
I think the coolest invention would be teleporting.

5211
02:33:05.350 --> 02:33:05.831
Yeah.

5212
02:33:05.831 --> 02:33:08.050
If you could just like be in Hawaii right now,

5213
02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:08.741
right after this,

5214
02:33:08.741 --> 02:33:11.730
we'd walk outside and just snap and we're on Kauai.

5215
02:33:11.770 --> 02:33:12.131
Hawaii.

5216
02:33:12.131 --> 02:33:14.110
It'd be fucked if they invent teleporting.

5217
02:33:14.290 --> 02:33:15.040
That would be pretty dope.

5218
02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.090
That's probably ruined the world,

5219
02:33:16.091 --> 02:33:16.680
wouldn't it?

5220
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.170
It was just too much tramp that we won't be trampling on the pretty places.

5221
02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:21.190
Just teleport to why?

5222
02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:22.270
Like if it was an app,

5223
02:33:23.230 --> 02:33:25.210
Hawaii just be filled with people.

5224
02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:26.101
Yeah.

5225
02:33:26.101 --> 02:33:26.801
Q Magine.

5226
02:33:26.801 --> 02:33:29.050
If you could just instantly go to Hawaii anytime you wanted.

5227
02:33:29.051 --> 02:33:30.100
The beautiful thing about Hawaii's,

5228
02:33:30.130 --> 02:33:31.900
it takes five hours to get there on a plane.

5229
02:33:32.050 --> 02:33:33.250
That's what's so awesome about it.

5230
02:33:33.251 --> 02:33:34.440
The quickest way to get there.

5231
02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:34.930
Yeah.

5232
02:33:34.930 --> 02:33:35.830
Five bucks an hour.

5233
02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:36.370
Yeah.

5234
02:33:36.370 --> 02:33:37.420
That's why it's so awesome.

5235
02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:40.310
<v 2>Did you ever read that Stephen King Story?</v>

5236
02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:41.280
The gr uh,

5237
02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:42.163
the jaunt?

5238
02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:42.591
No.

5239
02:33:42.591 --> 02:33:42.980
What is it?

5240
02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:43.161
Oh,

5241
02:33:43.161 --> 02:33:43.941
it's so good.

5242
02:33:43.941 --> 02:33:44.930
I think it's called the John.

5243
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:45.651
Oh fuck.

5244
02:33:45.651 --> 02:33:46.221
It's so good,

5245
02:33:46.221 --> 02:33:46.610
man.

5246
02:33:46.610 --> 02:33:48.830
It's like they've invented teleportation.

5247
02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:50.240
It's somewhere in the future.

5248
02:33:50.241 --> 02:33:52.400
They have like airports for teleportation,

5249
02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:57.110
but the thing is they've got a nest of the ties you so that you're asleep when

5250
02:33:57.111 --> 02:34:01.130
you go through because if you're awake when you go through it feels like

5251
02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:01.964
infinity.

5252
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.570
It feels like you're floating and blackness for infinity and people come out the

5253
02:34:05.571 --> 02:34:07.940
other side insane or like you know,

5254
02:34:07.941 --> 02:34:10.620
like they've lost their minds because it did the,

5255
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:10.911
their,

5256
02:34:10.911 --> 02:34:14.270
their jibberish and that's probably how it will be because what would

5257
02:34:14.271 --> 02:34:17.920
teleportation be like disassembling you're Adams and then reassembling it

5258
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:19.270
somewhere else or something?

5259
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:20.070
Yeah,

5260
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.530
yeah.

5261
02:34:20.530 --> 02:34:21.490
That's a good question.

5262
02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:21.731
I mean,

5263
02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:24.580
is it going to be like some star trek type shit in this story?

5264
02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:28.420
They say like it's a really quick story so you can barely see it could just read

5265
02:34:28.421 --> 02:34:28.570
it.

5266
02:34:28.570 --> 02:34:29.950
This is a little bit of a spoiler,

5267
02:34:29.951 --> 02:34:31.240
but you should just read it anyway.

5268
02:34:31.241 --> 02:34:35.590
But they want to know what happens inside the teleportation device because they

5269
02:34:35.591 --> 02:34:38.560
figure out that if a thing is awake when it comes through the other end,

5270
02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:39.850
it dies.

5271
02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:42.970
So they get someone on death row and they tell us,

5272
02:34:43.330 --> 02:34:45.850
if you go through and tell us what happens in there,

5273
02:34:45.851 --> 02:34:46.391
we're going to like,

5274
02:34:46.391 --> 02:34:47.230
let you off the hook.

5275
02:34:47.231 --> 02:34:49.870
Your sentence will be forgotten.

5276
02:34:49.871 --> 02:34:50.800
You'll be forgiven.

5277
02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:53.590
Guy Gum comes out the other side.

5278
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:56.620
He's like fucked up and he says

5279
02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:01.810
<v 1>it's a long time in there and then he dies.</v>

5280
02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:03.401
Well,

5281
02:35:03.401 --> 02:35:06.850
did you hear about that with recent idea that they'd come up with some sort of a

5282
02:35:06.851 --> 02:35:11.500
chemical treatment they would give to someone that would allow them to live a

5283
02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:14.470
thousand years in eight hours would be the equivalent of a thousand years in

5284
02:35:14.471 --> 02:35:15.304
eight hours.

5285
02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:15.970
What?

5286
02:35:15.970 --> 02:35:16.301
Yeah,

5287
02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:16.751
exactly.

5288
02:35:16.751 --> 02:35:17.620
Super strong weed.

5289
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.531
<v 2>Salvia.</v>

5290
02:35:19.531 --> 02:35:20.700
I'm really slows down.

5291
02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:21.900
I don't know the logic.

5292
02:35:21.901 --> 02:35:22.010
Yeah.

5293
02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:22.551
<v 1>Behind it.</v>

5294
02:35:22.551 --> 02:35:23.600
I don't understand that.

5295
02:35:23.601 --> 02:35:24.920
I've tried to understand what they're,

5296
02:35:24.921 --> 02:35:25.760
what they're saying,

5297
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:30.410
but the idea being that you would experience the equivalent of a thousand years

5298
02:35:30.411 --> 02:35:32.270
by yourself in eight hours,

5299
02:35:32.810 --> 02:35:35.880
that would suck because you can't like read.

5300
02:35:35.881 --> 02:35:36.410
Uh,

5301
02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:36.981
what would you do?

5302
02:35:36.981 --> 02:35:39.510
You're just like in a state of staring God that does.

5303
02:35:39.511 --> 02:35:41.000
That sounds like a great,

5304
02:35:41.001 --> 02:35:42.770
could be a horrifying experience.

5305
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:43.191
Well,

5306
02:35:43.191 --> 02:35:44.000
not only that,

5307
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.480
who's to say that you hear prisoners could serve a thousand year sentence in

5308
02:35:47.481 --> 02:35:48.314
eight hours.

5309
02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:53.420
Biotechnology could be used to make prisoners feel as if they were serving a

5310
02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:53.870
thousand year sentence.

5311
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:54.620
Oh my God.

5312
02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:55.460
Well the problem is,

5313
02:35:55.461 --> 02:35:56.000
man,

5314
02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.440
then those people can really serve those thousand year sentences.

5315
02:35:58.470 --> 02:36:01.430
They could day with those people would fucking come out crazy.

5316
02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:01.660
Yeah.

5317
02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:04.530
He would come around and helping society with that thousand year sentence like

5318
02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:06.110
the Bradley manning situation.

5319
02:36:06.140 --> 02:36:07.580
They kept that guy.

5320
02:36:07.581 --> 02:36:08.420
Now girl,

5321
02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:08.840
um,

5322
02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.560
they kept him in a cell by himself for days,

5323
02:36:13.010 --> 02:36:13.843
days,

5324
02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:14.833
days,

5325
02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:15.793
days,

5326
02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:17.360
days became years,

5327
02:36:17.450 --> 02:36:18.200
years,

5328
02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:18.870
years.

5329
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:19.100
Alright.

5330
02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:20.750
No contact with human beings.

5331
02:36:20.751 --> 02:36:25.751
Totally naked and cold and w and then just broke him just over time.

5332
02:36:26.991 --> 02:36:27.824
Just broke him,

5333
02:36:27.890 --> 02:36:28.723
broke them.

5334
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:29.361
I mean the,

5335
02:36:29.361 --> 02:36:29.631
the,

5336
02:36:29.631 --> 02:36:33.320
the idea that you could go through years and years of solitary confinement naked

5337
02:36:33.321 --> 02:36:35.480
and be the same person you were when they brought you in there.

5338
02:36:35.890 --> 02:36:36.620
This is ridiculous.

5339
02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.390
There's a lot of people in solitary confinement.

5340
02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:39.740
I heard some story about it,

5341
02:36:39.741 --> 02:36:40.940
like an NPR or something.

5342
02:36:40.941 --> 02:36:43.820
Like they used to do it as like a special punishment.

5343
02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:44.660
Put you in there,

5344
02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:45.950
put you in the hole for a little bit,

5345
02:36:45.951 --> 02:36:50.450
but now it's like people are just permanently in solitary for like years or

5346
02:36:50.450 --> 02:36:50.540
something.

5347
02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:53.630
Why would it be only contact is like when they get the lunch guide sliding the

5348
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:54.140
luncheon.

5349
02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:55.220
That's fucking crazy.

5350
02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:57.200
That's fucking completely crazy.

5351
02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:59.510
Like the idea that you can do that to a human being.

5352
02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:01.310
I mean if you want to do that to a human being,

5353
02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:02.390
you should be killing that person.

5354
02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:02.751
Yeah.

5355
02:37:02.751 --> 02:37:05.630
I would rather die than do that for the rest of your life.

5356
02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:06.890
The rest of your life by herself.

5357
02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:09.380
That's a weird kind of special torture.

5358
02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:10.591
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

5359
02:37:10.591 --> 02:37:12.510
you're just holding them here for some reason.

5360
02:37:12.511 --> 02:37:12.781
You're like,

5361
02:37:12.781 --> 02:37:16.040
we're just going to keep you on the edge of for as long as

5362
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:16.790
<v 4>we can.</v>

5363
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:17.960
We'll keep you alive.

5364
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:19.460
But everything that you know,

5365
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:23.870
everything that you have come to understand as being a human being is totally

5366
02:37:23.871 --> 02:37:26.060
taken away from you outside of the basics.

5367
02:37:26.061 --> 02:37:26.894
You can eat,

5368
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.860
you can shit.

5369
02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:29.600
You can piss and sleep,

5370
02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:30.620
but that's it.

5371
02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:31.453
So

5372
02:37:31.540 --> 02:37:31.731
<v 0>yeah,</v>

5373
02:37:31.731 --> 02:37:33.330
it's a beautiful and pushups and burpees.

5374
02:37:33.650 --> 02:37:34.740
It's the idea.

5375
02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:36.720
The idea is unbelievably insane.

5376
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:39.210
And there's nothing you can do about it.

5377
02:37:39.450 --> 02:37:41.490
That's just what they do and to try to change that.

5378
02:37:41.491 --> 02:37:42.324
Now,

5379
02:37:42.330 --> 02:37:43.470
I mean there's a,

5380
02:37:43.471 --> 02:37:47.490
there's a God damn momentous movement.

5381
02:37:47.550 --> 02:37:50.850
I mean the amount of people that have been put in solitary confinement,

5382
02:37:50.851 --> 02:37:55.851
the amount of time that's been devoted to this style of torture they can take

5383
02:37:55.861 --> 02:37:59.910
you and remove one of the most important aspects of being a human being,

5384
02:38:00.090 --> 02:38:01.110
human contact,

5385
02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:03.000
and then just break you,

5386
02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:04.020
break your mind.

5387
02:38:04.110 --> 02:38:06.990
How is that helping society by like torturing someone?

5388
02:38:07.290 --> 02:38:09.030
We fix that person.

5389
02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:09.893
Look at that.

5390
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:14.100
There are 80,000 Americans currently held in solitary confinement.

5391
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:15.870
What the fuck?

5392
02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:16.830
Well,

5393
02:38:16.830 --> 02:38:18.060
what's number three on that list?

5394
02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:21.840
Solitary confinement was developed as a humane alternative to what?

5395
02:38:22.050 --> 02:38:23.190
To shoot him in the face.

5396
02:38:23.191 --> 02:38:24.030
Head waterboarding.

5397
02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:25.680
They didn't even have water body,

5398
02:38:25.681 --> 02:38:29.370
but then that's some latest onboarding is an old technique.

5399
02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:30.300
Yeah.

5400
02:38:30.300 --> 02:38:31.133
How old is that?

5401
02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:32.820
They used,

5402
02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:34.830
there's reports of them doing it in a,

5403
02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:39.100
I think the the like the eight late 18 hundreds or world war one or something.

5404
02:38:39.101 --> 02:38:41.970
In this book I'm reading about about World War II pilots,

5405
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.420
they're talking about somebody was torturing someone with waterboarding

5406
02:38:45.421 --> 02:38:47.190
techniques in kind of makes sense.

5407
02:38:47.191 --> 02:38:47.910
Philippines.

5408
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:48.743
Wow.

5409
02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:51.350
It's been around solitary.

5410
02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:52.290
Scary shit man.

5411
02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:53.430
I mean,

5412
02:38:53.430 --> 02:38:55.320
if you really think that someone's that bad,

5413
02:38:55.350 --> 02:38:56.460
we shouldn't we remove them.

5414
02:38:56.700 --> 02:38:58.170
We should remove them from society.

5415
02:38:58.410 --> 02:38:59.280
Like remove them,

5416
02:38:59.281 --> 02:39:00.114
period.

5417
02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:01.830
And if you don't,

5418
02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:04.200
you gotta you gotta give them what it is to be human.

5419
02:39:04.201 --> 02:39:05.760
You got to let them interact with people.

5420
02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:06.750
If you don't,

5421
02:39:06.750 --> 02:39:07.201
I mean you're,

5422
02:39:07.201 --> 02:39:08.550
you're not just punishing them,

5423
02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:09.690
you're torturing them.

5424
02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.330
It's a constantly tornado drip.

5425
02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:15.000
It's not solving a problem.

5426
02:39:15.001 --> 02:39:16.620
It's making like more problems.

5427
02:39:16.621 --> 02:39:16.980
Right?

5428
02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:17.460
Yeah,

5429
02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:18.210
for sure.

5430
02:39:18.210 --> 02:39:18.391
Well,

5431
02:39:18.391 --> 02:39:20.820
what's going on in Abu Ghraib or what's going on or above grade?

5432
02:39:20.821 --> 02:39:22.140
What's going on in Guantanamo Bay?

5433
02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:22.711
I mean,

5434
02:39:22.711 --> 02:39:22.911
what,

5435
02:39:22.911 --> 02:39:23.151
what,

5436
02:39:23.151 --> 02:39:26.640
what is that kind of torture doing more terrorists or something?

5437
02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:26.860
Well,

5438
02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:28.830
you were talking about the last time we were discussing

5439
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:30.100
<v 4>chemical waterboarding.</v>

5440
02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:30.461
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

5441
02:39:30.461 --> 02:39:33.500
This chemical Laurium malaria disease that they,

5442
02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:35.070
<v 4>what?</v>

5443
02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:35.480
This,

5444
02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:38.390
there's a drug called Laurium that my friend took.

5445
02:39:38.391 --> 02:39:39.240
Got Complete am,

5446
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:40.103
yeah.

5447
02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:42.470
So this drug Laurium,

5448
02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:47.300
they give it to prisoners in Guantanamo Bay in really high doses when they first

5449
02:39:47.301 --> 02:39:48.134
get there.

5450
02:39:48.350 --> 02:39:49.940
And you know,

5451
02:39:49.941 --> 02:39:52.250
it has the potential for causing amnesia.

5452
02:39:52.251 --> 02:39:53.540
And when you have amnesia,

5453
02:39:54.050 --> 02:39:57.290
that's when someone can really control you because you don't remember who you

5454
02:39:57.291 --> 02:39:57.561
are.

5455
02:39:57.561 --> 02:39:59.420
And so someone will just tell you who you are.

5456
02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.580
<v 0>This is all detainees at Guantanamo Bay.</v>

5457
02:40:03.850 --> 02:40:04.683
All of them.

5458
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:07.090
They're all taking this Larry Defense Department,

5459
02:40:07.091 --> 02:40:07.810
forest,

5460
02:40:07.810 --> 02:40:09.400
all war on terror,

5461
02:40:09.401 --> 02:40:13.770
detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison to take a high of

5462
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:16.710
<v 2>a controversial anti-malarial drug.</v>

5463
02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:22.500
It's the actual term is male effective quote Queen Melphalan Queens.

5464
02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:23.670
Is this a,

5465
02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:28.080
does this affect only have only affects a certain percentage of people that take

5466
02:40:28.081 --> 02:40:28.260
it?

5467
02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:28.620
You?

5468
02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:28.871
Well,

5469
02:40:28.871 --> 02:40:30.390
only if you're like allergic to it or something.

5470
02:40:30.391 --> 02:40:30.660
Well,

5471
02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:33.300
it gives you shitty dreams minimum.

5472
02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:33.631
I mean,

5473
02:40:33.631 --> 02:40:34.860
some people maybe don't have that,

5474
02:40:34.861 --> 02:40:35.880
but it'll give you shitty dreams.

5475
02:40:35.881 --> 02:40:36.271
But that's it.

5476
02:40:36.271 --> 02:40:37.350
A regular dose.

5477
02:40:37.650 --> 02:40:39.510
They're giving these poor bastards,

5478
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:41.730
huge doses of this stuff.

5479
02:40:41.731 --> 02:40:43.260
So I mean,

5480
02:40:43.261 --> 02:40:44.610
you're already going crazy.

5481
02:40:44.611 --> 02:40:46.650
You've been kidnapped by,

5482
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:47.371
you know,

5483
02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:49.300
you've been kidnapped by Weirdos.

5484
02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:51.060
A lot of those people were shepherds,

5485
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.751
you know,

5486
02:40:51.751 --> 02:40:53.730
they were just out there like doing nothing.

5487
02:40:53.731 --> 02:40:57.600
They were just farmers and they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

5488
02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:00.630
Swept up without a trial and a black helicopter.

5489
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:02.790
Never see your kids or your family again.

5490
02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.710
You could take into this weird island by these psychopaths who start poisoning

5491
02:41:07.711 --> 02:41:08.110
you.

5492
02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:10.300
It's not an America and it's not an America.

5493
02:41:10.301 --> 02:41:11.790
How does not America there in Cuba.

5494
02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:12.331
That's crazy.

5495
02:41:12.331 --> 02:41:13.320
That's in Cuba too.

5496
02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:14.491
It's very crazy.

5497
02:41:14.491 --> 02:41:15.390
And it's called,

5498
02:41:15.391 --> 02:41:20.190
I mean the U S Army Public Health physician is the one who named it

5499
02:41:20.191 --> 02:41:21.024
pharmacologically.

5500
02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:21.893
Waterboarding.

5501
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.560
Wow.

5502
02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:27.330
There was a US army physician that they came up with that term pharmacological

5503
02:41:27.331 --> 02:41:27.871
waterboarding.

5504
02:41:27.871 --> 02:41:29.070
Cause when you have amnesia,

5505
02:41:29.430 --> 02:41:32.610
you don't remember who you are and you start believing what people are saying to

5506
02:41:32.611 --> 02:41:32.701
you.

5507
02:41:32.701 --> 02:41:33.061
They're like,

5508
02:41:33.061 --> 02:41:34.770
yes you are a terrorist.

5509
02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:36.870
You are involved in,

5510
02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:39.000
oh I thought they would tell them something nice.

5511
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:40.830
It's you're a clown.

5512
02:41:40.890 --> 02:41:41.671
You live in this.

5513
02:41:41.671 --> 02:41:42.570
If you live in this,

5514
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:43.650
in this room now,

5515
02:41:43.651 --> 02:41:44.970
this little cement room.

5516
02:41:45.090 --> 02:41:45.690
Yeah,

5517
02:41:45.690 --> 02:41:46.650
and that's your home.

5518
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:47.760
This is what they should do.

5519
02:41:47.761 --> 02:41:49.010
That to them at least be a little,

5520
02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:50.160
make them feel a little better.

5521
02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:53.640
It's fucking insane to think about being killed.

5522
02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:57.570
Like imagine like just to reverse that you're walking down the street,

5523
02:41:57.571 --> 02:41:58.530
you're in Culver city,

5524
02:41:58.540 --> 02:41:59.820
a helicopter comes down,

5525
02:41:59.821 --> 02:42:00.511
grabs you,

5526
02:42:00.511 --> 02:42:01.500
carries you away.

5527
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:04.830
Suddenly you're in some weird brick building with people who you can't even

5528
02:42:04.831 --> 02:42:05.820
understand what they're saying.

5529
02:42:06.090 --> 02:42:07.560
There's a translator with him.

5530
02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:09.570
They're just like telling you what,

5531
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:11.100
tell us what you did.

5532
02:42:11.130 --> 02:42:12.210
We know what you did,

5533
02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:14.010
where the rest of the attacks going to happen.

5534
02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:14.131
Well,

5535
02:42:14.131 --> 02:42:14.761
they said that the,

5536
02:42:14.761 --> 02:42:14.941
the,

5537
02:42:14.941 --> 02:42:15.121
the,

5538
02:42:15.121 --> 02:42:16.860
the premise that they would deliver it to,

5539
02:42:16.861 --> 02:42:18.870
as they say in Casey's people had malaria,

5540
02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:21.450
but before they would even test them from malaria,

5541
02:42:21.451 --> 02:42:26.320
they would give them a dose five times higher than the prophylactic dose giving

5542
02:42:26.321 --> 02:42:28.290
to individuals to prevent the disease.

5543
02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:31.920
And that made my friend completely forget his past.

5544
02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:34.230
But did he eventually remembers it now?

5545
02:42:34.350 --> 02:42:34.501
Well,

5546
02:42:34.501 --> 02:42:34.741
yeah,

5547
02:42:34.741 --> 02:42:35.370
but it took,

5548
02:42:35.370 --> 02:42:36.570
is it a temporary?

5549
02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:39.150
That's what's scary about it,

5550
02:42:39.151 --> 02:42:39.300
man.

5551
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:39.991
Look up labored.

5552
02:42:39.991 --> 02:42:40.531
It says there,

5553
02:42:40.531 --> 02:42:44.970
it was invented by US army and was routinely given to soldiers deployed

5554
02:42:44.971 --> 02:42:45.804
overseas.

5555
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:46.943
What the hell.

5556
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:48.720
Look up Larry him suicide note.

5557
02:42:48.750 --> 02:42:50.760
There's this famous suicide note by a guy,

5558
02:42:50.761 --> 02:42:53.340
lost his shit on Larry Him and then just killed himself.

5559
02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:56.010
If you really want to like see how bad they should is,

5560
02:42:56.011 --> 02:42:57.810
this is a really dark,

5561
02:42:58.230 --> 02:43:01.980
dark thing cause well they'll probably given it to soldiers to prevent malaria

5562
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:03.180
and then they realize like,

5563
02:43:03.181 --> 02:43:03.631
Whoa,

5564
02:43:03.631 --> 02:43:04.430
this uh,

5565
02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:05.970
this has a very unique property.

5566
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:08.280
All the best drugs come out of a military stuff,

5567
02:43:08.281 --> 02:43:09.050
right?

5568
02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:10.750
Like meth from like air,

5569
02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:11.663
like um,

5570
02:43:11.770 --> 02:43:12.360
air force.

5571
02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:12.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

5572
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:13.721
Well not air force.

5573
02:43:13.721 --> 02:43:14.554
He was like,

5574
02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:17.560
I think it was Japan and Germany and we're the first people to come up with it,

5575
02:43:17.561 --> 02:43:18.394
I believe,

5576
02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:22.030
or the first people to harness it for military reasons.

5577
02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:24.100
Did they invent ecstasy for the war?

5578
02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.630
MTMA imagine.

5579
02:43:25.631 --> 02:43:27.040
It's like everyone's on ecstasy.

5580
02:43:27.310 --> 02:43:28.960
They certainly did some experimenting with it.

5581
02:43:28.961 --> 02:43:32.530
They also did experiments with DMT the way Terence Mckenna first found out about

5582
02:43:32.531 --> 02:43:33.131
DMT.

5583
02:43:33.131 --> 02:43:36.490
He knew a guy worked at the army research lab and the guy came over with a

5584
02:43:36.491 --> 02:43:37.870
barrel full of this stuff.

5585
02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:39.580
Yeah.

5586
02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:41.980
He said the army had a barrel of this shit.

5587
02:43:41.981 --> 02:43:43.180
They're all of DMT.

5588
02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:46.090
They had synthesize a fucking barrel.

5589
02:43:46.091 --> 02:43:46.511
This shit,

5590
02:43:46.511 --> 02:43:51.511
the purest of the pure clean white damn micro drop would do it an effect.

5591
02:43:51.581 --> 02:43:52.510
Well you'd smoke it,

5592
02:43:52.511 --> 02:43:53.021
but yeah,

5593
02:43:53.021 --> 02:43:55.930
he said that they had just an insane supply,

5594
02:43:55.931 --> 02:43:58.330
this stuff and and Mckenna was.

5595
02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:00.610
That was how was he was introduced to DMT.

5596
02:44:00.611 --> 02:44:04.090
It was the army's fucking DMT that got Terence Mckenna Hi.

5597
02:44:04.091 --> 02:44:04.924
The first time.

5598
02:44:05.410 --> 02:44:06.130
And then he was like,

5599
02:44:06.130 --> 02:44:06.910
Whoa,

5600
02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:07.990
Lee Shit.

5601
02:44:08.290 --> 02:44:09.730
And then he went from there,

5602
02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:10.211
you know,

5603
02:44:10.211 --> 02:44:11.470
to become the Terence Mckenna.

5604
02:44:11.471 --> 02:44:12.700
We all knew in La.

5605
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:14.120
He got high the first time.

5606
02:44:14.121 --> 02:44:15.520
My military grade DMT,

5607
02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:17.260
first time he got high on DMT.

5608
02:44:17.261 --> 02:44:22.261
It was from the fucking US army research lab supply that some guy who he used to

5609
02:44:22.841 --> 02:44:24.880
refer to as the real Terence Mckenna.

5610
02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:28.240
He knew a guy like many of us do growing up,

5611
02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:32.020
this guy was kind of underground and this is the guy that was the real guy who

5612
02:44:32.021 --> 02:44:36.040
told him about all this stuff and sort of hit was his guru of all these things.

5613
02:44:36.970 --> 02:44:37.541
Some cat.

5614
02:44:37.541 --> 02:44:42.070
There was a scientist and Mckenna Mckenna got ahold of DMT from him for the

5615
02:44:42.071 --> 02:44:43.720
first time and you know,

5616
02:44:43.721 --> 02:44:45.610
he said that they basically had a hold them down.

5617
02:44:45.690 --> 02:44:46.070
Like,

5618
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.450
you know,

5619
02:44:46.450 --> 02:44:47.650
he just couldn't stop saying,

5620
02:44:47.651 --> 02:44:49.030
I can't believe it.

5621
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:50.680
I cannot believe it.

5622
02:44:51.010 --> 02:44:52.540
I cannot believe this is real.

5623
02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:54.520
I can like what he's saying.

5624
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:55.600
Or you saw the barrel,

5625
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:57.210
what he saw my,

5626
02:44:57.220 --> 02:44:59.500
he had his idea of what drugs were.

5627
02:44:59.770 --> 02:45:01.510
I mean he had psychedelic experiences.

5628
02:45:01.511 --> 02:45:02.590
He had had LSD,

5629
02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:05.890
he had done morning glory seeds and that's a pretty intense visionary

5630
02:45:05.891 --> 02:45:06.724
experiences.

5631
02:45:06.940 --> 02:45:09.010
But the description of DMT,

5632
02:45:09.011 --> 02:45:12.850
that's probably the best one that I've ever come up with is mushrooms times a

5633
02:45:12.850 --> 02:45:16.840
million plus aliens that if you think that mushrooms are crazy and they are

5634
02:45:16.841 --> 02:45:17.351
crazy,

5635
02:45:17.351 --> 02:45:19.300
mushrooms are absolutely mind blowing.

5636
02:45:19.301 --> 02:45:21.250
Life changing things and you think,

5637
02:45:21.251 --> 02:45:22.840
well that's about as crazy as they can get.

5638
02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:24.460
And then you do DMT and he'd go,

5639
02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:25.630
oh wait,

5640
02:45:25.631 --> 02:45:27.250
this isn't even thinkable.

5641
02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:29.140
I couldn't even have made this up.

5642
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:31.570
I can almost imagine mushrooms all most,

5643
02:45:31.571 --> 02:45:32.350
not really,

5644
02:45:32.350 --> 02:45:33.183
but almost.

5645
02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:34.660
But then DMT just,

5646
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:36.760
and then inside the DMT trips,

5647
02:45:36.761 --> 02:45:37.810
a lot of times you'll have,

5648
02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:41.560
it'll show you something that's impossible and it show you something a million

5649
02:45:41.561 --> 02:45:42.910
times more impossible.

5650
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:44.380
Like you think you've hit the Andy,

5651
02:45:44.381 --> 02:45:47.500
like this is how could this be and that wall,

5652
02:45:47.530 --> 02:45:51.580
do you remember these things or do you just remember think seeing you remember

5653
02:45:51.581 --> 02:45:53.140
seeing something that's impossible?

5654
02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:54.640
Dj Talk Pom wants to

5655
02:45:56.340 --> 02:45:57.120
it.

5656
02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:59.740
He's thinking it's very appealing.

5657
02:45:59.770 --> 02:46:00.521
So I made it happen.

5658
02:46:00.521 --> 02:46:02.020
I want to see impossible stuff.

5659
02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.440
Um,

5660
02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:06.460
the best way to remember it is to write it down or to talk about it and record

5661
02:46:06.461 --> 02:46:06.611
it.

5662
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:09.200
But the true memory of it,

5663
02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:10.070
the true memory,

5664
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:11.540
<v 0>if I had to be completely honest with you,</v>

5665
02:46:12.020 --> 02:46:13.400
it's very fragmented.

5666
02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:14.421
It's very,

5667
02:46:14.421 --> 02:46:15.050
um,

5668
02:46:15.050 --> 02:46:17.120
like there's lessons that I learned for sure.

5669
02:46:17.121 --> 02:46:20.810
And there's images that I still recall and there's feelings that I can remember,

5670
02:46:20.811 --> 02:46:23.180
like being in the middle of it and having these feelings,

5671
02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:25.070
but it slips through your fingers.

5672
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:28.490
It's like a super psychedelic dream where you wake up and you're like,

5673
02:46:28.491 --> 02:46:29.241
what the fuck was that?

5674
02:46:29.241 --> 02:46:31.130
And then five minutes later you kind of don't remember.

5675
02:46:31.170 --> 02:46:31.420
Sorry,

5676
02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:33.170
trying to carry the ocean home and your hands.

5677
02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:34.020
<v 2>Yes.</v>

5678
02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:34.741
And you feel,

5679
02:46:34.741 --> 02:46:35.100
but you,

5680
02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:35.620
you,

5681
02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:36.150
I see.

5682
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:37.950
But you still feel good from it.

5683
02:46:38.130 --> 02:46:43.130
It's like somebody whispered the secret of everything into your ear and it's

5684
02:46:43.231 --> 02:46:45.090
good news and then you're like,

5685
02:46:45.690 --> 02:46:46.440
oh,

5686
02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:47.610
but you can't verbalize it.

5687
02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:48.060
Yeah.

5688
02:46:48.060 --> 02:46:49.010
And you can't remember.

5689
02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:49.920
You can't,

5690
02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:51.930
but you just feel after you've done it.

5691
02:46:52.050 --> 02:46:52.890
It's a snapchat.

5692
02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:53.893
It's a snap.

5693
02:46:54.090 --> 02:46:56.130
I snap chat with God and what it is,

5694
02:46:56.460 --> 02:46:57.750
God sends you a snapchat

5695
02:46:57.870 --> 02:46:58.960
<v 0>if that is what it is.</v>

5696
02:46:58.990 --> 02:47:00.090
It's kind of a snapshot.

5697
02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:00.880
Put it man,

5698
02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:01.713
in a way.

5699
02:47:01.930 --> 02:47:02.201
Um,

5700
02:47:02.201 --> 02:47:04.300
and then you have the memory of that pussy in your face.

5701
02:47:04.580 --> 02:47:05.413
<v 2>Wow.</v>

5702
02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:06.201
Yeah.

5703
02:47:06.201 --> 02:47:07.150
You just remember it's,

5704
02:47:07.330 --> 02:47:08.163
it's amazing.

5705
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:11.660
It's life changing in a really positive way.

5706
02:47:11.661 --> 02:47:13.070
Like it's for most people.

5707
02:47:13.071 --> 02:47:16.000
But I've heard some people have some really horrendous experiences on it too.

5708
02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:16.370
Yeah.

5709
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:19.100
Like dark or the girl who did the DMT,

5710
02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:19.780
em,

5711
02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:22.290
Emma and she said she was just like going through,

5712
02:47:23.330 --> 02:47:23.910
she took it.

5713
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:24.743
Oh yeah.

5714
02:47:24.860 --> 02:47:26.180
I want to get her on the podcast,

5715
02:47:26.181 --> 02:47:26.880
man.

5716
02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:27.713
What's your name?

5717
02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:28.700
Neuro soup.

5718
02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:29.270
Shura,

5719
02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:30.470
you're a youtube channel.

5720
02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.650
She was also the girl that was a part of that whole thing

5721
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:33.780
<v 0>thing with,</v>

5722
02:47:33.781 --> 02:47:36.330
I'm that guy that had a MDM,

5723
02:47:36.331 --> 02:47:37.330
a lab ls.

5724
02:47:37.390 --> 02:47:39.260
The missile silo was the LSD lab.

5725
02:47:39.490 --> 02:47:39.720
Oh,

5726
02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:40.330
it was her.

5727
02:47:40.330 --> 02:47:41.570
I saw that documentary.

5728
02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:42.000
Yeah.

5729
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:42.751
It was a vice piece.

5730
02:47:42.751 --> 02:47:43.950
She was the girlfriend?

5731
02:47:44.010 --> 02:47:44.843
Yes.

5732
02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:46.470
Wasn't that Hamilton Morris?

5733
02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:47.281
Wasn't that Hamilton?

5734
02:47:47.281 --> 02:47:47.581
Yeah,

5735
02:47:47.581 --> 02:47:48.180
yeah,

5736
02:47:48.180 --> 02:47:48.331
yeah.

5737
02:47:48.331 --> 02:47:51.120
It was happening and it was a a vice piece.

5738
02:47:51.121 --> 02:47:51.931
She was the girlfriend.

5739
02:47:51.931 --> 02:47:55.350
She was a stripper and she met this guy who was a drug dealer and it became,

5740
02:47:55.351 --> 02:47:55.860
this,

5741
02:47:55.860 --> 02:47:57.360
I mean is a wild story.

5742
02:47:57.361 --> 02:47:58.890
I really want to stop there.

5743
02:47:59.250 --> 02:48:01.380
I want people to not get it from me,

5744
02:48:01.381 --> 02:48:02.670
just get it in its entirety.

5745
02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:03.660
I highly recommend it.

5746
02:48:03.661 --> 02:48:04.770
It's really cool.

5747
02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:05.491
It's really cool.

5748
02:48:05.491 --> 02:48:06.324
It's creepy.

5749
02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:07.170
Really creepy.

5750
02:48:07.171 --> 02:48:08.230
Crazy scary.

5751
02:48:08.350 --> 02:48:13.350
Like sad that someone could be into these mind expanding drugs and then be so

5752
02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:15.370
dark.

5753
02:48:15.370 --> 02:48:19.650
Like he just took it to like a dark sort of place.

5754
02:48:19.710 --> 02:48:19.981
I mean,

5755
02:48:19.981 --> 02:48:21.990
he was a fucking informant for the government.

5756
02:48:21.991 --> 02:48:22.610
I mean it was really,

5757
02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:23.610
it got really crazy.

5758
02:48:23.611 --> 02:48:24.960
A drug dealer became an informant.

5759
02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:25.800
I'm not telling you any.

5760
02:48:25.860 --> 02:48:26.693
You've got to look it up.

5761
02:48:26.820 --> 02:48:28.230
It's a goddamn great movie.

5762
02:48:28.260 --> 02:48:32.700
It would be a great movie if somebody like did like just a factual accounts with

5763
02:48:32.701 --> 02:48:33.534
no fuckery.

5764
02:48:33.780 --> 02:48:35.280
You don't have to doctor it up at all.

5765
02:48:35.281 --> 02:48:35.461
It's,

5766
02:48:35.461 --> 02:48:36.660
it's an amazing account.

5767
02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:39.690
Neuro soup is her name on Youtube.

5768
02:48:39.691 --> 02:48:42.420
She's got some great videos on Youtube and uh,

5769
02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:44.970
her youtube stuff and then her Hamilton Morris thing.

5770
02:48:44.971 --> 02:48:46.050
I don't remember what the,

5771
02:48:46.051 --> 02:48:46.884
uh,

5772
02:48:47.130 --> 02:48:48.030
what Hamilton Morris,

5773
02:48:48.031 --> 02:48:49.260
his title of it was.

5774
02:48:49.470 --> 02:48:50.303
You find it,

5775
02:48:50.670 --> 02:48:51.503
let people know.

5776
02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:52.733
But um,

5777
02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:53.633
yeah,

5778
02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:54.001
look,

5779
02:48:54.001 --> 02:48:55.320
there's some weird stories out there.

5780
02:48:55.321 --> 02:48:57.090
People have done some terrible things.

5781
02:48:57.091 --> 02:49:00.390
Don't put DMT in your asshole may or do well,

5782
02:49:00.391 --> 02:49:01.224
what happened?

5783
02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:02.520
What's her report?

5784
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:03.383
She's still,

5785
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:04.500
she's still with us.

5786
02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:05.370
Right?

5787
02:49:05.370 --> 02:49:09.600
I think what happens when you put in your asshole is probably pretty similar to

5788
02:49:09.601 --> 02:49:11.340
what happens when you do it intravenously.

5789
02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:15.390
And the intravenous trips that were reported by a doctor,

5790
02:49:15.391 --> 02:49:16.950
Rick Strassman in the book,

5791
02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:17.701
Dmt,

5792
02:49:17.701 --> 02:49:18.750
the spirit molecule,

5793
02:49:18.990 --> 02:49:20.130
they were very long.

5794
02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:21.000
They were like,

5795
02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:22.380
instead of 10 to 15 minutes,

5796
02:49:22.381 --> 02:49:23.670
there's the normal DMT trip.

5797
02:49:23.671 --> 02:49:24.900
There were more than a half hour.

5798
02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:27.510
And I'm much more intense.

5799
02:49:27.511 --> 02:49:31.110
It seemed like that people got like right to the source.

5800
02:49:31.350 --> 02:49:33.450
Hamilton's Pharmacopia but yeah,

5801
02:49:33.451 --> 02:49:34.830
but that's the name of his show.

5802
02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:37.110
What's the name of the specific episode?

5803
02:49:37.170 --> 02:49:38.003
I'm sure.

5804
02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:38.240
<v 2>Good.</v>

5805
02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:39.480
But her report was like,

5806
02:49:39.481 --> 02:49:41.020
it wasn't getting to this sore.

5807
02:49:41.021 --> 02:49:41.620
She was like,

5808
02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:42.810
neurosis crapped in.

5809
02:49:42.811 --> 02:49:43.601
These tunnels are,

5810
02:49:43.601 --> 02:49:44.434
yeah,

5811
02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:45.990
<v 0>Crystal Crystal's name,</v>

5812
02:49:46.010 --> 02:49:48.490
K r y.

5813
02:49:48.490 --> 02:49:48.851
S t.

5814
02:49:48.851 --> 02:49:49.150
L.

5815
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.720
E,

5816
02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:51.590
Hamilton Morris and neuro sue.

5817
02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:53.050
But we just Google that you'll find it.

5818
02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:55.090
But Hamilton is a very cool guy.

5819
02:49:55.150 --> 02:49:56.050
Very interesting guy.

5820
02:49:56.051 --> 02:49:58.250
Has a lot of really fascinating uh,

5821
02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:01.360
videos and articles about,

5822
02:50:01.470 --> 02:50:02.110
um,

5823
02:50:02.110 --> 02:50:03.310
various psychedelics.

5824
02:50:03.370 --> 02:50:04.540
If he's a very bright guy,

5825
02:50:04.541 --> 02:50:08.020
knows a lot about them on top of being just kind of a cool Weirdo.

5826
02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:09.131
You know,

5827
02:50:09.131 --> 02:50:09.970
he was on the podcast.

5828
02:50:09.971 --> 02:50:10.541
We fucked up.

5829
02:50:10.541 --> 02:50:11.374
We got them too high,

5830
02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:12.190
too high.

5831
02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:12.881
He came over,

5832
02:50:12.881 --> 02:50:16.150
he came over to talk to me about the tank and we went into the basement.

5833
02:50:16.151 --> 02:50:16.400
He's,

5834
02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:16.771
he can,

5835
02:50:16.771 --> 02:50:17.650
he can get too high.

5836
02:50:17.651 --> 02:50:20.500
He seems like he's just a drunk in the whole world.

5837
02:50:20.501 --> 02:50:21.200
Can get too high.

5838
02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:24.130
I got to high red van got too high and we went too deep.

5839
02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:24.640
We are.

5840
02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:28.180
We got fucked up because it was one of the only other time we did that was,

5841
02:50:28.181 --> 02:50:31.840
we definitely did that with Anthony Bourdain too because we like fucking

5842
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:32.743
Anthony.

5843
02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:34.300
He seems kind of cool.

5844
02:50:34.330 --> 02:50:35.070
He's very cool.

5845
02:50:35.070 --> 02:50:36.370
Can I held his shit together?

5846
02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:36.851
Yeah,

5847
02:50:36.851 --> 02:50:37.601
he's very cool.

5848
02:50:37.601 --> 02:50:38.650
I really love that guy.

5849
02:50:38.860 --> 02:50:39.700
But we,

5850
02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:40.660
we just kept going.

5851
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:41.980
I kept handing the joint.

5852
02:50:41.981 --> 02:50:43.240
He kept talking and I was like this,

5853
02:50:43.241 --> 02:50:44.890
this mother fucker even know.

5854
02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:46.660
Cause the people who live in New York,

5855
02:50:46.690 --> 02:50:49.850
I mean I knew he's a guy who's experienced a lot of substances,

5856
02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.410
right?

5857
02:50:50.410 --> 02:50:51.460
So I knew he'd be fine,

5858
02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:52.690
but at a certain point in time,

5859
02:50:52.691 --> 02:50:53.980
the body just has a breakdown.

5860
02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:55.240
Even Joey Diaz,

5861
02:50:55.660 --> 02:50:57.160
we had probably seven,

5862
02:50:57.220 --> 02:50:59.860
eight hits and you know where that goes.

5863
02:50:59.861 --> 02:51:00.460
Yeah.

5864
02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:03.930
You're talking on a podcast like good fucking,

5865
02:51:03.970 --> 02:51:05.770
you might be able to keep it together if you didn't have to talk,

5866
02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:11.170
but just managing your thoughts and talking at the same time.

5867
02:51:11.171 --> 02:51:12.004
It's fucking,

5868
02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:12.880
it's problematic.

5869
02:51:13.290 --> 02:51:13.630
Okay.

5870
02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:14.380
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

5871
02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:16.870
Have you heard that thing that you can smoke yourself sober?

5872
02:51:16.871 --> 02:51:17.704
You think that's true?

5873
02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:18.753
I've heard that,

5874
02:51:18.910 --> 02:51:20.490
but I think people just forget what sober.

5875
02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:21.910
What do you mean smoke yourself sober?

5876
02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:24.580
They apparently like you're not stoned anymore.

5877
02:51:24.690 --> 02:51:25.523
We're going to charge.

5878
02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:31.000
It starts triggering a thing in your brain that actually acts as an antidote or

5879
02:51:31.721 --> 02:51:32.081
something.

5880
02:51:32.081 --> 02:51:35.440
Like you get a high enough dose and it starts having a reverse effect.

5881
02:51:35.650 --> 02:51:36.820
Sounds like something.

5882
02:51:36.850 --> 02:51:37.091
Yeah,

5883
02:51:37.091 --> 02:51:37.924
man.

5884
02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:40.010
<v 0>You get to,</v>

5885
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.661
you get sober,

5886
02:51:40.661 --> 02:51:41.494
man.

5887
02:51:41.770 --> 02:51:42.603
I wonder.

5888
02:51:42.670 --> 02:51:42.941
Okay,

5889
02:51:42.941 --> 02:51:43.201
let's,

5890
02:51:43.201 --> 02:51:44.080
let's go with that.

5891
02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:45.630
Can you smoke yourself sober?

5892
02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:48.160
Small smoke yourself.

5893
02:51:49.860 --> 02:51:52.330
It's fucking one of the first things you look up in Google.

5894
02:51:52.331 --> 02:51:53.164
It's right there.

5895
02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:53.920
Okay,

5896
02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:54.551
let's find out.

5897
02:51:54.551 --> 02:51:55.990
What is the CIO answers.

5898
02:51:56.350 --> 02:51:56.681
Okay.

5899
02:51:56.681 --> 02:51:59.140
Smoking yourself sober is possible.

5900
02:51:59.141 --> 02:52:03.310
Read here from marijuana.com so you know,

5901
02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:04.970
it's got to be legit.

5902
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:08.020
They sponsor Doug Benson's bathroom.

5903
02:52:08.350 --> 02:52:09.880
They sponsor everything he does.

5904
02:52:10.470 --> 02:52:11.303
Uh,

5905
02:52:11.470 --> 02:52:14.680
I figured out that the cannabinoid receptors in your body absorbed well.

5906
02:52:14.681 --> 02:52:15.514
What does this word?

5907
02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:18.190
Some fucking guy was really smart dude.

5908
02:52:18.191 --> 02:52:19.024
Relax.

5909
02:52:19.060 --> 02:52:19.391
Okay.

5910
02:52:19.391 --> 02:52:24.391
This is hilarious because he obviously cut and pasted the word because there's a

5911
02:52:24.491 --> 02:52:25.990
different font between,

5912
02:52:26.260 --> 02:52:29.720
I have figured out the cannabinoid receptors in the body absorb

5913
02:52:33.390 --> 02:52:34.223
smaller.

5914
02:52:34.570 --> 02:52:35.620
Yeah.

5915
02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:40.210
It's in a capital letter smaller than all the rest in the font becomes smaller

5916
02:52:40.211 --> 02:52:41.230
for the rest of the thing.

5917
02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:43.270
So he copied and pasted it in wordpress.

5918
02:52:43.271 --> 02:52:46.750
This is one of those articles written by the robot she was talking about?

5919
02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:46.991
No,

5920
02:52:46.991 --> 02:52:50.130
this Guy Wade just smoked himself sober when he wrote this article.

5921
02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:53.650
This guy fucked up is what he did because now I'm not buying your bullshit side

5922
02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:56.290
and this is the word and uh,

5923
02:52:56.320 --> 02:53:01.320
damn mind and a damn I a m and a and d.

5924
02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:06.590
A.

5925
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.590
M.

5926
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.590
I.

5927
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.590
D.

5928
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.590
E.

5929
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.640
Sorry.

5930
02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:07.473
Sorry.

5931
02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:09.033
Okay,

5932
02:53:09.530 --> 02:53:12.550
well that's not so we get sober halfway through your session.

5933
02:53:12.551 --> 02:53:15.460
It's just because you finished breaking down the old THC basically.

5934
02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:16.031
Okay.

5935
02:53:16.031 --> 02:53:17.270
He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking now.

5936
02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:18.560
He doesn't Dunkin,

5937
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:19.473
let's smoke.

5938
02:53:19.650 --> 02:53:20.650
I smoked myself sober.

5939
02:53:20.651 --> 02:53:21.220
Let's try it.

5940
02:53:21.220 --> 02:53:22.270
This guy's response,

5941
02:53:22.271 --> 02:53:25.840
I feel like in theory that first half sounded really good.

5942
02:53:26.050 --> 02:53:27.240
Then your baked didn't.

5943
02:53:27.241 --> 02:53:29.620
This just took you down a different path.

5944
02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:36.420
It's hard to reach giant premises when there's a carousel spinning around in

5945
02:53:36.431 --> 02:53:39.040
your head playing music if you get what I'm saying.

5946
02:53:40.390 --> 02:53:43.780
I feel like although theoretically it is possible,

5947
02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:48.520
I doubt one would ever fill up every receptor in their brain with THC thus

5948
02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:51.400
halting a further increase of your high.

5949
02:53:51.790 --> 02:53:53.550
I think you just get so high you forget your high.

5950
02:53:53.630 --> 02:53:54.160
All right.

5951
02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:54.971
That's my theory.

5952
02:53:54.971 --> 02:53:57.310
It's much easier Ockham's razor go with that.

5953
02:53:57.820 --> 02:53:58.780
You forgot what sober is.

5954
02:53:58.781 --> 02:53:59.471
You're so baked.

5955
02:53:59.471 --> 02:53:59.831
You forgot.

5956
02:53:59.831 --> 02:53:59.921
Well,

5957
02:53:59.921 --> 02:54:00.754
I'm sober dude.

5958
02:54:00.850 --> 02:54:02.980
You forgot what being sober really feels like.

5959
02:54:03.970 --> 02:54:04.870
He's just talking shit.

5960
02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:06.390
Right.

5961
02:54:06.390 --> 02:54:07.270
I don't like to get that high.

5962
02:54:07.630 --> 02:54:08.463
I mean either.

5963
02:54:08.530 --> 02:54:09.363
I used to though.

5964
02:54:09.550 --> 02:54:10.420
I'd like to get that high.

5965
02:54:10.421 --> 02:54:12.850
If I know I'm going to do something like flying a plane.

5966
02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:15.040
Really that all men hate that.

5967
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:16.510
That's when I would be thinking about this,

5968
02:54:16.570 --> 02:54:19.130
the plane and got to force yourself to every little,

5969
02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.140
every little thing,

5970
02:54:20.140 --> 02:54:21.580
every little thing that could go wrong.

5971
02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:22.983
Focused on that.

5972
02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:25.270
Yeah.

5973
02:54:25.270 --> 02:54:26.320
I think it's good though.

5974
02:54:26.530 --> 02:54:28.810
It's good to have those experiences every now and then because when you land,

5975
02:54:28.811 --> 02:54:30.010
you feel so good about life.

5976
02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:30.853
You so happy.

5977
02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:33.220
He just sobered up and nothing happened and you're like,

5978
02:54:33.221 --> 02:54:33.551
God,

5979
02:54:33.551 --> 02:54:34.330
I'm going to be okay.

5980
02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:39.070
But a plane is a good place to get really hard because you're in a relatively

5981
02:54:39.071 --> 02:54:40.750
safe place outside of the fact,

5982
02:54:40.751 --> 02:54:41.340
like when it's,

5983
02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:43.030
I've been so hard to keep it together.

5984
02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:44.230
I've been so high in a plane.

5985
02:54:44.231 --> 02:54:48.130
When I was taking off then I thought I was going to start screaming like for a

5986
02:54:48.131 --> 02:54:48.610
quick,

5987
02:54:48.610 --> 02:54:49.600
quick second.

5988
02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:50.420
Aria Hall said,

5989
02:54:50.420 --> 02:54:51.820
once it happens,

5990
02:54:51.821 --> 02:54:52.480
man,

5991
02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:55.450
you feel like you're going to have a heart attack because it's like,

5992
02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:55.571
yeah,

5993
02:54:55.571 --> 02:54:56.410
this sounds great.

5994
02:54:57.070 --> 02:55:00.250
But then when you're in the air and also the time shit man,

5995
02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:02.230
remember on Air France,

5996
02:55:03.310 --> 02:55:04.070
remember that?

5997
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:05.810
Which one are we went to England.

5998
02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:06.440
Yeah.

5999
02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:06.920
Yeah.

6000
02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:07.753
What happened?

6001
02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:08.713
What happened?

6002
02:55:09.050 --> 02:55:14.050
<v 4>I just remember having ingested and maybe some more coming onto the end of the</v>

6003
02:55:14.061 --> 02:55:15.170
airport area,

6004
02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:16.760
way outside the airport.

6005
02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:19.300
I remember working near where it's at,

6006
02:55:19.310 --> 02:55:19.850
where it's legal.

6007
02:55:19.850 --> 02:55:23.420
I remember taking an edible in Colorado after the war,

6008
02:55:23.950 --> 02:55:24.783
after the war,

6009
02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:26.001
but like Joe,

6010
02:55:26.001 --> 02:55:26.690
because it's like,

6011
02:55:26.690 --> 02:55:28.220
it's like the UFC.

6012
02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:33.200
They've hooked him up with these FirstClass insane seats.

6013
02:55:33.230 --> 02:55:33.600
I've,

6014
02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:35.630
I still think about it like every couple of days.

6015
02:55:35.631 --> 02:55:39.080
I'll think about that flight just because it was so luxurious.

6016
02:55:39.081 --> 02:55:39.914
I'd never been in a,

6017
02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:42.020
you're like flying with the Illuminati.

6018
02:55:42.170 --> 02:55:46.700
There's like Dutch oil billionaires across from you or act like it's normal.

6019
02:55:46.701 --> 02:55:49.730
You watch him like take their shoes off and put on new pants.

6020
02:55:49.731 --> 02:55:53.120
They have like luxury flying clothes that they wear.

6021
02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:53.930
Pajamas,

6022
02:55:53.930 --> 02:55:54.561
pajamas,

6023
02:55:54.561 --> 02:55:58.070
they put on their pajamas and your seat goes all the way back and it's a big,

6024
02:55:58.071 --> 02:56:01.490
huge weird bubble seat they can swirl around.

6025
02:56:01.700 --> 02:56:06.260
But so it's a perfect place to be super high until we hit fucking turbulence.

6026
02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:07.070
Remember that?

6027
02:56:07.070 --> 02:56:07.640
Oh yeah.

6028
02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:09.260
And when the captain came on and said,

6029
02:56:09.261 --> 02:56:13.940
this turbulence is probably going to keep up for the rest of the flight and I am

6030
02:56:13.941 --> 02:56:15.350
fucking high man.

6031
02:56:15.351 --> 02:56:16.360
Like scared.

6032
02:56:16.380 --> 02:56:17.090
Like you're,

6033
02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:17.631
I'm just thinking,

6034
02:56:17.631 --> 02:56:18.560
how would you do that?

6035
02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:22.710
<v 0>Well,</v>

6036
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:25.410
I gotta I gotta get drunk at the airport.

6037
02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:28.980
That's what I do because I've been in those turbulent flights where it's like

6038
02:56:28.981 --> 02:56:30.300
three hours of turbulence.

6039
02:56:30.660 --> 02:56:34.020
It's the worst drink and then you're like kind of not as terrified.

6040
02:56:34.140 --> 02:56:34.651
Unfortunately.

6041
02:56:34.651 --> 02:56:35.041
Gentleman.

6042
02:56:35.041 --> 02:56:35.874
We're out of time.

6043
02:56:36.810 --> 02:56:38.520
Sorry to end on that story.

6044
02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:39.090
Sorry.

6045
02:56:39.090 --> 02:56:40.160
Sorry to freak everybody out.

6046
02:56:40.161 --> 02:56:40.741
What else happened,

6047
02:56:40.741 --> 02:56:40.921
Doug?

6048
02:56:40.921 --> 02:56:41.850
It is that the end of the story.

6049
02:56:42.030 --> 02:56:44.520
That's how it goes to that.

6050
02:56:44.830 --> 02:56:45.430

6051

6052
02:56:46.501 --> 02:56:47.490

02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.930

6088
02:57:49.410 --> 02:57:52.050
<v 15>cited those shows are almost sold out,</v>

6089

02:58:02.820 --> 02:58:05.460
If you want to listen to one of the most awesome podcast and the history of the

6094
02:58:05.461 --> 02:58:05.941
universe,

6095
02:58:05.941 --> 02:58:08.730
then you want to listen to the Duncan Trussell family hour that's

6096
02:58:08.731 --> 02:58:11.340
available@duncantrussell.com.

6099
02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:15.083
<v 1>stitcher.</v>

6100
02:58:15.710 --> 02:58:16.180
The university

6101
02:58:16.180 --> 02:58:19.620
<v 15>wants you to be a part of this and you want to be a part of the universe since</v>

6102
02:58:19.621 --> 02:58:20.454
you already are.

6103
02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:21.510
How pretentious.

6104
02:58:21.630 --> 02:58:23.690
<v 1>Imagine if I said the only way to be a part of the university's,</v>

6105
02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:24.750
if you pay attention to us,

6106
02:58:25.260 --> 02:58:26.280
<v 15>that's pretty ridiculous,</v>

6107
02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:27.293
but I mean it.

6108
02:58:27.570 --> 02:58:28.403
So get on it.

02:58:28.951 --> 02:58:29.850
and it is,

6111
02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:31.290
where'd Rogan say 10% off?

6112
02:58:31.770 --> 02:58:31.951
All right,

6113
02:58:31.951 --> 02:58:32.880

6114

6116
02:58:36.610 --> 02:58:36.930
Um,

6117
02:58:36.930 --> 02:58:38.130
I don't even want to tell you who it is

6118
02:58:38.450 --> 02:58:40.380
<v 15>cause I want to surprise you with awesomeness.</v>

6119
02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:44.220
So a much love everybody seen next weekend.

6120
