00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you know that you like the</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:10.071
<v Speaker 1>concept of gender identity to someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't struggle with it is it's one</v>

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>of those things where you try to wrap</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head around and try to understand</v>

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd never.</v>

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like why we say that a man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman never really understand each</v>

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sort of get this thing where</v>

7
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>they accept that this is how you are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>but I never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never understand what it's like to</v>

9
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>want a baby in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never understand what it's like to</v>

10
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>have my period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never.</v>

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never understand what it's like in</v>

12
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:38.601
<v Speaker 1>any way and being a woman and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like you're in the wrong sex.</v>

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>What does that like and how did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you realize it?</v>

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It's imagine if you felt all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden.</v>

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>One day he started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a girl.</v>

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>It would freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>it would take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

18
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>

19
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I really most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I can just tell you what most of my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that way,</v>

21
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but my parents did raise me like a boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I was a little girl.</v>

22
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>They completely raised me like a boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't very much of a tomboy.</v>

23
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Tomboys are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A girl who looks like a little boy and</v>

24
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you know your Tan and you dress like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little boy.</v>

25
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>That's okay in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody freaks out on that.</v>

26
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It's when you start reaching puberty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started.</v>

27
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I started growing breasts and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting my period.</v>

28
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>That's when everything shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was totally okay.</v>

29
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>My childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then people are like,</v>

30
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to start treating her like her.</v>

31
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Not like he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents were completely freaked out</v>

32
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>because they always just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

33
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that an issue?</v>

34
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Because I was just like a tomboy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when that happened,</v>

35
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that's when I'll like basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything all hell broke loose,</v>

36
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't your folks that have the issue</v>

37
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>or the community that had the issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>community or their friends kept saying,</v>

38
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stop calling her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

39
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

40
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I fuck.</v>

41
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>The daycare will be quite such a freaky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird thing for people in our,</v>

42
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically I manage this and a woman is</v>

43
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your penis makes you a man and your</v>

44
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>vagina makes you a woman that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white for most people in the</v>

45
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>whole wide world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it works.</v>

46
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And so basically that's not true because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really how you feel inside your</v>

47
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:21.081
<v Speaker 1>outer presence is just the shell of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul and your being really.</v>

48
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it's that simple,</v>

49
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>but of course people don't get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people always take things at</v>

50
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>face value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't tend to get to know you or.</v>

51
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting right in front of you now.</v>

52
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that I am a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

53
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A beard.</v>

54
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically a man.</v>

56
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the compliment from.</v>

57
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just that everyone gets so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

58
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the government doesn't represent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people anymore.</v>

59
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.031
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>that may be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are we doing to organize to</v>

61
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>make it so that they start listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us again?</v>

62
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>We need</v>

63
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.963
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

64
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah and no.</v>

65
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

66
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>and that something's got to change and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no in that really what would be optimal</v>

67
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>is if the people that were in positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of power realize that there were fucking</v>

68
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.930
<v Speaker 1>over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the best that they just</v>

69
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:13.511
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

70
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:13.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

71
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>we ate some pot and we realized we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of cons.</v>

72
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>So we're willing to like try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to figure out a way how to</v>

73
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>reward people for the work they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already done,</v>

74
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>but yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move forward in a much more ethical</v>

75
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>way of distributing wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck,</v>

76
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are good luck.</v>

77
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>That's socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk you fucking Cami.</v>

78
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.840
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking human fossils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

79
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.900
<v Speaker 2>imagine taking Payoti with Baner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine</v>

80
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine looking across at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and he's like transforming into</v>

81
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 2>howdy doody in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His eyes are glowing red.</v>

82
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>No Way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

83
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like these are a earlier</v>

84
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:55.841
<v Speaker 2>versions of human beings who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose entire operating system as a is</v>

85
00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.780
<v Speaker 2>needed an update since the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no.</v>

86
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had an updated your iphone since</v>

87
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:06.050
<v Speaker 2>when iphones came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what these people are like with</v>

88
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:06.884
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

89
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>but they're way worse than iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers,</v>

90
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>they murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on a bbs board of in the early</v>

91
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>nineties with a 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four modem.</v>

92
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the shit cuts out every five</v>

93
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not gonna.</v>

94
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Want to tell it with a ball at all?</v>

95
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's.</v>

96
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:21.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole thing's fucking wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

97
00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Christopher Ryan on my podcast and</v>

98
00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.130
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how in indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>

99
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 2>the people who never are allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become leaders or the people who</v>

100
00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>indicate that they want to be leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those are always the ones people</v>

101
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:39.260
<v Speaker 2>avoid as being the leaders and the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>who end up being leaders are the ones</v>

102
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 2>who know the most about certain things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fishing or hunting.</v>

103
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Those people are naturally followed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't fucking throw makeup on and</v>

104
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.800
<v Speaker 2>try to get in front of a try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnotize a country by saying the exact</v>

105
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone always says,</v>

106
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.410
<v Speaker 2>my fellow American president talk that</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird cadence.</v>

107
00:04:57.411 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Why are you talking like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>

108
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about that times on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you and if you were sitting at home</v>

109
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:06.470
<v Speaker 1>with a guy and he started talking to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

110
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>you would stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

111
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you trying to hypnotize me?</v>

112
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.320
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz was sitting across from Obama.</v>

113
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing right now,</v>

114
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>bipartisan efforts have been reached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have reached out to Republicans for</v>

115
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.963
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to bargain.</v>

116
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

117
