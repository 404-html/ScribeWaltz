00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience buddy don't as a motherfucker and go on stay red ban.</v>

2
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:09.550
<v Speaker 1>You Miss Friday night.</v>

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I know I heard about this Friday night how I fucking almost had a nervous</v>

4
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>breakdown the time.</v>

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.093
<v Speaker 1>Did he tell you,</v>

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>remember when you and your wife were asking me questions and I was fidgety?</v>

7
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I was having a nervous breakdown.</v>

8
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:21.814
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

9
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.830
<v Speaker 1>You think I'm fucking with you guys though?</v>

10
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know me Friday night I bombed so hard last week.</v>

11
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>You know sometimes you get in a transition period,</v>

12
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got all of these bits that aren't ready and you bring them up and it's</v>

13
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>like you got three of them so you bomb for two weeks,</v>

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden one night they all come together.</v>

15
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Now you become a force.</v>

16
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a different game.</v>

17
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I was in that process for like two weeks.</v>

18
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:44.141
<v Speaker 1>I was in limbo.</v>

19
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I had good sets in Boston,</v>

20
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>but anything I tried out of the ordinary and Boston wasn't clicking for him.</v>

21
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>So I just stuck to the fucking original.</v>

22
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>And then I came back to the comedy store.</v>

23
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I ate shit somewhere on Monday night and I went to the economy's struck</v>

24
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>

25
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>They opened up with that suicide joke that didn't take me very far</v>

26
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>and then the second time I told him the story about my friend who tried to</v>

27
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.131
<v Speaker 1>commit suicide.</v>

28
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>She failed and she went up to the comedy store and she bought a gram of coke</v>

29
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>from chewy and as we were doing it I said,</v>

30
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>how did you get out of the crazy house?</v>

32
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Then you try to kill yourself three days ago and there was a big Graham,</v>

33
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it was one big line.</v>

34
00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>She did the whole thing.</v>

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>She looked at me and she goes,</v>

36
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:22.001
<v Speaker 1>I ain't crazy.</v>

37
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:22.834
<v Speaker 1>They let me out.</v>

38
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

39
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I told that story that we've got some last minute,</v>

40
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>one of them near in the rate and the main home and I just died.</v>

41
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I had a fall delete.</v>

42
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.553
<v Speaker 1>I just died.</v>

43
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I just died a slow death that was trying new stuff.</v>

44
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going nowhere.</v>

45
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to talk about Trump and I just died.</v>

46
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>So Friday I went to the store and I swear to God guys,</v>

47
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't eat nothing on that.</v>

48
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Smoked some pot I worked at,</v>

49
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.211
<v Speaker 1>I went to the y,</v>

50
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I did chest and the other thing I smoked though before I left the house.</v>

51
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It was a little Brownie.</v>

52
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's 70 milligram brownies.</v>

53
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I have like maybe 13 cops left for the day.</v>

54
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking starving.</v>

55
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>This little bong is right there.</v>

56
00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a half a pack of an antiquey edible.</v>

57
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>They give you two brownies each.</v>

58
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Each at each Brownie is 70 milligrams.</v>

59
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy scary.</v>

60
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I rub my balls are 70 milligrams.</v>

61
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:14.961
<v Speaker 1>You understand me?</v>

62
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>70 milligrams for uncle Joey is like an APP,</v>

63
00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>but that's not going to parrot teeth.</v>

64
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a fuck you're supplying to the rest of the world.</v>

65
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>70 milligrams of put you into a fucking hole.</v>

74
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.510

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>so I'm alone at the comedy store.</v>

146
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I went to the original image path.</v>

147
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I walk around with it,</v>

148
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 1>but I go into the VIP patio and I just sit there some to,</v>

149
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>to listen to music.</v>

150
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Some black dude was smoking a joint.</v>

151
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I mind my business.</v>

152
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I look straight ahead.</v>

153
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about more material.</v>

154
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say how I bombed.</v>

155
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just whipping me now,</v>

156
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

157
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm starting to get scared.</v>

158
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:53.621
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

159
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to go on stage.</v>

160
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Jeff comes over to me and he goes,</v>

161
00:04:58.901 --> 00:04:59.201

171
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.010
<v Speaker 1>She had a hat on and she was,</v>

172
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.920

179
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I walk up to the first landing guys and it hits me.</v>

180
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

181
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.931

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>this can't be happening to me.</v>

187
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>This ain't happening.</v>

188
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And all the sudden I'm standing there and it's getting worse.</v>

189
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

190
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>it's getting worse now there's one seat open at the whole comedy store,</v>

191
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>this Mitsis jet.</v>

192
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So I sit in there for about a minute.</v>

193
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>She's got the blue light on,</v>

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 1>the pressure's on,</v>

195
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I got water in my hand,</v>

196
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I get back up and it's getting worse.</v>

197
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:55.091
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

198
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:55.871
<v Speaker 1>I turned around,</v>

199
00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I looked down to where the phone used to be and now I'm getting the anxiety I</v>

200
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>get when I'm getting the needle,</v>

201
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>which means I'm going down.</v>

202
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>That's I gotta look for day light or air.</v>

203
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I know this like I look for air,</v>

204
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>but I know if I go down those stairs,</v>

205
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>if she calls my name and I come back up those stairs,</v>

206
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm really going to have an anxiety attack.</v>

207
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>So I go to the corner and I just started looking at the wall and I start</v>

208
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.550
<v Speaker 1>breathing through my nose and some guy comes up to me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

238
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>He's the closest person in stage.</v>

239
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>She's about to call my name.</v>

240
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.581
