1
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And where are you writing notes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.713
<v Speaker 1>What are you writing notes about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just things that would be cool if we </v>

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you organized to do that?</v>

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know you don't like me looking at</v>

5
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>my computer so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>trying to go analog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:24.434
<v Speaker 1>I think both of us would be better off </v>
<v Speaker 1>in these things if we just said it's so </v>

8
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>easy to just start reading computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you read and shit that's</v>

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to get when one person's talking to</v>

10
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.094
<v Speaker 1>start thinking about the next thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to read about instead of </v>

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>there's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much coming at us.</v>

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like obsessive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to obsessive Lee,</v>

14
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 2>like fact check though and like make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure I'm saying the right thing.</v>

15
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:47.934
<v Speaker 2>So you</v>

16
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>get trumped later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>You uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to with this stuff.</v>

18
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.234
<v Speaker 1>But I mean don't think it's like harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>to form an opinion now than it's ever </v>

19
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>been before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just looking back at old videos,</v>

21
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's a different day.</v>

22
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

23
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I should probably delete this now if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

24
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

25
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the amount of data that you take in </v>
<v Speaker 1>today as opposed to just 20 years ago.</v>

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see something,</v>

27
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>anything that's happened and I read a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about something,</v>

28
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I got to throw it through like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>filters.</v>

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this real?</v>

30
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who,</v>

31
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>who's making this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

32
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>like every time someone sends you some </v>

<v Speaker 3>You have to get a nickname.</v>

108
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.000
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Jerry Seinfeld?</v>

109
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 3>You would probably say Mr Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

110
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Or I would say Mr Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said Mr Ventura,</v>

111
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 3>when I met Jesse Ventura,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called him Sir.</v>

112
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.433

<v Speaker 3>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 3>If I met Seinfeld for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd called him Mr Seinfeld,</v>

116
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.163
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're sharing a pizza like </v>

117
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:11.930
<v Speaker 3>watching a movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

174
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say that 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went to school.</v>

176
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.053
<v Speaker 1>I went to a a middle school in Jamaica </v>
<v Speaker 1>Plain Massachusetts when I was 13 years </v>

177
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:45.041
<v Speaker 1>old and I remember that's when that hip </v>
<v Speaker 1>hop hip it to the hippity hop.</v>

178
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That's when that was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the sugar hill gang had just</v>

179
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 1>come out with the first rap music ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had ever rather.</v>

180
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might've been some before,</v>

181
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but that was the first mainstream rap </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was exposed to as a kid.</v>

182
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.500

<v Speaker 1>80 nine was.</v>

236
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain works.</v>

237
00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I think of graduating high school.</v>

238
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.730
<v Speaker 4>80 eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>87 released January 27th,</v>

239
00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 4>1988.</v>

240
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.233
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of a graduating high school and </v>

241
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>the day I started comedy I superimpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>those times,</v>

242
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.703
<v Speaker 1>like literally are you think of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the two milestones of my youth for </v>

243
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Graduating high school,</v>

244
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 1>1985 and then starting comedy 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the big milestones.</v>

245
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I confabulated them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the word?</v>

246
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not be the right word.</v>

247
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.033
<v Speaker 1>Stepped out of my lane again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have one of those word of the </v>

248
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like calendars and everyday you,</v>

249
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it?</v>

250
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

251
00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I just try to find a good word that fits</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend has one of those and every day</v>

252
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 1>she tries to use a new word and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the word,</v>

253
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

254
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Psychiatry,</v>

255
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confabulation is a disturbance of memory</v>

256
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.143
<v Speaker 1>defined as the production of fabricated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted or misinterpreted memories </v>

257
00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 1>about oneself or the world without </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious intention to deceive.</v>

258
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Never used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

259
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.703
<v Speaker 1>How do they use it again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I write that I confabulated </v>

260
00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that I'm wrong once I say it.</v>

261
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a disturbance of memory?</v>

262
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's right.</v>

263
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Confabulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

264
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

265
00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it man.</v>

266
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Think about those like the date you </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduated high school.</v>

267
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever have nightmares that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go back?</v>

268
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 1>That you didn't take tests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept through most of high school,</v>

269
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:10.714
<v Speaker 1>like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole school I was sleeping so it </v>

270
00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>was all a dream to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually probably slept honestly,</v>

271
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.120
<v Speaker 1>40 percent of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

272
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Because I only liked art class and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I liked.</v>

273
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:23.164
<v Speaker 1>I hated everything else except English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked English class because I liked </v>

274
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.043
<v Speaker 1>like stories and writing crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to bring this up because I </v>

275
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>brought her up on the podcast before </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy,</v>

276
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

277
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:35.883
<v Speaker 1>when I was in high school that I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an art teacher that was just a Douche </v>

278
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:40.144
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just was not nice and he was like </v>

279
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>really negative and he must have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

280
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

281
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.263
<v Speaker 1>he was just wasn't a happy guy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made me stop doing art because I </v>

282
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to be in his class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

283
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

284
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I liked frank frazetta illustrations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like comic book illustrations.</v>

285
00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.473
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was really into learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do and this guy was just like </v>

286
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 1>pissing on dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 1>just saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never be able to do that.</v>

288
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisements for magazines that's most</v>

289
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 1>likely where you're going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just super negative,</v>

290
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but there was one guy in the class that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the most talented guy by far.</v>

291
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:18.994
<v Speaker 1>His name's John Devor and I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast and John reached out to </v>

292
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.364
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

293
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.293
<v Speaker 1>John Got Ahold of me and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me that he fucking quit that </v>

294
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>guy's class.</v>

295
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>That guy failed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

296
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 1>and this guy was insanely talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

297
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always pretty good,</v>

298
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>but there was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was another guy in our class.</v>

299
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It was better than me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was Kevin.</v>

300
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>He was a football player who's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stocky fucking dude.</v>

301
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And his brother was on the football </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

302
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.490

<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember his last name,</v>

303
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but those were the two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like number three.</v>

304
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Those are two guys who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all this.</v>

305
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>We all did the same style of was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic book,</v>

306
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.943
<v Speaker 1>illustration Type Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And devor could draw like he was the </v>

307
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:01.874
<v Speaker 1>most versatile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could draw like things like he could </v>

308
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:06.164
<v Speaker 1>draw a beautiful things like huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge or rose or you could draw a </v>

309
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:11.320
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only draw monsters how to draw and</v>

310
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 1>look like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I draw a fucked up,</v>

311
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf's for something like that.</v>

312
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:16.923
<v Speaker 1>And so that was into that kind of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in all three of us were into like </v>

313
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>that sort of comic book style aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this fucking teacher just,</v>

314
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.233
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

315
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean he rather uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the most talented guy in the class </v>

316
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 1>and gave them an f.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

317
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>When he told me that I went what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said give him an f that's fucked up.</v>

318
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:38.444
<v Speaker 1>And that teacher went in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in today's world because you </v>

319
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:42.060
<v Speaker 1>would have filmed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have put on Youtube.</v>

320
00:15:42.061 --> 00:15:42.894
<v Speaker 1>But when it became a news story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been like checking the </v>

321
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:49.460
<v Speaker 1>teachers is like another big thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

322
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:50.294
<v Speaker 1>But it's when a teacher has tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be really difficult in certain </v>

323
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:55.080
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I know they have that problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain universities.</v>

325
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Teachers have tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really can't fire them.</v>

326
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And once they know they can't be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they can be like really,</v>

327
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>really radical and some crazy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and teach your kids some shit that</v>

328
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:10.214
<v Speaker 1>you don't agree with that no one agrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and if they get into a university </v>

329
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and they get into the system and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid winds up in their class,</v>

330
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.313
<v Speaker 1>I mean some really crazy teachers out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and there's this guy in Toronto </v>

331
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.703
<v Speaker 1>who is a professor and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding that he take a sensitivity </v>

332
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:30.104
<v Speaker 1>courses and all kinds of crazy shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're calling him transphobic because </v>

333
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 1>you won't use the 28 different gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns that are available today.</v>

334
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 fucking gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So talking to him.</v>

335
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.273
<v Speaker 1>They're calling him transphobic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender binary gender believer and this </v>

336
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 1>guy is a lashing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of backing off,</v>

337
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.693
<v Speaker 1>he's decided to make more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational youtube videos about what's </v>

338
00:16:58.341 --> 00:17:02.840
<v Speaker 1>wrong with this kind of censorship </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was.</v>

339
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.420
<v Speaker 1>He saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I agree with this,</v>

340
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.153
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a lot of like what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with like maybe what people </v>

341
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:11.054
<v Speaker 1>would call a social justice warrior or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to shut people down from </v>

342
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>being able to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on,</v>

343
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's this need to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a.</v>

344
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:22.094
<v Speaker 1>there's like a need to control other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and to push your idea on other </v>

345
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:28.640
<v Speaker 1>people whether or not they agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or not.</v>

346
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 1>That mirrors the same thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>with religions.</v>

347
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might be right or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might not be right.</v>

348
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.823
<v Speaker 1>There might be an argument against what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that you might have to </v>

349
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:42.080
<v Speaker 1>consider like in that one when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get an idea one way in their head,</v>

350
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.293
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to consider any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and when you see these </v>

351
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 1>kids rallying against this professor,</v>

352
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 5>it's never been more evident because </v>
<v Speaker 5>this professor is brilliant and what </v>

353
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:55.464
<v Speaker 5>he's saying is nonemotional and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about the problems with how </v>

354
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:00.294
<v Speaker 5>these things are defined and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things is he brought up this DVD that </v>

355
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:07.490
<v Speaker 5>one of the teachers of this course was </v>
<v Speaker 5>making about how to.</v>

356
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.383
<v Speaker 5>How to make sure that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>subconsciously biased or subconsciously </v>

357
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:14.574
<v Speaker 5>a prejudiced and the dvds were like 700 </v>
<v Speaker 5>bucks or something like that for a DVD </v>

358
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 5>series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

359
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 5>Well this guy outlines all of this in </v>
<v Speaker 5>his.</v>

360
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:26.460
<v Speaker 5>In his video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this youtube video,</v>

361
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:28.910
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is craziness like gold.</v>

362
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 5>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This doesn't make sense.</v>

363
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.464
<v Speaker 5>It's never been proven to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in the idea that there's </v>

364
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.243
<v Speaker 5>subconscious biases that you're accusing</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone of being guilty before you're </v>

365
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 5>ever even talking to them about </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

366
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 5>I get it like you don't even know.</v>

367
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 5>Saying a subconscious bias is a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange thing.</v>

368
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

369
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.993
<v Speaker 5>how do you know if you have that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's subconscious like you can't even </v>

370
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 5>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

371
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 5>you're making people think they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>guilty.</v>

372
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
<v Speaker 5>Even if they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you say you have a subconscious </v>

373
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:03.834
<v Speaker 5>bias,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the things that people do </v>

374
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.293
<v Speaker 5>when they're super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super liberal in order to prevent from </v>

375
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 5>other people think and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>subconscious bias.</v>

376
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 5>They go way out of their way to show no </v>
<v Speaker 5>bias whatsoever and even favor something</v>

377
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 5>that people would be biased against.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's super and a gay marriage.</v>

378
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 5>I love seeing gay couples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

379
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.770
<v Speaker 5>Do you love seeing heterosexual couples </v>
<v Speaker 5>to like,</v>

380
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.940
<v Speaker 5>or do you just freak out over gay </v>
<v Speaker 5>people?</v>

381
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.530
<v Speaker 5>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

382
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:31.600
<v Speaker 5>I like seeing people in love to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I really don't.</v>

383
00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 5>You like seeing all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like seeing the whole batch.</v>

384
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.840
<v Speaker 5>It's nice.</v>

385
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.690
<v Speaker 2>It's very exhausting nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like April in love,</v>

386
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.970
<v Speaker 2>just everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the how you're supposed to act,</v>

387
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.650
<v Speaker 2>what you're supposed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

388
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.560
<v Speaker 2>There was a last night I was at this bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

389
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was sitting next to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a taller woman and then she looked up,</v>

390
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.730
<v Speaker 2>she looked over and it was obviously a </v>
<v Speaker 2>post,</v>

391
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a transformation and a transgender </v>

392
00:19:55.511 --> 00:19:56.344
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fuck,</v>

393
00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.490
<v Speaker 2>you have to say the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to say the right word.</v>

394
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.690
<v Speaker 2>She transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

395
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.760
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

396
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.320
<v Speaker 2>but then the whole time she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

397
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.253
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kept on looking at me as if that </v>

398
00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:10.864
<v Speaker 2>person was way taller and so if it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy it would be a big giant guy just </v>

399
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.300
<v Speaker 2>staring at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So either way I feel I felt like freaked</v>

400
00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.260
<v Speaker 2>out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

401
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.130
<v Speaker 2>so I might not allowed to be freaked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's a woman now that some guys</v>

402
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:26.020
<v Speaker 2>staring at me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>anyone staring at you.</v>

405
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.843
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a little kid was staring at you like </v>

415
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.480
<v Speaker 6>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that it's</v>

416
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 5>essentially just fools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just fools.</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

419
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 5>You don't vote for because you hate </v>
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>

<v Speaker 5>care.</v>

423
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.050
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what you're worried about,</v>

424
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:14.884
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

425
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 5>being a Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so why don't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you to go to gym and be a bro and</v>

427

<v Speaker 5>care.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those super like aggro,</v>

429
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:25.414
<v Speaker 5>progressive type people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember I was in a bar once in </v>

430
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 5>New York and I was having a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 5>with this,</v>

431
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:33.514
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this girl who was a waitress and the </v>

432
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 5>bartender got so aggro bro on me and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a,</v>

433
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.540
<v Speaker 5>it was about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the Oj Simpson case where like Oj</v>

434
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Simpson had been accused of domestic </v>
<v Speaker 5>violence before,</v>

435
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 5>like before the murder.</v>

436
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.763
<v Speaker 5>It was something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something along those lines and our </v>

437
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.810
<v Speaker 5>member,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all I asked was,</v>

438
00:21:58.811 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

439
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.040
<v Speaker 5>I said he was accused of being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was acquitted and the,</v>

440
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.940
<v Speaker 5>and the guy just totally ego brought me </v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

441
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen man,</v>

442
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.170
<v Speaker 5>when a woman says that something </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

443
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 5>it fucking happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

444
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Until you know better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happened.</v>

445
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:19.114
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but didn't you just say he was </v>

446
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:22.900
<v Speaker 5>acquitted?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think he probably murdered his ex</v>

447
00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:23.734
<v Speaker 5>wife and that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But didn't you say that he was </v>

448
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 5>acquitted?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't,</v>

449
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 5>like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't attack that in there.</v>

450
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.573
<v Speaker 5>If he was acquitted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't really know what happened </v>

451
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:32.794
<v Speaker 5>unless you were there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know that a court of law found that </v>

452
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.440
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't guilty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that because he had a lot of money?</v>

453
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:39.220
<v Speaker 5>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did it.</v>

454
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.053
<v Speaker 5>Did he never go to trial for that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it just something that somebody </v>

455
00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:44.410
<v Speaker 5>accused him of dropping and then drop </v>
<v Speaker 5>the charges?</v>

456
00:22:44.411 --> 00:22:45.244
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he didn't want to hear none of that </v>

457
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:48.184
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to come strong with the ECO </v>

458
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just puffed up.</v>

459
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.013
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even respond to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember going to look at this silly </v>

460
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is ridiculous.</v>

461
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 5>He got so aggro with me.</v>

462
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.433
<v Speaker 6>Did you watch that make and made in </v>
<v Speaker 6>America the ESPN 30 for 30 on the trial </v>

463
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:03.900

<v Speaker 6>throat can see Ron Goldman to.</v>

471
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.280
<v Speaker 6>They don't show up when they hear it on </v>
<v Speaker 6>TV,</v>

472
00:23:23.281 --> 00:23:25.110
<v Speaker 6>so if you're watching it and you can try</v>
<v Speaker 6>to catch it there,</v>

473
00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:26.400
<v Speaker 6>because I tried to show it to my friend </v>

481
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:38.514
<v Speaker 6>web,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's amazing how some things can be </v>

482
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:44.460
<v Speaker 6>kept off the web pretty easy nowadays.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they'll aggregate these stories from all</v>
<v Speaker 5>these other different websites and stuff</v>

516
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:16.660
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

517
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.533
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's easy to go to someone </v>

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

520
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.040
<v Speaker 5>I believe in supporting collectors </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't,</v>

521
00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:25.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't have the time to do that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're going out and finding all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>cool stories about space and you're </v>

523
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:34.361
<v Speaker 5>putting them up in one spot that's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable because it's like a Dj there,</v>

524
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:36.044
<v Speaker 5>like a Dj for stories because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not just covering any fucking story </v>

525
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 5>because if they covered any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>story it would be boring as shit.</v>

526
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.383
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of stories that are going </v>

527
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:45.794
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just like,</v>

528
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.760

<v Speaker 5>that's not that good.</v>

529
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.900
<v Speaker 5>But they figured out like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the juiciest shit?</v>

530
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.790
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the more interesting shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the,</v>

531
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the debt?</v>

532
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 5>And they shuffle it all in together and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you always can get something fascinating</v>

533
00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:59.300
<v Speaker 5>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very addictive man.</v>

534
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 5>Like looking on the Internet for those </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories,</v>

538
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.560
<v Speaker 2>then you start watching videos and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning more.</v>

539
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:18.230

<v Speaker 3>She'll just go up to a fish and pull up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the eyeball and eat it.</v>

593
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

595
00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:30.801

<v Speaker 3>she opens up this thing and she got.</v>

596
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.341
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And it was like every thing that you </v>

598
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:40.020
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't want to eat like a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a pig feet like cow noses.</v>

599
00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Like it was just like a smorgasbord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one,</v>

600
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 3>not one thing that I would eat in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this whole tray.</v>

601
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:51.650
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a Delicatessen to Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did the balloon?</v>

602
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.690
<v Speaker 3>That's Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love that stuff.</v>

603
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.990
<v Speaker 3>We used to serve that on fear factor as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

604
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 3>like a hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my Filipino friends because in pool,</v>

605
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.190
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of the best pool players in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world are Filipino.</v>

606
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.173
<v Speaker 3>So I played pool a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always around Filipino guys and </v>

607
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 3>while I was doing fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played a lot of pool.</v>

608
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 3>This fucking dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

609
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat that shit tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like bring somebody.</v>

610
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you got any leftover?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to eat it.</v>

611
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.573
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made people eat that stuff is if you </v>

612
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:23.370
<v Speaker 3>don't know what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fetus to duck fetus that's in.</v>

613
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's cooked in the yolk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of fucked up.</v>

614
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of gruesome and it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a duck.</v>

615
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.313
<v Speaker 3>Like the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember it looked like a baby duck </v>

616
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>that you'd just eat a baby duck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

617
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:38.500
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know until I was like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>39 years old or something.</v>

618
00:29:38.501 --> 00:29:39.334
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how old I was when I found </v>

619
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:41.990
<v Speaker 3>out that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of</v>

620
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.200
<v Speaker 5>a chicken egg doesn't become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I never thought of it.</v>

621
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 5>I never even thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

622
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 5>of course it can't become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just like,</v>

623
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 5>I thought he had to describe them quick </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the chicken,</v>

624
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 4>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get if you got them</v>

625
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.100
<v Speaker 5>early,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you sat on them then you're going</v>

626
00:30:01.101 --> 00:30:01.934
<v Speaker 5>to have to take care of that God damn </v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken because it checks going to be </v>

627
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:04.684
<v Speaker 5>born.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I thought I felt you </v>

628
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.693
<v Speaker 5>like you had to eat the eggs quick </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they were just going to become </v>

629
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 5>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because in my mind,</v>

630
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.023
<v Speaker 5>and this is as a dopey child,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like once something's out of the </v>

631
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's obviously,</v>

632
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 5>it's just that's how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

633
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 5>they lay their eggs and then the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>come out of the eggs.</v>

634
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 5>It's out of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It must have given birth.</v>

635
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 5>Like in my mind it has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an egg.</v>

636
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 5>It's in a shell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gave birth.</v>

637
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.510
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

638
00:30:30.511 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 5>it has to be a fertilized egg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

639
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 5>So what happens then within all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit that's in the egg,</v>

640
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 5>all that shit becomes a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little bird.</v>

641
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.183
<v Speaker 5>But birds are such hose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're so goddamn prolific that they </v>

642
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:43.204
<v Speaker 5>drop an egg every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I might have birds that I have </v>

643
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:48.400
<v Speaker 5>chickens to drop an egg every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means everyday they,</v>

644
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 5>they want to be shitting out a baby.</v>

645
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:51.643
<v Speaker 4>As your cholesterol or anything gone up </v>
<v Speaker 4>since he got these chickens is a </v>

646
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.670
<v Speaker 4>gigantic myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dietary cholesterol</v>

647
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.540
<v Speaker 5>strong according to the most recent </v>
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>

648
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.540
<v Speaker 5>according to people that are way smarter</v>
<v Speaker 5>than me.</v>

649
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I know there's some disputes on this</v>

650
00:31:07.941 --> 00:31:08.774
<v Speaker 5>amongst people that are plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that believe that you can get </v>

651
00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 5>everything that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

652
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:17.550
<v Speaker 5>you need from vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

653
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 5>I think dietary cholesterol is less </v>
<v Speaker 5>significant than sedentary lifestyle.</v>

654
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Less like genetics are a huge factor in </v>
<v Speaker 5>having high cholesterol.</v>

655
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 5>And then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've come to learn about ldl cholesterol</v>

656
00:31:35.271 --> 00:31:36.104
<v Speaker 5>and hdl cholesterol and that having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>higher levels of each other can balance </v>

657
00:31:40.731 --> 00:31:41.564
<v Speaker 5>each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not necessarily the level of </v>

658
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:47.810
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol they're concerned with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the type of cholesterol.</v>

659
00:31:47.811 --> 00:31:50.000
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not food,</v>

660
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.283
<v Speaker 5>it's not like dietary cholesterol is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually important for developing </v>

661
00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:58.430
<v Speaker 5>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually an important factor in,</v>

662
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.120
<v Speaker 5>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body having the proper nutrients to</v>

663
00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:05.114
<v Speaker 5>rebuild itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like dietary cholesterol is actually </v>

664
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:09.260
<v Speaker 5>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been fucked.</v>

665
00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.573
<v Speaker 5>We've been fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been fucked by these food </v>

666
00:32:12.441 --> 00:32:13.274
<v Speaker 5>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was an article today from Arab </v>

667
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:15.923
<v Speaker 5>Technica and how do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ars Technica where they were talking </v>

668

<v Speaker 5>about the sugar industry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Soda Industry,</v>

669
00:32:21.681 --> 00:32:26.570

<v Speaker 5>negative health effects of sugar,</v>

670
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.090
<v Speaker 5>of sugar in these sodas.</v>

671
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.090
<v Speaker 4>W when we forget this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this were created as a desert.</v>

672
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.920
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to drink it as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>beverage.</v>

673
00:32:33.921 --> 00:32:34.754
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

674
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was supposed to be like,</v>

675
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.003
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after dinner maybe we can all split a </v>

676
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 4>coca cola.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Soda is</v>

<v Speaker 1>in Americans.</v>

678

<v Speaker 1>Fat Top Producers Back 90 six national </v>

<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

680
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.920
<v Speaker 4>And now I switched to Arnold Palmer's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few years ago,</v>

681

682
00:32:59.081 --> 00:33:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Arnold Palmer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

683
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's better though,</v>

684
00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.930
<v Speaker 4>because the sugar of the lemonade</v>

685
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040
<v Speaker 1>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

686
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.650
<v Speaker 1>it's prob half a glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

687
00:33:07.651 --> 00:33:10.140
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many grams,</v>

688
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really you would think there's some,</v>

689
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a new soda that they sweetened </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Stevia.</v>

690
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if it's any good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gross.</v>

691
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody was drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very health conscious.</v>

692
00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:22.980
<v Speaker 1>The other day I looked at them drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

693
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.610
<v Speaker 4>I tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it,</v>

694
00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.444

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

698

699
00:33:37.201 --> 00:33:40.480
<v Speaker 1>This is it called Xavia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate had it on his instagram page.</v>

700
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

701
00:33:42.551 --> 00:33:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I like Stevie and coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

702
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.320

<v Speaker 1>different than sugar,</v>

703
00:33:47.321 --> 00:33:49.960
<v Speaker 1>but at least I know it's not fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

704
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.943
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starbucks just finally got Stevia and </v>

705
00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:55.180

<v Speaker 1>There he goes.</v>

706
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

707
00:33:57.911 --> 00:33:58.721
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know nate,</v>

708
00:33:58.721 --> 00:34:01.570
<v Speaker 1>nate is super health conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He eats real clean.</v>

709
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.663
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

710
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.660
<v Speaker 1>once they really got deep into like </v>
<v Speaker 1>triathlons and stuff like that,</v>

711
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.370
<v Speaker 1>that's when they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

712
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Nick was the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really met a bunch of people that ate</v>

713
00:34:13.091 --> 00:34:13.924
<v Speaker 1>really clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these racers and then you realize </v>

714
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:17.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

715
00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:18.460
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like organic foods,</v>

716
00:34:18.461 --> 00:34:19.630
<v Speaker 1>way better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

717
00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:19.981
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

718
00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:20.850
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

719
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.460
<v Speaker 1>don't eat pastas and breads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

720
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I think he cut out everything except for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

721
00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like no land animals he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing for awhile.</v>

722
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:36.220
<v Speaker 1>But he might even be full vegan now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother's gone back and forth.</v>

723
00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they take in fish and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were eating eggs.</v>

724
00:34:39.731 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields eat eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

725
00:34:41.501 --> 00:34:42.334
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of those guys hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they have a real similar </v>

726
00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:48.340
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

727
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.740
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

728
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.890
<v Speaker 1>if they're drinking something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that cvs shit guarantee.</v>

729
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:56.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve is just not bad for you.</v>

730
00:34:56.951 --> 00:34:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

731
00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen any negative effects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve.</v>

732
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I thought there was that because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember I was really big in the Stevia.</v>

733
00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:05.820
<v Speaker 4>And then there was an article that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out about something that I was like,</v>

734
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.140
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going back to sugar.</v>

735
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.033
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sick of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My only sugar that I really take now is </v>

736
00:35:11.341 --> 00:35:12.174
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get some sugar in my ice coffee </v>

737
00:35:13.231 --> 00:35:16.080
<v Speaker 4>instead of putting sweeteners in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just put it in your.</v>

738
00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:17.910
<v Speaker 4>So you get an unsweetened and dump it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

739
00:35:17.911 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a little bit man.</v>

740
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.520
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know how bad that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've cut down starbucks now.</v>

741
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I used to do it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of these every day.</v>

742
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it like twice a week.</v>

743
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:27.963
<v Speaker 1>I think they're saying more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's just not good unless it's in </v>

744
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:38.041
<v Speaker 1>the food naturally like sugar and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's connected to all the fiber</v>

745
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 5>and all the vitamins and nutrients in </v>
<v Speaker 5>like an like an orange or something like</v>

746
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>

747
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.873
<v Speaker 5>there's some juicy oranges that you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are probably better than any </v>

748
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:48.084
<v Speaker 5>dessert you ever have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but isn't there like a factor in </v>

749
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:53.970
<v Speaker 5>desserts that you know you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be eating that shit.</v>

750
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.473
<v Speaker 2>They know the thing I missed the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's hard to get out here in </v>

751
00:35:59.411 --> 00:36:01.630
<v Speaker 2>California or at least I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you go to like a,</v>

752
00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 2>like a market or like a outdoor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When those is a peach or,</v>

753
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.730
<v Speaker 2>or a nectarine or a plum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually nice.</v>

754
00:36:09.731 --> 00:36:10.564
<v Speaker 2>And were you in Ohio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just bite these humongous </v>

755
00:36:13.181 --> 00:36:15.310
<v Speaker 2>peaches and they just melt in your mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>out here.</v>

756
00:36:15.311 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>They're like hard as a rock and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might,</v>

757
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you just have to kind of wait for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get like mushy one day and go,</v>

758
00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's mushy.</v>

759
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Mushy is not the same as</v>

760
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 5>catch them and season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

761
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:26.881
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

762
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:27.714
<v Speaker 5>it's dry as fuck out here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet a lot of like fruit trees and </v>

763
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:32.390
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're good.</v>

764
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.440
<v Speaker 5>We're good for almonds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

765
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 5>This is what California is good for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almonds.</v>

766
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's some shit I found out.</v>

767
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:40.763
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I was at the home ranch that to </v>

768
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:46.290
<v Speaker 5>hone ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have pistachio trees,</v>

769
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.710
<v Speaker 5>but they graphed the pistachio leaves </v>
<v Speaker 5>and branches onto another sturdier tree,</v>

770
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 5>like an avocado.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

771
00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.320
<v Speaker 5>And so you've got like a pistachio tree </v>
<v Speaker 5>growing out of an avocado tree.</v>

772
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the dude was telling me,</v>

773
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:03.420
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

774
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 5>They can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you know they could do that?</v>

775
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.603
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do a lot of things like that in </v>

776
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:10.170
<v Speaker 2>farming nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

777
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.670
<v Speaker 5>how did I not know that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I knew about grafting,</v>

778
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.713
<v Speaker 5>like limbs onto other plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would've thought it was the same </v>

779
00:37:17.871 --> 00:37:18.704
<v Speaker 5>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you would graft your tomato branch </v>

780
00:37:20.751 --> 00:37:23.960
<v Speaker 5>onto another tomato.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck man?</v>

781
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.823
<v Speaker 5>How do they do that?</v>

782
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>

783
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

784
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I would say they probably like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this Jamie hand drawn diagram?</v>

785
00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:37.670
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it says right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like figure one cut.</v>

786
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.833
<v Speaker 2>You know what this looks like whenever </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes get abducted by aliens and then </v>

787
00:37:41.601 --> 00:37:42.950
<v Speaker 2>they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it like?</v>

788
00:37:42.951 --> 00:37:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me draw it for you.</v>

789
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 1>This is the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one I come to,</v>

790
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one,</v>

791
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the table said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

792
00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:50.371
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

793
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:50.731
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

794
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:51.450
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back.</v>

795
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the second one that's </v>

796
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.173
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to vibrate and then the alien </v>

797
00:37:56.071 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 1>comes in from overhead and now all I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see was his head and the lights in</v>

798
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:04.500
<v Speaker 1>the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then an examining machine came down,</v>

799
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.620
<v Speaker 1>see the Arrow down into exactly what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

800
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:11.880
<v Speaker 1>And then I became one with the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

801
00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:16.410
<v Speaker 1>There's the alien and then the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reaches the next level,</v>

802
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.720
<v Speaker 1>the next level of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I see.</v>

803
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I say Dick and a butthole and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting probed on that last one.</v>

804
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a Dick if you.</v>

805
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Dick looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>

806
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite sure with Dick it's a,</v>

807
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a nail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tea cup o' tea cut stem.</v>

808
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>And then they're implanting.</v>

809
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It says a bud gets implanted in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

810
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Then the bud grows into out of the stem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

811
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.320
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

812
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 3>they implant the button there and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they cut it.</v>

813
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is cutting the bud.</v>

814
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to do some other pictures </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could kind of see that.</v>

815
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.640
<v Speaker 3>But like this is a little more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre.</v>

816
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.713
<v Speaker 3>Is that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make a tree grow inside another </v>

817
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:57.394
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that they can frank and </v>

818
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 3>tree but I should've known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

819
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Because it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they,</v>

820
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.833
<v Speaker 3>did they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about the drought and like how </v>

821
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 3>pistachios are supposedly going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>double in price in the next year because</v>

822
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:13.354
<v Speaker 3>we had such a drought this year and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess pistachios are just about to go </v>

823
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sky High.</v>

824
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:18.304
<v Speaker 3>So by now I know that's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>point and I know it's important for </v>

825
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:27.511
<v Speaker 3>agriculture in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to go get it.</v>

826
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.963
<v Speaker 3>Cause smog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you fuck what if you buy a bag a day </v>

827
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.021
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

828
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:38.980

<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked.</v>

829
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:39.903
<v Speaker 3>It's also a good of how much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What percentage of your fucking budget </v>

830
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:47.581
<v Speaker 3>goes to pistachios ever in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you had to even consume a moment</v>

831
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 3>of your time thinking about this as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

832
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Like what about the stock price is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

833
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.303
<v Speaker 3>Like I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your favorite three things that </v>

834
00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:57.741
<v Speaker 3>you buy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

835
00:39:57.741 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 3>if I gave you an opportunity to give up </v>
<v Speaker 3>pistachios for the rest of your life,</v>

836
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 3>do you think you would struggle now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be no issue.</v>

837
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Go Mad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm interesting.</v>

839
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Complex flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

840
00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:13.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean there'd be no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat peanuts,</v>

841
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like cashews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm down with cashews.</v>

842
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you buy walnuts?</v>

843
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Like full walnuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I tried to buy like walnuts,</v>

844
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:23.014
<v Speaker 3>not like chopped up walnuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm talking about the ones in </v>

845
00:40:25.031 --> 00:40:26.970
<v Speaker 3>the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You crack on with this stupid crackers.</v>

846
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Good question.</v>

847
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:29.710

848
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.930
<v Speaker 3>They don't have walnuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walnuts.</v>

849
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a fuck about Walmart's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

850
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.180
<v Speaker 3>People realize like mixed nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walnuts give me that almond motherfucker</v>

851
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 3>to crack that.</v>

852
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

853
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:46.120
<v Speaker 3>like how many people buy nutcrackers </v>
<v Speaker 3>these days?</v>

854
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:50.650
<v Speaker 3>If you're not cracking clause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lobster claws or crab claws.</v>

855
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not buying a fucking nut.</v>

856
00:40:52.681 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Cracker was the last time he cracked a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nut.</v>

857
00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Cracking any nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a netcracker collection at home.</v>

858
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.950
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just leave in Ohio.</v>

859
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.260
<v Speaker 3>Just like the dance one where you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to handle that?</v>

860
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are real.</v>

861
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the nutcracker.</v>

862
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.320
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always like,</v>

863
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 3>why they call it the nutcracker when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a bunch of wooden toys.</v>

864
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Like why is that the nutcracker?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And realized,</v>

865
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are actual nutcrackers.</v>

866
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

867
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.660
<v Speaker 3>we cracked on notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't just go and buy Aum.</v>

868
00:41:26.661 --> 00:41:31.661
<v Speaker 3>Aum shilled and packaged by Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also had a box of wooden ducks.</v>

869
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.883
<v Speaker 3>Remember when that was a popular thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you'd have like a stupid people </v>

870
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:40.360
<v Speaker 3>will when we were kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here have a wooden fucking dumped.</v>

871
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.130
<v Speaker 3>You're too stupid to play with anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that moves you.</v>

872
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take this fucking wouldn't duck and</v>

873
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:49.780
<v Speaker 3>pretend it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

874
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Have duck fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit.</v>

875
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm over here starving to death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was duck.</v>

876
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 3>There was something that was ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic like that,</v>

877
00:41:57.561 --> 00:41:58.394
<v Speaker 3>the green head and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was ones that we were </v>

878
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:01.220
<v Speaker 3>just all brown that weren't painted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

879
00:42:01.221 --> 00:42:04.250
<v Speaker 3>but I have like 20 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

880
00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Did you got wooden ducks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

881
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.653
<v Speaker 3>the role or wants a baby?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I'm talking about </v>

882
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:14.080
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that a thing or is that just an arm?</v>

883
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.983
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a stupid redneck thing or </v>

884
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:17.924
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's like wouldn't stupid </v>

885
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 3>wooden toys it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was a boy,</v>

886
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the argument though,</v>

887
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:24.643
<v Speaker 5>is the argument that it gave us more </v>
<v Speaker 5>room for creativity when we were kids </v>

888
00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.450
<v Speaker 5>because we're playing with these stupid </v>
<v Speaker 5>toys that really didn't do much,</v>

889
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:33.284
<v Speaker 5>so we had to do it all in our own head </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of being overwhelmed by a video </v>

890
00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:38.210
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

891
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.130
<v Speaker 5>That.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

892
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

893
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.030
<v Speaker 5>that's a decoy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>

894
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 5>That's actually like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a well done decoy.</v>

895
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Like what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They use those when they hunt ducks,</v>

896
00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 5>they put that shit in the water.</v>

897
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this had like a.</v>

898
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.983
<v Speaker 3>well maybe they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this had like real feathers and </v>

899
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.143
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that misstep.</v>

900
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.800
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd put it on your fireplace.</v>

901
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

902
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 3>so that's because people use them for </v>
<v Speaker 3>decoration.</v>

903
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.571
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

904
00:43:01.571 --> 00:43:03.130
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are beautiful.</v>

905
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 5>What they started out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

906
00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.093
<v Speaker 5>when you call it a decoy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just because it's the exact same </v>

907
00:43:09.101 --> 00:43:11.920
<v Speaker 5>shape as a decoy might not ever see the </v>
<v Speaker 5>water,</v>

908
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.173
<v Speaker 5>but what those were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Originally it was people trying to make </v>

909
00:43:15.881 --> 00:43:16.714
<v Speaker 5>ducks that looked exactly like a duck so</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could float it on the pond and the </v>

910
00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 5>ducks would fly over and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

911
00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:23.380
<v Speaker 5>these ducks are just hanging out here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a cool spot.</v>

912
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.410
<v Speaker 5>And they land and you blast them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

913
00:43:26.411 --> 00:43:27.244
<v Speaker 5>that's a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dynasty is all about that as a show and </v>

914
00:43:29.381 --> 00:43:34.381
<v Speaker 5>an empire built on duck slaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trickery and fuckery.</v>

915
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:35.913
<v Speaker 5>That's what they should rename duck </v>
<v Speaker 5>dynasty trickery and fuckery because </v>

916
00:43:38.921 --> 00:43:41.290
<v Speaker 5>they're tricking those ducks and is </v>
<v Speaker 5>blowing them out of the sky.</v>

917
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:44.380
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people got really good at it,</v>

918
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.960
<v Speaker 5>they started doing as art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some of them are just art,</v>

919
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:51.430
<v Speaker 5>like people like grandma type people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have on their mantle piece.</v>

920
00:43:51.431 --> 00:43:53.830
<v Speaker 5>And I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love this.</v>

921
00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:56.500
<v Speaker 5>I Love What it represents to pee in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fall.</v>

922
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of them if you want it.</v>

923
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

924
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because my mom is like,</v>

925

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.830
<v Speaker 3>I want to throw away all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

927
00:44:09.831 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a basement.</v>

<v Speaker 3>why bother throwing it away?</v>

929
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need more room,</v>

930
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you barely even go in your </v>

931

<v Speaker 3>basement and she's just telling me all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit that I have there that </v>

932
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 3>completely forgot.</v>

935
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.680
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you hang onto that laser disc,</v>

936
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:31.763
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'll be one day like that Tuba </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a needle on it that you dropped </v>

937
00:44:34.641 --> 00:44:36.390
<v Speaker 3>down on the records,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

938
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.760

<v Speaker 3>If you had one of those,</v>

939
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 3>if you had one of those old school like </v>

<v Speaker 3>electrical.</v>

943
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.744
<v Speaker 3>You turn the handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so the record player with the </v>

946
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:56.423
<v Speaker 3>like the needle was attached to like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that looked like a musical </v>

957
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:18.444
<v Speaker 3>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of those things where you </v>

958
00:45:19.301 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 3>go back to like the history of stuff and</v>

966
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But God,</v>

967
00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 3>that'd be so valuable if you had that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your house.</v>

968
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Like if you had that in your mom's house</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

969
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.823
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've fished that out one day and be </v>

970
00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>if it's an edison on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

972
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.060
<v Speaker 3>that laser disk recorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As goofy as it seems now,</v>

973
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.580
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna come a time where it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>goofy anymore.</v>

974
00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's going to make a comeback </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be like watching.</v>

975
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make a comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be interesting.</v>

976
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

977
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:04.674
<v Speaker 3>look at this fucking thing from 1999 </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they had these silver discs </v>

978
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:11.693
<v Speaker 3>earlier this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>July the last few car got made right </v>

979
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.203
<v Speaker 3>until they've started making them again </v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone's going to realize that </v>

980
00:46:16.621 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 3>can make a shitload of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no weird.</v>

981
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 3>About five years ago I bought a VCR just</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

982
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:23.184
<v Speaker 3>you know what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is on its way out and I have tons </v>

983
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 3>of vhs tapes so I'm just going to buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>$29 on Amazon.</v>

984
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 3>So I bought one and it's so light </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowadays.</v>

985
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.470
<v Speaker 3>The technology is so basic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you could just pick,</v>

986
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 3>pick on like one finger easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

987
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous how light it is.</v>

988
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.593
<v Speaker 3>It feels cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only one on Amazon now costs a 180 </v>

989
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:42.930
<v Speaker 3>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

990
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a DVD player,</v>

991
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.060
<v Speaker 3>you got to get one of those both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

992
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe it's telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the other one that dvr now?</v>

993
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:54.003
<v Speaker 3>Just like what is the price?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a good price for like a vhs </v>

994
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:00.180
<v Speaker 3>player?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be like 50,</v>

995
00:47:00.181 --> 00:47:03.510
<v Speaker 3>$60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got down to like 29 to $39,</v>

996
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.980
<v Speaker 3>but look at these companies that make </v>
<v Speaker 3>them like,</v>

997
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 3>who I've heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you hear about that thing that they </v>

999
00:47:12.691 --> 00:47:13.524
<v Speaker 3>were doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been paying more attention to this </v>

1000
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:15.384
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out what a lot of </v>

1001
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 3>this was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a story,</v>

1002
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>al Qaeda videos and faked like isis </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

1005
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.490
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was this documentary about this.</v>

1006
00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:34.324
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not a documentary but this video </v>

1007
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:40.120
<v Speaker 5>online about the company that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in making these things.</v>

1008
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1009
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come in for a meeting like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're going to Iraq.</v>

1012
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.230
<v Speaker 5>They fucking ship this guy off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a really interesting,</v>

1013
00:47:50.231 --> 00:47:51.064
<v Speaker 5>like this guy talking about being </v>
<v Speaker 5>recruited to create these propaganda </v>

1014
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 5>films for the US government and what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were was seat.</v>

1015
00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.470
<v Speaker 5>Everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1016
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 5>the US government's line to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1017
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:01.684
<v Speaker 5>definitely not good to have these videos</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we think are al Qaeda but are </v>

1018
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:06.634
<v Speaker 5>actually CIA that are or whoever it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's doing these things as propaganda </v>

1019
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.003
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what's interesting is what they did </v>

1020
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.700
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a,</v>

1021
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:18.180
<v Speaker 5>there was a thing called realplayer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Remember Real player?</v>

1022
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.013
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.030
<v Speaker 5>They only streamed it through real </v>
<v Speaker 5>player so people would go to it,</v>

1024
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:23.123
<v Speaker 5>they would stream it and it would get </v>
<v Speaker 5>their Ip and they would know where they </v>

1025
00:48:25.001 --> 00:48:25.834
<v Speaker 5>were and so they would know where people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who were all grouping up in these like </v>

1026
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 5>radical factions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>radical groups,</v>

1027
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.513
<v Speaker 5>and they would be able to isolate them </v>
<v Speaker 5>to a certain extent because of that or </v>

1028
00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 5>at least isolate their location,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1029
00:48:42.551 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but which is really interesting.</v>

1030
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:46.084
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting because that's </v>

1031
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:49.203
<v Speaker 5>another thing that someone was telling </v>
<v Speaker 5>me and this I had never considered this </v>

1032
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.120
<v Speaker 5>fucking who fucking said this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it's on the message board,</v>

1033
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 5>but they were talking about all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>different factions that were sort of put</v>

1034
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:00.334
<v Speaker 5>together to become isis and that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>weren't even really necessarily against </v>

1035
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.030
<v Speaker 5>or together with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1036
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 5>there was Boko Haram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the Taliban,</v>

1037
00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 5>al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's ice,</v>

1038
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.293
<v Speaker 5>there's all these different people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they just sort of lump all these </v>

1039
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:18.940
<v Speaker 5>groups in together like we're fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>those fuckers everybody.</v>

1040
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 5>And we think of him as an organized </v>
<v Speaker 5>group,</v>

1041
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.670
<v Speaker 5>like they got together and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

1042
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:25.943
<v Speaker 5>we've got to get together and organize a</v>
<v Speaker 5>group and put together our powers and </v>

1043
00:49:28.721 --> 00:49:29.270
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't.</v>

1044
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.000
<v Speaker 5>They basically on each other sides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the whole,</v>

1045
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.863
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a giant group of people that don't </v>

1046
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:40.261
<v Speaker 5>like us foreign policy and we sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>call them whatever we want to call them.</v>

1047
00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:41.893
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are isis and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>are al Qaeda and some of them are </v>

1048
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.690
<v Speaker 5>Taliban and some of them are what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>used to be the Mujahideen.</v>

1049
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1050
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch the debates?</v>

1051
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.570
<v Speaker 2>The funniest thing on twitter is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag Muslims reporting.</v>

1052
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever trump says,</v>

1053
00:49:58.461 --> 00:49:59.294
<v Speaker 2>like the Muslims need to report things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a Hashtag of just Muslims </v>

1054
00:50:02.781 --> 00:50:05.040
<v Speaker 2>reporting things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>

1055
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.250
<v Speaker 2>But it's all shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1056
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>like a fart in a little poop came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and listened to recordings.</v>

1057
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1058
00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.110
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or so they just took over that Hashtag.</v>

1059
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually made it because it is </v>

1060
00:50:17.661 --> 00:50:20.660
<v Speaker 2>pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when he said that.</v>

1061
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:23.590
<v Speaker 2>So now they're just taking advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to make it funny and it's.</v>

1062
00:50:23.591 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious to Rio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Muslim report stuff.</v>

1063
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag</v>

1064
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even seem real.</v>

1065
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 5>It really doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm watched the debate and I was like,</v>

1066
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:35.714
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so strange to watch that this is </v>

1067
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.134
<v Speaker 5>their choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is our choice of who gets to be </v>

1068
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:42.720
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1069
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.930
<v Speaker 5>how did we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened here?</v>

1070
00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I got really freaked out when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hovering over,</v>

1071
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:50.170
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what triggered something in</v>

1072
00:50:50.171 --> 00:50:50.460
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>

1073
00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:50.780
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

1074
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.380
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from her later taught.</v>

1075
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Big powerful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:58.350
<v Speaker 5>He's a big looming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful,</v>

1077
00:50:58.351 --> 00:51:01.020
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rich man.</v>

1078
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:03.630
<v Speaker 5>Scares off everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1079
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.550
<v Speaker 5>I Kim hovering over her and that debate </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just.</v>

1080
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.940
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really bizarre what</v>

1081
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:14.160
<v Speaker 2>talking to people that watch the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>program as you with completely different</v>

1082
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.033
<v Speaker 2>hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in fights with family members over </v>

1083
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:18.780
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you not?</v>

1084
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.440
<v Speaker 5>What I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been tuning the Fox News nonstop.</v>

1085
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.333
<v Speaker 5>That's all been watching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so interesting to see how people </v>

1086
00:51:27.841 --> 00:51:30.300
<v Speaker 5>just fucking form teams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1087
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:35.420
<v Speaker 5>they just form teams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go right or they go left,</v>

1088
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.103
<v Speaker 5>but they form a team and then they write</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit that doesn't necessarily make </v>

1089
00:51:40.951 --> 00:51:41.784
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it fits within the narrative of </v>

1090
00:51:43.621 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 5>their team winning and they duke it out </v>
<v Speaker 5>back and forth with each other.</v>

1091
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:47.714
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of people that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking with big smiles about how great </v>

1092
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.750
<v Speaker 5>trump came away from that debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had one good line.</v>

1093
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:56.580
<v Speaker 5>You'd be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1094
00:51:56.581 --> 00:51:57.570
<v Speaker 5>that was a good line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1095
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.230
<v Speaker 5>because you'd be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a good line.</v>

1096
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:02.123
<v Speaker 5>He got her there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was a fucking nice quick </v>

1097
00:52:03.931 --> 00:52:05.160
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got,</v>

1098
00:52:05.161 --> 00:52:06.300
<v Speaker 5>ain't got out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom,</v>

1099
00:52:06.301 --> 00:52:07.230
<v Speaker 5>knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blow.</v>

1100
00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:10.530
<v Speaker 5>But the debate itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1101
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And then when he kept on saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1102
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:14.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's uh,</v>

1103
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 2>she did her time interrupting while </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupting.</v>

1104
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 2>He interrupted more and took more time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer questions.</v>

1105
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.420
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what road is,</v>

1106
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 2>is he living in a strange guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics.</v>

1107
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I hate both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1108
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.940
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting seeing how </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery bill,</v>

1109
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for billy Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think,</v>

1110
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot's going to come out on him</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that he's under the microscope.</v>

1111
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does there have to be moderators?</v>

1112
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.160
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't it be better to watch the two </v>
<v Speaker 5>of them sit down and talk?</v>

1113
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:48.330
<v Speaker 5>This is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</v>

1114
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.370
<v Speaker 5>Sit them in a room together across a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice table like this.</v>

1115
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.190
<v Speaker 5>Put a camera on the bolt them and let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let them have a conversation.</v>

1116
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.790
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out what they're really all </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

1117
00:52:58.590 --> 00:52:59.423
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because everyone's doing their </v>

1118
00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:04.360
<v Speaker 5>broadcasting to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's broadcasting to you,</v>

1119
00:53:04.361 --> 00:53:06.070
<v Speaker 5>including me right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is very ironic,</v>

1120
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:07.600
<v Speaker 5>but everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're doing.</v>

1121
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:08.463
<v Speaker 5>They're broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't just think Donald Trump would </v>

1122
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.750
<v Speaker 5>overpower for her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she can't even talk as you will learn</v>

1123
00:53:13.751 --> 00:53:15.170
<v Speaker 5>a lot about him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he does that well,</v>

1124
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.370
<v Speaker 5>we'll learn a lot about him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he does that and I bet she'll be able</v>

1125
00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:20.680
<v Speaker 5>to manipulate that and make him look </v>
<v Speaker 5>really bad.</v>

1126
00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you get them together,</v>

1127
00:53:23.561 --> 00:53:26.300
<v Speaker 5>the moderators asking him to answer </v>
<v Speaker 5>questions,</v>

1128
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 5>telling her the time is up and all this </v>
<v Speaker 5>different jazz.</v>

1129
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 5>That's an added element.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why am I not talking to her?</v>

1130
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.391
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

1131
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:34.060
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1132
00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm not there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1133
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why doesn't he talk to her?</v>

1134
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out what they think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

1135
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 5>Let's let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let them.</v>

1136
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.733
<v Speaker 5>Why I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are you going to do it better than </v>

1137
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:42.330
<v Speaker 5>me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me.</v>

1138
00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.613
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why does it have to be fucking bitter </v>

1139
00:53:46.731 --> 00:53:51.530
<v Speaker 5>dire enemies every time to people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>running for the same position kit.</v>

1140
00:53:51.531 --> 00:53:53.930
<v Speaker 5>They've recognized that without </v>
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>

1141
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.033
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is allegedly not the best we can </v>

1142
00:53:57.021 --> 00:53:57.854
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1143
00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.270
<v Speaker 5>I think most people think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1144
00:53:59.271 --> 00:54:00.104
<v Speaker 5>we probably could find a few scientists </v>
<v Speaker 5>or doctors or whatever that might do a </v>

1145
00:54:02.541 --> 00:54:04.250
<v Speaker 5>better job in those two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Running the country,</v>

1146
00:54:04.251 --> 00:54:06.530
<v Speaker 5>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just put that aside.</v>

1147
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.270
<v Speaker 5>It's not the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think is the best?</v>

1148
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:12.973
<v Speaker 5>There's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1149
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:13.873
<v Speaker 5>No Way.</v>

1150
00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:17.383
<v Speaker 7>Why don't</v>

1151
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:21.080
<v Speaker 5>just doesn't seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even discussing it.</v>

1152
00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:22.690
<v Speaker 5>I like lose my train of thought because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1153
00:54:22.691 --> 00:54:25.160
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe we're actually sitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>here talking about this,</v>

1154
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:29.350
<v Speaker 5>but whatever people do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1155
00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:34.590
<v Speaker 5>they get on a team and they fucking wave</v>
<v Speaker 5>that flag and it's the team of the right</v>

1156
00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:35.844
<v Speaker 5>of the team of the left is a few people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that sort of dangling between the </v>

1157
00:54:38.021 --> 00:54:38.854
<v Speaker 5>middles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like if you had big giant piles of </v>

1158
00:54:40.511 --> 00:54:41.344
<v Speaker 5>ants and then there was like a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>trail in between those piles of ants </v>

1159
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.250
<v Speaker 5>that was like kinda thinned out and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1160
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.113
<v Speaker 5>the pile would be on the lefthand side </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the pile of being the right hand </v>

1161
00:54:51.431 --> 00:54:52.264
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few people that are in the </v>

1162
00:54:53.291 --> 00:54:54.124
<v Speaker 5>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few people that are walking </v>

1163
00:54:54.971 --> 00:54:57.490
<v Speaker 5>back and forth in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know which way to go,</v>

1164
00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:02.080
<v Speaker 5>but the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they kill a fucking pile and they decide</v>

1165
00:55:02.081 --> 00:55:04.480
<v Speaker 5>fucking circular movement or they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1166
00:55:04.481 --> 00:55:07.720
<v Speaker 5>they decide whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever they decide,</v>

1167
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fourth amendment,</v>

1168
00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:10.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom of speech,</v>

1169
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:12.550
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is they ride with.</v>

1170
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just gender rights.</v>

1173

<v Speaker 3>happens again in 20,</v>

00:55:27.901 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 3>versus trump in 2020.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be worse.</v>

1176

<v Speaker 3>He could win.</v>

1178
00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I can you imagine having years of Kanye </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump shit.</v>

1179
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.870

<v Speaker 3>I would throw my tv out.</v>

1181
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Could have a new election every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You keep winning.</v>

1182
00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Just so people could say president </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kanye.</v>

<v Speaker 5>A hundred percent.</v>

1190
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.370
<v Speaker 5>A guy named wiener can't stop showing </v>

1198
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.120

<v Speaker 6>flag on the ground.</v>

1199
00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Corey Feldman looses his damn mind again</v>
<v Speaker 3>with another today.</v>

1200
00:56:43.291 --> 00:56:43.981
<v Speaker 3>Performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1201
00:56:43.981 --> 00:56:45.840
<v Speaker 3>hey man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how he staying relevant.</v>

1202
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.600
<v Speaker 3>He banned me off twitter after I talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him.</v>

1203
00:56:48.601 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Last time we talked about him on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blocked you.</v>

1204
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:53.010
<v Speaker 3>You blocked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he block you?</v>

1205
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Corey Feldman's twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>page ever,</v>

1206
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.280
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure he's a good guy.</v>

1207
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one.</v>

1208
00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving him out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1209
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Saying he's just being super outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to get attention.</v>

1210
00:57:06.421 --> 00:57:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It's smart because otherwise they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to pay attention.</v>

1211
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard for a guy that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>in movies and had a lot of shit going on</v>

1212
00:57:13.411 --> 00:57:16.620
<v Speaker 3>that it all kind of goes away and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to do it himself.</v>

1213
00:57:16.621 --> 00:57:21.000
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to figure out some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some way to stay in entertainer.</v>

1214
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:22.590
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with it.</v>

1215
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.840
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doing weird stuff,</v>

1216
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.920
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get.</v>

1217
00:57:25.921 --> 00:57:26.754
<v Speaker 3>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about him because he's </v>

1218
00:57:27.451 --> 00:57:29.970
<v Speaker 3>doing weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does questionable things though,</v>

1219
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:32.190
<v Speaker 3>that it's on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird,</v>

1220
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.490
<v Speaker 3>but think he's just a weird dude and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of art he likes to make.</v>

1221
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:41.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole feldman angel thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>really is gross and creepy and awful,</v>

1222
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.260
<v Speaker 3>so I think he's just talented and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks he is talented.</v>

1223
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Like he's in denial.</v>

1224
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Could be a grand Andy Kaufman </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements could be.</v>

1225
00:57:54.421 --> 00:57:55.254
<v Speaker 3>But if you've watched any ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnitudes the album cover for his </v>

1226
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:01.070
<v Speaker 3>double disc that he's releasing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jello to the core.</v>

1227
00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:04.830
<v Speaker 3>He hates rock on Corey Feldman on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1228
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.233

<v Speaker 3>They are racer tool around some fun </v>

1229
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.930
<v Speaker 3>crop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he likes,</v>

1230
00:58:09.931 --> 00:58:12.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at a party.</v>

1231
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.333
<v Speaker 3>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he know he sells like $20 videos or </v>

1232
00:58:17.011 --> 00:58:18.540
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you pay him,</v>

1233
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:20.220
<v Speaker 3>pay him 20 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll be like,</v>

1234
00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.173
<v Speaker 3>he'll read something for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he does it in characters like when </v>

1235
00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:26.700
<v Speaker 3>he was in lost boys who has the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket on and stuff like that.</v>

1236
00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.210
<v Speaker 3>So Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget what's comic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

1239
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:38.303
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably a smart way to make </v>

1240
00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:40.554
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he can turn out fucking dozens of </v>

1241
00:58:42.541 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 3>those an hour.</v>

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.010
<v Speaker 3>if he's just doing that.</v>

1243
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 6>That just reminded me of the story I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>been hearing recently.</v>

1244
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.360
<v Speaker 6>You know all the comic con convention is</v>
<v Speaker 6>others,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

1246
00:58:53.171 --> 00:58:54.004
<v Speaker 6>There are multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're all over the country and they </v>

1247
00:58:55.721 --> 00:58:59.440
<v Speaker 6>have a old TV stars come in to beyond </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

1248
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:00.963
<v Speaker 6>They're making.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I heard hundreds of thousands of </v>

1249
00:59:03.461 --> 00:59:08.461
<v Speaker 6>dollars per convention leaving with cash</v>
<v Speaker 6>and bags because they're.</v>

1250
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 6>It's 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's at least 20 bucks a photo if not 40</v>

1251
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:13.534
<v Speaker 6>or 50 or 80.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're signing them and it's a deal </v>

1252
00:59:15.911 --> 00:59:16.744
<v Speaker 6>they're making with the photographer </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's taken the photo and the </v>

1253
00:59:18.341 --> 00:59:19.174
<v Speaker 6>convention and then the person who's who</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the actual star gets the rest of it </v>

1254
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.010
<v Speaker 6>and they're making a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like really old people making.</v>

1255
00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.083
<v Speaker 6>I forget it.</v>

1256
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:28.603
<v Speaker 3>I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said this before on the podcast </v>

1257
00:59:30.751 --> 00:59:31.584
<v Speaker 3>when I saw daisy duke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girl that played daisy duke and I a </v>

1258
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.650
<v Speaker 3>comic convention and she was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and Catherine Bach?</v>

1259
00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was just sitting there by herself.</v>

1260
00:59:39.061 --> 00:59:41.970
<v Speaker 3>No one knew who knew who she was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and then I'm like,</v>

1261
00:59:41.971 --> 00:59:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>daisy dukes to sitting there.</v>

1262
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:45.180
<v Speaker 3>And so I came up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1263
00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:46.380
<v Speaker 3>can I get a picture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

1264
00:59:46.381 --> 00:59:47.214
<v Speaker 3>sure it's going to be 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sounded like she was just making </v>

1265
00:59:48.961 --> 00:59:50.460
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had to use my own camera,</v>

1266
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:53.580
<v Speaker 3>but she was charging 20 bucks for to </v>

<v Speaker 2>would you ever eat one of those peppers?</v>

1326
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably try it just to see what the</v>

1327
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 5>fuss is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've had some,</v>

1328
01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:42.294
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a piece to be a place in </v>

1329
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.783
<v Speaker 5>encino called chili,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my soul and it was just like super </v>

1330

<v Speaker 5>fuck with you at all.</v>

1332
01:02:55.741 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 5>But then at the top end of the scale </v>
<v Speaker 5>they had like some himalayan death shit.</v>

1333
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:01.523
<v Speaker 5>They had some chili that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even fucking believe a person can eat </v>

<v Speaker 5>And I never even tried 10.</v>

1335
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:07.920
<v Speaker 5>They have a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently they had a 10,</v>

1336
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 5>but I did try a nine once and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they give you,</v>

1337
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.880
<v Speaker 5>this is how strong the chileans they </v>
<v Speaker 5>give it to you in like a thimble and I'm</v>

1338
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:15.714
<v Speaker 5>not fucking joking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'S like a little tiny cup that you </v>

1339
01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:20.370
<v Speaker 5>would get ketchup at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a shitty diner.</v>

1340
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 5>Those little tiny ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they give you.</v>

1341
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 5>The chili.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I put it in my mouth and immediately</v>

1342
01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:30.540
<v Speaker 5>start hiccuping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My body's like freaking out.</v>

1343
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.600
<v Speaker 5>Tears are pouring down my face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my snots porn out of my nose.</v>

1344
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.130
<v Speaker 5>And that was like a tiny little bite of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff.</v>

1345
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:39.780
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1346
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:41.400
<v Speaker 5>My whole tongue was numb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1347
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.234
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1348
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.073
<v Speaker 2>Youtube videos of like ghost peppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I highly recommend is sitting there and </v>

1349
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:46.434
<v Speaker 2>watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite shows is called hot </v>

1350
01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:49.670
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to like,</v>

1351
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:50.663
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do this show so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen it where </v>

1352
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:58.010
<v Speaker 2>this guy answered 10 questions and each </v>
<v Speaker 2>one you start off at like,</v>

1353
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.780
<v Speaker 2>like tap eto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it gets hotter,</v>

1354
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 2>each chicken wings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So each one you take a bite of a chicken</v>

1355
01:04:03.691 --> 01:04:04.524
<v Speaker 2>wing and then he will ask you a question</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it starts off to see how if you </v>

1356
01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 2>could get all the way to the end in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end it's like the hottest one.</v>

1357
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's really interesting to see who </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it and who can't.</v>

1358
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1359
01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:22.311
<v Speaker 2>like a tommy chung did it and he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there were some shenanigans,</v>

1360
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:25.020
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three he was like,</v>

1361
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:27.330
<v Speaker 2>even the tapteal when it goes well or </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is hot and he's like,</v>

1362
01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he gets to the end.</v>

1363
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:33.681
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't breaking a sweat where other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like gagging on the japanese,</v>

1364
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:36.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't handle that hot shit.</v>

1365
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:37.314
<v Speaker 2>He went for it first and like almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>started barfing heat the hot one first </v>

1366
01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and then he touched his dick with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>

1367
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got broke.</v>

1368
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Chrysler did one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes.</v>

1372
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.953

01:04:56.761 --> 01:04:58.400
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to the hot peppers.</v>

1423
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.520

<v Speaker 1>every time I've had a bad one I come out</v>

1424
01:07:23.191 --> 01:07:27.420
<v Speaker 1>of it and I realized like whatever was </v>

<v Speaker 1>that's not real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acting always going to keep digging.</v>

1430
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever hit some really harshly?</v>

01:07:50.641 --> 01:07:51.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We don't know that this,</v>

1434
01:07:52.981 --> 01:07:53.814
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the oils from the pepper or </v>

1435
01:07:55.831 --> 01:07:59.790
<v Speaker 1>transmitted in the air and they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know and that looks good.</v>

1436
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.590
<v Speaker 6>Overacting from a hillbilly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe a little bit,</v>

1437
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 6>but maybe it's trying to get used to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>knows what he's doing with that,</v>

1438
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:06.394

<v Speaker 1>smoke be right?</v>

1443

<v Speaker 1>dick,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know somebody that did it.</v>

1495
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.560
<v Speaker 2>This is say he got paid to be a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1496
01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:28.394
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to hand make a fart sound </v>

1497

<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>

1498
01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:32.570

<v Speaker 2>like daily.</v>

1499
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's on a channel that's.</v>

1500
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:35.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1502
01:10:37.961 --> 01:10:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I just hate that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I say get away with that.</v>

1503
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll say it's a scripted show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say written by or I don't know.</v>

1504
01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1505
01:10:47.561 --> 01:10:49.000
<v Speaker 1>They just hope that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1506
01:10:49.001 --> 01:10:50.830
<v Speaker 1>is it like here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1507
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that different than like see that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prank.</v>

1508
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Prank is like almost like a sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1509
01:10:58.031 --> 01:11:03.031
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a setup sketch like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bigger deception then a reality</v>

1510
01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>show where you already know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do during that day.</v>

1511
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.313
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1512
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a reality show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1513
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all</v>

1514
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 5>going to go to the football game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1515
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 5>my sons playing football.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today's is big day.</v>

1516
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 5>And all the cameras day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yay.</v>

1517
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:22.280
<v Speaker 5>Go making enriched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's like,</v>

1518
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 5>like they know that they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do that,</v>

1519
01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:28.980
<v Speaker 5>but It is at least technically like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real thing you can do.</v>

1520
01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:31.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning like they were going to do it if</v>

1521
01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the cameras were there and not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the cameras are there.</v>

1522
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.980
<v Speaker 2>So I consider that like duh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the cameras are there,</v>

1523
01:11:38.981 --> 01:11:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I've accepted this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see.</v>

1524
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 2>But it's like real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the most.</v>

1525
01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:43.540
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite shows is the profit.</v>

1526
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a lie though.</v>

1527
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:48.010
<v Speaker 5>All of it is a lie was different than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other thing is.</v>

1528
01:11:48.011 --> 01:11:49.480
<v Speaker 5>The other thing is like they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the game.</v>

1529
01:11:49.481 --> 01:11:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're cheering.</v>

1530
01:11:50.601 --> 01:11:52.580
<v Speaker 5>We're aware of the cameras were acting </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird because it.</v>

1531
01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:53.523
<v Speaker 5>But the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're pretending that you didn't know </v>

1532
01:11:55.421 --> 01:11:57.370
<v Speaker 5>that that fart sound like a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:01.830
<v Speaker 5>So like it's not really acting like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1534
01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.660
<v Speaker 5>you're being deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deceptive.</v>

1535
01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.490
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not.</v>

1536
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.940
<v Speaker 5>You guys aren't doing a sketch about a </v>
<v Speaker 5>prank show.</v>

1537
01:12:09.941 --> 01:12:10.774
<v Speaker 5>You're doing an acTual prank show zone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only one reason to watch an actual </v>

1538
01:12:14.111 --> 01:12:17.170
<v Speaker 5>prank show is to see people legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 5>get what?</v>

<v Speaker 5>People come up to people and a lot of </v>

1541
01:12:21.701 --> 01:12:22.534

<v Speaker 5>They couldn't.</v>

1558
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.293
<v Speaker 5>They had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They thought he was a guy from an mtv </v>

01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 5>show that had come to do interviews with</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's why it pisses me so off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not even.</v>

1566
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:32.723
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that drives me </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy about this network because they </v>

1567
01:13:35.851 --> 01:13:39.390
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of these shows just like that</v>

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:40.643
<v Speaker 2>But is that okay if it's good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good when you know it's fake </v>

1569
01:13:43.381 --> 01:13:44.520
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell it's fake.</v>

1570
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:45.383
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the actors are such bad actors </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't even need to know </v>

1571
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 2>somebody that's working on you.</v>

01:14:06.931 --> 01:14:09.840

1608
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:33.010
<v Speaker 6>It can't be on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't make something bad.</v>

1609
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make something bad on purpose.</v>

1610
01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:35.804
<v Speaker 1>My point being like a movie like </v>
<v Speaker 1>showgirls and there's a few other ones </v>

1611
01:15:39.651 --> 01:15:44.651
<v Speaker 1>you could go back to Texas roadhouse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways I fucking love roadhouse,</v>

1612
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb when you watch it,</v>

1613
01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes really good.</v>

1614
01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It goes away from being like Just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

1615
01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>like a just a bad ass action movie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a comedy,</v>

1616
01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:02.023
<v Speaker 1>like it really does morph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially over time because what it's </v>

1617
01:16:05.301 --> 01:16:06.021
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like something.</v>

1618
01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>You had a plant and it had to grow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as culture grew around,</v>

1619
01:16:10.491 --> 01:16:11.324
<v Speaker 1>roadhouse roadhouse is in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a time capsule because it captures </v>

1620
01:16:17.001 --> 01:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>how fucking ridiculous people were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year that it was made where you will</v>

1621
01:16:21.681 --> 01:16:22.514
<v Speaker 1>let you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see like what people accepted </v>

1622
01:16:24.111 --> 01:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see how lame the script is,</v>

1623
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:28.363
<v Speaker 1>how ridiculous the dialogue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how preposterous the fucking plot is is </v>

1624
01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:34.184
<v Speaker 1>a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been screwing this town over and </v>

1625
01:16:35.811 --> 01:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have keeps drilling them over like,</v>

1626
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.293
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been screwing up his towel for </v>

1627
01:16:40.731 --> 01:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cheap.</v>

1628
01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Keep screwing them over too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bad that it becomes awesome.</v>

1629
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.793
<v Speaker 6>Are you worried about the potential new </v>
<v Speaker 6>one they're going to make and the </v>

1630
01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:55.323
<v Speaker 6>thought behind it might be they're going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to try to make something badly awesome </v>

1631
01:16:57.941 --> 01:17:00.550
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but start with bad intentions.</v>

1632
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.580
<v Speaker 6>Here's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

1633
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:05.993
<v Speaker 1>Do you piggy back like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is coming from a guy who did </v>

1634
01:17:08.071 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>the man show to version to me and</v>

1635
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.900
<v Speaker 5>stan home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you piggy back on when you.</v>

1636
01:17:14.901 --> 01:17:17.020
<v Speaker 5>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're confined to the ideal,</v>

1637
01:17:17.021 --> 01:17:19.710
<v Speaker 5>like you piggyback on the love that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>original roadhouse hat,</v>

1638
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's a classic movie.</v>

1639
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 5>You piggyback on that love and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>already in a deficit.</v>

1640
01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 5>It's like the ghostbusters thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which by the way wasn't a good movie.</v>

1641
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.860
<v Speaker 5>It was a good movie for a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1642
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.200
<v Speaker 5>There was some funny shit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ghostbusters,</v>

1643
01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 5>but then it got monotonous and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>enJoy the end,</v>

1644
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.780
<v Speaker 5>but I thought you told me you loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love some parts of it,</v>

1645
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:41.020
<v Speaker 5>so I bought it based on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>recommendation.</v>

1646
01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Not saying I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely did not say I love it.</v>

1647
01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.710
<v Speaker 5>It just wasn't a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of it I was like,</v>

1648
01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:46.550
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like,</v>

1649
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 5>it seems like 200 people fucked with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things where sometimes</v>

1650
01:17:51.111 --> 01:17:54.380
<v Speaker 5>you look at a movie and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what so much going on here?</v>

1651
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:58.280
<v Speaker 5>So much special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The special effects were so monumental.</v>

1652
01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:01.360
<v Speaker 5>The one at the end that used to be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>donut guy or the,</v>

1653
01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:02.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pillsbury doughboy.</v>

1654
01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the original ghostbusters,</v>

1655
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:05.383
<v Speaker 5>that fucking thing is taken to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy new cgi level where they're going </v>

1656
01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:10.730
<v Speaker 5>into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spoiler alert,</v>

1657
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:11.803
<v Speaker 5>they're going into other dimensions or </v>
<v Speaker 5>retrieving their friends and it's </v>

1658
01:18:14.451 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 5>fucking craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking craziness.</v>

1659
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:19.603
<v Speaker 5>But there were some funny moments in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning of that movie where I laughed </v>

1660
01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:23.480
<v Speaker 5>pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1661
01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:26.450
<v Speaker 5>there's a funny fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tend to Just lost its way,</v>

1662
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 5>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard to make a movie,</v>

1663
01:18:28.701 --> 01:18:29.534
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought that godzilla movie that came </v>

1664
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:32.960
<v Speaker 5>out like two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was dog shit.</v>

1665
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:34.700
<v Speaker 5>You didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was okay.</v>

1666
01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:36.770
<v Speaker 5>The guy from breaking bad in it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1667
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 5>He was great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was great and everything,</v>

1668
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:39.670
<v Speaker 5>but it was like god.</v>

1669
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.480
<v Speaker 5>So corny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know they're making another one.</v>

1670
01:18:41.481 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was funds being made by a.</v>

1671
01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:44.774
<v Speaker 5>I think it's being made in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like the way they originally </v>

1672
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:49.730
<v Speaker 5>made god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's my problem with it.</v>

1673
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.593
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't say it's corny because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>love monster movies and it definitely </v>

1674
01:18:52.131 --> 01:18:55.100
<v Speaker 5>don't want to discourage monster movies </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'll absolutely see it next time it</v>

1675
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:55.934
<v Speaker 5>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem Is there's a dude in this </v>

01:18:58.041 --> 01:18:59.360
<v Speaker 5>movie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>actually looks really cool.</v>

1807
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:29.303
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie godzilla and the idea of </v>

1808
01:25:31.861 --> 01:25:35.220
<v Speaker 3>godzilla is very fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ocean is</v>

1809
01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.850
<v Speaker 5>fucking huge folks and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1811
01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.780
<v Speaker 5>So we know that there's something as big</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a godzilla sort of.</v>

1812
01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:48.063
<v Speaker 5>Not really like what's a big whale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many hundreds of feet is a big </v>

1813
01:25:51.011 --> 01:25:51.844
<v Speaker 5>whale?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the size comparison of the </v>

1814
01:25:53.441 --> 01:25:55.420
<v Speaker 5>godzilla is of all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1815
01:25:55.421 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 5>They all get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need bigger.</v>

1816
01:25:57.401 --> 01:26:02.080
<v Speaker 5>We need to double doubles and big gulps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big gulps.</v>

1817
01:26:02.081 --> 01:26:04.550
<v Speaker 5>And our godzilla's what I just asked </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1818
01:26:04.551 --> 01:26:05.980
<v Speaker 5>Jamie whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh this?</v>

1819
01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:08.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How big is the biggest whale?</v>

1820
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.070
<v Speaker 5>Sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a sperm whale?</v>

1821
01:26:11.071 --> 01:26:12.380
<v Speaker 5>A blue whale?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blue whale.</v>

1822
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 5>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred and 70 meters?</v>

1823
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 5>Ninety eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1824
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.560
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1825
01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:22.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's still quite a bit smaller than</v>

1826
01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:23.774
<v Speaker 5>godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if a whale can be real and a whale </v>

1827
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 5>is 93 feet long and you are five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eight.</v>

1828
01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we know one thing can be way bigger,</v>

1829
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm five,</v>

1830
01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.073
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my daughter has a hamster and that </v>

1831
01:26:44.391 --> 01:26:47.360
<v Speaker 5>little fucker fits in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's start thinking here.</v>

1832
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:48.343
<v Speaker 5>What's the stop?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something from getting godzilla sized </v>

1833
01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.750
<v Speaker 5>for so far we haven't really seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything other than the dinosaurs.</v>

1834
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.670
<v Speaker 5>But then it really got godzilla sized </v>
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>

1835
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.040
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't mean that it couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have happened.</v>

1836
01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:02.330
<v Speaker 5>Me and someone probably has like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument against like the gravity effect</v>

1837
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:03.164
<v Speaker 5>on something that large,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how much mass you'd have to be </v>

1838
01:27:05.151 --> 01:27:07.790
<v Speaker 5>moving around and how big your muscles </v>
<v Speaker 5>and bones would have to be.</v>

1839
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:12.410
<v Speaker 5>They'll they say that happens to certain</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals at a certain size.</v>

1840
01:27:12.411 --> 01:27:15.020
<v Speaker 5>It just becomes impractical due to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment of earth.</v>

1841
01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.173
<v Speaker 5>And that was one of the things that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought was a reason why the dinosaurs </v>

1842
01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 5>are so huge.</v>

1843
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.593
<v Speaker 5>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The atmosphere might've been different </v>

1844
01:27:21.861 --> 01:27:22.694
<v Speaker 5>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might've been a different kind of </v>

1845
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 5>atmosphere that allowed them to move </v>
<v Speaker 5>more easily,</v>

1846
01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.650
<v Speaker 5>which is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1847
01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Where oxygen maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1848
01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:34.790
<v Speaker 5>I think it was way warmer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1849
01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:35.713
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't that in real tropical?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they think during the dinosaur </v>

1850
01:27:38.661 --> 01:27:41.030
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously not everywhere.</v>

1851
01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:42.980
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they had probably had polarized</v>

1852
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:43.814
<v Speaker 5>caps even back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think that the temperature in the </v>

1853
01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 5>jurassic and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1854
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 5>here we go here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dinosaur era at five times today,</v>

1855
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 5>ceo two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

1856
01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen to that folks.</v>

1857
01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they had,</v>

1858
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:02.143
<v Speaker 5>they knew world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dinosaurs roamed the earth 250 </v>

1859
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 5>million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knew a world with five times more carbon</v>

1860
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:09.650
<v Speaker 5>dioxide than president earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today,</v>

1861
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.053
<v Speaker 5>researchers say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and new techniques for estimating the </v>

1862
01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:14.204
<v Speaker 5>amount of carbon dioxide on prehistoric </v>
<v Speaker 5>earth may help scientists predict how </v>

1863
01:28:18.441 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 5>earth's climate may change in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>

1864
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.650
<v Speaker 5>Fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to have dinosaurs.</v>

1865
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.990
<v Speaker 5>We fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We fucked up.</v>

1866
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:26.630
<v Speaker 5>We had coal power plants and we're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 5>make dinosaurs.</v>

1867
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.613
<v Speaker 5>Those lizards are just going to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting bigger and bigger and all the </v>

1868
01:28:29.901 --> 01:28:30.734
<v Speaker 5>liberals are going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to keep them alive because </v>

1869
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:38.320
<v Speaker 5>they're important part of our ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they are scaly.</v>

1870
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:39.163
<v Speaker 5>Friends can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the alligators just keep </v>

1871
01:28:41.221 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 5>getting bigger and alligators get to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 30 feet long.</v>

1872
01:28:43.761 --> 01:28:44.594
<v Speaker 5>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1873
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:47.990
<v Speaker 5>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why the alligators so big?</v>

1874
01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 5>Like they're getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you guys?</v>

1875
01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:50.030
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1876
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.451
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1877
01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 5>These are just unusual examples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are outliers.</v>

1878
01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.110
<v Speaker 5>These are outliers of our scaly friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1879
01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a size shame as a human or with animals.</v>

1880
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:01.573
<v Speaker 5>And a big alligators don't next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He no alligators or 300 feet long anD </v>

1881
01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:08.100
<v Speaker 5>they just smashing through buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eaten your kids.</v>

1882
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:12.560
<v Speaker 5>JuraSsic park was technically real </v>
<v Speaker 5>alligators.</v>

1883
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:13.403
<v Speaker 5>Keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My story that I'm talking about right </v>

1884
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:16.020
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not too far off of that.</v>

1885
01:29:16.021 --> 01:29:18.320
<v Speaker 5>like what would you go visit it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They kept them on.</v>

1886
01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Why jesus jv?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>

1887
01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that at one point in </v>
<v Speaker 5>time the alligators keep getting bigger.</v>

1888
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 5>They're going to have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1889
01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:28.500
<v Speaker 5>they're too big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We gotta kill him.</v>

1890
01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:29.533
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't have him wandering around if </v>

1891
01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.180
<v Speaker 5>they're 50 feet long and they just want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to kill people,</v>

1892
01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:34.140
<v Speaker 5>we can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1893
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 5>so my point is they accept alligators up</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a certain size.</v>

1894
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:38.963
<v Speaker 5>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alligators like the alligator on the </v>

1895
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:41.334
<v Speaker 5>golf course video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which got like millions and millions of </v>

1896
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 5>hits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That alligator was like 15 feet long.</v>

1897
01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:47.010
<v Speaker 5>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alligator is like on the border.</v>

1898
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're letting that thing live.</v>

1899
01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:53.340
<v Speaker 5>You don't let this 15 foot long monster </v>
<v Speaker 5>just roam around and everybody's like,</v>

1900
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:54.600
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we always have before.</v>

1901
01:29:54.601 --> 01:29:55.110
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1902
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.943
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're cool.</v>

1903
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if he's 30 feet long,</v>

1904
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1905
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:04.020
<v Speaker 5>If he's 90 feet long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a fucking whale,</v>

1906
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:05.183
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to be out there and </v>

1907
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a giant carnivore.</v>

1908
01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.580
<v Speaker 5>So my point was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1909
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:14.180
<v Speaker 5>When do we shoot that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We.</v>

1910
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.950
<v Speaker 5>Would you shoot it or would you capture </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

1911
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:21.360
<v Speaker 5>Sci world record stakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stokes,</v>

1912
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.010
<v Speaker 5>stokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or stakes stokes.</v>

1913
01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Stokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stokes,</v>

1914
01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:25.680
<v Speaker 5>alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the stokes alligator?</v>

1915
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 5>Is that a type of alligator?</v>

1916
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:29.263
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

1917
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Fifteen feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nine inches long.</v>

1918
01:30:31.971 --> 01:30:34.700
<v Speaker 5>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

1919
01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

1920
01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.980
<v Speaker 5>that's an sci.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what that means?</v>

1921
01:30:36.981 --> 01:30:40.210
<v Speaker 5>That's safari club international.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like a,</v>

1922
01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.530
<v Speaker 5>it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make sure that I'm correct there.</v>

1923
01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.700
<v Speaker 5>But that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1924
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:45.583
<v Speaker 5>that's one of those organizations that </v>
<v Speaker 5>measures the largest animals of each </v>

1925
01:30:48.711 --> 01:30:50.300
<v Speaker 5>species that were killed hunting.</v>

1926
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:52.223
<v Speaker 8>hmm.</v>

1927
01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:54.850
<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that might be what that is.</v>

1928
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:57.460
<v Speaker 5>See If that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the sci?</v>

1929
01:30:59.590 --> 01:31:00.870
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stokes was.</v>

1930
01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:02.380
<v Speaker 5>It keeps saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1931
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:06.730
<v Speaker 5>the name mandy stokes told the website </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1932
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.870
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dan.</v>

1933
01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they kIlled it.</v>

1934
01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:14.510
<v Speaker 5>They killed that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eric.</v>

1935
01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:15.344
<v Speaker 5>It goes so that she went through with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>range of emotions as they first stalk </v>

1936
01:31:18.551 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 5>the animal before baiting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1937
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:21.234
<v Speaker 5>battling it and killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally struggling to take it and </v>

1938
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:28.320
<v Speaker 5>finally struggling to take it back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>shore.</v>

1939
01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:32.250
<v Speaker 5>How weird alligator meat is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be super good for you,</v>

1940
01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:33.930
<v Speaker 5>which is really kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1941
01:31:33.931 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 5>You look at that thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how could you eat that fucking thing?</v>

1942
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.300
<v Speaker 5>But apparently their tails are </v>
<v Speaker 5>delicious.</v>

1943
01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.460
<v Speaker 5>You just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1944
01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:46.260
<v Speaker 5>prepare it properly and you get it like </v>
<v Speaker 5>right off the alligator and that,</v>

1945
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:47.660
<v Speaker 5>those things</v>

1946
01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.310
<v Speaker 2>in that place we used to always go to in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

1947
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:52.040
<v Speaker 2>have alligator soup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a grizzly bears?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just start wandering the streets and </v>

1984
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.053

<v Speaker 1>If grizzlies started wandering through </v>

1985
01:33:18.581 --> 01:33:21.070
<v Speaker 1>san francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that dude.</v>

1986
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.653
<v Speaker 1>I was in this town near bakersfield </v>
<v Speaker 1>called le bec and it's named after a </v>

1987
01:33:28.001 --> 01:33:28.834
<v Speaker 1>dude named peter lubeck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is purportedly the last man in </v>

1988
01:33:31.661 --> 01:33:33.910
<v Speaker 1>California to get killed by a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

1989
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the website to read about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude.</v>

1990
01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1991
01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:39.973
<v Speaker 1>We're reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading that his feet were bitten </v>

1992
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:43.420
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not financial.</v>

1993
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not funny because his feet were </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitten off.</v>

1994
01:33:46.511 --> 01:33:51.511
<v Speaker 1>One of his hands was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bear just fucked him up.</v>

1995
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.493
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they named the town after him after the </v>

1996
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:57.064
<v Speaker 1>guy had died in his honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They named this town after the last guy </v>

1997
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:03.160
<v Speaker 1>to get killed by a grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

1998
01:34:03.161 --> 01:34:04.420
<v Speaker 1>people that go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

1999
01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:06.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've ruined California.</v>

2000
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 1>The grizzly bears extinct from </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

2001
01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.020
<v Speaker 1>listened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to me.</v>

2002
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Let Montana have the fucking grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them here.</v>

2003
01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Just trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they seem so romantic.</v>

2004
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.950
<v Speaker 1>They seem so lovely when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

2005
01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:26.590
<v Speaker 1>That's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a spot for them on earth.</v>

2006
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.530
<v Speaker 1>That's great too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this idea of bringing them back like</v>

2007
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneers.</v>

2008
01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:32.194
<v Speaker 1>It's scared to get to your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>recyclable bin in the middle of the </v>

2009
01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.253
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're terrifying because your </v>

2010
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.370
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood is filled with bears and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions and shit.</v>

2011
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.590
<v Speaker 1>The fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.513
<v Speaker 1>30 foot long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crocodiles wandering down your </v>

2013
01:34:43.781 --> 01:34:45.020
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2016
01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:49.443
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

2017
01:34:51.641 --> 01:34:53.470
<v Speaker 1>was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was written into a tree.</v>

2018
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you read that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let'S say.</v>

2019
01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:56.950

01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:59.703
<v Speaker 4>say I'm looking up the story about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I keep talking about this </v>

2022
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:02.624
<v Speaker 4>inscription written on a tree that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>found when people were passing through </v>

2023
01:35:05.571 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 4>and the 18 fifties low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think if we didn't have the teddy</v>

2024
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:12.040
<v Speaker 4>bears as kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would not be so attached to bears.</v>

2025
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.883
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2026
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:13.671
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2027
01:35:13.671 --> 01:35:15.380
<v Speaker 4>There was a story written on the tree.</v>

2028
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:20.120
<v Speaker 5>I dug him up and his bones were torn </v>
<v Speaker 5>apart.</v>

2029
01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2030
01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:25.310
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that I refresh my memory,</v>

2031
01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.860
<v Speaker 5>I'd forgotten it was written somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know it was on a tree.</v>

2032
01:35:27.861 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was a note.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

2033
01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Fuck bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2034
01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck them.</v>

2035
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not for eradicating bears,</v>

2036
01:35:37.701 --> 01:35:38.301
<v Speaker 5>ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gentlemen.</v>

2037
01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:40.070
<v Speaker 5>I just want to be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love them.</v>

2038
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're cool.</v>

2039
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 5>Just like lions are Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Don't want lions in burbank.</v>

2040
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:47.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just a whole cecil the lion thing.</v>

2041
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.870
<v Speaker 5>Let's not get carried away folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's not,</v>

2042
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:52.243
<v Speaker 5>don't bring them over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get crazy because a guy who wants </v>

2043
01:35:54.531 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 5>to bring them over to england.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the guy who is the,</v>

2044
01:35:58.191 --> 01:36:00.290
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when bulls created rivers guy,</v>

2045
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:02.373
<v Speaker 5>the guy with wolves change rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He made this really cool documentary or </v>

2046
01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:08.590
<v Speaker 5>a video that shows what the.</v>

2047
01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:10.400
<v Speaker 5>It's been criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's right,</v>

2048
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:13.010
<v Speaker 5>but to me it's interesting and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of really cool points.</v>

2049
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:14.083
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things was that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves were reintroduced them to the </v>

2050
01:36:16.811 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They started killing the elk and killing</v>

2051
01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:21.314
<v Speaker 5>the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that allowed a lot of the plants to </v>

2052
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:23.924
<v Speaker 5>grow better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which allowed a lot of the rivers that </v>

2053
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:26.384
<v Speaker 5>changed the course of the rivers because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the root system got stronger and all </v>

2054
01:36:29.271 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 5>these other animals survived and </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrived.</v>

2055
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:34.640
<v Speaker 5>They all did better because they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 5>the prey of the wolf,</v>

2056
01:36:34.641 --> 01:36:38.120
<v Speaker 5>but they were benefiting from the elk </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the deer not being around anymore.</v>

2057
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:39.343
<v Speaker 5>and so a look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really cool to see like how when </v>

2058
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:43.244
<v Speaker 5>they introduce a predator into an area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like you're watching a </v>

2059
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:48.104
<v Speaker 5>mathematical program,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you introduced this and it's a </v>

2060
01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:51.224
<v Speaker 5>really controversial subject because a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of elk hunters in particular were </v>

2061
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.843
<v Speaker 5>really mad when they brought these </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves in because they killed half the </v>

2062
01:36:58.041 --> 01:36:58.850
<v Speaker 5>elk population.</v>

2063
01:36:58.850 --> 01:37:02.210
<v Speaker 5>They chopped them down to 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But some people think that it's probably</v>

2064
01:37:02.211 --> 01:37:05.360
<v Speaker 5>overall healthy for the actual animals </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

2065
01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:06.194
<v Speaker 5>It's like a more honest life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not really honest for these wild </v>

2066
01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 5>cows and undulates to not have any </v>
<v Speaker 5>predators.</v>

2067
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:14.270
<v Speaker 5>They've never had that all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>

2068
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:15.283
<v Speaker 5>So our idea that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>eliminate all the predators and they're </v>

2069
01:37:17.661 --> 01:37:20.210
<v Speaker 5>just going to run wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2070
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.073
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how you get like Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where people are fucking hitting him </v>

2071
01:37:22.851 --> 01:37:25.550
<v Speaker 5>with cars to a tune of a million a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some was it.</v>

2072
01:37:25.551 --> 01:37:28.880
<v Speaker 5>No one was at one point $5 million in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole country for a year.</v>

2073
01:37:28.881 --> 01:37:29.714
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 people dead from colliding with </v>

2074
01:37:32.391 --> 01:37:34.070
<v Speaker 5>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

2075
01:37:34.071 --> 01:37:37.010
<v Speaker 5>So like wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wolves are important.</v>

2076
01:37:37.011 --> 01:37:38.780
<v Speaker 5>Bears are important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're interesting.</v>

2077
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.490
<v Speaker 5>They're fucking fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2078
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:44.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm so glad they're around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't get crazy.</v>

2079
01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Don't get fucking to coyotes in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>

2080
01:37:48.251 --> 01:37:50.160
<v Speaker 4>It's getting out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the crows,</v>

2081
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:51.540
<v Speaker 4>crows and coyotes</v>

2082
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:53.410
<v Speaker 5>out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love coyotes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2090
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:12.714
<v Speaker 1>I was driving to the apartment and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking dogs running down the </v>

2091
01:38:15.331 --> 01:38:16.164
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little german shepherds and is the </v>

2092
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:19.290
<v Speaker 1>first time I'd ever seen a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized,</v>

2093
01:38:19.291 --> 01:38:21.660
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are coyotes.</v>

2094
01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:25.110

<v Speaker 1>He's a little wild predators,</v>

2095
01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:29.220
<v Speaker 1>just small enough that we let them stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>just small enough.</v>

2096
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:30.263
<v Speaker 1>If they were hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be gunning them down from the </v>

2097
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 1>top of buses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2098
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.930
<v Speaker 1>If he needs a roman down the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing apart dogs and shit,</v>

2099
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:38.933
<v Speaker 1>we'd be terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is just dickie enough to slip under </v>

2100
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 1>the radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to eat a cat every now and then.</v>

2108
01:39:09.991 --> 01:39:14.991
<v Speaker 1>skirting the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scary enough that you don't want</v>

2109

<v Speaker 1>your kids to be around them,</v>

2115
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.980
<v Speaker 1>They'd be scared if you put up a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2116
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:38.550
<v Speaker 1>like if you booted a coyote in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a good roundhouse kick,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They get into their house,</v>

2176
01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 1>getting your car drive off to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go down here,</v>

2177
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:20.734
<v Speaker 1>you go on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often you check in that weird </v>

01:42:21.701 --> 01:42:25.180
<v Speaker 1>alleyway behind your apartment building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often you check in that place?</v>

01:42:26.771 --> 01:42:27.604
<v Speaker 1>there's like trees back there for no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason and then behind that there's a </v>

2181
01:42:29.681 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 1>fence you ever go look in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were coyotes live motherfucker.</v>

2182
01:42:32.801 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 1>If you don't go there for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>

2183
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:35.164
<v Speaker 1>they find that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sniff around like these dumb fucks </v>

<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they'll use that and they find these </v>
<v Speaker 1>spots all around the city.</v>

2186
01:42:42.071 --> 01:42:47.071
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's pretty cool to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a weird animal that's just small</v>

2187
01:42:49.551 --> 01:42:52.700
<v Speaker 1>enough that will let it hunt near us.</v>

2197
01:43:13.261 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Such a weird video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2198
01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.340
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>

2202
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

2203
01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2204
01:43:28.590 --> 01:43:31.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a hilarious sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rolls over at fox,</v>

2205
01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:34.470
<v Speaker 1>probably so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's inside a house getting free food.</v>

2206
01:43:34.471 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 1>You just have to go out there and earn </v>
<v Speaker 1>fox.</v>

2207
01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2208
01:43:40.011 --> 01:43:40.844
<v Speaker 1>of the fox with a grizzly man when </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly man was up in the woods and the </v>

2209
01:43:46.141 --> 01:43:47.770
<v Speaker 1>fox and him became buddies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2210
01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.150
<v Speaker 1>it's really beautiful footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think honestly,</v>

2211
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I know I make fun</v>

2212
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.933
<v Speaker 5>of that movie a lot because that guy was</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of his fucking mind and that's </v>

2213
01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:56.924
<v Speaker 5>another unintentional comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is another perfect example of </v>

2214
01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 5>something that's not supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>funny,</v>

2215
01:44:01.190 --> 01:44:02.023
<v Speaker 5>but it's god damned hilarious and no </v>
<v Speaker 5>disrespect to this guy who got eaten by </v>

2216
01:44:05.601 --> 01:44:06.434
<v Speaker 5>the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No disrespect because I think he really </v>

2217
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:09.644
<v Speaker 5>did do a lot of great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was a little delusional with </v>

2218
01:44:12.291 --> 01:44:15.860
<v Speaker 5>his idea that he was saving these bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what he did do,</v>

2219
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.843
<v Speaker 5>his got amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible up close footage of grizzly </v>

2220
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:24.260
<v Speaker 5>bears involved in all sorts of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2221
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:25.094
<v Speaker 5>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he captured grizzly bear wars at like </v>

2222
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:28.783
<v Speaker 5>really close range and he did a great </v>
<v Speaker 5>job and he deVeloped friendships with </v>

2223
01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:36.740
<v Speaker 5>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this little fox right here.</v>

2224
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:40.310
<v Speaker 5>This fox just comes right up to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man is hanging out with him.</v>

2225
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.473
<v Speaker 5>AT one point it steals his hat and </v>
<v Speaker 5>playfully runs off with it and he's </v>

2226
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:45.861
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2227
01:44:45.861 --> 01:44:48.740
<v Speaker 5>give me that hat back and the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fox isn't scared of a man.</v>

2228
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:52.370
<v Speaker 5>The fox just thinks it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why would the fox take the hat?</v>

2229
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:55.220
<v Speaker 5>He just rolling around and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>biting on it.</v>

2230
01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:58.310
<v Speaker 5>It's really adorable and the grizzly man</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets mad,</v>

2231
01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.290
<v Speaker 5>so he goes chasing after the fox and</v>

2232
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:02.763
<v Speaker 5>it was just like weird moment of </v>
<v Speaker 5>camaraderie between two life forms that </v>

2233
01:45:07.091 --> 01:45:11.970
<v Speaker 5>are just hanging out in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2234
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.490
<v Speaker 5>Like that thing accepted him into its </v>
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>

2235
01:45:14.491 --> 01:45:16.110
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

2236
01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:17.753
<v Speaker 5>Another interesting thing is the wolves </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed one of those boxes while he was </v>

2237
01:45:20.581 --> 01:45:24.240
<v Speaker 5>there already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got ahold of that fox torn apart.</v>

2238
01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.740
<v Speaker 5>They don't want any competing predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same with coyotes.</v>

2239
01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:30.550
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coyotes.</v>

2240
01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Same with coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want competing predators.</v>

2241
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:36.120
<v Speaker 5>That's apparently the main reason why </v>
<v Speaker 5>they kill cats.</v>

2242
01:45:36.570 --> 01:45:37.403
<v Speaker 5>They don't even kill them to eat them as</v>
<v Speaker 5>much as they kill them because they </v>

2243
01:45:39.091 --> 01:45:39.924
<v Speaker 5>don't want any predators that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing for the same things they're </v>

2244
01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.073
<v Speaker 5>competing for.</v>

2245
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:46.793
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he got this amazing footage of him </v>

2246
01:45:47.971 --> 01:45:50.940
<v Speaker 5>like running after this fox hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with his fox.</v>

2247
01:45:51.190 --> 01:45:52.023
<v Speaker 5>He was like buddies with this little fox</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then when the fox kid got eaten by </v>

2248
01:45:55.201 --> 01:45:58.290
<v Speaker 5>the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he found like a paul and you're like,</v>

2249
01:45:58.291 --> 01:46:01.950
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this world is gangster.</v>

2250
01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:07.220
<v Speaker 5>Like these little crazy animals make </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends with this nutty guy who's camped</v>

2251
01:46:07.501 --> 01:46:10.830
<v Speaker 5>out in a tent and while he's camped on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that tent in the middle of the night,</v>

2252
01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:15.510
<v Speaker 5>the wolves come into town and tear one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those boxes apart and he's crying and</v>

2253
01:46:15.511 --> 01:46:16.740
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard the screams.</v>

2254
01:46:16.741 --> 01:46:18.870
<v Speaker 5>I heard the howls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard the wolves.</v>

2255
01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:21.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck are you live in through</v>

2256
01:46:21.121 --> 01:46:21.954

<v Speaker 5>Like there you have in monster wars and </v>

2257
01:46:23.461 --> 01:46:24.294

01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:29.390
<v Speaker 3>LiTerally watched that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where these parts are.</v>

2259
01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:30.830
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox a little,</v>

2260
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:35.420
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it way too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that fucking movie</v>

2261
01:46:36.730 --> 01:46:37.563
<v Speaker 5>15 times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched it on planes and I'm bored if </v>

2262
01:46:40.661 --> 01:46:41.494
<v Speaker 5>I'm bored</v>

2263
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:43.880
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>

2264
01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:45.373
<v Speaker 3>did you see that report that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1300 chinese old ladies or old </v>

2265
01:46:50.371 --> 01:46:51.204
<v Speaker 3>people get go missing every day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this whole thing where the </v>

2266
01:46:54.821 --> 01:46:59.240
<v Speaker 3>old people just are missing like daily </v>
<v Speaker 3>1300 chinese.</v>

2267
01:46:59.650 --> 01:47:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is recent.</v>

2268
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:01.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're saying it's up to </v>

2269
01:47:03.481 --> 01:47:04.314
<v Speaker 3>500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>old women go ms dot or old people go </v>

2270
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:07.914
<v Speaker 3>missing every year in China and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these theories like that </v>

2271
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:11.843
<v Speaker 3>they become food and in the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes them because it costs so much </v>

2272
01:47:15.181 --> 01:47:17.010
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2273
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:21.380
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know $500.</v>

2274
01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Mark and old people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>500,000.</v>

2275
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>

2276
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:26.303
<v Speaker 3>how many people go missing in America </v>
<v Speaker 3>every year from the old people go </v>

2277
01:47:30.211 --> 01:47:32.910
<v Speaker 3>missing in America year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See there's a difference,</v>

2278
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 3>but I think $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like a lot,</v>

2279
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:40.020
<v Speaker 3>but China has a billion in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 80 percent.</v>

2280
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent of what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>missing people.</v>

2281
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent of missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over 75.</v>

2283
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're killing all people.</v>

2284
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:56.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

2285
01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 3>they killed babies and older people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

2286
01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:01.500

<v Speaker 3>On average in the usa,</v>

2287
01:48:01.501 --> 01:48:04.950
<v Speaker 3>there's only $90,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>missing persons at any given time.</v>

2288
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>$90,000</v>

2289
01:48:06.221 --> 01:48:08.580
<v Speaker 3>missing persons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in their defense,</v>

2290
01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:13.610
<v Speaker 3>China has probably three plus times more</v>
<v Speaker 3>people than we do,</v>

2291
01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:18.450
<v Speaker 3>so wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't still be under 300,000</v>

2292
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:20.160
<v Speaker 3>if that was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's close.</v>

2293
01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:21.503
<v Speaker 3>That's close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you considered the fact that they </v>

2294
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:25.180
<v Speaker 3>live in a really rural place in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

2295
01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:27.930
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the errors are very rural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they have predators?</v>

2296
01:48:27.931 --> 01:48:28.830
<v Speaker 3>They have bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2297
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:31.350
<v Speaker 3>China has some bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else did they have?</v>

2298
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 3>What kind of credit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What hate?</v>

2299
01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.253
<v Speaker 3>Hey google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of shit eats people in China </v>

2300
01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 3>and they'll say chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chinese.</v>

2301
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:43.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just the infinity sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a few animals.</v>

2302
01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.600
<v Speaker 3>It's very aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've got a few guys.</v>

2303
01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:48.790
<v Speaker 3>That would be a weird thing to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people in America,</v>

2304
01:48:48.791 --> 01:48:51.460

<v Speaker 3>missing people or how percent of that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>old people?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creditors of humans in China.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is there maybe the old ladies get </v>
<v Speaker 3>scooped up by tara.</v>

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.010

<v Speaker 1>See that's the thing about eagles.</v>

2331
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:59.703
<v Speaker 1>Eagles got smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never got big enough to fuck with </v>

2332
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we said,</v>

2333
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:04.090
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll let you be our national bird.</v>

2334
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>He eagles got really close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got scary.</v>

2335
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:08.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see an eagle and you see those </v>

2336
01:50:09.641 --> 01:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>towns and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll freak you out.</v>

2337
01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I get attacked by birds a lot recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I just must be near ness.</v>

2338
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like sitting in my backyard.</v>

2339
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:21.791
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2340
01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:22.624
<v Speaker 1>what do you got here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>James is just a wildlife with China on </v>

2341
01:50:24.461 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a different mammals.</v>

2342
01:50:26.171 --> 01:50:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Does it say predators of humans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have predators?</v>

2343
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:31.120
<v Speaker 1>They have giant tiger's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2344
01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:31.871
<v Speaker 1>they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2345
01:50:31.871 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old people getting eaten by tigers.</v>

2346
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.110
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In it.</v>

2347
01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:38.970
<v Speaker 1>What if we find out south China tiger </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2348
01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.670
<v Speaker 1>toilet chinese people are sewing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figured.</v>

2349
01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2350
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:48.580
<v Speaker 1>we told you it was in the fucking dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit.</v>

2351
01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have siberian tigers.</v>

2352
01:50:51.971 --> 01:50:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a bunch of other cats to it.</v>

2353
01:50:53.391 --> 01:50:55.540
<v Speaker 1>What does that population of bengal </v>
<v Speaker 1>tigers.</v>

2354
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:57.820
<v Speaker 1>What are those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those other cats?</v>

2355
01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Laptop leopards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leopards are terrifying.</v>

2356
01:51:00.490 --> 01:51:04.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I think since they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of shit that we don't have,</v>

2357
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:05.224
<v Speaker 1>they can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My estimation is that poor </v>

2358
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:10.510
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack of resources.</v>

2359
01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:11.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm very rural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neighborhoods connected to tigers and </v>

2360
01:51:14.681 --> 01:51:15.514
<v Speaker 1>cats are causing the extra 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would account for them having the </v>

2361
01:51:19.901 --> 01:51:22.690
<v Speaker 1>exact same amount of old people go </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing as we do.</v>

2362
01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Said 25 percent of those old people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>dementia.</v>

2363
01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:25.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2364
01:51:25.991 --> 01:51:27.460
<v Speaker 1>You wander off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get eaten by the tiger.</v>

2365
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I not supposed to get eaten by a</v>

2366
01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:31.780

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>than one of these videos to.</v>

2383
01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:14.920
<v Speaker 2>You would let that go on and it get on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like,</v>

2384
01:52:15.690 --> 01:52:17.010
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You have how many people know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know I can't do shit.</v>

2386
01:52:20.130 --> 01:52:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Killed the fuck out of that guy if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

2388
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:26.783
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to worry that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go after you next or your kid or your </v>

2389
01:52:28.991 --> 01:52:30.660
<v Speaker 2>friend or your bite.</v>

2391
01:52:32.621 --> 01:52:33.454
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's more than one of these </v>

2392
01:52:33.971 --> 01:52:37.020
<v Speaker 2>cannibalism videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's China on subways,</v>

2393
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:39.100

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happens,</v>

2394
01:52:39.101 --> 01:52:39.934
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of this happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bunch of videos of people </v>

2395
01:52:43.001 --> 01:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>randomly attacking people on subways or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2396
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>We were just watching.</v>

2397
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:46.911
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>

2398
01:52:46.911 --> 01:52:47.744
<v Speaker 5>when you're some about being contained </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a subway where you're in this thing </v>

2399
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:53.900
<v Speaker 5>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's a container and you know,</v>

2400
01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:54.734
<v Speaker 5>nobody can get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some weird instinct that people </v>

2401
01:52:57.591 --> 01:53:00.350
<v Speaker 5>have where like if someone was like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>predator already,</v>

2402
01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.513
<v Speaker 5>I bet they would be in that thing and it</v>

<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

2437
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like even if he wasn't threatening,</v>

2438
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 5>maybe that makes sense why he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening.</v>

2439
01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.030
<v Speaker 5>Why walked back to his car and reached </v>
<v Speaker 5>into his door.</v>

2440
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:32.240
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe he was fucked up on pcp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It totally makes sense.</v>

2441
01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well she shot him apparently what I've </v>

2442
01:54:36.351 --> 01:54:39.310
<v Speaker 5>understood by people that are around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2443
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:40.383
<v Speaker 5>a law enforcement and tactical </v>
<v Speaker 5>situations when people don't have </v>

2444
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:49.160
<v Speaker 5>triggered discipline and they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>been in a firefight before.</v>

2445
01:54:49.161 --> 01:54:49.994
<v Speaker 5>Any kind of situation where your </v>
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline is jacked and you're really </v>

2446
01:54:53.031 --> 01:54:55.580
<v Speaker 5>scared for your life and she might have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been in some before,</v>

2447
01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:58.940
<v Speaker 5>which may be even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could exacerbate that and jack it up.</v>

2448
01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:02.900
<v Speaker 5>But her adrenaline was jack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was shitting her pants.</v>

2449
01:55:02.901 --> 01:55:03.734
<v Speaker 5>Dude wasn't listening and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>tased the guy and the my friend justin </v>

2450
01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:09.434
<v Speaker 5>said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what most lIkely happened is when they </v>

2451
01:55:12.081 --> 01:55:14.660
<v Speaker 5>tase the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she freaked out and pulled the trigger.</v>

2453
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.883

01:55:21.741 --> 01:55:25.280
<v Speaker 5>didn't even mean to shoot this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that what happened with her was she just</v>

2455
01:55:25.281 --> 01:55:27.920
<v Speaker 5>didn't have good trigger discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she freaked out because,</v>

<v Speaker 3>she shouldn't have shot him by.</v>

2503
01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.273
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make it any different.</v>

2505
01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.593
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a mistake that cost somebody their </v>

2506
01:57:40.121 --> 01:57:40.954
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like the whole thing is </v>

2507
01:57:42.971 --> 01:57:43.804
<v Speaker 3>kind of fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having a girl in that kind of a </v>

<v Speaker 3>burnt fries,</v>

2516
01:58:13.151 --> 01:58:17.920
<v Speaker 3>like each guys fucked the fries up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the equivalent in her job.</v>

2517
01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Fucking up the fries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody dies.</v>

2518
01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.180
<v Speaker 3>She made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She screwed up.</v>

2519
01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.273
<v Speaker 3>Somebody got shot and kill that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much different than any other </v>

2520
01:58:27.041 --> 01:58:28.780
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

2521
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:30.953
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believed that it probably is exactly </v>

2522
01:58:32.831 --> 01:58:36.940
<v Speaker 3>the sound of the taser in her being in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>high stress that makes complete sense to</v>

2523
01:58:36.941 --> 01:58:37.600
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2524
01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I think you just react by hearing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound and my buddy justin</v>

2525
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 1>would definitely know because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's down with all those.</v>

2526
01:58:44.921 --> 01:58:47.890
<v Speaker 1>A tactical guys and military guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2527
01:58:47.891 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 1>he's a gun nut so constantly around </v>
<v Speaker 1>those dudes.</v>

2528
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:52.840
<v Speaker 1>So if that's what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's most likely what happened.</v>

2529
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:53.733
<v Speaker 1>It's probably what she relayed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>private or what they figured out or who </v>

2530
01:58:56.921 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and fuck,</v>

2531
01:58:59.290 --> 01:59:00.123
<v Speaker 1>fuck that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine just chasing after people that </v>

2532
01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:06.430
<v Speaker 1>are committing crimes all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>

2533
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:07.930
<v Speaker 1>How stressful would that be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

2534
01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:10.380
<v Speaker 1>She Was a five year veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2535
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:13.510
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drop.</v>

2536
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2537
01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2538
01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:19.293
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird that we need them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that they become what they </v>

2539
01:59:23.141 --> 01:59:23.974
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2540
01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:27.790
<v Speaker 1>they become this death dealer or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifesaver,</v>

2541
01:59:27.850 --> 01:59:28.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's coming after you and the cops </v>

2542
01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:30.960
<v Speaker 1>break in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lifesaver.</v>

2543
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:34.270
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna like what a crazy position</v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone to take,</v>

2544
01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:37.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stressful.</v>

2545
01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

2546
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:43.660
<v Speaker 1>especially nowadays it's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2547
01:59:43.661 --> 01:59:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I probably was cooler back then because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he got away with so much,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

2609
02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:52.960
<v Speaker 3>but I mean zIka babies grow up to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty smart.</v>

02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't had any.</v>

2611
02:02:58.130 --> 02:03:00.710
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't grown up are really.</v>

2612
02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not that I've ever heard of.</v>

2613
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:04.243
<v Speaker 3>I just made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's actually adult zika </v>

2614
02:03:05.721 --> 02:03:06.554
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so because I was thinking about </v>

2615
02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 3>making zika hats for zika people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it makes it look like their heads are</v>

2616
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:12.224
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to start a conspiracy on </v>

2617
02:03:17.471 --> 02:03:18.304
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I read recently that the zika has </v>

2618
02:03:19.281 --> 02:03:20.810
<v Speaker 3>been around for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2619
02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:24.470

<v Speaker 3>Now it says since 19 forties.</v>

2620
02:03:24.471 --> 02:03:26.390
<v Speaker 3>That's when it was first discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2621

<v Speaker 3>look like zika babies by grown up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2631
02:03:52.351 --> 02:03:53.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2632
02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some.</v>

2633
02:03:54.570 --> 02:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean the little errors in the scripts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make a person.</v>

2634
02:03:58.680 --> 02:03:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those errors?</v>

2635
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.200
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2636
02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>So you can virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael microcephaly suffers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sef allopathy suffers campaign.</v>

2638
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people go,</v>

2639
02:04:15.370 --> 02:04:16.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2640
02:04:16.710 --> 02:04:17.543
<v Speaker 3>How many people are zika?</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just have hats and you never </v>

2641
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:21.230
<v Speaker 3>another zika.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2642
02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:22.153
<v Speaker 3>is that a thing?</v>

2643
02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to the picture.</v>

2644
02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:24.893
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking bug that makes your </v>

2645
02:04:26.761 --> 02:04:27.594
<v Speaker 1>head smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just stop and think about how </v>

2646
02:04:30.061 --> 02:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>insane that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to eradicate that bug.</v>

2647
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a bug that makes your baby's </v>
<v Speaker 1>head smaller.</v>

2648
02:04:36.121 --> 02:04:36.954
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't givE fuck what is going on in </v>

2649
02:04:38.701 --> 02:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to kill all these god damn bugs.</v>

2650
02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:42.563
<v Speaker 1>Stop worrying about stupid shit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are going to be born with </v>

2651
02:04:44.521 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>little tiny heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2652
02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>they're killing the bees in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

2653
02:04:48.721 --> 02:04:51.840
<v Speaker 1>They're spraying for zika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ms dot rosemary are bs.</v>

2654
02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked up from top to bottom.</v>

2655
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth defects.</v>

2656
02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

2657
02:04:59.010 --> 02:04:59.843
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just terrifying to think that </v>

2658
02:05:03.171 --> 02:05:06.080
<v Speaker 1>there's bugs that can just all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2659
02:05:06.110 --> 02:05:06.943
<v Speaker 1>even when you hear about things like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spanish plague that like one flew over </v>

2660
02:05:10.371 --> 02:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>the spanish flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one flu and like the 18 hundreds was the</v>

2661
02:05:14.081 --> 02:05:16.550
<v Speaker 1>1800 and $1,900</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the spanish flu.</v>

2662
02:05:16.670 --> 02:05:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to say the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 nineties,</v>

2663
02:05:19.130 --> 02:05:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this.</v>

2664
02:05:20.090 --> 02:05:23.540
<v Speaker 1>My grasp of history ready beCause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2665
02:05:23.541 --> 02:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2666
02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:25.693
<v Speaker 1>interview with a vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dude that plays brad pitt had the </v>

2667
02:05:31.191 --> 02:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>spanish flu and he was a soldier and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dying in 1918.</v>

2668
02:05:36.110 --> 02:05:36.943
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2669
02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.493
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2670
02:05:40.190 --> 02:05:42.620
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so old timey.</v>

2671
02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:43.513
<v Speaker 1>Basically folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other dude who played brad pitt's </v>

2672
02:05:45.681 --> 02:05:48.920
<v Speaker 1>character of brad pitt's character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude black brad pitt played.</v>

2673
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:50.083
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say he died with that flu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stat gave him the vampire gene </v>

2674
02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>got real issues after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2675
02:05:56.830 --> 02:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really like doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really like being a vampire,</v>

2676
02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>really like choking on people's blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink his own daughters.</v>

2677
02:06:05.151 --> 02:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Blood was kind of dark.</v>

2678
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.170
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about westworld earlier </v>
<v Speaker 6>reminded me of something a thought I had</v>

2679
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:12.900
<v Speaker 6>on here of a couple of people mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 6>some things about,</v>

2680
02:06:13.050 --> 02:06:13.883
<v Speaker 6>I think dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it might've had to do a string </v>

2681
02:06:16.351 --> 02:06:18.630
<v Speaker 6>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it had to go with the store.</v>

2682
02:06:18.631 --> 02:06:19.464
<v Speaker 6>I think I showed you this story before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This came out earlier this year about </v>

2683
02:06:22.231 --> 02:06:25.020
<v Speaker 6>the scientists have found out that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>human brain,</v>

2684
02:06:25.050 --> 02:06:27.510
<v Speaker 6>the size of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or at least at what a store might be way</v>

2685
02:06:27.511 --> 02:06:32.511
<v Speaker 6>more than they thought previously based </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the way the brain codes,</v>

2686
02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:33.810
<v Speaker 6>what it's calling bits.</v>

2687
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>They need to stop the study right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and examined red band,</v>

2688
02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but my only point on this is that a.</v>

2689
02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:44.070
<v Speaker 6>There was like 26 up to 26 neuropathways</v>
<v Speaker 6>are discovering the brain,</v>

2690
02:06:44.071 --> 02:06:47.490
<v Speaker 6>which allows for more of maybe thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>storage and they knew about,</v>

2691
02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:50.080
<v Speaker 6>but when the person came on to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2692
02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.830
<v Speaker 6>dimensions in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a couple of months ago,</v>

2693
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:57.120
<v Speaker 6>I'd never heard that there was up to 26 </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimensions possibly.</v>

2694
02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:58.950
<v Speaker 6>I'd always heard it was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2695
02:06:58.951 --> 02:06:59.784
<v Speaker 6>And this is the first time I heard 26,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which made me go back to something I </v>

2696
02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:04.390
<v Speaker 6>had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had just heard about what had 26 to do</v>

2697
02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.810
<v Speaker 6>with it in the brain and it was this.</v>

2698
02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:07.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it says,</v>

2699
02:07:07.901 --> 02:07:08.734
<v Speaker 1>according to super string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are at least 10 dimensions in the </v>

2700
02:07:11.321 --> 02:07:12.154
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>M theory actually suggests there are 11 </v>

2701
02:07:14.981 --> 02:07:15.814
<v Speaker 1>dimensions to space time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then both sonic string theory </v>

2702
02:07:19.361 --> 02:07:22.960
<v Speaker 1>suggests 26 dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is both sonic string theory?</v>

2703
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:25.930
<v Speaker 6>I had never heard that term either,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was just kind of ask,</v>

2704
02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:29.360
<v Speaker 6>asking in a strange way like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you think that those could be related</v>

2705
02:07:29.361 --> 02:07:30.194
<v Speaker 6>in any way?</v>

2706
02:07:30.230 --> 02:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see that stuff,</v>

2707
02:07:31.371 --> 02:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>they're writing down on those little </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow legal pads and they'll.</v>

2708
02:07:34.581 --> 02:07:37.410
<v Speaker 1>String theorists are going off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing computations,</v>

2709
02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>like you just got to take their word for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2710
02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:40.573
<v Speaker 1>like you can't even try to rationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how the fuck some dude is </v>

2711
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.513
<v Speaker 1>looking at a note notebook and figuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how many dimensions there are </v>

2712
02:07:48.611 --> 02:07:51.520
<v Speaker 1>potentially in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the masonic is.</v>

2713
02:07:51.521 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 1>The original version is string theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're on superstring theory or</v>

2714
02:07:55.031 --> 02:07:57.430
<v Speaker 1>supersymmetric string theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2715
02:07:57.431 --> 02:07:59.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a push back about this stuff.</v>

2716
02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:00.253
<v Speaker 5>People and I don't know if the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that push back or smart enough to </v>

2717
02:08:03.171 --> 02:08:06.500
<v Speaker 5>actually be hanging in there with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>dudes and their ideas.</v>

2718
02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:08.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too,</v>

2719
02:08:08.391 --> 02:08:09.350
<v Speaker 5>it's way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2720
02:08:09.351 --> 02:08:11.750
<v Speaker 5>way over my head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see them talking about this stuff.</v>

2721
02:08:11.751 --> 02:08:13.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a fucking clue.</v>

2722
02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:17.060
<v Speaker 5>The all the stuff that fascinates me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that fascinates me for sure.</v>

2723
02:08:17.061 --> 02:08:18.440
<v Speaker 5>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2724
02:08:18.441 --> 02:08:19.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the word?</v>

2725
02:08:19.971 --> 02:08:21.500
<v Speaker 5>A theorial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so.</v>

2726
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:24.380
<v Speaker 5>It's so misty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like you can grab it,</v>

2727
02:08:25.190 --> 02:08:26.023
<v Speaker 5>but the quantum physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the guys who are actually studying </v>

2728
02:08:29.811 --> 02:08:33.200
<v Speaker 5>things like the guys who were looking at</v>
<v Speaker 5>subatomic things,</v>

2729
02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:36.270
<v Speaker 5>that fascinates me like where they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually like the,</v>

2730
02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:40.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like things being in a state of movement</v>

2731
02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.900
<v Speaker 5>and then being still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2732
02:08:41.901 --> 02:08:42.734
<v Speaker 5>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've discovered that and subatomic </v>

2733
02:08:44.061 --> 02:08:46.000
<v Speaker 5>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called a superstate.</v>

2734
02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:48.830
<v Speaker 5>There's moving and still at the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2735
02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:50.780
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

2736
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:52.820
<v Speaker 5>They don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were observing it.</v>

2737
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:55.520
<v Speaker 5>They're observing particles blink in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of existence.</v>

2738
02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:56.953
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm sure that it has some </v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematical computations that go along </v>

2739
02:08:59.031 --> 02:08:59.864
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the bottom line is they're aCtually </v>

2740
02:09:00.441 --> 02:09:03.290
<v Speaker 5>observing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't something that,</v>

2741
02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:04.393
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're writing down on notebooks and </v>

2742
02:09:05.331 --> 02:09:07.490
<v Speaker 5>you can't get it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2743
02:09:07.570 --> 02:09:08.403
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know what the fuck they're </v>

2744
02:09:09.351 --> 02:09:10.730
<v Speaker 5>getting at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are,</v>

2745
02:09:10.731 --> 02:09:11.564
<v Speaker 5>these are people observing subatomic </v>
<v Speaker 5>particles blinking in and out of </v>

2746
02:09:15.891 --> 02:09:17.510
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know where they're going.</v>

2747
02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:20.690
<v Speaker 5>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is where scientists are going,</v>

2748
02:09:20.691 --> 02:09:25.691
<v Speaker 5>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the smallest visible matter in earth,</v>

2749
02:09:29.150 --> 02:09:30.290
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the universe,</v>

2750
02:09:30.291 --> 02:09:33.530
<v Speaker 5>the smallest of the smallest measurable </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter,</v>

2751
02:09:33.531 --> 02:09:36.890
<v Speaker 5>subatomic particles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's magic.</v>

2752
02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:38.773
<v Speaker 5>So when you get to the very bottom to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get to the smallest thing that we can </v>

2753
02:09:42.231 --> 02:09:43.064
<v Speaker 5>currently observe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at things that perform </v>

2754
02:09:46.281 --> 02:09:49.310
<v Speaker 5>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go in and out of existence,</v>

2755
02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:52.130
<v Speaker 5>they're there and they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're still in.</v>

2756
02:09:52.131 --> 02:09:52.964
<v Speaker 5>They're moving there like a god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like a crazy magician that like </v>

2757
02:09:59.241 --> 02:10:04.241
<v Speaker 5>a psychedelic trip at the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 5>measurable amount of reality.</v>

2758
02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.550
<v Speaker 5>The universe behaves like a magic trick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking amazing.</v>

2759
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:15.170
<v Speaker 5>It's mostly nothing like an atom is </v>
<v Speaker 5>mostly nothing.</v>

2760
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:17.383
<v Speaker 1>It's probably still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably does a trick to the eye of </v>

2761
02:10:19.191 --> 02:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>not being able to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your navy could be,</v>

2762
02:10:21.591 --> 02:10:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think if they're using an </v>
<v Speaker 1>item,</v>

2763
02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:23.714
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They using some pretty sophisticated </v>

2764
02:10:25.131 --> 02:10:27.080
<v Speaker 1>equipment right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure.</v>

2765
02:10:27.081 --> 02:10:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Or</v>

2766
02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:32.200
<v Speaker 5>this thing somehow or another disappears</v>
<v Speaker 5>and reappears and they don't know how.</v>

2767
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:33.351
<v Speaker 5>And you might.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2768
02:10:33.351 --> 02:10:34.184
<v Speaker 5>They might be able to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>better and better equipment than 10 </v>

2769
02:10:36.321 --> 02:10:37.071
<v Speaker 5>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>

2770
02:10:37.071 --> 02:10:39.100
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not what we were saying.</v>

2771
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:41.030
<v Speaker 5>We were seeing this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally possible,</v>

2772
02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:44.240
<v Speaker 5>but they're all saying it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they're right,</v>

2773
02:10:44.530 --> 02:10:46.690
<v Speaker 5>if mean this is not only a debated </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

2774
02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:50.540
<v Speaker 5>like the fact that subatomic particles </v>
<v Speaker 5>blink in and out of existence,</v>

2775
02:10:50.541 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 5>I think all those super smart dudes </v>
<v Speaker 5>except that shit.</v>

2776
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:55.100
<v Speaker 5>That's magic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2777
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:58.010
<v Speaker 5>they're going away and coming back like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the fuck are they going?</v>

2778
02:10:58.011 --> 02:11:00.600
<v Speaker 5>what's happening in there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's that thing moving?</v>

2779
02:11:00.601 --> 02:11:01.371
<v Speaker 5>Instill?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2780
02:11:01.371 --> 02:11:04.610
<v Speaker 5>it just is what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you looking at?</v>

2781
02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Discovery by the large hadron collider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ,</v>

2782
02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:13.300
<v Speaker 3>or not enough official discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the new theory?</v>

2783
02:11:13.690 --> 02:11:14.523
<v Speaker 3>Large hadron collider set to discover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discover fifth dimension and doorway to </v>

2784
02:11:18.371 --> 02:11:20.710
<v Speaker 3>other universes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>

2785
02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:24.670
<v Speaker 3>This is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a movie.</v>

2786
02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:29.360
<v Speaker 5>They're going to open that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>doorway and those grades are going to Be</v>

2787
02:11:29.361 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 5>waiting on the other side.</v>

2788
02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:33.210
<v Speaker 3>You can take your exit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any eggs?</v>

2789
02:11:33.970 --> 02:11:34.803
<v Speaker 3>If you have eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take you middle of the </v>

2790
02:11:38.441 --> 02:11:40.780
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speaking of eggs,</v>

2791
02:11:40.781 --> 02:11:41.614
<v Speaker 3>did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's one of those places that </v>

2792
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:48.610
<v Speaker 3>gets like sperm and eggs and I made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person with three people's dna.</v>

2793
02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:51.100
<v Speaker 3>No one wants to hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

2794
02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:55.480
<v Speaker 5>They combined the dna of three people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2795
02:11:55.590 --> 02:11:58.740
<v Speaker 5>through in vitro fertilization made a </v>
<v Speaker 5>baby.</v>

2796
02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:00.173
<v Speaker 5>so the baby was born.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a baby born with the dna of </v>

2797
02:12:02.911 --> 02:12:04.770
<v Speaker 5>three people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not two people,</v>

2798
02:12:04.770 --> 02:12:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but three people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they mix it?</v>

2799
02:12:06.211 --> 02:12:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Like gargling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't know.</v>

2800
02:12:09.450 --> 02:12:10.283
<v Speaker 3>They just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just put it on this in the bitches </v>

2801
02:12:12.901 --> 02:12:14.850
<v Speaker 3>mouth and tell her to gargle and spit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cup.</v>

2802
02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Don't use that word pitch and this show </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so rude.</v>

2803
02:12:18.450 --> 02:12:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2804
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:24.360
<v Speaker 3>where did that take place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That baby was born in like Russia is her</v>

2805
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:26.400
<v Speaker 3>name came up on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just googled it.</v>

2806
02:12:26.401 --> 02:12:29.610
<v Speaker 3>There's an actual faq on web md about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2807
02:12:29.611 --> 02:12:30.480
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2808
02:12:30.481 --> 02:12:32.560
<v Speaker 3>What are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Babies definitely gay or no,</v>

2809
02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.300
<v Speaker 3>I've found another article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a gay gladiator.</v>

2810
02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:39.630
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be the most handsome about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technique is safe on.</v>

2811
02:12:39.690 --> 02:12:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three person babies.</v>

2812
02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Ivf technique safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2813
02:12:43.321 --> 02:12:44.190
<v Speaker 3>If you say so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2814
02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:46.050
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to take your word for it.</v>

2815
02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know wHat that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's safe.</v>

2816
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:49.950
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how many people have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>born.</v>

2817
02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.033
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a real good study group?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said 500 eggs from 64 donor women found </v>

2818
02:12:55.441 --> 02:12:58.460
<v Speaker 3>that the new procedure did not adversely</v>
<v Speaker 3>affect embryo development.</v>

2819
02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:01.160
<v Speaker 5>That's what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now when that baby grows up to read your</v>

2820
02:13:01.161 --> 02:13:03.140
<v Speaker 5>fucking mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got a problem.</v>

2821
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if They put chips in these kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they were little like killed.</v>

2822
02:13:07.131 --> 02:13:09.550
<v Speaker 5>Chips were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know how this is gonna work out</v>

2823
02:13:09.570 --> 02:13:11.780
<v Speaker 5>just in cases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude goes on a murderous rampage.</v>

2824
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.853
<v Speaker 5>We want to be able to have a button that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can press that just shuts them off </v>

2825
02:13:15.681 --> 02:13:17.090
<v Speaker 5>because if you have a designer baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

2826
02:13:17.091 --> 02:13:19.520
<v Speaker 5>your baby could be like a super athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super genius,</v>

2827
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:23.900
<v Speaker 5>but we don't know longterm consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you agree to this,</v>

2828
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:27.440
<v Speaker 5>we'll put the chip and your baby and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you a kill switch.</v>

2829
02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:30.110
<v Speaker 5>So if your baby goes on a rampage of it </v>
<v Speaker 5>all goes wrong.</v>

2830
02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:32.570
<v Speaker 5>We'll give a kill switch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the parents of the babies,</v>

2831
02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:33.404
<v Speaker 5>a super baby was going to be pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How come these fucking regular babies </v>

2832
02:13:35.401 --> 02:13:36.240
<v Speaker 5>don't have a kill switch?</v>

2833
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.073
<v Speaker 5>You think about all the goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 5>murderers that have ever existed all </v>

2834
02:13:39.241 --> 02:13:41.400
<v Speaker 5>throughout time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of them were super babies,</v>

2835
02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:45.210
<v Speaker 5>so you're blaming my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're blaming my super kids for all the</v>

2836
02:13:45.211 --> 02:13:46.044
<v Speaker 5>shit you regular kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you want my kid to have a fucking </v>

2837
02:13:48.181 --> 02:13:49.050
<v Speaker 5>chip?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can kill them.</v>

2838
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got to have a chip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can kill them.</v>

2839
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.863
<v Speaker 5>So we all signed an agreement because we</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to keep the people safe from the </v>

2840
02:13:53.731 --> 02:13:54.564
<v Speaker 5>super baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so everybody signs an agreement that </v>

2841
02:13:55.651 --> 02:13:58.590
<v Speaker 5>everybody has a chip in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their head and we all were chips,</v>

2842
02:13:58.920 --> 02:13:59.753
<v Speaker 5>regular baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super babies and everybody just say so </v>

2843
02:14:01.861 --> 02:14:02.694
<v Speaker 5>polite because you're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrified that the government is going </v>

2844
02:14:05.771 --> 02:14:07.380
<v Speaker 5>to come along and kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Switch,</v>

2845
02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:09.080
<v Speaker 5>chip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the.</v>

2846
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.090
<v Speaker 5>That's the key to a healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>happy society.</v>

2847
02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:15.060
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's terrified of getting your </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill switch hit.</v>

2848
02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:16.793
<v Speaker 5>ThAt's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why we have to look forward to </v>

2849
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:18.570
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2850
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:19.403
<v Speaker 6>Close to the house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember that movie gattica with ethan </v>

2851
02:14:22.171 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 6>hawke and they have a kIll switch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't kill switch,</v>

2852
02:14:24.631 --> 02:14:27.090
<v Speaker 6>but when you're born you're either valid</v>
<v Speaker 6>or invalid,</v>

2853
02:14:27.091 --> 02:14:27.924
<v Speaker 6>I think is what it was and like the tie </v>
<v Speaker 6>the society and invalid do all the rest </v>

2854
02:14:33.061 --> 02:14:34.260
<v Speaker 6>of the shit work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

2855
02:14:34.290 --> 02:14:37.090
<v Speaker 6>He likes chicks himself to become a </v>
<v Speaker 6>valid in some way.</v>

2856
02:14:37.091 --> 02:14:38.490
<v Speaker 6>That's how the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the movie's all about.</v>

2857
02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:40.460
<v Speaker 6>He tricks his code.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2858
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:42.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gets a fake fingerprint hair,</v>

2859
02:14:42.610 --> 02:14:44.850
<v Speaker 6>fake eyes and all this shit and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>those sensors.</v>

2860
02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:47.520
<v Speaker 6>This is the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>late nineties.</v>

2861
02:14:47.521 --> 02:14:48.354
<v Speaker 6>I feel like for</v>

2862
02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:49.273
<v Speaker 5>if somebody creates a synthetic person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who told me this synthetic person's not </v>

2863
02:14:52.011 --> 02:14:55.520
<v Speaker 5>going to have a kill switch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you don'T know,</v>

2864
02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:57.380
<v Speaker 5>if you don't know what that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>capable of.</v>

2865
02:14:57.410 --> 02:14:59.600
<v Speaker 5>Like if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there is one option.</v>

2866
02:14:59.750 --> 02:15:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Like what if they tried to pass it </v>
<v Speaker 5>through congress congress like fuck you.</v>

2867
02:15:03.290 --> 02:15:04.310
<v Speaker 5>And then someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2868
02:15:04.311 --> 02:15:09.311
<v Speaker 5>there's this solution would if every </v>
<v Speaker 5>synthetic kid is born with a kill switch</v>

2869
02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:11.180
<v Speaker 5>and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2870
02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:12.620
<v Speaker 5>well it's reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's reasonable.</v>

2871
02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:14.193
<v Speaker 5>And then everybody by 2070 we're all </v>
<v Speaker 5>born with a kill switch is no more </v>

2872
02:15:17.781 --> 02:15:18.614
<v Speaker 5>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every now and then someone freaks out </v>

2873
02:15:19.701 --> 02:15:21.920
<v Speaker 5>and they just zap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drop them,</v>

2874
02:15:22.190 --> 02:15:23.840
<v Speaker 5>chop them up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feed it to the garden.</v>

2875
02:15:25.610 --> 02:15:26.443
<v Speaker 6>I'm remembering that other movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that justin timberlake movie where he's </v>

2876
02:15:28.251 --> 02:15:32.330
<v Speaker 6>got a time to end time now everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 6>25 and then they all die.</v>

2877
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:33.283
<v Speaker 5>You watch too many movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The so future movie that you made a </v>

2878
02:15:36.771 --> 02:15:39.380
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>the concept is really good.</v>

2879
02:15:39.381 --> 02:15:41.660
<v Speaker 5>Movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Timberlake did a bunch of movies.</v>

2880
02:15:41.661 --> 02:15:45.140
<v Speaker 5>He was actually actually a good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alpha dog or something else.</v>

2881
02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:47.450
<v Speaker 5>It was in something else too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good actor.</v>

2882
02:15:49.970 --> 02:15:50.810
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kimberly,</v>

2883
02:15:50.890 --> 02:15:52.590
<v Speaker 6>it will be in time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a really cool concept.</v>

2884
02:15:52.591 --> 02:15:55.260
<v Speaker 6>Once you get 20 fIve,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you stop aging and then your,</v>

2885
02:15:55.290 --> 02:15:57.090
<v Speaker 6>your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your whatever,</v>

2886
02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:01.770
<v Speaker 6>a year of life starts going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's all the currency to you.</v>

2887
02:16:01.771 --> 02:16:03.720
<v Speaker 6>Work for time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can trade time,</v>

2888
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:06.600
<v Speaker 6>you spend time and then once your time </v>
<v Speaker 6>is up,</v>

2889
02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:07.553
<v Speaker 6>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But people have thousands of centuries </v>

2890
02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:11.130
<v Speaker 6>of years built up on their little clock.</v>

2891
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:14.010
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like a sultan of Brunei or some super</v>

2892
02:16:14.011 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 5>rich centuries and centurIes live </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>

2893
02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:17.973
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

2894
02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:21.453
<v Speaker 5>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this we're talking about when it </v>

2895
02:16:23.591 --> 02:16:26.250
<v Speaker 5>comes to the future about what could </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen like these,</v>

2896
02:16:26.290 --> 02:16:30.670
<v Speaker 5>these silly science fiction movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they probably in comparison to how crazy</v>

2897
02:16:30.671 --> 02:16:31.540
<v Speaker 5>it's actually going to be</v>

2898
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:37.490
<v Speaker 3>playing vr know you've got to play the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dunkin's vr.</v>

2899
02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.670
<v Speaker 3>How awesome was that on the gary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it scary?</v>

2900
02:16:40.671 --> 02:16:41.900
<v Speaker 3>Awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scary,</v>

2901
02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:44.040
<v Speaker 5>awesome and awesome in a way where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2902
02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:44.840
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

2903
02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.890
<v Speaker 5>Not like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew I had goggles on.</v>

2904
02:16:47.250 --> 02:16:48.083
<v Speaker 5>I knew I was playing a video game where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're on a castle and these little </v>

2905
02:16:51.121 --> 02:16:53.400
<v Speaker 5>cartoons are bouncing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You shoot bows and arrows.</v>

2906
02:16:53.401 --> 02:16:54.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've played that one </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>

2907
02:16:54.630 --> 02:16:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2908
02:16:54.930 --> 02:16:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't played it,</v>

2909
02:16:55.921 --> 02:16:57.330
<v Speaker 3>but I know what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun.</v>

2910
02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2911
02:16:57.730 --> 02:16:59.380
<v Speaker 5>so part of it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

2912
02:16:59.381 --> 02:17:02.110
<v Speaker 5>this is so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's another party that goes,</v>

2913
02:17:02.111 --> 02:17:03.430
<v Speaker 5>you know where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2914
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 5>Where this has gone in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not that far of a time.</v>

2915
02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:10.960
<v Speaker 5>You got to think when we were watChing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that phonograph ones.</v>

2916
02:17:10.961 --> 02:17:12.100
<v Speaker 5>That photograph from jamie.</v>

2917
02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2918
02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:17.050
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's give it 1880,</v>

2919
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:18.100
<v Speaker 3>let's say 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>18.</v>

2920
02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Think about 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 to 2016.</v>

2921
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:21.573
<v Speaker 5>That's not very fucking long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've gone from a phonograph to a </v>

2922
02:17:25.451 --> 02:17:28.420
<v Speaker 5>fake world in what,</v>

2923
02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:30.190
<v Speaker 3>a couple hundred years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2924
02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:32.710
<v Speaker 3>what a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2925
02:17:32.770 --> 02:17:37.770
<v Speaker 3>We're in it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why this election is happening.</v>

2926
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why this thing is so ridiculous.</v>

2927
02:17:40.050 --> 02:17:40.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be that it's happening right </v>

2928
02:17:41.771 --> 02:17:42.604
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The playstation just release their </v>

2929
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:47.920
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality today or last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2930
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:50.230
<v Speaker 3>so now that's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for the first time.</v>

2931
02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:53.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a price point that's going to hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>the masses.</v>

2932
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to see a lot more people</v>

2933
02:17:56.141 --> 02:17:57.640
<v Speaker 3>are going to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2934
02:17:57.641 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 3>so this was a huge day yesterday and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one of the games that come,</v>

2935
02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.153
<v Speaker 3>comes with that I believe is where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're underwater and it's not really a </v>

2936
02:18:05.831 --> 02:18:07.810
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just hanging out in a shark,</v>

2937
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:10.960
<v Speaker 3>comes close to you and you get attacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a shark.</v>

2938
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:13.150
<v Speaker 3>But I guess it's so scary that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2939
02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:18.200
<v Speaker 3>oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just the atari 2,600</v>

2941
02:18:19.781 --> 02:18:23.140
<v Speaker 3>what is going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to be insane if it hasn't</v>

2942
02:18:23.141 --> 02:18:24.100
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2943
02:18:24.101 --> 02:18:25.930
<v Speaker 3>we both remember pong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2945
02:18:27.671 --> 02:18:29.650
<v Speaker 3>But when it first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were amazed.</v>

2946
02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:31.990
<v Speaker 3>You can actually interact with something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's on the tv.</v>

2947
02:18:31.991 --> 02:18:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was insane.</v>

2948
02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:36.990
<v Speaker 5>That was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was so crazy and wasn't that bIg.</v>

2949
02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:38.153
<v Speaker 5>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look how little it is when we plan and </v>

2950
02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.720
<v Speaker 5>you stick a cartridge in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

2955
02:18:53.251 --> 02:18:56.480
<v Speaker 5>amount of time is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've got a,</v>

2956
02:18:56.481 --> 02:18:57.314
<v Speaker 5>a giant jump of progress in 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what the fuck is it going to be in </v>

2957
02:19:04.291 --> 02:19:05.430
<v Speaker 5>less than 200 years?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>yesterday or this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2965
02:19:17.770 --> 02:19:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Says you won't get into a wreck and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't need a helmet.</v>

2966
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:21.830
<v Speaker 3>it balances itself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Explain that.</v>

2970
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.500

<v Speaker 3>Nothing can record.</v>

2971

<v Speaker 3>someone in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just below in pollution,</v>

3065
02:23:45.141 --> 02:23:45.974

3103
02:25:19.970 --> 02:25:23.060
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that we have in our life.</v>

3104
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:24.190

<v Speaker 5>any freedom,</v>

3109
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.903
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once we stopped letting people drive </v>

3110
02:25:36.221 --> 02:25:37.840
<v Speaker 5>their own car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was just.</v>

3111
02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:39.610
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>road rage,</v>

3112
02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:40.473
<v Speaker 5>death stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing and it was worth it </v>

3113
02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:45.970
<v Speaker 5>alone to lose that freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know why your road rage right?</v>

3114
02:25:46.450 --> 02:25:47.440
<v Speaker 5>In a way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Road rage,</v>

3115
02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:49.593
<v Speaker 5>road rage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're scared when you get in </v>

3116
02:25:51.511 --> 02:25:54.790
<v Speaker 5>the car and you're going fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're senses are heightened.</v>

3117
02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:58.000
<v Speaker 5>You know your senses are heightened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything is dangerous.</v>

3118
02:25:58.001 --> 02:26:00.820
<v Speaker 5>You don't feel it because you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just chilling going on the road,</v>

3119
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 5>but you're super aware that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>fast.</v>

3120
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:05.380
<v Speaker 5>You're super aware.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people around you.</v>

3121
02:26:05.381 --> 02:26:06.790
<v Speaker 5>They're also in these metal boxes.</v>

3122
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:09.250
<v Speaker 5>You got to trust these idiots to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your lane.</v>

3123
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:12.640
<v Speaker 5>You're already on level eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when someone gets in front of you,</v>

3124
02:26:12.641 --> 02:26:13.474
<v Speaker 5>even if it's like nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why people don't get road rage </v>

3125
02:26:16.001 --> 02:26:16.834
<v Speaker 5>when they're walking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're walking in the mall and </v>

3126
02:26:18.821 --> 02:26:20.710
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of a lot of people and someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets in front of you,</v>

3127
02:26:20.711 --> 02:26:21.790
<v Speaker 5>you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

3128
02:26:21.791 --> 02:26:22.624
<v Speaker 5>Don't give a fuck at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever give a fuck if somebody </v>

3129
02:26:24.281 --> 02:26:26.680
<v Speaker 5>walks past you and get them in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you with the mall?</v>

3130
02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:29.200
<v Speaker 5>They're just walking down the hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one gives A shit.</v>

3131
02:26:29.410 --> 02:26:31.210
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's something about being in the</v>

3132
02:26:31.211 --> 02:26:32.044
<v Speaker 5>car that your senses are super </v>
<v Speaker 5>heightened up because you're worried </v>

3133
02:26:34.301 --> 02:26:36.370
<v Speaker 5>about the consequences of someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>crashed into you.</v>

3134
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:38.260
<v Speaker 5>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck dude,</v>

02:26:38.350 --> 02:26:39.183
<v Speaker 5>fuck box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's where all that shit comes </v>

3136
02:26:41.651 --> 02:26:42.940
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you pull over bitch,</v>

<v Speaker 5>pull over bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's where all that shit cut.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Your life's on the line when it's really</v>

3139

<v Speaker 5>a minor fender bender or a minor traffic</v>
<v Speaker 5>infraction or minor rudeness where </v>

02:26:56.471 --> 02:26:58.810
<v Speaker 5>someone cut you off were they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to.</v>

3141
02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:01.510

<v Speaker 5>bit and got behind you.</v>

3142
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.650

<v Speaker 1>road rage in a fucking fuck you with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other guy drunk.</v>

3259
02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:33.133
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cutting each other off and you just </v>

3260
02:32:34.931 --> 02:32:37.300
<v Speaker 1>get clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go flying through the air.</v>

3261
02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:40.750
<v Speaker 1>People are angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too many of us,</v>

3262
02:32:40.810 --> 02:32:41.643
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile you get in a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fly over the country like a space </v>

3263
02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>while we all huddled up while we fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>huddled up so much because the ocean,</v>

3264
02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:52.113
<v Speaker 1>we need to figure out a way to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking salt out of the ocean in big </v>

3265
02:32:55.481 --> 02:32:57.820
<v Speaker 1>pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pump it to the middle where everything's</v>

3266
02:32:57.821 --> 02:33:00.070
<v Speaker 1>dry and let's fix this.</v>

3267
02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.560
<v Speaker 1>We do have a lot of desalinization </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

3268
02:33:02.561 --> 02:33:05.490
<v Speaker 1>If you look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a super expensive and slow.</v>

3269
02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:08.020
<v Speaker 1>They're not that efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult process.</v>

3270
02:33:08.021 --> 02:33:09.760
<v Speaker 1>It's very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth it,</v>

3271
02:33:10.090 --> 02:33:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even not worth it with water,</v>

3272
02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:17.650
<v Speaker 1>as jesse ventura was saying on before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water being more expensive than oil.</v>

3273
02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It's still not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the salt out of the water.</v>

3274
02:33:20.050 --> 02:33:20.883
<v Speaker 1>That's how hard the process is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of ironic right next to the </v>

3275
02:33:23.801 --> 02:33:24.910
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a water problem.</v>

3276
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really stop and thInk about it,</v>

3277
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.943
<v Speaker 1>but the like when you're flying over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look down at like some of the big </v>

3278
02:33:34.391 --> 02:33:36.250
<v Speaker 1>dry spots on the way to vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3279
02:33:36.251 --> 02:33:39.910
<v Speaker 1>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't you boIl the water out right now?</v>

3280
02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Kind of go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>

3281
02:33:42.310 --> 02:33:43.900
<v Speaker 1>What am I thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That boy not boil.</v>

3282
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:45.063
<v Speaker 1>Boil spring water or pond water or lake </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and you kill most of the shit </v>

3283
02:33:49.421 --> 02:33:50.254
<v Speaker 1>that's in there.</v>

3284
02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:52.180
<v Speaker 1>There's some shit that can survive that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3285
02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:53.133
<v Speaker 1>They have all these water filters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people take when they're like hardcore </v>

3286
02:33:55.181 --> 02:33:56.014
<v Speaker 1>backpackers shit in it and drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most recently I got really into like </v>

3287
02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:05.470
<v Speaker 1>hardcore backpackers because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this one podcast where they</v>

3288
02:34:05.471 --> 02:34:07.270
<v Speaker 1>were talking about the appalachian </v>
<v Speaker 1>trail.</v>

3289
02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:08.483
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appalachian trail is a trail that goes </v>

3290
02:34:10.901 --> 02:34:13.720
<v Speaker 1>from Georgia all the way to Maine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they walk.</v>

3291
02:34:13.721 --> 02:34:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It takes five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3292
02:34:16.061 --> 02:34:16.894
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wear the clothes the entire </v>

3293
02:34:18.671 --> 02:34:20.350
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live off their backpack.</v>

3294
02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was listening to you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3295
02:34:22.931 --> 02:34:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is nuts,</v>

3296
02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:27.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has a nutty way to live.</v>

3297
02:34:27.011 --> 02:34:27.844
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how crazy accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people think they're bad ass by </v>

3298
02:34:30.191 --> 02:34:33.940
<v Speaker 1>doing a marathon do to run 26 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took me four hours,</v>

3299
02:34:33.941 --> 02:34:34.774
<v Speaker 1>but I've perseverance now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are walking to main and </v>

3300
02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:39.680
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things.</v>

3301
02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Once you start something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're kind of committed to it,</v>

3302
02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of committed to the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3303
02:34:44.851 --> 02:34:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fringes did not the whole thing,</v>

3304
02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:49.540

<v Speaker 1>for five days.</v>

3305
02:34:49.541 --> 02:34:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Like last weekend I think he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marine but they just went and camped and</v>

3306
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:57.880
<v Speaker 1>you just put up facebook message like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a hammock but it's 37 degrees.</v>

3307
02:34:57.890 --> 02:34:58.723
<v Speaker 1>It's raining and we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point was they don't know where </v>

3308
02:35:02.561 --> 02:35:03.394
<v Speaker 1>they're getting their water from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of them bring filters and they </v>

3309
02:35:06.311 --> 02:35:07.144
<v Speaker 1>have these things that they hang there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different kinds of </v>

3310
02:35:09.461 --> 02:35:11.980
<v Speaker 1>filters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them actually are straws and you</v>

3311
02:35:11.981 --> 02:35:12.814
<v Speaker 1>can take it and you actually dip into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pond and suck it through the straw and </v>

3312
02:35:15.851 --> 02:35:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you can drink it and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones where they're gravity filters</v>

3313
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:22.240
<v Speaker 1>and they have these like buckets and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

3314
02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:23.333
<v Speaker 1>If it gets filtered out of the water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it comes down to it comes out </v>

3315
02:35:25.181 --> 02:35:27.010
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting man,</v>

3316
02:35:27.011 --> 02:35:27.844
<v Speaker 1>because these people are using like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best state of the art survival </v>

3317
02:35:32.561 --> 02:35:35.650
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of shit and just drinking</v>

3330
02:36:06.161 --> 02:36:06.994
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people.</v>

3331
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Leo machida did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like kind of famous for drinking </v>

3332
02:36:10.241 --> 02:36:13.330
<v Speaker 1>your own business and so I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this about?</v>

3333
02:36:13.331 --> 02:36:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And I drank it a couple of times and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking after I drank it,</v>

3334
02:36:17.021 --> 02:36:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I just drank my piss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the cup and then we make.</v>

3338
02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:32.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the dude incidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no name.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the dude who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>

3341
02:36:38.470 --> 02:36:39.303
<v Speaker 1>How ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inappropriate when we're about to do </v>

3342
02:36:40.871 --> 02:36:45.871
<v Speaker 1>something really stupid because we feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

3343
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:52.660
<v Speaker 1>We clicked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just download it.</v>

3344
02:36:54.650 --> 02:36:55.483
<v Speaker 1>But you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on fear factor for so </v>

3345
02:36:58.641 --> 02:37:01.970
<v Speaker 1>long and he couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3346
02:37:01.971 --> 02:37:04.880
<v Speaker 1>He was hurl and don't be a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

3347
02:37:04.930 --> 02:37:07.670
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make deal</v>

3348
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:23.780
<v Speaker 5>old school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old school.</v>

3349
02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:24.913
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why point was about </v>

3350
02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:26.631
<v Speaker 5>drinking piss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3351
02:37:26.631 --> 02:37:28.280
<v Speaker 5>it's not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all in your head.</v>

3352
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:30.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like eating roaches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing.</v>

3353
02:37:30.350 --> 02:37:31.183
<v Speaker 5>It's all in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of bugs that we </v>

3354
02:37:32.841 --> 02:37:34.010
<v Speaker 5>serve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People on fear factor.</v>

3355
02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:36.650
<v Speaker 5>They didn't taste bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They barely tasted like anything.</v>

3356
02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:38.810
<v Speaker 5>Like spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of spiders.</v>

3357
02:37:38.811 --> 02:37:39.531
<v Speaker 5>We ate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3358
02:37:39.531 --> 02:37:42.080
<v Speaker 5>spiders are um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're cousins of crabs,</v>

3359
02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:45.020
<v Speaker 5>lobsters and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3360
02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:46.520
<v Speaker 5>oysters taste bad.</v>

3361
02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:49.150
<v Speaker 4>Oysters are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is amazing that we eat oysters.</v>

3362
02:37:49.151 --> 02:37:49.984
<v Speaker 4>Like just pulling them out of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just open them up and just like </v>

3363
02:37:52.871 --> 02:37:53.810
<v Speaker 4>sucked down this</v>

3364
02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:57.360
<v Speaker 5>slimy vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is kinda like that,</v>

3365
02:37:57.930 --> 02:37:59.000
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

3366
02:37:59.490 --> 02:38:00.323
<v Speaker 4>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know how lobsters switched from </v>

3367
02:38:00.971 --> 02:38:03.940
<v Speaker 4>being like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say poor people's food,</v>

3368
02:38:03.941 --> 02:38:06.640
<v Speaker 4>but I thought that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't make the change.</v>

3369
02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:07.813
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3370
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:11.750
<v Speaker 5>it all happened when lobsters used to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a bar food.</v>

3371
02:38:12.170 --> 02:38:14.660
<v Speaker 5>They used to go to the east river and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the turn of the century,</v>

3372
02:38:14.810 --> 02:38:15.643
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like in the 18 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the early 19 hundreds and they would </v>

3373
02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:19.873
<v Speaker 5>cast out for lobsters and catch them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>feed them to people that were like </v>

3374
02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:23.203
<v Speaker 5>hungry at bars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was taught to be like garbage </v>

3375
02:38:25.371 --> 02:38:26.204
<v Speaker 5>food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere along the line probably the </v>

3376
02:38:27.951 --> 02:38:30.380
<v Speaker 5>supplied dwindled because they overfish </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3377
02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:31.813
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3378
02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:32.753
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was reading this thing about diamonds </v>

3379
02:38:34.551 --> 02:38:38.660
<v Speaker 5>the other day and how they managed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep diamond super valuable when they're</v>

3380
02:38:38.661 --> 02:38:39.494
<v Speaker 5>not really rare anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fascinating that they recognize </v>

3381
02:38:42.321 --> 02:38:43.154
<v Speaker 5>it coming and that diamond production up</v>
<v Speaker 5>until the time they discovered these </v>

3382
02:38:46.581 --> 02:38:47.414
<v Speaker 5>mines in South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was diamond production was </v>

3383
02:38:50.001 --> 02:38:51.620
<v Speaker 5>very small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>few pounds a year,</v>

3384
02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:54.770
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden they just hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>the motherload.</v>

3385
02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:56.690
<v Speaker 5>They just found so many diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They realize,</v>

3386
02:38:56.691 --> 02:38:58.340
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>diamonds are just weird,</v>

3387
02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:01.610
<v Speaker 5>like they're not valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they formed this giant group,</v>

3388
02:39:01.611 --> 02:39:03.530
<v Speaker 5>the debaters group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they said,</v>

3389
02:39:03.531 --> 02:39:04.364
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just hoard all these fucking diamonds </v>

3390
02:39:05.151 --> 02:39:08.510
<v Speaker 5>control all the diamond mining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We decide that they're still valuable,</v>

3391
02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:09.883
<v Speaker 5>so because they don't release them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they keep mining them and so they </v>

3392
02:39:12.021 --> 02:39:15.590
<v Speaker 5>have way more diamonds than they sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the amount of diamonds,</v>

3393
02:39:15.591 --> 02:39:16.424
<v Speaker 5>the diamonds they sell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then diamonds are worth a fuck load </v>

3394
02:39:18.861 --> 02:39:20.180
<v Speaker 5>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they.</v>

3395
02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:21.230
<v Speaker 5>They're rare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3396
02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:22.790
<v Speaker 5>They split,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sell them all the time.</v>

3397
02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:24.830
<v Speaker 5>They sell them as if they're rare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they couldn't be rare.</v>

3398
02:39:24.831 --> 02:39:26.780
<v Speaker 5>If there were that rare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't be selling so many of them.</v>

3399
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.883
<v Speaker 5>Like how many do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They essentially have an unlimited </v>

3400
02:39:28.971 --> 02:39:31.150
<v Speaker 5>supply of diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're making an outline.</v>

3401
02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:32.033
<v Speaker 4>Times are so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so rare that we found this diamond </v>

3402
02:39:35.010 --> 02:39:35.431
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

3403
02:39:35.431 --> 02:39:37.350
<v Speaker 4>you got a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got warehouses full of them.</v>

3404
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:41.610
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like the sunglasses and </v>
<v Speaker 4>glasses industry are all owned,</v>

3405
02:39:41.611 --> 02:39:43.800
<v Speaker 4>like all the known,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ray bans,</v>

3406
02:39:43.801 --> 02:39:46.050
<v Speaker 4>oakleys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all owned by one company,</v>

3407
02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:46.913
<v Speaker 4>so they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like glasses shouldn't be that </v>

3408
02:39:48.751 --> 02:39:50.840
<v Speaker 4>expensive or sunglass shouldn't be that </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive.</v>

3409
02:39:50.841 --> 02:39:54.720
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of sunglass companies do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are all owned by the same company.</v>

3410
02:39:54.721 --> 02:39:55.920
<v Speaker 4>If you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look it up,</v>

3411
02:39:55.921 --> 02:39:57.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many,</v>

3412
02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:58.810
<v Speaker 4>how many different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be competitive.</v>

3413
02:39:58.811 --> 02:40:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You watch those on a tv show,</v>

3414
02:40:00.631 --> 02:40:04.050
<v Speaker 4>that guy like a whole big breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big video of the whole thing.</v>

3415
02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:05.110
<v Speaker 4>I'll look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3416
02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:09.630
<v Speaker 4>even what's weird is that like companies</v>
<v Speaker 4>held out like oakley was like,</v>

3417
02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:12.120
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna.</v>

3418
02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:13.440
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna to</v>

3419
02:40:14.390 --> 02:40:15.230
<v Speaker 3>africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

3420
02:40:15.231 --> 02:40:16.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like the store was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3421
02:40:16.130 --> 02:40:18.330
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to carry this brand </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they won't,</v>

3422
02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:20.710
<v Speaker 3>they're not a part of our company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3423
02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:21.563
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they just ended up buying oakley </v>

3424
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:24.023
<v Speaker 3>and then raising the price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like ray bands used to be cheap glasses </v>

3425
02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:27.743
<v Speaker 3>and then when they bought ray ban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pumped it up to like now you can </v>

3426
02:40:30.341 --> 02:40:32.930
<v Speaker 3>buy a ray ban and like 200 bucks for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3427
02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:34.133
<v Speaker 3>And what did they used to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be just like the cheap </v>

3428
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:38.790
<v Speaker 3>glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a $10 glass or something like that.</v>

3429
02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:39.693
<v Speaker 3>Turns out a single company control </v>
<v Speaker 3>several of the outlets where you buy </v>

3430
02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:44.340
<v Speaker 3>eyeglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3431
02:40:44.341 --> 02:40:46.530
<v Speaker 3>So they control the outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did they own the company?</v>

3432
02:40:46.531 --> 02:40:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have on the company.</v>

3433
02:40:48.001 --> 02:40:52.170
<v Speaker 3>So they also own lens crafters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also own sunglass hut or any of the</v>

3434
02:40:52.171 --> 02:40:54.780
<v Speaker 3>sunglass stores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They own everything.</v>

3435
02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:56.610
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty slick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3436
02:40:56.611 --> 02:40:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Because how many people</v>

3437
02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.353
<v Speaker 5>buy sunglasses from those sunglass huts?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where a lot of people buy them </v>

3438
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:03.543
<v Speaker 5>right statement to snopes.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The company said it's sales account for </v>

3439
02:41:08.171 --> 02:41:11.770
<v Speaker 5>only 10 percent of the frame sold </v>
<v Speaker 5>worldwide's shouldn't snopes.com</v>

3440
02:41:11.771 --> 02:41:12.341
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

3441
02:41:12.341 --> 02:41:14.830
<v Speaker 5>conclude that regardless of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure,</v>

3442
02:41:14.831 --> 02:41:15.664
<v Speaker 5>much of adam's ruins everything's </v>
<v Speaker 5>assessment of luxottica's market </v>

3443
02:41:19.631 --> 02:41:21.760
<v Speaker 5>dominance was accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3444
02:41:21.761 --> 02:41:22.594
<v Speaker 5>so that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adam ruins everything show interesting </v>

3445
02:41:24.310 --> 02:41:25.540
<v Speaker 5>fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>

3446
02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:26.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3447
02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:28.570
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

3448
02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:31.390
<v Speaker 5>some of the stuff that he gets on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really a really,</v>

3449
02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:35.560
<v Speaker 5>it's a well measured take that some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people disagree with.</v>

3450
02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:36.933
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was one that steven crowder just </v>

3451
02:41:41.621 --> 02:41:45.610
<v Speaker 5>was mocking one and he had some really </v>
<v Speaker 5>good points.</v>

3452
02:41:45.770 --> 02:41:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Car dealership is one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes.</v>

3453
02:41:47.781 --> 02:41:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea about car dealerships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about illegal</v>

3454
02:41:50.810 --> 02:41:51.643
<v Speaker 5>ration and he was talking about how the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fence wouldn't help and the fence </v>

3455
02:41:55.581 --> 02:41:56.414
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't help because only I think it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like a certain percentage of the </v>

3456
02:42:04.011 --> 02:42:07.550
<v Speaker 5>people that got into the country came to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the country by foot.</v>

3457
02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:13.250
<v Speaker 5>It was something like only like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 5>60 percent came in by foot.</v>

3458
02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.720
<v Speaker 5>So the idea was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

3459
02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:16.093
<v Speaker 5>see if you could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is interesting statistics because </v>

3460
02:42:18.831 --> 02:42:21.110
<v Speaker 5>it means a lot of people came in by </v>
<v Speaker 5>foot.</v>

3461
02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:23.240
<v Speaker 5>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fence would definitely stop that.</v>

3462
02:42:23.241 --> 02:42:26.180
<v Speaker 5>Like it wouldn't stop everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by the own,</v>

3463
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:27.043
<v Speaker 5>the definition of the own show explored,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would stop a large number of people </v>

3464
02:42:31.930 --> 02:42:32.700
<v Speaker 5>you see it.</v>

3465
02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:34.450
<v Speaker 3>But it probably just changed people </v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

3466
02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:36.780
<v Speaker 3>But I'm trying to find the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the numbers.</v>

3467
02:42:37.290 --> 02:42:39.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's 60 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the numbers are.</v>

3468
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:40.743
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to louder with crowder is </v>

3469
02:42:41.401 --> 02:42:42.234
<v Speaker 3>website explains it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the not just in the video but in the </v>

3470
02:42:44.911 --> 02:42:47.130
<v Speaker 3>actual description of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has the numbers.</v>

3471
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.170
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't that 60 percent though?</v>

3472
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Like if there was a wall just fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

3473
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess we have to fly now.</v>

3474
02:42:52.530 --> 02:42:55.020
<v Speaker 5>It's not that easy to fly though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's super hard to fly.</v>

3475
02:42:55.021 --> 02:42:57.200
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that it's really easy to </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk across that stage.</v>

3476
02:42:57.230 --> 02:43:00.510
<v Speaker 5>The idea that offense would help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's something even weirder.</v>

3477
02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:01.613
<v Speaker 5>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dominick.</v>

3478
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:04.260
<v Speaker 5>Pete dominick from the stand up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>pete dominick,</v>

3479
02:43:04.261 --> 02:43:07.980
<v Speaker 5>I think radio show on sirius.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what this show is called.</v>

3480
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:10.260
<v Speaker 5>Forgive me if I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He um,</v>

3481
02:43:10.470 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 5>he was saying the actual</v>

3482
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:14.770
<v Speaker 1>amount of mexicans that immigrate to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

3483
02:43:14.771 --> 02:43:15.880
<v Speaker 1>like the net amount and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3484
02:43:15.881 --> 02:43:17.320
<v Speaker 1>they go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who goes here?</v>

3485
02:43:17.321 --> 02:43:18.154
<v Speaker 1>Who there is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's even like the same </v>

3486
02:43:22.001 --> 02:43:23.260
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go over there as,</v>

3487
02:43:23.261 --> 02:43:24.094
<v Speaker 1>come over here.</v>

3488
02:43:25.860 --> 02:43:26.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how do they know that in plus are </v>

3489
02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:29.333
<v Speaker 4>all those people just killed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like are people that go down there to </v>

3490
02:43:31.430 --> 02:43:35.250
<v Speaker 4>murder?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends on where they're going.</v>

3491
02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:36.950
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you got there?</v>

3492
02:43:36.951 --> 02:43:37.784
<v Speaker 6>Jamie doesn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just has a three paragraphs of like </v>

3493
02:43:41.810 --> 02:43:44.280
<v Speaker 6>his opinion of what the video is talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

3494
02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Does it have anything with numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No numbers at all?</v>

3495
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:48.423
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3496
02:43:49.090 --> 02:43:49.923
<v Speaker 1>Well he explains it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like play the beginning of the </v>

3497
02:43:52.751 --> 02:43:55.150
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it explains it in the clip.</v>

3498
02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:57.400
<v Speaker 1>It gets to it pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting.</v>

3499
02:43:58.570 --> 02:44:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just play it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting because it gets</v>

3500
02:44:02.681 --> 02:44:04.720
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird numbers of it pretty quick.</v>

3501
02:44:04.721 --> 02:44:06.970
<v Speaker 1>We can get this taken off without his </v>
<v Speaker 1>permission.</v>

3502
02:44:07.390 --> 02:44:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Can we play?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only brian and I can hear it.</v>

3503
02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Sorry fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll reenact what he says.</v>

3504
02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do?</v>

3505
02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Go to the beginning please.</v>

3506
02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:26.340
<v Speaker 6>It's a 32nd intro for.</v>

3507
02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 40 percent came here on planes.</v>

3508
02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill it.</v>

3509
02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:41.760
<v Speaker 1>You can kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I wanted to hear.</v>

3510
02:44:42.030 --> 02:44:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's 27 to 40 percent of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>came here on planes.</v>

3511
02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:51.320
<v Speaker 1>That means that between 60 and 73 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent came here walking like.</v>

3512
02:44:54.241 --> 02:44:56.430
<v Speaker 1>How would you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fence is not going to stop that.</v>

3513
02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:58.200
<v Speaker 1>We're in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3514
02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Which will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which even if we had a wall,</v>

3515
02:45:00.361 --> 02:45:04.470
<v Speaker 4>we mexicans are still allowed to come to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States to go on vacation,</v>

3516
02:45:04.471 --> 02:45:05.304
<v Speaker 4>aren't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3517
02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:06.870
<v Speaker 4>and that's all they're gonna do it.</v>

3518
02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:08.493
<v Speaker 1>They have one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If especially if I don't know how it </v>

3519
02:45:11.501 --> 02:45:12.334
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how you can get a visa or how you </v>

3520
02:45:13.451 --> 02:45:14.590
<v Speaker 1>don't get a visa to visit</v>

3521
02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:17.330
<v Speaker 4>some countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some countries are harder,</v>

3522
02:45:17.331 --> 02:45:19.310
<v Speaker 4>but Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States ain't that hard.</v>

3523
02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:20.173
<v Speaker 4>But going into like philippinEs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trying to get it can I try to </v>

3524
02:45:22.430 --> 02:45:24.820
<v Speaker 4>remember them when I tried to rescue a </v>
<v Speaker 4>filipino woman,</v>

3525
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:29.060
<v Speaker 4>but she was killed by that tsunami.</v>

<v Speaker 4>get approved because they know they're </v>

3528
02:45:34.191 --> 02:45:35.690
<v Speaker 4>not coming back to the Philippines.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>

3530
02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:38.993

<v Speaker 1>really super poor part of the world and </v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a road there.</v>

3537
02:45:56.701 --> 02:46:00.140
<v Speaker 1>They have to find a reason why you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come over and visit video.</v>

3538
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I saw recently people climbing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>

3539
02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3540
02:46:03.500 --> 02:46:06.650
<v Speaker 6>And then they take the kind of stocks </v>
<v Speaker 6>and notice they're caught on camera.</v>

3541
02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:08.090
<v Speaker 6>So they run and climbed back over.</v>

3542
02:46:09.340 --> 02:46:10.030
<v Speaker 1>well they've got</v>

3543
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:13.150
<v Speaker 7>backpacks on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They look over at the camera.</v>

3544
02:46:15.490 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 1>The guy got a cell phone near his ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3545
02:46:17.950 --> 02:46:21.300
<v Speaker 6>I assume there are drug runners,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know that that's necessarily</v>

3546
02:46:21.470 --> 02:46:24.740
<v Speaker 1>because they have those backpacks so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they climbed back over again.</v>

3547
02:46:24.860 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It's that easy.</v>

3548
02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:27.030
<v Speaker 6>Skip,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll skip ahead.</v>

3549
02:46:27.031 --> 02:46:27.420
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

3550

<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

3556
02:46:39.850 --> 02:46:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Grab in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3558
02:46:42.641 --> 02:46:45.130
<v Speaker 1>they're talking and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering their face.</v>

3559
02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3560
02:46:51.870 --> 02:46:54.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to climb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was easy</v>

3561
02:46:55.150 --> 02:46:58.070
<v Speaker 6>clock showing you how fast it takes to </v>
<v Speaker 6>take 10 seconds.</v>

3562
02:46:58.750 --> 02:47:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those dudes are like,</v>

3563
02:47:02.310 --> 02:47:03.143
<v Speaker 1>they're like little acrobats to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have that kind of hand strength to </v>

3564
02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:08.890
<v Speaker 1>pin down those things and climate like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3565
02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:10.023
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fucking impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just holding onto those </v>

3566
02:47:13.711 --> 02:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3567
02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3568
02:47:16.980 --> 02:47:19.890
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the news caster catching them?</v>

3569
02:47:20.510 --> 02:47:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty god.</v>

3570
02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:24.793
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>

3571
02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:27.600
<v Speaker 1>She's very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were on the wrong side of the dirt.</v>

3572
02:47:28.770 --> 02:47:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3573
02:47:29.671 --> 02:47:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're on the wrong side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dirt.</v>

3574
02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at all those nice people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around corpus christi,</v>

3575
02:47:35.550 --> 02:47:38.400
<v Speaker 1>partying it up down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dodging bullets,</v>

3576
02:47:38.970 --> 02:47:39.803
<v Speaker 1>going fucking bull fights and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird that we just decide </v>

3577
02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:47.130
<v Speaker 1>that people are born in the wrong batch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dirt.</v>

3578
02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:49.510
<v Speaker 4>Drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially with the mexicans.</v>

3579
02:47:49.511 --> 02:47:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I just love all my mexican friends and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything like that.</v>

3580
02:47:51.611 --> 02:47:53.380
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3581
02:47:53.470 --> 02:47:55.750
<v Speaker 4>like trump just pisses me off when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to that.</v>

3582
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:57.000
<v Speaker 4>He's a string,</v>

3583
02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing's very strange.</v>

3584
02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:01.373
<v Speaker 1>I just have the crazy feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the last gasps of this </v>

3585
02:48:04.371 --> 02:48:05.204
<v Speaker 1>silly system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take a few more election </v>

3586
02:48:07.591 --> 02:48:10.920
<v Speaker 1>cycles before completely mpo implodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

3587
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:11.783
<v Speaker 1>some disasters occurrence has to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place for someone comes up with an </v>

3588
02:48:14.521 --> 02:48:18.900
<v Speaker 1>alternative method that people embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's got to be something like it's not.</v>

3589
02:48:19.210 --> 02:48:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to keep going like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and can't,</v>

3590
02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:24.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why we're down to these two.</v>

3591
02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants that gig.</v>

3592
02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:29.420
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be how long until it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer program.</v>

3593
02:48:30.930 --> 02:48:32.900
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not the worst idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty years.</v>

3594
02:48:32.901 --> 02:48:33.734
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a siri that's just is common </v>

3595
02:48:35.331 --> 02:48:36.164
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks up facts and figures and it </v>

3596
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:40.610
<v Speaker 4>tells you what the best answer is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that situation.</v>

3597
02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3598
02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:41.653
<v Speaker 1>not only that may be instead of you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting down and making one impulsive </v>

3599
02:48:45.651 --> 02:48:48.140
<v Speaker 1>choice as to who's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader of the free world.</v>

3600
02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you want to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing the next leader,</v>

3601
02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to interface with the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then asked to talk to you about your</v>

3602
02:48:56.331 --> 02:48:57.164
<v Speaker 1>wants and your needs and desires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to find a solution that's </v>

3603
02:49:00.951 --> 02:49:01.784
<v Speaker 1>mutually compatible with ethics and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires of all the people that are </v>

3604
02:49:04.491 --> 02:49:05.324
<v Speaker 1>attached to the system so they run the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires of all the people that are </v>

3605
02:49:08.491 --> 02:49:09.324
<v Speaker 1>attached to the system through some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ethics program where they try to </v>

3606
02:49:11.941 --> 02:49:12.774
<v Speaker 1>think about what's important and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unimportant and where people are just </v>

3607
02:49:15.001 --> 02:49:15.834
<v Speaker 1>being bitches and where people are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy and where people are being too </v>

3608
02:49:18.991 --> 02:49:22.170
<v Speaker 1>controlling and where and just figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

3609
02:49:22.530 --> 02:49:27.530
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way that you can concoct a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of government where a.</v>

3610
02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:28.913
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's profiting from being in charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as people say they won't do </v>

3611
02:49:32.221 --> 02:49:33.054
<v Speaker 1>that because there's just too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that profit from being in charge </v>

3612
02:49:34.921 --> 02:49:38.220
<v Speaker 1>and gigantic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's too valuable to be in charge.</v>

3613
02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:41.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you get off on doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you did a great job.</v>

3614
02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It's something you get off on doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you used it in a personal way to</v>

3615
02:49:46.141 --> 02:49:46.974
<v Speaker 1>enrich your own bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've figured out a way to use these </v>

3616
02:49:50.641 --> 02:49:54.300
<v Speaker 1>weird laws that you set up to suck a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of money out of the system.</v>

3617
02:49:54.570 --> 02:49:56.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're getting over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

3618
02:49:56.940 --> 02:49:58.150
<v Speaker 1>That's just all that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3619
02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:00.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason why they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

3620
02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:01.233
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else wants that gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be like a crazy person with </v>

3621
02:50:04.931 --> 02:50:05.764
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3622
02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:06.893
<v Speaker 1>an amazing view of yourself or you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to grab them by the pussy grabbing </v>

3623
02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>grabbed by the pussy man.</v>

3624
02:50:15.570 --> 02:50:16.403
<v Speaker 1>But imagine if he wins magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a president that talks about </v>

3625
02:50:18.511 --> 02:50:21.060
<v Speaker 1>grabbing chips by the posting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just so sick of him.</v>

3626
02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I just kept on it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of if,</v>

3627
02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:25.980
<v Speaker 1>if this is a simulation man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ending it good.</v>

3628
02:50:26.820 --> 02:50:30.780
<v Speaker 1>It's coming down nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see somebody.</v>

3629
02:50:30.781 --> 02:50:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have kania then trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3630
02:50:33.241 --> 02:50:34.074
<v Speaker 1>He's going to win next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be jesse ventura versus </v>

3631
02:50:35.941 --> 02:50:36.774
<v Speaker 1>conduit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might team up together to kanye </v>

3632
02:50:38.071 --> 02:50:38.904
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make jesse his running mate because </v>

3633
02:50:40.111 --> 02:50:41.730
<v Speaker 1>jesse like spent a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

3634
02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:43.133
<v Speaker 1>make some sort of a joint agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>where president kanye takes care of the </v>

3635
02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:49.800
<v Speaker 1>heavy lifting and then a vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ventura,</v>

3636
02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:51.473
<v Speaker 1>he just works his fanny pack and hangs </v>
<v Speaker 1>around Mexico and case needs me as calm </v>

3637
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:55.343
<v Speaker 1>on the phone because he doesn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone at least to try to get </v>

3638
02:50:57.151 --> 02:51:01.470
<v Speaker 1>somebody elected like one of our friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>like joey diaz or something next,</v>

3639
02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:07.050
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost coming down to that.</v>

3640
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason why kanye west really </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be president is because it is kind</v>

3641
02:51:10.891 --> 02:51:13.230
<v Speaker 1>of almost coming down to a popularity </v>
<v Speaker 1>contest,</v>

3642
02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:14.593
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost coming down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily have to be the </v>

3643
02:51:18.211 --> 02:51:19.044
<v Speaker 1>person who could do the job best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the person who the people love the </v>

3644
02:51:22.651 --> 02:51:25.020
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they can convince themselves,</v>

3645
02:51:25.021 --> 02:51:28.830
<v Speaker 1>can do a good enough job or who the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person can convince them,</v>

3646
02:51:28.831 --> 02:51:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but they'll do a good enough job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily the best person for</v>

3647
02:51:31.801 --> 02:51:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A popular person,</v>

3648
02:51:33.930 --> 02:51:38.520
<v Speaker 1>like if a guy like kanye west and kanye </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drake ran together for the children,</v>

3649
02:51:39.630 --> 02:51:41.550
<v Speaker 1>it might be they might win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3650
02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Kanye and jay z ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3651
02:51:44.650 --> 02:51:47.700
<v Speaker 1>What if nas runs for president nas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jay z?</v>

3652
02:51:47.701 --> 02:51:49.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a joint ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

3653
02:51:49.261 --> 02:51:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I might fucking vote for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might do that to nausea.</v>

3654
02:51:52.700 --> 02:51:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay z is a smart dude.</v>

3655
02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they would come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense,</v>

3656
02:51:56.970 --> 02:51:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but then jay z did have that streaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>music service.</v>

3657
02:51:59.020 --> 02:52:00.780
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't really good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it still does.</v>

3658
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't he still do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People buy stuff tight,</v>

3659
02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:06.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

3660
02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:09.880
<v Speaker 5>I think they're trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get bought by somebody else probably.</v>

3661
02:52:09.881 --> 02:52:10.810
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3662
02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:13.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's just trying to make a buck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got to take a chance.</v>

3663
02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:16.330
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>

3664
02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:19.210
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of fucking smart people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are super popular is my point.</v>

3665
02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:21.190
<v Speaker 5>If you can get really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really popular,</v>

3666
02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:22.430
<v Speaker 5>like george clooney,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

3667
02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:23.680
<v Speaker 5>If george clooney didn't run for </v>
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>

3668
02:52:23.681 --> 02:52:26.530
<v Speaker 5>he couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When george clooney can be the president</v>

3669
02:52:26.531 --> 02:52:29.260
<v Speaker 5>of this fucking country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt,</v>

3670
02:52:29.290 --> 02:52:33.050
<v Speaker 5>ronald reagan even sampled when now the </v>
<v Speaker 5>door's opened.</v>

3671
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:34.480
<v Speaker 5>Alec baldwin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3672
02:52:34.690 --> 02:52:36.370
<v Speaker 5>Because after all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grab the pussy stuff.</v>

3673
02:52:36.580 --> 02:52:37.413
<v Speaker 5>All that crazy shit that alec baldwin </v>
<v Speaker 5>did screaming at people calling them </v>

3674
02:52:39.221 --> 02:52:40.054
<v Speaker 5>faggots and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to have to remember that </v>

3675
02:52:41.891 --> 02:52:43.240
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The daughter stuff was terrible.</v>

3676
02:52:43.241 --> 02:52:43.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the daughter.</v>

3677
02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:44.703
<v Speaker 5>That was terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know why he could say he was </v>

3678
02:52:45.731 --> 02:52:47.140
<v Speaker 5>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He apologized.</v>

3679
02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:49.330
<v Speaker 5>They have a great relationship now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People forgive you.</v>

3680
02:52:49.331 --> 02:52:50.164
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if we look for a person who's </v>

3681
02:52:52.301 --> 02:52:53.134
<v Speaker 5>perfect to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to have a president </v>

3682
02:52:55.181 --> 02:52:58.090
<v Speaker 5>because there are no perfect people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everybody's been lying,</v>

3683
02:52:58.210 --> 02:52:59.043
<v Speaker 5>so we have to readjust our curve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our curves all fucked up because we've </v>

3684
02:53:01.751 --> 02:53:03.220
<v Speaker 5>been dealing with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians,</v>

3685
02:53:03.221 --> 02:53:04.054
<v Speaker 5>had been pretending to be someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not they've been lying about </v>

3686
02:53:05.441 --> 02:53:06.274
<v Speaker 5>everything they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've been lying about who's paying </v>

3687
02:53:07.751 --> 02:53:09.520
<v Speaker 5>them to do this and who they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>supporting,</v>

3688
02:53:09.521 --> 02:53:11.650
<v Speaker 5>where the money's coming from and why </v>
<v Speaker 5>they do it,</v>

3689
02:53:11.651 --> 02:53:12.484
<v Speaker 5>and there's unspoken arrangements that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have with certain people that pam </v>

3690
02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:18.400
<v Speaker 5>large sums of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't even have to say,</v>

3691
02:53:18.401 --> 02:53:19.234
<v Speaker 5>I want you to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's understood that you're going to do </v>

3692
02:53:21.671 --> 02:53:24.700
<v Speaker 5>things to support their interest because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've paid a shitload of money to help</v>

3693
02:53:24.701 --> 02:53:25.534
<v Speaker 5>you out and to pay you to come do these </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking speeches of these ridiculous </v>

3694
02:53:28.811 --> 02:53:29.080
<v Speaker 5>play.</v>

3695
02:53:29.080 --> 02:53:29.913
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to see a fucking bill </v>

3696
02:53:31.631 --> 02:53:33.550
<v Speaker 5>clinton speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's paying?</v>

3697
02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:35.710
<v Speaker 5>Who's paying for that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's,</v>

3698
02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:36.583
<v Speaker 5>who's excited about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's going to pay enough money to </v>

3699
02:53:38.831 --> 02:53:41.950
<v Speaker 5>justify a $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>hillary clinton's speech?</v>

3700
02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Who's paying that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's paying that?</v>

3701
02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:46.210
<v Speaker 5>A crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be like,</v>

3702
02:53:46.211 --> 02:53:48.640
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going to be the shit we have.</v>

3703
02:53:48.730 --> 02:53:51.610
<v Speaker 5>We have tickets to kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to see kiss.</v>

3704
02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:52.513
<v Speaker 5>They have a reunion tour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's not the real ace freely and </v>

3705
02:53:54.521 --> 02:53:57.370
<v Speaker 5>it's not the real peter chris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the fucking show is awesome,</v>

3706
02:53:57.371 --> 02:53:58.204
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing and then right after that </v>

3707
02:54:00.881 --> 02:54:04.840
<v Speaker 5>to top it off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hillary clinton is going to speak.</v>

3708
02:54:06.490 --> 02:54:07.323
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not something she can be a very </v>

3709
02:54:08.651 --> 02:54:09.484
<v Speaker 5>effective politician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to pay someone that much money to </v>

3710
02:54:12.941 --> 02:54:16.720
<v Speaker 5>speak like you just make it an obvious </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not.</v>

3711
02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:19.810
<v Speaker 5>That's not what a normal super famous </v>
<v Speaker 5>person gets.</v>

3712
02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:22.900
<v Speaker 5>They don't get $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>to speak at a luncheon.</v>

3713
02:54:23.050 --> 02:54:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Some comedians not that much clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you sell out madison square garden.</v>

3714
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:30.100
<v Speaker 5>You know there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's ticket sales.</v>

3715
02:54:30.101 --> 02:54:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Like if bill burst sells out madison </v>
<v Speaker 5>square garden,</v>

3716
02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:34.150
<v Speaker 5>he's going to get a giant chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

3717
02:54:34.151 --> 02:54:34.984
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that number is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's probably a giant chunk of </v>

3718
02:54:36.341 --> 02:54:37.174
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3719
02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:40.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure we could ask dane cook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dane cook sold out madison square garden</v>

3720
02:54:40.541 --> 02:54:42.280
<v Speaker 5>four times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3721
02:54:42.430 --> 02:54:44.830
<v Speaker 5>That's a giant chunk of money he must </v>
<v Speaker 5>have made,</v>

3722
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:48.160
<v Speaker 5>but he made it because people paid money</v>
<v Speaker 5>to see them,</v>

3723
02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:51.610
<v Speaker 5>like they want to see him entertain them</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the bankers really doing that.</v>

3724
02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:52.623
<v Speaker 5>Are they fucking psyched?</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have lighters up while she's </v>

3725
02:54:54.551 --> 02:54:57.460
<v Speaker 5>talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you talking about deregulation.</v>

3726
02:54:58.750 --> 02:54:59.360
<v Speaker 9>Fuck</v>

3727
02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:00.360
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hillary,</v>

3728
02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:01.463
<v Speaker 5>she's up there with a bite suit on like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a german shepherd is to jump out of the </v>

3729
02:55:03.651 --> 02:55:04.484
<v Speaker 5>back of a paddy wagon and bite her legs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and try to take her down wearing that </v>

3730
02:55:07.770 --> 02:55:12.770
<v Speaker 5>boxy bite suit the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the whole thing is ridiculous,</v>

3731
02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:16.230
<v Speaker 5>so it's so obvious.</v>

3732
02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:18.673
<v Speaker 5>These people are just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just running this thing the way </v>

3733
02:55:21.081 --> 02:55:23.480
<v Speaker 5>they've always been running this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just getting to see it.</v>

3734
02:55:23.481 --> 02:55:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Now we're getting to see it like really </v>
<v Speaker 5>super clear.</v>

3735
02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:27.733
<v Speaker 5>We're a real weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real weird to watch them scramble and </v>

3736
02:55:30.411 --> 02:55:31.244
<v Speaker 5>readjust and change and shift and move,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to be successful in the </v>

3737
02:55:36.081 --> 02:55:41.070
<v Speaker 5>world that those people run in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to be one of those people like.</v>

3738
02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:45.050
<v Speaker 5>That's why bernie sanders is shunned </v>
<v Speaker 5>because bernie sanders,</v>

3739
02:55:45.051 --> 02:55:47.990
<v Speaker 5>whether you agree with his politics or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you disagree with his politics,</v>

3740
02:55:48.180 --> 02:55:52.580
<v Speaker 5>and I agree with a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says he's an outsider.</v>

3741
02:55:52.700 --> 02:55:56.330
<v Speaker 5>They don't want that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy's not going to play ball.</v>

3742
02:55:56.360 --> 02:56:00.470
<v Speaker 5>That guy's going to talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be reasonable.</v>

3743
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:02.220
<v Speaker 5>He might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3744
02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:05.720
<v Speaker 5>anti capitalist to a certain extent to </v>
<v Speaker 5>some people,</v>

3745
02:56:06.290 --> 02:56:11.290
<v Speaker 5>but ultimately what he does represent is</v>
<v Speaker 5>some thing that's different than the way</v>

3746
02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:16.130
<v Speaker 5>things are running now and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not having that fuck that.</v>

3747
02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:19.640
<v Speaker 5>But he got closer than anybody like him </v>
<v Speaker 5>has ever gotten ever.</v>

3748
02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:24.500
<v Speaker 5>So I think if four more years of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever the fuck gets in qa,</v>

3749
02:56:24.770 --> 02:56:26.510
<v Speaker 5>you might want to go to Canada for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>

3750
02:56:27.350 --> 02:56:30.800
<v Speaker 5>just hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just go to vancouver and yeah,</v>

3751
02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:33.140
<v Speaker 5>who knows what the fuck's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen man.</v>

3752
02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:34.033
<v Speaker 5>I mean people are up in arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been watching exclusively fox news </v>

3753
02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:42.140
<v Speaker 5>because those are the people that think </v>
<v Speaker 5>the least liked me.</v>

3754
02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:43.153
<v Speaker 5>So I've been exclusively watching and </v>
<v Speaker 5>occasionally I agree with them on many </v>

3755
02:56:45.771 --> 02:56:46.604
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those are the people that I agree </v>

3756
02:56:48.741 --> 02:56:52.040
<v Speaker 5>with the lease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it is fascinating watching them.</v>

3757
02:56:52.041 --> 02:56:53.900
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trump debate.</v>

3758
02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:55.520
<v Speaker 5>I thought he's too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he's.</v>

3759
02:56:55.580 --> 02:56:56.413
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and two,</v>

3760
02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:59.930
<v Speaker 5>I thought hillary whooped him in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first one and I thought she.</v>

3761
02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:00.793
<v Speaker 5>She clearly outboxed him and out moved </v>
<v Speaker 5>him in the second one he did land a </v>

3762
02:57:04.761 --> 02:57:08.730
<v Speaker 5>devastating blow that you'd be in jail </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you'd be in jail.</v>

3763
02:57:08.730 --> 02:57:11.270
<v Speaker 5>I was devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like a total two point round.</v>

3764
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:13.250
<v Speaker 5>It was a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight round for sure.</v>

3765
02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:14.870
<v Speaker 5>He dropped her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got rocked.</v>

3766
02:57:15.140 --> 02:57:17.990
<v Speaker 5>Referee saved her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She saved by the bell there,</v>

3767
02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:22.400
<v Speaker 5>but other than that I think she won.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she's just,</v>

3768
02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:26.200
<v Speaker 5>she's just better at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got better economy of words unlike</v>

3769
02:57:26.210 --> 02:57:28.640
<v Speaker 5>me rambling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got.</v>

3770
02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:33.730
<v Speaker 5>She says her sentences more concisely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's more measured in her approach.</v>

3771
02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:35.053
<v Speaker 5>She's more disciplined in her </v>
<v Speaker 5>preparation to say that she didn't win </v>

3772
02:57:37.731 --> 02:57:38.840
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not fair.</v>

3773
02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:40.590
<v Speaker 5>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're.</v>

3774
02:57:40.670 --> 02:57:41.503
<v Speaker 5>So I'm watching these people just lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well obviously Donald Trump was the </v>

3775
02:57:45.501 --> 02:57:47.750
<v Speaker 5>winner of that debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there can be no doubt.</v>

3776
02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:48.670
<v Speaker 5>There could be no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3777
02:57:48.690 --> 02:57:50.120
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you really serious?</v>

3778
02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:51.890
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you guys are arguing?</v>

3779
02:57:52.750 --> 02:57:54.960
<v Speaker 4>It blows my fucking mind though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like like,</v>

3780
02:57:55.060 --> 02:57:59.080
<v Speaker 4>how are you watching the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and every person that was in the room</v>

3781
02:57:59.081 --> 02:58:00.160
<v Speaker 4>with me agreed with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3782
02:58:00.161 --> 02:58:01.890
<v Speaker 4>like how like if you were in the room,</v>

3783
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:04.650
<v Speaker 5>would we be both sitting there like </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting?</v>

3784
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:05.503
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's terms that he uses that you </v>

3785
02:58:07.591 --> 02:58:08.424
<v Speaker 5>should only use very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very sparingly because they indicate </v>

3786
02:58:14.071 --> 02:58:17.020
<v Speaker 5>that you're scrambling and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>

3787
02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:19.440
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to be honest with you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be honest with you.</v>

3788
02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:21.233
<v Speaker 5>This is A shame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find this to be a shame like that to </v>

3789
02:58:23.311 --> 02:58:24.450
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>says he's,</v>

3790
02:58:24.540 --> 02:58:26.580
<v Speaker 5>he's in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in the moment,</v>

3791
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:29.100
<v Speaker 5>but he's free ball and a little bit he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>free balling.</v>

3792
02:58:29.580 --> 02:58:30.413
<v Speaker 5>She's not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's saying the America that we see in </v>

3793
02:58:33.541 --> 02:58:34.374
<v Speaker 5>front of us is not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is the best that we can find in </v>

3794
02:58:37.801 --> 02:58:38.634
<v Speaker 5>the world today and I'm proud to be an </v>
<v Speaker 5>american and she says this stuff with </v>

3795
02:58:41.911 --> 02:58:44.450
<v Speaker 5>the right inflection and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

3796
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:45.383
<v Speaker 5>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google news crew can choose going to </v>

3797
02:58:47.530 --> 02:58:49.290
<v Speaker 5>ruin this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that,</v>

3798
02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:50.670
<v Speaker 5>but that's not what the debate is.</v>

3799
02:58:50.730 --> 02:58:53.460
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would a debate is some sort of a contest</v>

3800
02:58:53.461 --> 02:58:57.060
<v Speaker 5>of words or it's a battle of words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a battle of ideas.</v>

3801
02:58:57.061 --> 02:58:59.670
<v Speaker 5>It's battle concepts about of words and </v>
<v Speaker 5>personalities.</v>

3802
02:58:59.671 --> 02:59:02.280
<v Speaker 5>Importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did everything wrong in that respect,</v>

3803
02:59:02.490 --> 02:59:04.560
<v Speaker 5>looming over her and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective.</v>

3804
02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:06.300
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

3805
02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:08.250
<v Speaker 5>she didn't take the bait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't engage.</v>

3806
02:59:08.251 --> 02:59:10.710
<v Speaker 5>She laughed and smiled when he said </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous shit.</v>

3807
02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:11.753
<v Speaker 5>Even when he said you'd be in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she walked off and jusT stood there as </v>

3808
02:59:14.881 --> 02:59:16.500
<v Speaker 5>if nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she had.</v>

3809
02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:17.933
<v Speaker 5>She had a great reaction to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not whether or not she'd be a </v>

3810
02:59:21.151 --> 02:59:23.940
<v Speaker 5>better president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to judge a debate like a</v>

3811
02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:27.290
<v Speaker 5>game of tic tac toe or checkers or you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3812
02:59:27.390 --> 02:59:28.223
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or some sort of a thing that you're </v>

3813
02:59:30.391 --> 02:59:32.910
<v Speaker 5>sCoring your scoring this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the people,</v>

3814
02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:35.700
<v Speaker 5>it's like a team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You watch it on online.</v>

3815
02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:36.533
<v Speaker 5>Sixty seven percent think mr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Secretary of state clinton won the </v>

3816
02:59:40.291 --> 02:59:41.124
<v Speaker 5>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the trump supporters feel </v>

3817
02:59:42.361 --> 02:59:44.310
<v Speaker 5>differently and then you go to these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and they're like,</v>

3818
02:59:44.311 --> 02:59:45.660
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt he was strong.</v>

3819
02:59:45.810 --> 02:59:48.120
<v Speaker 5>I felt like what he said and that one </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

3820
02:59:48.450 --> 02:59:50.560
<v Speaker 5>you go to jail that really rang with </v>
<v Speaker 5>moo,</v>

3821

<v Speaker 5>moo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>moo,</v>

3822
02:59:51.661 --> 02:59:52.494
<v Speaker 5>and see all these people that they've </v>
<v Speaker 5>chosen that it kind of interesting or </v>

3823
02:59:55.711 --> 02:59:56.544
<v Speaker 5>controversial or stupid or that one guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the crazy sweater they had that </v>

02:59:59.911 --> 03:00:02.940
<v Speaker 5>poor bastard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have some poor bastard with a giant</v>

3825
03:00:02.941 --> 03:00:03.774
<v Speaker 5>red sweater and he stood out there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he saId his name and so his name became </v>

3826
03:00:07.531 --> 03:00:09.570
<v Speaker 5>like a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sweater became a meme.</v>

3827
03:00:09.571 --> 03:00:12.240
<v Speaker 5>That sweater sold out everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All over the world.</v>

3828
03:00:12.241 --> 03:00:13.074
<v Speaker 5>Like instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are going to be that guy for </v>

<v Speaker 5>halloween now.</v>

3833
03:00:21.420 --> 03:00:23.460
<v Speaker 5>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking.</v>

3834
03:00:23.710 --> 03:00:25.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a game and it's an entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

3835
03:00:26.220 --> 03:00:27.053
<v Speaker 5>That's what these debates are and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>giant hustle and this is what I'm </v>

3836
03:00:29.791 --> 03:00:30.624
<v Speaker 5>sending out saying this a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 5>theory sort of a way because I think </v>

3837
03:00:32.311 --> 03:00:34.620
<v Speaker 5>we're hustling ourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want this hustle.</v>

3838
03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:36.120
<v Speaker 5>This is a hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all want to say,</v>

3839
03:00:36.121 --> 03:00:36.954
<v Speaker 5>we all want to pretend that he's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to fix it or we don't want to pretend </v>

3840
03:00:38.671 --> 03:00:42.140
<v Speaker 5>that she's going to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all want to pretend it's a.</v>

3841
03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:44.850
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird show.</v>

3842
03:00:45.370 --> 03:00:48.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird show and we're watching </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people improvise right in front of</v>

3843
03:00:48.871 --> 03:00:51.080
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones,</v>

3844
03:00:51.150 --> 03:00:54.390
<v Speaker 5>response to it was very upsetting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was wonderful.</v>

3845
03:00:54.450 --> 03:00:55.830
<v Speaker 5>Alex johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally,</v>

3846
03:00:55.890 --> 03:00:57.690

<v Speaker 5>she's a demon from hell.</v>

3847
03:00:57.990 --> 03:01:00.850
<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've flies land on her head.</v>

3848
03:01:01.870 --> 03:01:03.720
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we seen flies,</v>

3849
03:01:04.170 --> 03:01:06.090
<v Speaker 5>talked to people who are on the scene.</v>

3850
03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:10.390
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking beat red sky purple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>red face.</v>

3851
03:01:10.420 --> 03:01:13.540
<v Speaker 5>thursday evens demons are real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was crying.</v>

3852
03:01:14.070 --> 03:01:15.340
<v Speaker 5>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>

3853
03:01:15.341 --> 03:01:16.960
<v Speaker 5>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that.</v>

3854
03:01:17.010 --> 03:01:19.990
<v Speaker 5>That was upset and he's taken it to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right place.</v>

3855
03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:22.510
<v Speaker 5>I think he's just gone full parody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go.</v>

3856
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:24.970
<v Speaker 5>Just get so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's perfect.</v>

3857
03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.440
<v Speaker 5>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3858
03:01:26.441 --> 03:01:30.430
<v Speaker 5>Just give people just a little more than</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can swallow.</v>

3859
03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:31.293
<v Speaker 5>I'm choking back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The irony and the crazy is making even </v>

3860
03:01:35.081 --> 03:01:38.050
<v Speaker 5>like the serious conspiracy theories </v>
<v Speaker 5>reconsider their position,</v>

3861
03:01:38.470 --> 03:01:39.303
<v Speaker 5>which I think is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is also the best argument that he </v>

3862
03:01:41.971 --> 03:01:42.804
<v Speaker 5>psyops that he's actually cia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nsa undercover to discredit the entire </v>

3863
03:01:48.341 --> 03:01:51.360
<v Speaker 5>truth or movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you understand?</v>

3864
03:01:52.210 --> 03:01:55.020
<v Speaker 5>I went down to rabbit holes last night </v>
<v Speaker 5>to tower seven rabbit hole.</v>

3865
03:01:55.021 --> 03:01:58.690
<v Speaker 5>So I went down the explanation tower </v>
<v Speaker 5>seven rabbit hole,</v>

3866
03:01:58.691 --> 03:01:59.524
<v Speaker 5>which I found to be very plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I went down the other rabbit </v>

3867
03:02:04.121 --> 03:02:07.960
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is actual scientists that are uh,</v>

3868
03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:11.140
<v Speaker 5>saying that nine slash 11 was absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 5>a controlled demolition.</v>

3869
03:02:11.470 --> 03:02:13.810
<v Speaker 5>And it's really weird man because one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

3870
03:02:13.811 --> 03:02:15.550
<v Speaker 5>the scientist guys who's given this </v>
<v Speaker 5>lecture,</v>

3871
03:02:15.551 --> 03:02:16.384
<v Speaker 5>I forget the gentleman's name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's a professor emeritus of some </v>

3872
03:02:18.521 --> 03:02:23.080
<v Speaker 5>university which means a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a professor and then he retired,</v>

3873
03:02:23.081 --> 03:02:25.450
<v Speaker 5>but they allow him to keep his title and</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep his office.</v>

3874
03:02:26.260 --> 03:02:28.080
<v Speaker 5>And this dude is off his rocker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>

3875
03:02:28.130 --> 03:02:32.050
<v Speaker 5>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's to our speeches about tower seven,</v>

3876
03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:33.753
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about free fall speed and thermite and </v>

3877
03:02:36.251 --> 03:02:39.610
<v Speaker 5>all these different chemicals that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>found in the wreckage.</v>

3878
03:02:39.611 --> 03:02:43.870
<v Speaker 5>And he's just obsessed with this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And apparently he's not the only one.</v>

3879
03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:46.820
<v Speaker 5>There's thousands of different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least a thousand.</v>

3880
03:02:46.900 --> 03:02:47.733
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like 1500 or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>architects and engineers in that nine </v>

3881
03:02:50.831 --> 03:02:55.750
<v Speaker 5>slash 11 truth thing that think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nine slash 11 was an inside job or tower</v>

3882
03:02:55.751 --> 03:02:58.000
<v Speaker 5>seven was a controlled demolition or </v>
<v Speaker 5>both.</v>

3883
03:02:58.001 --> 03:02:58.834
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a spectrum of belief systems </v>

3884
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:02.650
<v Speaker 5>that's involved in the nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 5>truther movement.</v>

3885
03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:03.873
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people think that there's a lot of </v>

3886
03:03:05.801 --> 03:03:08.680
<v Speaker 5>nuts to think that planes didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>really hit the towers,</v>

3887
03:03:08.681 --> 03:03:12.520
<v Speaker 5>that there were explosions and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's other people that think that the</v>

3888
03:03:12.521 --> 03:03:13.354
<v Speaker 5>towers were rigged and that they rigged </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things like years in advance and </v>

3889
03:03:17.321 --> 03:03:18.154
<v Speaker 5>they remember seeing these maintenance </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and they were like these </v>

3890
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.943
<v Speaker 5>nefarious maintenance people are setting</v>
<v Speaker 5>up through my bombs all throughout the </v>

3891
03:03:23.681 --> 03:03:24.514
<v Speaker 5>beams of the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then there's this other video that </v>

3892
03:03:26.411 --> 03:03:27.244
<v Speaker 5>shows how how easily things weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A under fire shows a bunch of shit </v>

3893
03:03:31.991 --> 03:03:34.060
<v Speaker 5>collapsing under fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including a bridge.</v>

3894
03:03:34.330 --> 03:03:35.163
<v Speaker 5>There was one where a bridge collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 5>just because of a fire underneath the </v>

3895
03:03:37.031 --> 03:03:37.864
<v Speaker 5>bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The steel and the bridge heated up too </v>

3896
03:03:39.011 --> 03:03:43.480
<v Speaker 5>much and just couldn't support the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weight and apparently what is explaining</v>

3897
03:03:43.481 --> 03:03:46.930
<v Speaker 5>is that people think that steel melts at</v>
<v Speaker 5>a certain temperature,</v>

3898
03:03:46.931 --> 03:03:51.250
<v Speaker 5>which is very true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's significantly weakens way lower</v>

3899
03:03:51.310 --> 03:03:53.230
<v Speaker 5>at a way lower temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it melts.</v>

3900
03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:55.950
<v Speaker 5>So they were showing all these different</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that,</v>

3901
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:58.100
<v Speaker 5>that collapsed just fall</v>

3902
03:03:58.100 --> 03:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>down to just give up just like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower seven did.</v>

3903
03:04:02.060 --> 03:04:02.893
<v Speaker 1>But it's fun to think that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil genius that lives in a mountain </v>

3904
03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:10.040
<v Speaker 1>that rigged all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's laughing in a pile of money</v>

3905
03:04:11.090 --> 03:04:12.620
<v Speaker 1>because he got away with it 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

3906
03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:16.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they opened a walmart in burbank,</v>

3907
03:04:16.340 --> 03:04:17.320
<v Speaker 4>thank god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3908
03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:22.380
<v Speaker 4>and I was excited and I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided I hate mom and pop businesses.</v>

3909
03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:26.110
<v Speaker 4>It just because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See people working for the sheep,</v>

3910
03:04:26.340 --> 03:04:27.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just nice.</v>

3911
03:04:27.690 --> 03:04:28.523
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you go there thinking it's in </v>

3912
03:04:30.411 --> 03:04:31.244
<v Speaker 4>burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the suburban nicer areas of los </v>

3913
03:04:32.931 --> 03:04:33.800
<v Speaker 4>angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No way.</v>

3914
03:04:33.801 --> 03:04:37.070
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be the same people that go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a walmart in burbank.</v>

3915
03:04:37.071 --> 03:04:37.731
<v Speaker 4>Then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3916
03:04:37.731 --> 03:04:40.880
<v Speaker 4>you see on the internet or no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

3917
03:04:40.881 --> 03:04:43.160
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like flies on poop.</v>

3918
03:04:43.390 --> 03:04:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>all the walmart's on black friday and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then trump loses.</v>

3935
03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:30.833
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if we got to a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>wHere we had to start killing people </v>

3936
03:05:33.751 --> 03:05:34.584
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just way too many people </v>

3937
03:05:35.611 --> 03:05:37.290
<v Speaker 1>and there's no other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In China.</v>

3938
03:05:37.320 --> 03:05:38.153
<v Speaker 1>We got a call people the same way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to call wolves and the greater </v>

3939
03:05:41.341 --> 03:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>

3940
03:05:44.941 --> 03:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

3941
03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3942
03:05:47.460 --> 03:05:49.290
<v Speaker 1>we're keep overpopulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3943
03:05:49.530 --> 03:05:51.540
<v Speaker 1>We're at 7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They project,</v>

3944
03:05:51.630 --> 03:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I think they project 8 billion by 2050.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they said.</v>

3945
03:05:55.800 --> 03:05:56.633
<v Speaker 1>See if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

3946
03:05:57.010 --> 03:06:00.400
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of middle states though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got a lot of room.</v>

3947
03:06:00.401 --> 03:06:00.930
<v Speaker 4>We just got it.</v>

3948
03:06:00.930 --> 03:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the water right that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about this,</v>

3949
03:06:02.821 --> 03:06:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the desalinization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't fill up those areas,</v>

3950
03:06:05.220 --> 03:06:08.880
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that there's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>come a time if we survive,</v>

3951
03:06:08.881 --> 03:06:10.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say if there's no super volcanoes,</v>

3952
03:06:10.801 --> 03:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>no asteroid impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no plague,</v>

3953
03:06:12.801 --> 03:06:15.270
<v Speaker 1>no nuclear war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we avoid all that shit.</v>

3954
03:06:16.020 --> 03:06:18.150
<v Speaker 1>You know the water is going to ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to move in.</v>

3955
03:06:18.151 --> 03:06:18.984
<v Speaker 1>We'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coast to just be in a different </v>

3956
03:06:19.831 --> 03:06:22.140
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big of a deal.</v>

3957
03:06:22.470 --> 03:06:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a big deal obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the,</v>

3958
03:06:24.061 --> 03:06:26.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not a kill off the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big a deal.</v>

3959
03:06:27.330 --> 03:06:30.870
<v Speaker 1>So if it keeps going and we keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology keeps getting better,</v>

3960
03:06:31.090 --> 03:06:33.450
<v Speaker 1>we Just keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep making people,</v>

3961
03:06:33.660 --> 03:06:34.493
<v Speaker 1>we just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep the numbers keep rising and </v>

3962
03:06:36.591 --> 03:06:39.060
<v Speaker 1>rising and rising and then we get to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like $30 million,</v>

3963
03:06:39.330 --> 03:06:40.260
<v Speaker 1>$40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

3964
03:06:40.470 --> 03:06:44.310
<v Speaker 1>$50 million and we have real problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we don't have enough food,</v>

3965
03:06:44.340 --> 03:06:46.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough space.</v>

3966
03:06:47.760 --> 03:06:48.593
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do?</v>

3967
03:06:51.030 --> 03:06:52.500
<v Speaker 4>Make food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's already a thing.</v>

3968
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:54.270
<v Speaker 4>What about gil?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid people.</v>

3969
03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3970
03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:55.980
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

3971
03:06:55.980 --> 03:06:57.510
<v Speaker 3>can't say that because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitler wanted.</v>

3972
03:06:58.280 --> 03:06:59.113
<v Speaker 3>He had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had some good ideas and some bad </v>

3973
03:07:00.151 --> 03:07:02.430
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3974
03:07:02.460 --> 03:07:03.293
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's definitely like the look </v>
<v Speaker 3>this chinese thing that makes complete </v>

3975
03:07:07.351 --> 03:07:09.600
<v Speaker 3>sense if they're killing off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they're doing that though?</v>

3976
03:07:09.630 --> 03:07:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people in China.</v>

3977
03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:12.113
<v Speaker 3>They cannot have that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they get rid of a certain age of </v>

3978
03:07:17.371 --> 03:07:18.204
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they have mental issues </v>

3979
03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:21.590
<v Speaker 3>like homeless people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3980
03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:25.790
<v Speaker 3>but we already figured out that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States has almost 100,000.</v>

3981
03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Any given day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any given 10,000</v>

<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is elderly people.</v>

3987
03:07:39.420 --> 03:07:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh this is including kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's way different.</v>

3988
03:07:41.791 --> 03:07:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Are they talking about 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>elderly or $500,000?</v>

3989
03:07:44.570 --> 03:07:45.870
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>elderly.</v>

3990
03:07:45.950 --> 03:07:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3991
03:07:48.020 --> 03:07:49.170
<v Speaker 3>They're killing them for sure.</v>

3992
03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3993
03:07:50.130 --> 03:07:53.250
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they killed kids or they used</v>

3994
03:07:53.251 --> 03:07:54.240
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

3995
03:07:54.250 --> 03:07:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

3996
03:07:56.060 --> 03:07:57.570
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3997
03:07:58.470 --> 03:08:00.720
<v Speaker 3>About populations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they get too high,</v>

3998
03:08:00.850 --> 03:08:03.780
<v Speaker 3>see people aren't valuable anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>500,000</v>

3999
03:08:03.810 --> 03:08:06.060
<v Speaker 3>elderly people go missing in China every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

4000
03:08:06.100 --> 03:08:06.933
<v Speaker 3>which is 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent of the missing people </v>

4001
03:08:09.361 --> 03:08:12.560
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe to 80 percent of people.</v>

4002
03:08:12.890 --> 03:08:13.723
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they're killing people or </v>

4003
03:08:15.061 --> 03:08:16.620
<v Speaker 3>do you think people just get lost really</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>

4004
03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:18.053
<v Speaker 3>A look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's eigHty percent of 80 percent are </v>

4005
03:08:20.911 --> 03:08:21.840
<v Speaker 3>elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>

4006
03:08:21.841 --> 03:08:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they're killing them or </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 72 percent suffered some sort of</v>

4007
03:08:26.101 --> 03:08:27.720
<v Speaker 3>memory impairment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4008
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:28.583
<v Speaker 3>But it might be a mental health issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they might just not treat their </v>

4009
03:08:31.891 --> 03:08:34.470
<v Speaker 3>mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at the numbers in that chart.</v>

4010
03:08:34.471 --> 03:08:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll back up there,</v>

4011
03:08:35.581 --> 03:08:36.414
<v Speaker 3>look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the difference between what is </v>

4012
03:08:38.161 --> 03:08:43.161
<v Speaker 3>the earliest part of the chart in 1965 </v>
<v Speaker 3>population of people over 65.</v>

4013
03:08:43.620 --> 03:08:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 1965 page thing.</v>

4014
03:08:46.951 --> 03:08:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Jamie the bottom 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty five to 2015.</v>

4015
03:08:50.460 --> 03:08:53.670
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the way he runs up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>

4016
03:08:53.671 --> 03:08:54.504
<v Speaker 3>that's a spike man or at least a steep </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramp and then they're saying that kill </v>

4017
03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:03.240
<v Speaker 3>an old now and they're saying that out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those groups that are missing,</v>

4018
03:09:03.330 --> 03:09:04.163
<v Speaker 3>a large amount of them have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosed already with like an illness </v>

4019
03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:08.073
<v Speaker 3>like alzheimer's or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're already on the way out there </v>

4020
03:09:09.661 --> 03:09:11.510
<v Speaker 3>saying so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just.</v>

4021
03:09:11.690 --> 03:09:13.550
<v Speaker 3>They isom they get rid of soy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4022
03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:17.190
<v Speaker 3>because it's costing them more money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

4023
03:09:17.191 --> 03:09:18.024
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's taken up space to to imagine if we </v>

4024
03:09:19.621 --> 03:09:23.910
<v Speaker 3>find out that there is a murder racket </v>
<v Speaker 3>in China that kills 500,000</v>

4025
03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:27.270
<v Speaker 3>old sick people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine.</v>

4026
03:09:27.271 --> 03:09:28.104
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now we're just looking at a </v>

4027
03:09:28.651 --> 03:09:29.484
<v Speaker 3>number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we found out that is absolutely </v>

4028
03:09:32.341 --> 03:09:35.820
<v Speaker 3>what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think by 20,</v>

4029
03:09:35.821 --> 03:09:36.654
<v Speaker 3>30 they're going to have more than 400 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million people over 60 their g and they </v>

4030
03:09:43.231 --> 03:09:45.600
<v Speaker 3>last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The asians because they eat so nice.</v>

4031
03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:49.140
<v Speaker 3>That's so racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny.</v>

4032
03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:51.930
<v Speaker 3>As a meme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a racist,</v>

4033
03:09:51.931 --> 03:09:53.740
<v Speaker 3>mean people are going to beat your ass.</v>

4034
03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you said nothing but a good thing.</v>

4035
03:09:57.161 --> 03:09:58.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said good things,</v>

4036
03:09:58.451 --> 03:09:59.284
<v Speaker 1>but it's racial and so when it's racial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people automatically get recreationally </v>

4037
03:10:02.770 --> 03:10:03.603
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational outrage kicks in and </v>

4038
03:10:05.831 --> 03:10:06.664
<v Speaker 1>they'll call you a racist for saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that asian people last longer because </v>

4039
03:10:09.371 --> 03:10:11.510
<v Speaker 1>they eat well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you just said eat night.</v>

4040
03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a better way to say it.</v>

4041
03:10:14.460 --> 03:10:15.190
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4042
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:16.140
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

4043
03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:17.293
<v Speaker 4>my girlfriend's agent and she's the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>racist of chinese people have all the </v>

4044
03:10:20.131 --> 03:10:24.340
<v Speaker 4>time and most asians hate chinese people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

4045
03:10:24.341 --> 03:10:26.470
<v Speaker 4>why are you racist against chinese </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

4046
03:10:26.700 --> 03:10:27.131
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4047
03:10:27.131 --> 03:10:30.490
<v Speaker 4>they're stupid dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you research it and you're like,</v>

4048
03:10:30.491 --> 03:10:31.324
<v Speaker 4>maybe you should let her say to my ex </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend the one that died in the </v>

4049
03:10:35.260 --> 03:10:36.970
<v Speaker 4>crash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

4050
03:10:37.420 --> 03:10:38.253
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you read all these things like </v>

4051
03:10:39.181 --> 03:10:40.780
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like about this and you're like,</v>

4052
03:10:40.781 --> 03:10:42.880
<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on in China?</v>

4053
03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:45.160
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4054
03:10:46.090 --> 03:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or he's been there.</v>

4055
03:10:48.570 --> 03:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I know of quite a few people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in China.</v>

4056
03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Somebody just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4057
03:10:51.601 --> 03:10:53.230
<v Speaker 1>tate tate's in China right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4058
03:10:53.580 --> 03:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>he's doing some crossfit shit over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4059
03:10:55.770 --> 03:10:57.900
<v Speaker 1>He's doing some stuff with the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>owns crossfit.</v>

4060
03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a trip man.</v>

4061
03:11:00.840 --> 03:11:01.673
<v Speaker 1>Apparently though there's something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 new billionaires are created every </v>

4062
03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:08.160
<v Speaker 1>day in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something insane like that.</v>

4063
03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Tate told me I should probably know </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things before I say them out loud,</v>

4064
03:11:13.441 --> 03:11:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is folks.</v>

4065
03:11:16.110 --> 03:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>How many new billionaires are Created </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day in China?</v>

4066
03:11:19.290 --> 03:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>What do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brian?</v>

4067
03:11:20.910 --> 03:11:21.743
<v Speaker 1>50 sure was it say business insider says</v>
<v Speaker 1>China gets the new billionaire every </v>

4068
03:11:28.051 --> 03:11:30.990
<v Speaker 1>five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not five every day.</v>

4069
03:11:30.991 --> 03:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It's one every five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that sounds more likely.</v>

4070
03:11:35.970 --> 03:11:40.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's a 20 a month one every one </v>
<v Speaker 1>every five days.</v>

4071
03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:42.893
<v Speaker 1>Six month wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When every five days or seven days in a </v>

4072
03:11:47.521 --> 03:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's four weeks in a month.</v>

4073
03:11:49.730 --> 03:11:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Thirty days every month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every so six,</v>

4074
03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:58.710
<v Speaker 1>six times 5:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every month they get a billion.</v>

4075
03:11:58.711 --> 03:12:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Except for like february.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's short months.</v>

4076
03:12:00.331 --> 03:12:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Sixty every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like how crazy is that?</v>

4077
03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:05.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's 68 year essentially 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 year instead of 50,</v>

4078
03:12:05.401 --> 03:12:09.150
<v Speaker 1>60 a day when I was only off by a factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 365.</v>

4079
03:12:09.780 --> 03:12:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's see whAt tate said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe tate lied to me.</v>

4080
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a strange place though.</v>

4081
03:12:16.441 --> 03:12:17.274
<v Speaker 1>Like when we think about like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language can develop in two different </v>

4082
03:12:21.691 --> 03:12:22.524
<v Speaker 1>places in two completely different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you got your language that we </v>

4083
03:12:25.201 --> 03:12:26.034
<v Speaker 1>have over here with our very specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds that sound like english and then </v>

4084
03:12:29.731 --> 03:12:32.250
<v Speaker 1>they get a little weirder when they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to certain places.</v>

4085
03:12:32.460 --> 03:12:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4086
03:12:34.681 --> 03:12:39.681
<v Speaker 1>like a Germany or like thoSe places that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have different sounds and they have</v>

4087
03:12:41.101 --> 03:12:45.240
<v Speaker 1>the parts of the world where they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like different sort of sounds like that.</v>

4088
03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:46.783
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got China which has got </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own kind of weird thing and then on </v>

4089
03:12:50.101 --> 03:12:50.911
<v Speaker 1>top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4090
03:12:50.911 --> 03:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>here he says they</v>

4091
03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:52.833
<v Speaker 5>have made a here each year for 400,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$9 millionaires made their each day of </v>

4092
03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:01.250
<v Speaker 5>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's more impressive.</v>

4093
03:13:01.350 --> 03:13:02.390
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was.</v>

4094
03:13:02.391 --> 03:13:06.940
<v Speaker 5>He said 409 millionaires made their each</v>
<v Speaker 5>day and $50.</v>

4095
03:13:06.941 --> 03:13:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Million people living in shanghai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4096
03:13:09.411 --> 03:13:10.670
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the 40.</v>

4097
03:13:10.730 --> 03:13:12.320
<v Speaker 5>That's the 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I got confused.</v>

4098
03:13:13.250 --> 03:13:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But their language,</v>

4099
03:13:14.871 --> 03:13:16.640
<v Speaker 5>like when you look at it written down </v>

<v Speaker 5>like waterfalls.</v>

4191
03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:09.713
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably there was a weird time where </v>

4192
03:17:13.801 --> 03:17:18.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very strange where a word from some</v>

4193
03:17:18.751 --> 03:17:19.584
<v Speaker 5>other language means nothing over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we say words and it means like </v>

4194
03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:28.950
<v Speaker 5>something really fucked up over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like just certain words like,</v>

4195
03:17:29.130 --> 03:17:31.050
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a perfect example of fanny pack.</v>

4196
03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:35.190
<v Speaker 5>Fanny means vagina and england.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got that app,</v>

4197
03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:37.423
<v Speaker 5>have fuck that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simulation theory or facts for </v>

4198
03:17:40.831 --> 03:17:42.930
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call cigarette a fag</v>

4199
03:17:43.160 --> 03:17:44.510
<v Speaker 4>or a faggots.</v>

4200
03:17:45.460 --> 03:17:47.350
<v Speaker 5>You know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4201
03:17:47.620 --> 03:17:48.890
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

4202
03:17:48.891 --> 03:17:51.460
<v Speaker 5>there's a misconception about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The entomology,</v>

4203
03:17:51.461 --> 03:17:52.294
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the word of that word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the word faggot even was even miss </v>

4204
03:17:56.900 --> 03:17:57.733
<v Speaker 5>misspoke on the louis ck show that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>said that it was originally that the </v>

4205
03:18:02.501 --> 03:18:03.334
<v Speaker 5>reason why they use that term for gay </v>
<v Speaker 5>people is because it's a bundle of </v>

4206
03:18:07.511 --> 03:18:10.300
<v Speaker 5>sticks and they would light the bundle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of sticks on fire,</v>

4207
03:18:10.720 --> 03:18:11.553
<v Speaker 5>and so the reason why they call someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>a faggot in the reason why it was so </v>

4208
03:18:13.721 --> 03:18:16.900
<v Speaker 5>offensive is because that means that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're to be lit on fire.</v>

4209
03:18:17.290 --> 03:18:19.070
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4210
03:18:19.210 --> 03:18:20.043
<v Speaker 5>that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it wouldn't have taken long to </v>

4211
03:18:21.041 --> 03:18:23.260
<v Speaker 5>research this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The actual origin,</v>

4212
03:18:23.470 --> 03:18:27.430
<v Speaker 5>what it means is it's a bundle of wood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a burdensome woman.</v>

4213
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:28.743
<v Speaker 5>A faggot is very difficult to carry </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's like a bundle of wood and </v>

4214
03:18:33.281 --> 03:18:34.061
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>

4215
03:18:34.061 --> 03:18:36.460
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult to balance a budget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's cumbersome.</v>

4216
03:18:36.940 --> 03:18:41.940
<v Speaker 5>So a burdensome woman became a faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a guy who act like a woman,</v>

4217
03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:43.953
<v Speaker 5>like a burdensome woman became a faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It had nothing to do with lighting on </v>

4218
03:18:47.621 --> 03:18:48.100
<v Speaker 5>fire,</v>

4219
03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and there's no evidence other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated hate crimes,</v>

4220
03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:52.473
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no evidence of a practice of </v>

4221
03:18:54.671 --> 03:18:58.540
<v Speaker 1>lighting people on fire other than war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4222
03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:01.300
<v Speaker 1>some horrible things that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done when they've conquered cities.</v>

4223
03:19:01.301 --> 03:19:04.510
<v Speaker 1>They've lit entire villages On fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit along those lines,</v>

4224
03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:08.740
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the salem witch trials,</v>

4225
03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:11.110
<v Speaker 1>like most people think that they let </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people on fire,</v>

4226
03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:14.710
<v Speaker 1>most of them were drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what theY did with most of them.</v>

4227
03:19:14.711 --> 03:19:16.660
<v Speaker 1>They weren't burning witches at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stake really,</v>

4228
03:19:16.900 --> 03:19:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but they did drown a bunch of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

4229
03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:20.230
<v Speaker 1>BuT they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

4230
03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:21.760
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done it throughout history,</v>

4231
03:19:21.761 --> 03:19:22.594
<v Speaker 1>but it's not been something that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>practiced on gay people to the point </v>

4232
03:19:24.911 --> 03:19:28.220
<v Speaker 1>where that became the nickname because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a bundle of woods.</v>

4233
03:19:28.221 --> 03:19:29.054
<v Speaker 1>They're going to light them on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people love to reiterate that </v>

4234
03:19:31.450 --> 03:19:34.930
<v Speaker 1>without looking into it and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

4235
03:19:36.400 --> 03:19:37.233
<v Speaker 1>it's still a gross word when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>applying it to a homosexual person to </v>

4236
03:19:42.490 --> 03:19:43.990
<v Speaker 1>sort of dehumanize them.</v>

4237
03:19:44.020 --> 03:19:47.080
<v Speaker 1>It's still gross term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what it originally meant.</v>

4238
03:19:47.770 --> 03:19:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it meant a burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>some woman,</v>

4239
03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:51.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard the fire before,</v>

4240
03:19:51.490 --> 03:19:54.460
<v Speaker 1>but I've always heard the wood and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to your gay friends,</v>

4241
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it's okay if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they say it back to fourth year,</v>

4242
03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that we can do it around other dudes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to the punch you gave.</v>

4243
03:20:01.740 --> 03:20:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Those are dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4244
03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm make sure that I'm correct on that.</v>

4245
03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm 99 percent sure I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

4246
03:20:09.640 --> 03:20:10.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4247
03:20:10.440 --> 03:20:11.273
<v Speaker 1>the entomology of the word faggot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretends to a burdensome woman as it </v>

4248
03:20:17.351 --> 03:20:18.184
<v Speaker 1>pretends that it's one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>just get sort of repeated as an urban </v>

4249
03:20:21.701 --> 03:20:23.380
<v Speaker 1>myth or as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4250
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:26.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

4251
03:20:26.890 --> 03:20:30.040
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how many different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>slurs there are for people.</v>

4252
03:20:30.580 --> 03:20:31.413
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost in some ways be better if </v>

4253
03:20:34.151 --> 03:20:38.800
<v Speaker 1>there's just one and we use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally [inaudible] what would yours</v>

4254
03:20:38.801 --> 03:20:39.880
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4255
03:20:40.690 --> 03:20:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I like for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's too,</v>

4256
03:20:42.731 --> 03:20:46.840
<v Speaker 1>it's too hard to call morons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like moron is always good.</v>

4257
03:20:46.930 --> 03:20:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I to say here at jimmy.</v>

4258
03:20:50.660 --> 03:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it a little bigger.</v>

4259
03:20:52.300 --> 03:20:55.060
<v Speaker 1>The word faggot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been used in english since the late</v>

4260
03:20:55.330 --> 03:20:57.730
<v Speaker 1>16th century and his abusive term for </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

4261
03:20:58.210 --> 03:21:00.290
<v Speaker 1>particularly old women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4262
03:21:00.310 --> 03:21:04.180
<v Speaker 1>in reference to homosexuality may derive</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this,</v>

4263
03:21:04.181 --> 03:21:05.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>

4264
03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:06.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as female terms are often used with </v>

4265
03:21:08.291 --> 03:21:11.800
<v Speaker 1>reference to homosexual feminine men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4266
03:21:11.930 --> 03:21:12.191
<v Speaker 1>duh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duh,</v>

4267
03:21:12.191 --> 03:21:13.840
<v Speaker 1>duh duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4268
03:21:13.841 --> 03:21:14.674
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The application of a term to a woman as </v>

4269
03:21:16.451 --> 03:21:17.284
<v Speaker 1>possibly the shortening of the term </v>
<v Speaker 1>faggot gatherer applied to 19th century </v>

4270
03:21:22.121 --> 03:21:24.880
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call mIlo that from now on.</v>

4271
03:21:25.410 --> 03:21:26.243
<v Speaker 1>A especially older women who made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meager living by gathering and selling </v>

4272
03:21:30.521 --> 03:21:32.170
<v Speaker 1>firewood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4273
03:21:32.930 --> 03:21:33.763
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the sense of something awkward to </v>

4274
03:21:36.371 --> 03:21:37.151
<v Speaker 1>be carrIed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4275
03:21:37.151 --> 03:21:37.984
<v Speaker 1>That's where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So compared to the use of the word </v>

4276
03:21:40.301 --> 03:21:41.470
<v Speaker 1>baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4277
03:21:41.530 --> 03:21:42.363
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a pejorative term for old people in </v>

4278
03:21:45.050 --> 03:21:47.360
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So awkward to carry.</v>

4279
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4280
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's essentially it.</v>

4281
03:21:50.210 --> 03:21:53.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comparing men to women,</v>

4282
03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:56.690
<v Speaker 1>not comparing men to something that theY</v>
<v Speaker 1>light on fire.</v>

4283
03:21:56.720 --> 03:21:58.280
<v Speaker 1>So when people say that it's just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

4284
03:21:58.750 --> 03:22:02.030
<v Speaker 1>still doesn't excuse people for slurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we shouldn't lie,</v>

4285
03:22:02.540 --> 03:22:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem wIth something.</v>

4286
03:22:03.771 --> 03:22:04.604
<v Speaker 1>Sounds so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to repeat it over and over </v>

4287
03:22:05.811 --> 03:22:06.770
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not true.</v>

4288
03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:07.761
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4289
03:22:07.761 --> 03:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible to slur people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4290
03:22:10.041 --> 03:22:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you're rIght.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we should be honest about the origin</v>

4291
03:22:12.741 --> 03:22:13.700
<v Speaker 1>of words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4292
03:22:13.840 --> 03:22:14.673
<v Speaker 1>and that's not honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but It's something that gets repeated a </v>

4293
03:22:16.401 --> 03:22:18.590
<v Speaker 1>lot and people don't look into it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

4294
03:22:18.890 --> 03:22:21.170
<v Speaker 1>They just want to say it because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds awesome.</v>

4295
03:22:21.470 --> 03:22:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And when you say it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why it's so offensive because</v>

4296
03:22:25.041 --> 03:22:28.460
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to describe a bundle of wood.</v>

4297
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you and your friends,</v>

4298
03:22:30.681 --> 03:22:31.514
<v Speaker 1>you think you're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're Casually calling each </v>

<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

4303
