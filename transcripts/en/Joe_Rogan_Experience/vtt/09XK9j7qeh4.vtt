00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>My Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,</v>

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>but very good guy too.</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Very good fighter in him and Vinnie were both in the UFC so they got a lot of</v>

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.583
<v Speaker 1>good</v>

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>press it up and then they also got uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>my boy jake shields.</v>

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fine.</v>

9
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>That is the same night as the UFC fight in I think as the same night as UFC</v>

10
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>fight in New York City fucked up world series.</v>

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough draw for them to.</v>

13
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Everyone fucked up.</v>

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

15
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

16
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>let's get busy with this.</v>

17
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this Brendan Shop?</v>

18
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I am very excited about this fight.</v>

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I think people are fucking sleeping on Eddie Alvarez.</v>

20
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a dangerous dangerous 155 pounder that motherfucker can punch.</v>

21
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>He punches hard,</v>

22
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>he's fast as fuck and it does not a human alive that's more gained in that kit.</v>

23
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100 percent.</v>

24
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>If you've never seen him fight before,</v>

25
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch his fights in bellator with Michael Chandler and dream.</v>

26
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.121
<v Speaker 1>That's just fights him.</v>

27
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Dream to Michael Chandler is another dude who's out there who is world class.</v>

28
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That could easily be fighting and winning in the UFC.</v>

29
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

30
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and you see it now with Eddie Alvarez because it took a while for Eddie to get</v>

31
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>comfortable in the UFC.</v>

32
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>He Donald worked him over and his first fight because dismantled by John,</v>

33
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>but now he's training with your book mchenry and Connor's a goddamn phenom and</v>

34
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>he's a.</v>

35
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>he's got as for us a hobby likes to call it the touch of death in his hands.</v>

36
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary fight,</v>

37
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

38
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who thinks it's an easy flight or not,</v>

39
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>a big fight for conor is they just don't know the sport out of their time on the</v>

40
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>underground king,</v>

41
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I think at 55 and everyone knows I'm the biggest con or nut writer in the world</v>

42
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>at 55.</v>

43
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see a ton of success there.</v>

44
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I think Eddie Alvarez,</v>

45
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the top five,</v>

46
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:43.421
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this for you,</v>

47
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.254
<v Speaker 1>like the top five.</v>

48
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's his easiest matchup and that's a fucking nightmare for them because it can</v>

49
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>grapple his ass off.</v>

50
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He's been so many big fights.</v>

51
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get tired.</v>

52
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't mind winning by decision.</v>

53
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get tired and he's a bigger grandpa.</v>

54
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Those are two and he can't fucking crack and look at his resume.</v>

56
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Resume.</v>

57
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>

58
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>He's crisp,</v>

59
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>striking.</v>

60
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>He's not an easy guy to hit.</v>

61
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>You know you can hit him and he gets rocked and he survives.</v>

62
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>If you watch his chandler fights,</v>

63
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez got rocked and survived against Chandler and a couple other guys</v>

64
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>over in Bella.</v>

65
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>think about how.</v>

67
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>How's Connor win this fight?</v>

68
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>You go through a hassle.</v>

69
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Knock him out.</v>

70
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>He has five rounds of document.</v>

71
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>You're not winning decision against that.</v>

72
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>He could win a decision.</v>

73
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

74
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.441
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

75
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Why do you worry about the fight with Gilbert Melendez?</v>

76
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Eddie wanted decision.</v>

77
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.731
<v Speaker 1>The Gilbert Melendez,</v>

78
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

79
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

80
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying Edwin's by decision,</v>

81
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but we don't think that connor could beat him in a similar fight.</v>

82
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

83
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

84
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the endurance.</v>

85
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>The takedowns.</v>

86
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>The grappling with the striking.</v>

87
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>As the rounds go on,</v>

88
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>the knockout power goes down.</v>

89
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you think people sleep on Alvarez wrestling because I think they forget.</v>

90
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I forget how good of a restaurant is and his endurance,</v>

91
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

92
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.593
<v Speaker 1>it's a scary.</v>

93
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.783
<v Speaker 1>Where did he wrestle?</v>

94
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>He was a high level guy.</v>

95
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.261
<v Speaker 1>Division One.</v>

96
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

97
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.553
<v Speaker 1>All American.</v>

98
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

99
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

100
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.101
<v Speaker 1>compared to connor.</v>

101
00:02:58.101 --> 00:02:58.934
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking Dan.</v>

102
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.441
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

103
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:00.274
<v Speaker 1>This fight.</v>

104
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>This fight is nasty,</v>

105
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

106
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.470
<v Speaker 1>We all know that those guys were talking about Jimmy man who's about to go down</v>

107
00:03:06.471 --> 00:03:06.650
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

108
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

109
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

110
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.291
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

111
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this phrase nasty.</v>

112
00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Just not confuse people at home,</v>

113
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.000
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

114
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you man.</v>

115
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I think people sleep on them.</v>

116
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.420
<v Speaker 1>It's too.</v>

117
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>You've rolled with like a real division one wrestler and you realized how</v>

118
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking strong the wrestling is.</v>

119
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.243
<v Speaker 1>All American.</v>

120
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>That's high school.</v>

121
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.341
<v Speaker 1>National Prep.</v>

122
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:25.174
<v Speaker 1>All American.</v>

123
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.273
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

124
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>what is this college wrestling record?</v>

125
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.791
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have one.</v>

126
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

127
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>No college wrestling doesn't say as college wrestling.</v>

128
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And he got his wrestling and fricking dream.</v>

129
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.744
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

130
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.140
<v Speaker 1>He bypassed that career and went right into mma.</v>

131
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.230
<v Speaker 1>So he was a high level high school wrestling,</v>

132
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>which is not as impressive as a college wrestler,</v>

133
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>but when you see him wrestle,</v>

134
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you know he's got some skills like to stand up though.</v>

135
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>He loves trade,</v>

136
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>just wants to stand up.</v>

137
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:56.861
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

138
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>It's too smart.</v>

139
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>He's been in some of the best,</v>

140
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.081
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

141
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So Connor's down in an easy to take down though to highschool champ.</v>

142
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez begs to differ.</v>

143
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean as time goes on,</v>

144
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be harder and harder to get that Chad Mendez fight though in</v>

145
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Connor's defense,</v>

146
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>he had a pretty fucked up knee in that fight he was getting.</v>

147
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>He was getting stem cell injections in his knee,</v>

148
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's also the only rest where we've ever seen conor fight taking down</v>

149
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty effortlessly.</v>

150
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

151
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.774
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

152
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing we can go off and say,</v>

153
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.313
<v Speaker 1>I got a bad knee.</v>

154
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.153
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

155
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.331
<v Speaker 1>It's tough fight,</v>

156
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:28.571
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

157
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Because people think Karen's gonna lock those guys.</v>

158
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the sport man.</v>

159
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I saw the fire went,</v>

160
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

161
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

162
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>But also I could see connor just is gonna win.</v>

163
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna if,</v>

164
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.721
<v Speaker 1>if Connor wins,</v>

165
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:41.554
<v Speaker 1>he's going to Mirko.</v>

166
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Connor has some vicious fucking power in his hands.</v>

167
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Has Eddie been knocked out?</v>

168
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.173
<v Speaker 1>He's been stopped.</v>

169
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Chandler stopped him.</v>

170
00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>He rear naked choke him and beat him for the title.</v>

171
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm knocked out.</v>

172
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's been knocked out.</v>

173
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing some dog fights.</v>

174
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>He's just his game as they come.</v>

175
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one of those guys that fight at its very best when he's scared.</v>

176
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

177
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to be one of the best things about this fight is that he</v>

178
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>thinks conor is a dangerous motherfucker.</v>

179
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Just like he thought how failed on Joe's.</v>

180
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>He stopped those signed just in the first round and a lot of people,</v>

181
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>including me,</v>

182
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>were making the argument that Dos Anjos,</v>

183
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the guys he's beaten,</v>

184
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>stopped cowboy in the first round,</v>

185
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of Nate Diaz,</v>

186
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 1>had us beat pettis up,</v>

187
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>stopped Ben Henderson,</v>

188
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>crushed him.</v>

189
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

190
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>you look at all the guys that he's beaten.</v>

191
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a real argument that he's one of the best lightweight of all time and</v>

192
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>then Eddie went and stopped him in the first round so everyone thought he was</v>

193
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.150
<v Speaker 1>gonna get murdered.</v>

194
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you went,</v>

195
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.141
<v Speaker 1>thought Eddie was just.</v>

196
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:36.750
<v Speaker 1>You can get.</v>

197
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It was huge.</v>

198
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have the marquee name recognition type thing.</v>

199
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>They don't know him yet.</v>

200
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous fight for conor man,</v>

201
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>because he has such a big name.</v>

202
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.603
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

203
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>

204
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.651
<v Speaker 1>if connor does,</v>

205
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:52.651
<v Speaker 1>when you imagine the 55 belt holder is crazy and then I think you'll forget</v>

206
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>about Tony and Tony.</v>

207
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

209
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>we're not forgetting about them for sure,</v>

210
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>but I think the thing about Eddie Alvarez is that he has the title and that's</v>

211
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.840
<v Speaker 1>why it's sellable is it was just conor mcgregor versus Eddie Alvarez and they</v>

212
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.551
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the title.</v>

213
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:05.331
<v Speaker 1>You can't sell it.</v>

214
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just that the Miller garden though,</v>

215
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>middle so valuable.</v>

216
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>We realize how valuable that title,</v>

217
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>because Tony is right in there,</v>

218
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.863
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

219
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>as is Barboza as as a couple of guys,</v>

220
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Habib number go.</v>

221
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Madoff is of course everybody's first choice.</v>

222
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>She's undefeated.</v>

223
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's been able to deal with that crap.</v>

224
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Suplex your face,</v>

225
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>nasty fucking striker to</v>

226
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>give him a.</v>

227
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.491
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting.</v>

228
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting Michael Johnson and the next ride in that car.</v>

229
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking great fight.</v>

230
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.711
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>

231
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>just coming off of the knockout.</v>

232
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.594
<v Speaker 1>A poor ea.</v>

233
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fight.</v>

234
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Great fight on the main card.</v>

235
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.413
<v Speaker 1>Let's be real.</v>

236
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>We always argue what's the best UFC fight card?</v>

237
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the best UFC fight card of Baltimore.</v>

238
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Even close.</v>

239
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like by foot holds up.</v>

240
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>If it holds up towards the lineup,</v>

242
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>the lineup is insane.</v>

243
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>You have three world title fights.</v>

244
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>You have our versus conor Mcgregor.</v>

245
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.970
<v Speaker 1>You have tyron Woodley's fighting wonderboy.</v>

246
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Funny People forget that.</v>

247
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 1>This steven happening because everybody's talking about other fights.</v>

248
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>They forget this fight.</v>

249
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>How about Yoni and Jay?</v>

250
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Check versus Carolina Cable Kovich.</v>

251
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.401
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

252
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

253
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's even talking about that and then you have Chris.</v>

254
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Why Med versus yellow?</v>

255
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucking Ramiro.</v>

256
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Come on</v>

257
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>then our boy.</v>

258
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy counseling versus Calvin</v>

259
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.360
<v Speaker 1>and look at.</v>

260
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 1>This is Raquel Pennington that fights never met.</v>

261
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Raquel Pennington is one of the best Bantam weight in the world.</v>

262
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Nobody talks about her because she's.</v>

263
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>She's won some fights in a crazy way,</v>

264
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 1>like the Ashley Evan Smith fight with just had some great,</v>

265
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.941
<v Speaker 1>but she looks.</v>

266
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You took holly home to a fucking split decision I had.</v>

267
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>The girls have lost a lot though in to eight and six.</v>

268
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.651
<v Speaker 1>They have brawls,</v>

269
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

270
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 1>These girls go after it and Pennington and in my opinion is super,</v>

271
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>super aggressive.</v>

272
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I like watching her fight me.</v>

273
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>She got beat up in the last fight.</v>

274
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.790
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>

275
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>God Amanda Nunez Nunez?</v>

276
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

277
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

278
00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar versus sharpie Stevens.</v>

279
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.303
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>

280
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I almost forgot about that.</v>

281
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

282
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Not neuroma.</v>

283
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>

284
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

285
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close.</v>

286
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 1>There's not even a second place.</v>

287
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shot.</v>

288
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Ticketed entity.</v>

289
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

290
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.720
