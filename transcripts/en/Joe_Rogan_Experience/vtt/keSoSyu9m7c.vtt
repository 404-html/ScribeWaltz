1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're live.</v>

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.110
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the show.</v>

4
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing great Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for her rehab.</v>

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I know you've done a podcast for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did Tim Ferriss podcast.</v>

7
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I heard you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually three of them.</v>

8
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I did for three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three really cast.</v>

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to listen to the other two then.</v>

10
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 2>What is this one you brought me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

11
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you think I'm a drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what.</v>

13
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the dry farm wines.</v>

14
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Guys think that this giant magnum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to have a party.</v>

15
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wine that's pretty legit in </v>

16
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>regards to if you want to stay on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet.</v>

17
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tested this in my office actually and </v>

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 2>just found that to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's non glycaemic for one thing,</v>

19
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>which means it doesn't impact the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>content is so low.</v>

20
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 2>There's not an elevation in blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose and uh,</v>

21
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I can stay in Ketosis on this one if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do one glass two or three.</v>

22
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Three starts to kick me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to glasses of wine,</v>

23
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 2>you can completely stay in Ketosis.</v>

24
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Most glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most wine will kick you out of Ketosis.</v>

25
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

26
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's highly dependent on like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>merlow.</v>

27
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>A dry wine typically doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a smart little more dry,</v>

28
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of it,</v>

29
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time.</v>

30
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A white wines tend to kick me out more.</v>

31
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.040
<v Speaker 2>And of course something like a sweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>wine,</v>

32
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 2>we'll go bowling or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really sweet.</v>

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>St Maria,</v>

34
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll take you out very fast.</v>

35
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Just sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even beer does,</v>

36
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 2>even though it's supposed to be low carb</v>
<v Speaker 2>beer tends to kick me out.</v>

37
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Really Michelob ultra and maybe one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 2>one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

39
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:50.611
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get that question a lot so it </v>

40
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.341
<v Speaker 2>actually got me interested in studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this so I can answer some of the </v>

41
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.971
<v Speaker 2>questions with some level of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>and after testing these wines and uh,</v>

42
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I came to the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

43
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you can drink two glasses of wine a day </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a strict ketogenic diet.</v>

44
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is important for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing it to manage their health</v>

45
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 2>long term and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially people with actual health </v>

46
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 2>issues were ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet benefits them,</v>

47
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>like epileptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

48
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Like when I got into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a pediatric epilepsy like in 2007</v>

49
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>or eight and now the applications are </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding,</v>

50
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dozen or more.</v>

51
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:34.621
<v Speaker 2>So we hold a conference and Metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Therapeutics Conference where the top </v>

52
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 2>tier people in academia and like from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johns Hopkins,</v>

53
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 2>they probably one of the spearheaded </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet application clinically </v>

54
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 2>and a top tier scientists from Yale and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard and other places,</v>

55
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>present here.</v>

56
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:53.281
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the applicate it was like 11 or </v>

57
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.191
<v Speaker 2>12 applications for the key to genic </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet where there's good peer reviewed </v>

58
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 2>research to support the efficacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>as a metabolic based therapy for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of everything from,</v>

60
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>polycystic ovary syndrome to acne to </v>

61
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>rare.</v>

62
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Even genetic disorders like Angelman </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syndrome is something that we're </v>

63
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.500
<v Speaker 2>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

64
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.331
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a genetic disorder where a </v>

65
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 2>housekeeping gene is mutated and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>results in seizures and a motor function</v>

66
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>impairment and the ketogenic diet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkably effective.</v>

67
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

68
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>It's really drug resistant seizures that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids have,</v>

69
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>and even in the presence of a persistent</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular pathology,</v>

70
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>a genetic pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to genic diet,</v>

71
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through altering metabolism with the </v>

72
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can largely silenced the pathology </v>

73
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>and the motor function impairments </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with this disease.</v>

74
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing to me that you have a </v>

75
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.431
<v Speaker 2>disease that is persistently there due </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a genetic mutation and you can </v>

76
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>largely silence the symptoms that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours</v>

77
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.360
<v Speaker 3>in the interest of addressing people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are probably on the ground floor.</v>

78
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:04.361
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like there's very few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>today that don't understand what a </v>

79
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.951
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just in case for people who don't </v>

80
00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:10.071
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people that use carbohydrates </v>

81
00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:13.611
<v Speaker 3>mainly for fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the mutagenic diet </v>

82
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 3>which makes your body run on fats and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketones.</v>

83
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 3>So try just kind of explain that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

84
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 3>like how this came about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

85
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 3>how people started to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

86
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 3>researching this and how you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

87
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

88
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this goes back to if not </v>

89
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 2>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennia,</v>

90
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dating,</v>

91
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:38.961
<v Speaker 2>back to the time of hypocrisy when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was observed that fasting was a quote </v>

92
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 2>unquote cure for seizures and with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>observation.</v>

93
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fasting puts you into fasting </v>

94
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

95
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 3>So even intermittent fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I do the 14 hour thing where I,</v>

96
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 3>14</v>

97
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's clinic.</v>

99
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:57.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean technically that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call that semi a semi fasted state </v>

100
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>when you achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:02.611
<v Speaker 2>when you're eating breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be 12 hours or more a you've </v>

102
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>eaten last and you're breaking the fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>

103
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.560
<v Speaker 2>But with severe epileptic patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>it was found that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they restricted food and in some </v>

105
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 2>cases water after about two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

106
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 2>you had profound seizure control or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>silenced even the worst seizures.</v>

107
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 2>And this was observed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Millennia,</v>

109
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

110
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some work done in the,</v>

111
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.880
<v Speaker 2>the early 19 hundreds and 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

112
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 2>there was some work done at the Mayo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinic that I observed the presence of </v>

113
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.381
<v Speaker 2>these ketone bodies and people that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a carbohydrate restricted diet </v>

114
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 2>that was primarily a based on eating fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with a minimal amount of protein </v>

115
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>just enough to ensure there's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein malnutrition.</v>

116
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>And it was observed that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevation of ketone bodies,</v>

117
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Beta hydroxy butyrate acetate in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

118
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>So they called it a physiologist called </v>
<v Speaker 2>it the key to genic diet.</v>

119
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even technically,</v>

120
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe Beta hydroxy butyrate is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketone,</v>

121
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>but physiologists called these ketone </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies,</v>

122
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Beta hydroxybutyrate acetate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acetone,</v>

123
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 2>and it mimics the physiological state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting in many ways.</v>

124
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to draw blood off someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a ketogenic diet,</v>

125
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 2>it would sort of look like they had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting a few days,</v>

126
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's mimicking the way I think </v>

127
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's suppressing the hormone insulin and</v>

128
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 2>kind of mimicking the fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the substrate utilization that you would</v>

129
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 2>be using in a state of being fasted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is primarily fats,</v>

130
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 2>ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

131
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lesser extent a of,</v>

132
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a glucose from amino acids from protein.</v>

133
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You are mobilizing some gluconeogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>amino acids from your skeletal muscle </v>

134
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>when you are fasting.</v>

135
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Ketones are protein sparing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they are anti catabolic in that way.</v>

136
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:54.251
<v Speaker 2>So because we make ketones and our large</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain has a massive demand for energy </v>

137
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 2>and the ketones fulfill that for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most part.</v>

138
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 2>When fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 2>it prevents us from breaking down </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

140
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it prevents us from liberating the </v>

141
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.081
<v Speaker 2>gluconeogenic amino acids that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise be chewed up and use to </v>

142
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:12.581
<v Speaker 2>maintain our glucose levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ketones sort of replaced the </v>

143
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:16.061
<v Speaker 2>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain has the metabolic flexibility </v>

144
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.490
<v Speaker 2>to adapt from using glucose to using </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily ketone bodies in those ketone </v>

145
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.610
<v Speaker 2>bodies really have a protein sparing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anti catabolic.</v>

146
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this an ancient system that was in </v>

147
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 3>place back when people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

148
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.100
<v Speaker 3>obviously couldn't go to the store and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your diet varied depending upon what was</v>

149
00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 3>available and it just allowed people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like say,</v>

150
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:36.471
<v Speaker 3>like maybe inuits that lived off a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fats because they really don't have </v>

151
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.070
<v Speaker 3>many carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're living off a whale blubber and</v>

152
00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:39.960
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines like they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to back then.</v>

153
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

154
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hardwired in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in humans and other animals.</v>

155
00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:48.030
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife Studies Manta rays and uh,</v>

156
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the,</v>

157
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>like the Einsteins of the sea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're the fish with the biggest </v>

158
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.591
<v Speaker 2>brains of all animals and we've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolomic studies on them and looking </v>

159
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.630
<v Speaker 2>at the blood and they produce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant amount of ketones,</v>

160
00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 2>like two millimolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

161
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.500
<v Speaker 2>they dive really deep so it may help </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect them from that.</v>

162
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals will go into ketosis during </v>

163
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.730
<v Speaker 2>fasting or even if you manipulate their </v>
<v Speaker 2>food source,</v>

164
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Quito pet sanctuary actually treats </v>

165
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.671
<v Speaker 2>dogs that have cancer and they implement</v>
<v Speaker 2>a key to genic diet in dogs,</v>

166
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to some other things to </v>

167
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

168
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.520
<v Speaker 2>and the many of these are our dogs from </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill shelters and,</v>

169
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:32.521
<v Speaker 2>and put them on an anticancer therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>program and they can get into ketosis </v>

170
00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 2>for the most harder.</v>

171
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.340
<v Speaker 3>But most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most dog food is not kidogenic is like </v>

172
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:38.340
<v Speaker 3>documents have grain in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

173
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For fillers and things along those </v>

174
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.170
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

175
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

176
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

177
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Ron Pena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

179
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 2>from quest nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CEO of quest nutrition and he </v>

180
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.520
<v Speaker 2>brought to my attention that if you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a package of dog food,</v>

181
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:55.521
<v Speaker 2>you won't see carbohydrates listed even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though it's the primary because there </v>

182
00:08:55.521 --> 00:08:59.661
<v Speaker 2>was some laws or policy put into action </v>
<v Speaker 2>to prevent carbohydrates from even being</v>

183
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 2>listed on kibble on dog food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I find,</v>

184
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of reasons why mostly </v>

185
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.321
<v Speaker 2>because dogs really shouldn't be eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>a carbohydrate based diet and that's </v>

186
00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:15.380
<v Speaker 2>probably part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's sort of other reasons why a.</v>

187
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's really important that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the food that the Quito pet sanctuary</v>

188
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 2>gives the dogs that have cancer and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirmed that they have cancer with a,</v>

189
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.640
<v Speaker 2>a glucose pet scan and they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.660
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during and after is basically kind of </v>

191
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.451
<v Speaker 2>like a raw foods key to genic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost completely restricted in </v>

192
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 2>what we've called glycemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates.</v>

193
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Things that would elevate the glucose </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels and it's very high in fat,</v>

194
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.640
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.890
<v Speaker 2>But dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 2>really should not be eating any grains </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

197
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feed my dog grain free dog food,</v>

198
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if it's carbon free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's in there is a kibble</v>

199
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>kibble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find out.</v>

200
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

202
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog food that has a,</v>

203
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 2>like some peas and sweet potatoes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

204
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ideally,</v>

206
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:12.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to give your dog like a whole </v>

207
00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 2>food nutrition just like humans and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

208
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 2>they say don't give your dog human food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

209
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.740
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

210
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given talks where I talked about </v>

211
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.941
<v Speaker 2>giving dogs raw food and there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a reaction from the audience </v>

212
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:30.141
<v Speaker 2>while it's dangerous to give your dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>like raw food or what do they in a </v>

213
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:30.141
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's ground beef that's been sitting </v>

215
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>around at a processing plant for a while</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet maybe,</v>

216
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 2>but fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 2>a meat from a butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh meat.</v>

218
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the ideal thing for a dog.</v>

219
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Ideally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organ meats like liver,</v>

220
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidneys,</v>

221
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grind it up.</v>

222
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:52.011
<v Speaker 2>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Greens tos and things like spinach </v>

224
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:55.131
<v Speaker 2>you can buy like spinach powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Quito pet sanctuary has an ebook </v>

225
00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 2>that's completely free if you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Quito,</v>

226
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 2>pet sanctuary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.org,</v>

227
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can download the Ebook and it </v>

228
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.110
<v Speaker 2>tells you very precisely how to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>your dog food not only to,</v>

229
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

230
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:10.731
<v Speaker 2>if your dog has cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to maximize its overall performance </v>

231
00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:14.841
<v Speaker 2>and you are preventing cancer by virtue </v>
<v Speaker 2>of putting them on a diet that optimizes</v>

232
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their metabolic health.</v>

233
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that's got to be very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>package though.</v>

234
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>And something that's sort of evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's on the shelf and paper bag.</v>

235
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>You can rip open and just pour into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl.</v>

236
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this convenience thing,</v>

237
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 2>but there is a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

238
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

239
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I know those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 2>epigenics a foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

241
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:36.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

242
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.410
<v Speaker 2>are working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They basically support the Quito pet </v>

243
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.031
<v Speaker 2>sanctuary and they're working out not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only the macronutrient ratios that need </v>

244
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:48.201
<v Speaker 2>to go into the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the types of food and also </v>

245
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:51.950
<v Speaker 2>being able to package it in a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately come up with a food that you </v>

246
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.721
<v Speaker 2>can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may not be on the shelf and probably </v>

247
00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:58.801
<v Speaker 2>ideally shouldn't be on the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be like in the refrigerator </v>

248
00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 2>section of your pet food store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go there and like for our dogs we</v>

249
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:06.140
<v Speaker 2>get like a tube of freshly ground up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a steak or whatever.</v>

250
00:12:06.141 --> 00:12:11.141
<v Speaker 2>And we feed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We take the ground me and mix it with </v>

251
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and mix it with a different greens,</v>

252
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli and things like that and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to them.</v>

253
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 2>And they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put a little bit of coconut oil on it</v>

254
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would go to the grocery store or </v>

255
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be shipped to your house.</v>

256
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's basically kept refrigerated and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has the compliment of like organ </v>

257
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>meats to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>the proper types of fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a official hill,</v>

259
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:33.500
<v Speaker 2>fats and fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

260
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.970
<v Speaker 2>and it fits that macronutrient ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ketogenic diet dog was horrific </v>

261
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.060
<v Speaker 2>farts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them that,</v>

262
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a great Dane.</v>

263
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 2>They're both rescue dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

264
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.960
<v Speaker 2>one of them does Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organ meats and coconut oil.</v>

265
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

266
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.630
<v Speaker 2>go room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

267
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.210
<v Speaker 2>it's either my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

268
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 2>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog,</v>

269
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might be blaming the dog,</v>

270
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe blame the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're healthy.</v>

271
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.580
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic research and research on Keto </v>

272
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:05.580
<v Speaker 2>diets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

273
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 2>and how long have you been doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

274
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was.</v>

275
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I got turned onto it in 2007 or eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

276
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:16.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I was communicating online,</v>

277
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a nutrition forum on a fitness </v>

278
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

279
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I was a neuroscientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my phd on cellular neuroscience.</v>

280
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:29.851
<v Speaker 2>I didn't let something called patch </v>
<v Speaker 2>clamp electrophysiology where I </v>

281
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:30.520
<v Speaker 2>electrically record from neurons and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

282
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

283
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly just neuroscience and my </v>

284
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 2>postdoctoral research was studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>seizures and uh,</v>

285
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I got to the point where we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some drug based research on seizures and</v>

286
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:47.131
<v Speaker 2>other types of research and the types of</v>
<v Speaker 2>seizures that I study are powerful tonic</v>

287
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:52.651
<v Speaker 2>clonic seizures that a navy seal could </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially experience using closed </v>

288
00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 2>circuit rebreather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they're underwater,</v>

289
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:59.611
<v Speaker 2>a limitation for their time underwater </v>
<v Speaker 2>is cns oxygen toxicity and it's also </v>

290
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 2>limitation for hyperbaric oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>

291
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 2>rebreathers or those ones that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>emit bubbles.</v>

292
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that correct?</v>

293
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a bit of a stealth component,</v>

294
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:12.710
<v Speaker 2>so you're underwater and if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a lake to uh,</v>

295
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.830
<v Speaker 2>engage the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't see you coming.</v>

296
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>So that's the advantage that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

297
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:18.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stealth,</v>

298
00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:23.171
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disadvantages that at 50 feet of </v>

299
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>seawater in just 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the potential to get cns oxygen</v>

300
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 2>toxicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

301
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 2>if you follow the guidelines and dive </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the guidelines,</v>

302
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you know,</v>

303
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>the depth and the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're typically okay.</v>

304
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 2>90 nine point nine percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have,</v>

305
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

306
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone shooting with a 50 caliber </v>

307
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 2>machine gun on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the water,</v>

308
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to want to come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:49.711
<v Speaker 2>you're going to want to stay down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a mind to go down to the </v>

310
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>bridge or ship or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to likely,</v>

311
00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 2>in many cases go down below 50 feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts you at the potential of having a</v>

312
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 2>seizure and a seizure under water.</v>

313
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 2>The seizure itself is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deadly per se,</v>

314
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:05.410
<v Speaker 2>but having a seizure under water could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fatal to the mission and in,</v>

315
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warfighter.</v>

316
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

317
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.580
<v Speaker 2>my research was really developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>various technologies where we actually </v>

318
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:12.630
<v Speaker 2>put things inside of Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

319
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 2>inside a hyperbaric chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an atomic force microscope or a </v>

320
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 2>laser scanning confocal or we can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Mitochondria under pressures that</v>

321
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 2>simulate these operational conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

322
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was about 10 years ago,</v>

323
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:31.061
<v Speaker 2>and out of that research evolved </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying various things and looking at </v>

324
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:35.651
<v Speaker 2>the cells and even the Mitochondria and </v>
<v Speaker 2>observing that ketones essentially </v>

325
00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:39.910
<v Speaker 2>enhance brain energy production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And resilience in extreme environments </v>

326
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 2>of high pressure and high oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from those cellular studies,</v>

327
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became more interested in what people </v>

328
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.171
<v Speaker 2>do when drugs don't work for epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked up and found the ketogenic </v>

329
00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:57.311
<v Speaker 2>diet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fits in perfect because my </v>

330
00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 2>background was studying nutrition and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was studying pharmacology at the time,</v>

331
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but it allowed me to bring nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 2>back into my research program,</v>

332
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and studying the ketogenic diet </v>

333
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:07.830
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>

334
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.510
<v Speaker 2>And the program officer at the time at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the office of navy research really liked</v>

335
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the ketogenetic diet and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>

336
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.800
<v Speaker 2>So being able to consume something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can elevate these blood ketone levels </v>

337
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.590
<v Speaker 2>which can cross the blood brain barrier </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make our brains kind of super brains</v>

338
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 2>under physiological extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I really.</v>

339
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:31.541
<v Speaker 2>I put my efforts into studying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet and also into developing </v>

340
00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:35.891
<v Speaker 2>and testing a wide range of exonerations</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketone products and which come,</v>

341
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 2>which are on the spectrum of drug like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

342
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 2>on the spectrum of kind of natural based</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that can be combined together </v>

343
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Speaker 2>that put you in a state of therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis within like 30 minutes to 60 </v>

344
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 2>minutes so you can use it right before </v>
<v Speaker 2>an operation,</v>

345
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 2>a for mission or therapeutically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a child,</v>

346
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has status epilepticus,</v>

347
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:04.301
<v Speaker 2>which is continuous seizures that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't stop instead of giving them an </v>

348
00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 2>anti epilepsy drug that can have side </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects and even developmental delays.</v>

349
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ketogenic Diet,</v>

350
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes 24,</v>

351
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 2>48,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 72 hours to work,</v>

352
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Speaker 2>but if you can tube feed them a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

353
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>a ketone supplement and put them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic ketosis,</v>

354
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.970
<v Speaker 2>then you can mitigate these seizures </v>
<v Speaker 2>which could have potential longterm </v>

355
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.170
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just one example of a </v>

356
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic application of exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones.</v>

357
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're doing the research on this and</v>

358
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you decided to start doing it yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

359
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I started doing it myself to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better understanding.</v>

360
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a patient in in the UK,</v>

361
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:45.611
<v Speaker 2>his name is Mike Dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you just kind of Google Mike </v>

362
00:17:45.611 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Dancer and epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll come up on his story,</v>

363
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 2>which is a really remarkable story </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he tried a dozen,</v>

364
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:54.350
<v Speaker 2>half dozen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even a dozen different types of </v>

365
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 2>antiepileptic drugs and high doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like Keppra,</v>

366
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 2>like things that are the standard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>care and it didn't work for him.</v>

367
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.380
<v Speaker 2>He connected with me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned a couple supplements before </v>

368
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I embarked on the Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And long story short,</v>

369
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 2>I gave him the information kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the key to genic diet.</v>

370
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:12.921
<v Speaker 2>Here's a scientific rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like before you go and have </v>

371
00:18:12.921 --> 00:18:16.011
<v Speaker 2>brain surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to remove part of his </v>

372
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:16.011
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

373
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:16.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

374
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just use this as a,</v>

375
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe about 2008 or nine ish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a long story short,</v>

376
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk to them because they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>really busy.</v>

377
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I transitioned into a tenure track </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistant professor position.</v>

378
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I was working very long hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe four months or so,</v>

379
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:35.061
<v Speaker 2>went by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when I contacted him he was </v>

380
00:18:35.061 --> 00:18:37.731
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not had a seizure in this time </v>

381
00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:37.731
<v Speaker 2>and he was having multiple seizures </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes per day and couldn't leave the</v>

382
00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:42.501
<v Speaker 2>house and it was almost like a proof of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept and it also caused pretty </v>

383
00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:47.121
<v Speaker 2>significant body composition changes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he was in the fitness industry </v>

384
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 2>and even did a bodybuilding show.</v>

385
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 2>So he basically was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it saved.</v>

386
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.930
<v Speaker 2>It saved his life actually because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had what,</v>

387
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 2>what I would call and what the doctors </v>
<v Speaker 2>called terminal epilepsy.</v>

388
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>There was no way to control seizures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

389
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 2>when the drugs failed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ketogenic diet worked for him.</v>

390
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.270
<v Speaker 2>And that was almost like proof of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept I'm reading.</v>

391
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I thought the qg Hank Diet was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this fad diet.</v>

392
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:14.151
<v Speaker 2>I just knew about it in the fitness </v>
<v Speaker 2>circles is something that I would </v>

393
00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:18.080
<v Speaker 2>actually typically avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you read about the history of </v>

394
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 2>the Diet in the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 twenties,</v>

395
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 2>and how Dr Wilder kind of developed this</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>

396
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Mayo clinic there's like really </v>

397
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.471
<v Speaker 2>legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A peer reviewed research behind it and </v>

398
00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:33.300
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of research and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized it was a grossly underutilized,</v>

399
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mega bought what I would call a </v>

400
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.390
<v Speaker 2>metabolic based therapy for seizures.</v>

401
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Why would you typically avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're in our healthcare </v>

402
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.580
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really not the infrastructure </v>

403
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 2>when a patient comes in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have uncontrollable seizures.</v>

404
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 2>The neurologists or epileptologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>typically does not have the skillset in </v>

405
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:59.121
<v Speaker 2>nutrition knowledge in nutrition to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to guide a patient successfully </v>

406
00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:03.561
<v Speaker 2>into nutritional ketosis and to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would have to refer them to a </v>

407
00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:07.281
<v Speaker 2>registered dietician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which typically are not savvy and </v>

408
00:20:07.281 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

409
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

410
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:13.281
<v Speaker 2>but now the Charlie Foundation is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation that worked closely with </v>

411
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Johns Hopkins and I think there's about </v>
<v Speaker 2>150 to 200 clinics worldwide,</v>

412
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are key to genic diet clinics that </v>

413
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:21.340
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.830
<v Speaker 2>registered dieticians that are working </v>
<v Speaker 2>to assist patients.</v>

415
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

416
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infrastructure is kind of there,</v>

417
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.510
<v Speaker 2>but doctors typically will prescribe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug whenever they can.</v>

418
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>And even when they know they may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are probably aware that,</v>

419
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the standard of care,</v>

420
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.890
<v Speaker 2>a drank diet is a standard of care when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when drugs fail and there's things like </v>

421
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>vagal nerve stimulation and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

422
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 2>But the ketogenic diet has been around </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long,</v>

423
00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:50.001
<v Speaker 2>it has an amazing track record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some side effects associated </v>

424
00:20:50.001 --> 00:20:53.461
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly associated with a classical Kj </v>

425
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:53.461
<v Speaker 2>Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like 90 percent fat,</v>

426
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>eight percent protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now,</v>

427
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Kossoff at Johns Hopkins has done a</v>

428
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 2>lot of work on what I would call the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modified ketogenic diet.</v>

429
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>He calls it the modified Atkins Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more liberal and protein.</v>

430
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.370
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 to 30 percent protein and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance being mostly fats from healthy </v>

431
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 2>sources and the carbohydrates are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:19.981
<v Speaker 2>completely non glycemic carbohydrates </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get from salads or green </v>

433
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are those side effects?</v>

434
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with the classical Qj Diet,</v>

435
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 2>they found that kids put on the Diet it </v>
<v Speaker 2>a reduced igf one,</v>

436
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 2>which if you're into longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

437
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 2>that might be a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

438
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it reduced their terminal height in </v>

439
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 2>some cases because of the protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>restriction.</v>

440
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 2>So restricting protein can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

441
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 2>for reasons we know in the longevity </v>
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>

442
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

443
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.760
<v Speaker 2>reduce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

444
00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 2>igf one signaling insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>igf one signaling,</v>

445
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 2>and that was found to be the case in </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids versus the suspected mechanism.</v>

446
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 2>But when protein was titrated back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

447
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:59.470
<v Speaker 2>that was not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's also kidney stones can happen</v>

448
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>and there was a supplement potassium </v>
<v Speaker 2>citrate that can help kind of offset the</v>

449
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:08.971
<v Speaker 2>mild metabolic acidosis that occurs when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go in the ketogenic diet and just </v>

450
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 2>simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

451
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:13.981
<v Speaker 2>you could do that nutritionally just by </v>
<v Speaker 2>formula in your diet and using more </v>

452
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:13.981
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

453
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:18.720
<v Speaker 2>to balance out and using more minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually the big issue was just the </v>

454
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.070
<v Speaker 2>protein just yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the protein and for kids that </v>

455
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.551
<v Speaker 2>are growing and developing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you restrict protein and kids </v>

456
00:22:26.551 --> 00:22:31.200
<v Speaker 2>that have all these growth factors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that really kind of require </v>

457
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

458
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.820
<v Speaker 2>and also if you go on the Ketogenic Diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

459
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.930
<v Speaker 2>you may be inadvertently limiting total </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories just because of the </v>

460
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.950
<v Speaker 2>palatability of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the classical Qj Diet,</v>

461
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:48.020
<v Speaker 2>whereas the modified Atkins Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was studied very rigorously at </v>

462
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Johns Hopkins by Eric Kossoff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has shown to have like 90 percent of the</v>

463
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:55.351
<v Speaker 2>benefits of this draconian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classic ketogenic diet and a when </v>

464
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:57.680
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>it's better to put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I follow.</v>

466
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I follow a modified Atkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just higher in protein.</v>

467
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's establish the protocol.</v>

468
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 2>So the step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic Ketogenic Diet is 90 percent</v>

469
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight percent protein,</v>

470
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 2>two percent carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

471
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about the macronutrient ratios.</v>

472
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they call it a clinically,</v>

473
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>they call it the four to one or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three to one ketogenic diet.</v>

474
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's really confusing because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to one is in grams,</v>

475
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

476
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.020
<v Speaker 2>it's actually like four parts fat to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>part protein and carbohydrates,</v>

477
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates being very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small part of that one,</v>

478
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 2>that four to one ratio.</v>

479
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.920
<v Speaker 2>And if three to one ratio would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be like 92 percent fat,</v>

480
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:46.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the three to one ratio is like </v>

481
00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 2>88 percent fat or close to 85 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>

482
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.360
<v Speaker 2>So I like to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

483
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

484
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 2>it's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more,</v>

485
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>it's more easy for me to consider in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of percentage of calories.</v>

486
00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and about 75 percent calories from fat </v>

487
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 2>is pretty doable and pretty palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how you do it.</v>

488
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty five to 70 percent if it's super </v>

489
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:08.240
<v Speaker 2>important for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

490
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 2>not only in the clinical realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also people that are doing this,</v>

491
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for athletic reasons,</v>

492
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:18.011
<v Speaker 2>for losing body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>managing type two diabetes is probably </v>

493
00:24:18.011 --> 00:24:21.821
<v Speaker 2>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the low hanging fruit of all these </v>

494
00:24:21.821 --> 00:24:21.821
<v Speaker 2>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can talk more about that.</v>

495
00:24:21.821 --> 00:24:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest thing to do is to count your</v>

496
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.360
<v Speaker 2>macros and test your ketones of course.</v>

497
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.360
<v Speaker 2>But people are horrible at counting how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many calories they are getting in when </v>

498
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:35.350
<v Speaker 2>you tell them to follow a diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they really need a,</v>

499
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

500
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 2>an APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a software program,</v>

501
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an APP,</v>

502
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:44.741
<v Speaker 2>and a Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutrition makes the kind of gold </v>

503
00:24:44.741 --> 00:24:48.101
<v Speaker 2>standard app for tracking your macros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm working with them hopefully to </v>

504
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 2>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called avatar nutrition.</v>

505
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the actual app name that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>APP name.</v>

506
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very highly innovative,</v>

507
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 2>a app that not only does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.380
<v Speaker 2>you put in your macro has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a macro calculator,</v>

509
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that macro nutrient profile is in the </v>

510
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.971
<v Speaker 2>system and you do body composition </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurements a weekly and it calculates </v>

511
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.020
<v Speaker 2>through what I would call an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence system and ai system in the</v>

512
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:23.021
<v Speaker 2>algorithm to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adjust your calories week by week </v>

513
00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 2>based on the progress that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>

514
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the only system that I know of.</v>

515
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 2>It's kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

516
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:33.180
<v Speaker 2>like a macro tracking system that also </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you feedback on how to titrate </v>

517
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.970
<v Speaker 2>your calories and your macros over time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit specific body composition changes</v>

518
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:41.360
<v Speaker 2>that you want to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the system.</v>

519
00:25:41.361 --> 00:25:43.660
<v Speaker 2>It's the ideal platform to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

520
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 2>incorporate the ketogenic diet into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's gonna take some work with the,</v>

521
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are writing software to </v>

522
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:54.370
<v Speaker 2>design it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But essentially,</v>

523
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have available a key to genic </v>

524
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:00.821
<v Speaker 2>diet app that we'll be able to adjust to</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever output that you want,</v>

525
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 2>whether it be managing seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

526
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe a metabolic management of cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

527
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>body composition changes or performance </v>

528
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:12.720
<v Speaker 2>changes over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all being written up.</v>

529
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a bunch of questions.</v>

530
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.220
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

531
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.770
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

532
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.730
<v Speaker 2>what are your primary fats like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

533
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you tell someone that your diet is,</v>

534
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about the classic 90 percent fat,</v>

535
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 2>but even 75 percent fat people just go.</v>

536
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where?</v>

537
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Where's all that fat coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you,</v>

538
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 2>what do you use for fats and do vary it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

539
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

540
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:39.510
<v Speaker 2>my dad is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the same 12 to 15 foods probably </v>

541
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.150
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife kind of eats outside of the </v>

542
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:43.150
<v Speaker 2>range of the Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes,</v>

543
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.050
<v Speaker 2>or she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:44.990
<v Speaker 2>How dare she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

545
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't try to pasta in front of you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mock you a she does,</v>

546
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 2>but I don't crave it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing.</v>

547
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:54.140
<v Speaker 2>And she thinks it's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

548
00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

549
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 2>so that created a bit of a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

550
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 2>like when I go home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

551
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:05.601
<v Speaker 2>I was up on pasta so you might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carbohydrate tolerance is actually </v>

552
00:27:05.601 --> 00:27:07.770
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I go back to a higher carb diet,</v>

553
00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't throw in three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 grams of carbs a day,</v>

555
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:12.180
<v Speaker 2>but I tolerate it very well.</v>

556
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 2>So me going into a ketogenetic diet was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a very strange thing for me to do that.</v>

557
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had read Robb Wolfe's book and knew </v>

558
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 2>about the Paleo Diet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even,</v>

559
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

560
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.680
<v Speaker 2>some of the writings of Gary Taubes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was a little hesitant or skeptical</v>

561
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.910
<v Speaker 2>about about it and skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

562
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I really thought that you need carbs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow in the gym and maintain your </v>

563
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 2>strength and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and performance.</v>

564
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And I just felt that the brain needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose for fuel and I didn't,</v>

565
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:48.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of unaware of the research </v>

566
00:27:48.201 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Speaker 2>that was done in Harvard in 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

567
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:53.690
<v Speaker 2>by George Cahill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did get a chance to talk to him </v>

568
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.690
<v Speaker 2>for a pastor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rob Wolf is,</v>

569
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rob is really into Jujitsu,</v>

570
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's having an issue with maintaining a </v>

571
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.511
<v Speaker 2>strict ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's going with the </v>

572
00:28:02.511 --> 00:28:02.511
<v Speaker 2>classical ketogenic or the modified </v>
<v Speaker 2>Atkins,</v>

573
00:28:02.511 --> 00:28:07.041
<v Speaker 2>but he has a problem with having the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carbohydrate restriction when he has</v>

574
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 2>really hard training days.</v>

575
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would to,</v>

576
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to rob about that a little </v>

577
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

578
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.230
<v Speaker 2>the body is incredibly adaptable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching fuel sources and adapting to </v>

579
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.341
<v Speaker 2>that fuel source over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people may be a little less </v>

580
00:28:22.341 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 2>adaptable than other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that if he was to give it a,</v>

581
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I think you knowing rob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did give it a very legit shot.</v>

582
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:33.531
<v Speaker 2>He may benefit from adding some slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs in just prior to an intra workout.</v>

583
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 2>During what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you consider a slow carb?</v>

584
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 2>there are supplements out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

586
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I would say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit of sweet potato in,</v>

588
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to training or the day before,</v>

589
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe a few hours before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's some sort of a car with a plenty</v>

590
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:57.420
<v Speaker 2>of fiber or something like a digest </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly the idea,</v>

591
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.510
<v Speaker 2>even a high molecular weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates that are on the market </v>

592
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.510
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>

593
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't use them anymore.</v>

595
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I know Jeff Bullock has a product out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

596
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can.</v>

597
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Starch is the name of it and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

598
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will slightly elevate your glucose </v>

599
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 2>and not trigger an insulin response so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't go hypoglycemic after and </v>

600
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.450
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.490
<v Speaker 2>titrating carbohydrates and glucose into</v>
<v Speaker 2>your system over a predetermined period,</v>

603
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they know that you're a,</v>

604
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>it'll kind of hit your system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain it for three or four hours,</v>

605
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.400
<v Speaker 2>which is ideal for people engaging in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

607
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>

608
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 2>a or cycling during that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that timeframe.</v>

609
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're getting in a sufficient</v>

610
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 2>amount of calories and if you are using </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like creatine monohydrate,</v>

611
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 2>which knows where you work through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foster gen system,</v>

612
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:56.551
<v Speaker 2>you are able to generate atp for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>short bursts of power that you need to </v>

613
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.610
<v Speaker 2>manage your opponent and sustain it.</v>

614
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.150
<v Speaker 2>So for a supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to stop my creatine,</v>

615
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.160
<v Speaker 2>would you do that prior to the workout?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would like know a lot of people take </v>

616
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 2>creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>postworkout?</v>

617
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

618
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're tickling pre attentive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

620
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And you stopped taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created it's in your system for,</v>

621
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days to a week or more.</v>

622
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

623
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily when you take it.</v>

624
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:26.401
<v Speaker 2>It's just that you take it on a and </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably at least three grams per day </v>

625
00:30:26.401 --> 00:30:28.330
<v Speaker 2>for a larger guy at three to five grams </v>
<v Speaker 2>per day.</v>

626
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Is that something you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the few supplements that I </v>

627
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.661
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only take maybe three or four </v>

628
00:30:36.661 --> 00:30:39.301
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to take all these different </v>

629
00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:39.301
<v Speaker 2>supplements so I'm more of a food guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

630
00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I'd take three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements and they use some of the new</v>

631
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>food products that are coming out on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>market now,</v>

632
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.250
<v Speaker 2>a junk food products and that allows me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to maintain my kid drank diet when I'm </v>

633
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:50.250
<v Speaker 2>traveling.</v>

634
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever mess around with Beta </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alanine?</v>

635
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

636
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>it's something I use to increase a </v>
<v Speaker 2>carnosine levels,</v>

637
00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I used in the past.</v>

638
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:04.501
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the tingles that I get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people like to tinker with them </v>

639
00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and it's not quite that extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Niacin,</v>

640
00:31:07.631 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's working through a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>receptor.</v>

641
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:14.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I took notice and I </v>

642
00:31:14.821 --> 00:31:14.821
<v Speaker 2>thought I was going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

643
00:31:14.821 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 2>it's unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that,</v>

644
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people look forward to it.</v>

645
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are strange,</v>

646
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 2>but the Beta Alanine is a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes me uncomfortable.</v>

647
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 2>But I remember drinking on the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gym.</v>

648
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:28.920
<v Speaker 2>It was part of my preworkout formula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

649
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and it just made me itchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's didn't like it.</v>

650
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 2>And you know that the data's not dance a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

651
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

652
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not what I would call compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like it may offer a </v>

653
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>

654
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 2>It was just recommended to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I brought it up.</v>

655
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.600
<v Speaker 2>So you're creating three grams per day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what do you that up to 15,</v>

656
00:31:46.601 --> 00:31:47.260
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

657
00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 2>He was on the mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to the.</v>

658
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I lost some weight or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like almost almost exactly.</v>

659
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 2>So I had a couple of weeks ago I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

660
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I did an a mission with NASA and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater for a while and when it came </v>

661
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.170
<v Speaker 2>back up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long is awhile?</v>

662
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was under for 10 days,</v>

663
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 2>which is Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more than a while.</v>

664
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It makes me an aquanaut yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

665
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:10.540
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

666
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 2>and during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the training for it,</v>

667
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot of swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a,</v>

668
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I sink like a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of negatively buoyant and so it</v>

669
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.970
<v Speaker 2>took a lot out of me and I tried to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my file that I was like closer to </v>

670
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.490
<v Speaker 2>200.</v>

671
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe you'd be more likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>an astronaut candidate for your,</v>

672
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 2>like lower weight and space is a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

673
00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:35.371
<v Speaker 2>Has Been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to get my body weight from </v>

674
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:35.371
<v Speaker 2>2:26</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to two.</v>

675
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:35.371
<v Speaker 2>Oh seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did it,</v>

676
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>took about three months and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>creeping slowly back up.</v>

677
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did you do to do just high </v>

678
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 2>aerobic workout restriction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did intermittent fasting.</v>

679
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Really just transitioned to a diet where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I typically to a ketogenic breakfast </v>

680
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:54.761
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of small and I would made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a little bit smaller and two or </v>

681
00:32:54.761 --> 00:32:55.520
<v Speaker 2>three days out of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

682
00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.580
<v Speaker 2>on average I would just kind of naughty </v>
<v Speaker 2>until dinner and then I would eat a </v>

683
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.160
<v Speaker 2>substantial dinner and then maybe do </v>
<v Speaker 2>some activity after that and then kind </v>

684
00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 2>of nibble at nighttime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe an hour or two before bed.</v>

685
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 2>And that was kind of my routine.</v>

686
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.950
<v Speaker 2>So almost like a warrior diet type deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty close to that.</v>

687
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:17.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From what I know that that's pretty </v>

688
00:33:17.951 --> 00:33:19.511
<v Speaker 2>close to that and I did not in any way </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel deprived of food and that's really,</v>

689
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:25.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who follow a low carb diet or </v>

690
00:33:25.181 --> 00:33:27.311
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think you don't have to count </v>

691
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:27.311
<v Speaker 2>macros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like the biggest mistake.</v>

692
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 2>They think you just go on this and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to count calories,</v>

693
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 2>but you really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could sit back,</v>

694
00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.420
<v Speaker 2>you could sit down in front of the TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a bag of cashews and I can </v>

695
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Polish that off pretty quick and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do a lot of damage.</v>

696
00:33:36.841 --> 00:33:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a lot of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

697
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the kind of foods that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating.</v>

698
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Two handfuls of almonds I think is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>500 calories or something.</v>

699
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

700
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't even make sense.</v>

701
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I talked to people who follow the </v>

702
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Diet and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the huge one diet doesn't work for me.</v>

703
00:33:52.401 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I got on it and I gained like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds and I was like,</v>

704
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your calories?</v>

705
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.390
<v Speaker 2>What was your macros?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

706
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

707
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I was told I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to count that,</v>

708
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most important thing.</v>

709
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>So this is the function of the APP I </v>
<v Speaker 2>told you about Avatar,</v>

710
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.530
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a macro counting </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

711
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now you can set the adjustments to</v>

712
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 2>do low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

713
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the software is written up to,</v>

714
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Quito option,</v>

715
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 2>that will be a tremendous resource for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

716
00:34:21.771 --> 00:34:26.771
<v Speaker 2>The average person that wants to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasion Hank Diet and hopefully we're </v>

717
00:34:26.771 --> 00:34:26.771
<v Speaker 2>going to craft it in a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

718
00:34:26.771 --> 00:34:27.760
<v Speaker 2>to help the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

719
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 2>the clinical community too.</v>

720
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons why I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have you on is because you're an actual </v>

721
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.611
<v Speaker 4>scientist and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many misconceptions when it </v>

722
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:37.611
<v Speaker 4>comes to ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the benefits,</v>

723
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:42.120
<v Speaker 4>the problems associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a bunch of people that.</v>

724
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:47.450
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I've found really</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating is recently because the </v>

725
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:50.331
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet has become so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been these sort of sparsely </v>

726
00:34:52.081 --> 00:34:56.910
<v Speaker 4>educated meathead trainer type dudes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are pulling the ketogenic diet.</v>

727
00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.440
<v Speaker 4>And whenever I see that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

728
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a person whose ideas are </v>

729
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:03.970
<v Speaker 4>threatened and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whenever someone says the Ketogenic</v>

730
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Diet is not beneficial or it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>really worth it,</v>

731
00:35:07.531 --> 00:35:08.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

732
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:13.060
<v Speaker 4>but you're not saying anything like </v>
<v Speaker 4>where's the science like point to </v>

733
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.050
<v Speaker 4>something because there's a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of science that shows the benefit</v>

734
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 4>of the key to genic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of meat heads that </v>

735
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:21.990
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been critical of it.</v>

736
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.310
<v Speaker 4>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I read that,</v>

737
00:35:23.311 --> 00:35:23.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

738
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 4>you're not saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no substantial reason why </v>

739
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.261
<v Speaker 4>you're critical of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This makes me think that you have been </v>

740
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:33.750
<v Speaker 4>pushing a certain type of diet for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

741
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 4>This comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shows contrary evidence and trying to</v>

742
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:40.800
<v Speaker 4>diminish it in some sort of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but without any actual science.</v>

743
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:46.010
<v Speaker 4>So what have been the criticisms of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ketogenic Diet and how many of them are </v>

744
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.541
<v Speaker 4>actually valid in terms of when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when what I'm talking about when I'm </v>

745
00:35:50.541 --> 00:35:55.521
<v Speaker 4>talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if I'm talking to </v>

746
00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:57.141
<v Speaker 4>professional athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to athletes who's very </v>

747
00:35:57.141 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 4>health is very critical that they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy,</v>

748
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about fighters.</v>

749
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 4>So for them like to recommend a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet to a fighter,</v>

750
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 4>it's very tricky because we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking like one percent,</v>

751
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.980
<v Speaker 4>two percent performance could be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between victory and defeat </v>

752
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.300
<v Speaker 4>and maybe even being knocked out or </v>
<v Speaker 4>submitted and being successful.</v>

753
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think most important people need to</v>

754
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:23.931
<v Speaker 4>appreciate that when you transition your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body from burning carbohydrates and </v>

755
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:28.191
<v Speaker 4>glucose and forcing it to rely primarily</v>
<v Speaker 4>all fat and ketones for fuel or not.</v>

756
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:34.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're shifting for the predominant </v>

757
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 4>fuel source to be fat and ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not happening.</v>

758
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.970
<v Speaker 4>That's not something that happens like </v>
<v Speaker 4>overnight and it doesn't even happen in </v>

759
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 4>two or three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I've seen in elite level,</v>

760
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:48.470
<v Speaker 4>cyclist and and other types of sports is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it really takes a minimum of three </v>

761
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideally six months and even after a year</v>

762
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 4>I think you're getting a changes even at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the epigenetic level.</v>

763
00:36:57.121 --> 00:37:02.121
<v Speaker 4>We know that ketones function as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>signaling molecule through histone </v>

764
00:37:02.121 --> 00:37:06.651
<v Speaker 4>deacetylase activity that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>turning on genes that are causing </v>

765
00:37:06.651 --> 00:37:10.110
<v Speaker 4>adaptations in our body and these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these happened slowly over time.</v>

766
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:15.110
<v Speaker 4>The more you follow the huge hank diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the easier it gets because there's a </v>

767
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.890
<v Speaker 4>learning curve to to implementing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the more you follow it,</v>

768
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:21.891
<v Speaker 4>the easier it gets and the more benefits</v>
<v Speaker 4>you derive from it over time and those </v>

769
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:26.361
<v Speaker 4>benefits really don't start to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The benefits that that I'm thinking </v>

770
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:31.401
<v Speaker 4>about after about two or three months </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're talking about benefits on a </v>

771
00:37:31.401 --> 00:37:34.911
<v Speaker 4>cellular level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a performance from a performance </v>

772
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a minimum of two months,</v>

773
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 4>like your performance will go down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to accept,</v>

774
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:41.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is something that voters </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have to do in the off season.</v>

775
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:46.790
<v Speaker 4>Athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was stunned at how much of an impact </v>

776
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.790
<v Speaker 4>it had on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

777
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how fast were the benefits?</v>

778
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the benefits of the weight loss was </v>

779
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:53.990
<v Speaker 4>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty significant.</v>

780
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:58.521
<v Speaker 4>Pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost a few pounds within the first </v>

781
00:37:58.521 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 4>week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas I'm pretty active and it's not,</v>

782
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't change much other than that.</v>

783
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I was amazed at like the Keto </v>

784
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 4>flu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

785
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.291
<v Speaker 4>what people call the Keto flu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you get that dragging for the first </v>

786
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:16.280
<v Speaker 4>week or two?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was just dry and I would do a </v>

787
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:16.280
<v Speaker 4>hard workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

788
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.260
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to keep doing that.</v>

789
00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

790
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 4>That's like a big one was hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bag.</v>

791
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what I would really feel it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because uh,</v>

792
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:25.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do rounds or I'll,</v>

793
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 4>I'll set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

794
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:27.600
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of rounds,</v>

795
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:32.601
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of time and that's when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can really feel the difference from </v>

796
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 4>day to day and I'm just really </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggling.</v>

797
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

798
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 2>And how long did it take you to adapt to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

799
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Or did you adapt to that?</v>

800
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month in?</v>

801
00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.320
<v Speaker 3>It started to</v>

802
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.920
<v Speaker 2>normalize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that would be consistent with</v>

803
00:38:45.921 --> 00:38:49.490
<v Speaker 2>the literature if you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>cyclists and if you're,</v>

804
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of different athletes,</v>

805
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:54.170
<v Speaker 2>it takes about six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your performance will go down and</v>

806
00:38:54.171 --> 00:38:56.840
<v Speaker 2>then start to creep up back to baseline </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

807
00:38:56.841 --> 00:39:01.841
<v Speaker 2>around the six week mark and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>adhere to it strictly and really stick </v>

808
00:39:02.061 --> 00:39:03.230
<v Speaker 2>with your training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

809
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:08.330
<v Speaker 2>in the 12 week mark you could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking new pgrs depending on personal </v>

810
00:39:09.111 --> 00:39:10.650
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

811
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Non personal records.</v>

812
00:39:12.321 --> 00:39:17.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's primarily directed to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say endurance athletes,</v>

813
00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 2>ultra marathon athletes to cyclists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>runners too,</v>

814
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:21.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iron man athletes.</v>

815
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that had merged out of all</v>

816
00:39:24.651 --> 00:39:29.651
<v Speaker 2>the emails that I get people sending me </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood work and their performance </v>

817
00:39:29.651 --> 00:39:31.640
<v Speaker 2>measurements is that I used to think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was about a month or two.</v>

818
00:39:31.641 --> 00:39:36.641
<v Speaker 2>It's more like three months to six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months when they really start hitting </v>

819
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:38.690
<v Speaker 2>their stride because I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty profound changes when you,</v>

820
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.470
<v Speaker 2>when you alter the fuel that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving your body in such a profound way.</v>

821
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things that I noticed </v>

822
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.000
<v Speaker 3>the benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first benefits was cognitive </v>

823
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 3>clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

824
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.910
<v Speaker 3>lack of fogginess towards the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day,</v>

825
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.320
<v Speaker 3>the no desire to take a nap and no a </v>
<v Speaker 3>note drop.</v>

826
00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I would have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big meal thing and then the drop the</v>

828
00:40:01.951 --> 00:40:03.150
<v Speaker 3>valley when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

829
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's digesting everything.</v>

830
00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 3>And people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was just how you lived.</v>

831
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.960
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was no getting around </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

832
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.660
<v Speaker 3>That's life you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get sleepy.</v>

833
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.260
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

834
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that there was any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>options going on.</v>

835
00:40:16.261 --> 00:40:18.540
<v Speaker 3>A ketogenic diet completely changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

836
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.160
<v Speaker 3>And when I would tell people about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

837
00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:20.940
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

838
00:40:20.941 --> 00:40:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no difference.</v>

839
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:28.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would eat a meal and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout my day and then it'd be like </v>

840
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:28.070
<v Speaker 3>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the afternoon.</v>

841
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:28.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's this crash?</v>

842
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.620
<v Speaker 3>The crash is supposed to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

843
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.980
<v Speaker 3>where's it coming?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No crash.</v>

844
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with me.</v>

845
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean looking back at an Undergrad when</v>

846
00:40:36.031 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I was like task loaded with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes and stuff I would make,</v>

847
00:40:39.301 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to bulk up at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

848
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I would put like steak or beef on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bagel so I would cut a Bagel kind of in </v>

849
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.660
<v Speaker 2>half and put like meat and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would be getting all the carbs from</v>

850
00:40:48.661 --> 00:40:52.340
<v Speaker 2>the Bagel and I would just go get a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>starbucks coffee to,</v>

851
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.260
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate that crash that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

852
00:40:55.290 --> 00:41:00.290
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the key to genic diet when you eat a </v>

853
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.290
<v Speaker 2>meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it essentially,</v>

854
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:05.091
<v Speaker 2>if it does not abolish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is significantly attenuate that insulin </v>

855
00:41:05.091 --> 00:41:06.230
<v Speaker 2>response that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

856
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:11.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where something like a continuous blood </v>

857
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:11.250
<v Speaker 2>glucose measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dexcon or something,</v>

858
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.980
<v Speaker 2>and you look at that and you eat a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a standard American diet,</v>

859
00:41:13.981 --> 00:41:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you see a big spike in glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typically in the postprandial glucose,</v>

860
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.460
<v Speaker 2>that'll be hypoglycemic.</v>

861
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.700
<v Speaker 2>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only does your mental and physical </v>

862
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.341
<v Speaker 2>performance crash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you crave food so that we'll send </v>

863
00:41:28.341 --> 00:41:28.341
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>searching,</v>

864
00:41:28.341 --> 00:41:28.470
<v Speaker 2>sending you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running to the refrigerator.</v>

865
00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to seek a reward,</v>

866
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dysphoria,</v>

867
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I would say that you get from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypoglycemia,</v>

868
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 2>so when you on a Ketogenic Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you essentially abolished that you don't</v>

869
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 2>have this spike in glucose which spikes </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin and your.</v>

870
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Your energy levels are maintained in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big thing is cognitive.</v>

871
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So the cognitive resilience is is a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

872
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:57.041
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're hypoglycemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could like use something to lower </v>

873
00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 2>your blood glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin and push it down to a level that</v>

874
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 2>would put someone into a coma and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ketones are elevated,</v>

875
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 2>they are asymptomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For hypoglycemia,</v>

876
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:10.150
<v Speaker 2>and this was a study actually going back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the work done by George Cahill at </v>

877
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.261
<v Speaker 2>Harvard where he fasted subjects for 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and he did a battery of cognitive </v>

878
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:19.601
<v Speaker 2>tests and he measured blood going to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain and blood coming away from the </v>

879
00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:19.601
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

880
00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And he determined that about 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of brain energy metabolism is derived </v>

881
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.491
<v Speaker 2>from ketones when you're fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same occurs with a ketogenic </v>

882
00:42:27.491 --> 00:42:31.451
<v Speaker 2>diet too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are literally switching the fuel </v>

883
00:42:31.451 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 2>source that your brain is using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in an extension of the study,</v>

884
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:38.321
<v Speaker 2>he injected to 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use of Insulin and pushed glucose down</v>

885
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:40.060
<v Speaker 2>to one millimolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

886
00:42:40.061 --> 00:42:43.420
<v Speaker 2>which is universally fatal and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you take a crowd of people are eating</v>

887
00:42:43.421 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 2>a standard diet and push it down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

888
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 2>they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all die.</v>

889
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So none of them died in the study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how they got it passed </v>

890
00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:55.361
<v Speaker 2>the Irb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethics review in Harvard Medical </v>

891
00:42:55.361 --> 00:42:55.361
<v Speaker 2>School.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they did.</v>

892
00:42:55.361 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 2>What year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 67.</v>

893
00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:01.150
<v Speaker 2>And it was a steady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became completely fascinated with </v>

894
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.811
<v Speaker 2>because I couldn't believe that they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because you can't even do it in </v>

895
00:43:04.811 --> 00:43:04.811
<v Speaker 2>animals nowadays.</v>

896
00:43:04.811 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the IOC committee of the Animal Care and</v>

897
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 2>use committee would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

898
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 2>would put a stop to that very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

899
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:13.661
<v Speaker 2>they probably sent the investigator out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the university if they propose to do </v>

900
00:43:13.661 --> 00:43:15.450
<v Speaker 2>some of the studies that were done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

901
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:20.530
<v Speaker 2>but what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they lowered blood glucose down to </v>

902
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 2>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would put someone into a coma,</v>

903
00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the subjects were asymptomatic for </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypoglycemia because they,</v>

904
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.800
<v Speaker 2>their brains were keto adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had essentially been over a week </v>

905
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.170
<v Speaker 2>and in a fasted state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all kind of heavyset.</v>

906
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.320
<v Speaker 2>They were divinity students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

907
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:35.180
<v Speaker 2>and a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're Harvard medical students,</v>

908
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 2>so they tend to be overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

909
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:42.041
<v Speaker 2>there were liberating a lot of fat from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the adipose and making lots of ketones </v>

910
00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:44.330
<v Speaker 2>and they were in a state where their </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain was tremendously resilient against</v>

911
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 2>hypoglycemia because their ketones were </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevated.</v>

912
00:43:46.761 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 2>And that has practical implications for </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many different.</v>

913
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.900
<v Speaker 2>And I was reading this and couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe what I was reading.</v>

914
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I called George Cahill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it.</v>

915
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I called all these old time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:43:57.921 --> 00:44:00.980
<v Speaker 2>physiologists that were in the field </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to pick their brain.</v>

917
00:44:00.981 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 2>And they were like thrilled that a young</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

918
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just entering ag,</v>

919
00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:09.901
<v Speaker 2>a tenure track position was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of make this as career goes </v>

920
00:44:09.901 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 2>back a ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw all the implications,</v>

921
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 2>not just for epilepsy but for things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Alzheimer's disease,</v>

922
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

923
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.440
<v Speaker 2>a whole host of neurological disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's one in particular called </v>

924
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Glucose transporter type one deficiency </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndrome or glut one deficiency.</v>

925
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And the kids that have this literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a deficiency of the glucose </v>

926
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Speaker 2>transporter on the blood brain barrier </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their,</v>

927
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:36.320
<v Speaker 2>their blood glucose is normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal levels,</v>

928
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 2>but the glucose in their cerebral spinal</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluid is under a two millimolar,</v>

929
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

930
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:44.730
<v Speaker 2>their brains are essentially living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypoglycemia.</v>

931
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 2>So they're constantly having seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't move a lot of them.</v>

932
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 2>They're confined to a wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put them on a Ketogenic Diet,</v>

933
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them wake up,</v>

934
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 2>they start walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their motor function is reversed.</v>

935
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.520
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to genic diet restores brain </v>

936
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.451
<v Speaker 2>energy metabolism in these kids that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't use glucose as an energy source </v>

937
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 2>with this disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called Glucose transporter type one</v>

938
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:13.461
<v Speaker 2>deficiency syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another very interesting example of </v>

939
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:17.541
<v Speaker 2>a disorder where there is a persistent </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular pathology where the symptoms </v>

940
00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:22.431
<v Speaker 2>can be largely silenced with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the application of a key to genic diet </v>

941
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be pretty strict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where ketone supplements come</v>

942
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:27.150
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

943
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

944
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult for some of these kids to</v>

945
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:35.361
<v Speaker 2>follow occasioning diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like a ketone supplement can </v>

946
00:45:35.361 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 2>potentially circumvent the dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>restriction.</v>

947
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:41.841
<v Speaker 2>That's needed for kidogenic diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it easier for parents and kids to </v>

948
00:45:41.841 --> 00:45:46.821
<v Speaker 2>implement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that a ketone </v>

949
00:45:46.821 --> 00:45:49.431
<v Speaker 2>supplement can just further elevate </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones if you're on a ketogenic diet </v>

950
00:45:49.431 --> 00:45:53.870
<v Speaker 2>and further augment the therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficacy of the ketogenic diet or </v>

951
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing efficacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my main application is the warfighter</v>

952
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.700
<v Speaker 2>and maybe astronauts do a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just think of it as a way to </v>

953
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.000
<v Speaker 2>augment further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>augment a therapeutic effect or a safety</v>

954
00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:11.001
<v Speaker 2>effect when it comes to divers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance effect when it comes to the </v>

955
00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:11.001
<v Speaker 2>warfighters are diverse.</v>

956
00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

957
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.510
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

958
00:46:13.511 --> 00:46:16.480
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to people about mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>

959
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.680
<v Speaker 3>have there been studies that have shown </v>
<v Speaker 3>any variation between,</v>

960
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same individuals on a Ketogenic Diet</v>

961
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 3>or carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose based diet in terms of mental </v>

962
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 3>function?</v>

963
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Not good studies and not really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what Ha has been done?</v>

964
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first study I would say </v>

965
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.030
<v Speaker 2>purely key to genic study that I'm aware</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

966
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Use something as simple as medium chain </v>
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides.</v>

967
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:46.670
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a substance that the </v>

968
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.650
<v Speaker 2>chemical name was ace 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

969
00:46:47.651 --> 00:46:50.600
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that substance is in the patent list</v>

970
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.290
<v Speaker 2>as a substance called AC 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

971
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 2>two for people unfamiliar with mct oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil.</v>

972
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to pull this patent,</v>

973
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

974
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleague and friend,</v>

975
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Dr Mary Newport did and wrote a book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease about the use of,</v>

976
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.160
<v Speaker 2>of ketones for Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

977
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:14.210
<v Speaker 2>she identified that the ingredients in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this supplement that helped to enhance </v>

978
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:18.240
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function in people with mild </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive impairment.</v>

979
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ingredient of this,</v>

980
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 2>if you dig into the patent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was caprylic triglyceride,</v>

981
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a medium chain triglyceride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mct oil.</v>

982
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:31.790
<v Speaker 2>And they did a study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a double blind controlled study </v>

983
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:35.071
<v Speaker 2>that showed that people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly they were not apo e four </v>

984
00:47:35.071 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that group did not respond.</v>

985
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

986
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 2>which is another kind of pathway we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go down,</v>

987
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:44.731
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their improvement in cognitive function </v>

988
00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:47.740
<v Speaker 2>correlated with their elevation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketone levels with this supplement.</v>

989
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:52.770
<v Speaker 2>It was a fat that when you consume it </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent and the amount of </v>

990
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.491
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates you consume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it converts that fat into Beta </v>

991
00:47:56.491 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 2>hydroxybutyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can measure with a little </v>

992
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.921
<v Speaker 2>blood meter and adds that level creeped </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and it didn't even have to creep up </v>

993
00:48:01.921 --> 00:48:05.671
<v Speaker 2>that high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like point six that they were </v>

994
00:48:05.671 --> 00:48:08.401
<v Speaker 2>getting significant improvements in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mini mental status test and other tests </v>

995
00:48:08.401 --> 00:48:11.020
<v Speaker 2>that are sort of like the standard test </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Alzheimer's disease.</v>

996
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:16.470
<v Speaker 2>And that really got me interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I knew that levels could go up </v>

997
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:20.611
<v Speaker 2>way higher than point zero six and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're showing that there's a </v>

998
00:48:20.611 --> 00:48:23.940
<v Speaker 2>correlation as ketone levels rise up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

999
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.920
<v Speaker 2>that you have a proportional increase in</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function.</v>

1000
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.790
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking with a ketone ester or </v>
<v Speaker 2>other types of Ketones,</v>

1001
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.770
<v Speaker 2>you could elevate that to one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1002
00:48:32.771 --> 00:48:37.771
<v Speaker 2>three and four millimolar and then get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some really robust because that's </v>

1003
00:48:37.771 --> 00:48:42.181
<v Speaker 2>sending a lot of energy to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every millimolar of Beta </v>

1004
00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:46.801
<v Speaker 2>hydroxybutyrate that's in your blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>could it's been estimated that it gives </v>

1005
00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:46.801
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your brain,</v>

1006
00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:51.451
<v Speaker 2>about a 10 percent boost in energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can restore energy up to up to 10 </v>

1007
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:53.840
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at a,</v>

1008
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.200
<v Speaker 2>if you do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an fdg pet scan and um,</v>

1009
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.670
<v Speaker 2>and a ketone pet scan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you do a dual imaging for that.</v>

1010
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Dr Steven Koonin in Canada has done </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1011
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.280
<v Speaker 2>some work on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's insane that it was so,</v>

1012
00:49:07.281 --> 00:49:08.630
<v Speaker 2>like for</v>

1013
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 3>college students or someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying for an exam or someone is about</v>

1014
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 3>to do something very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm exogenous.</v>

1015
00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Ketones should be like standard,</v>

1016
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1017
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1018
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 2>there's some pretty good evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

1019
00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 2>but is that especially if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficit,</v>

1020
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1021
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually,</v>

1022
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the application that I'm using it for is</v>

1023
00:49:28.961 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 2>in an extreme environment when your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is already at a deficit.</v>

1024
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we could say we're at a deficit,</v>

1025
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:37.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tomorrow I'm jumping on a red eye and</v>

1026
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep on a plane and night land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1027
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:44.341
<v Speaker 2>and go to my university where I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach for a couple hours and then drive </v>

1028
00:49:44.341 --> 00:49:47.881
<v Speaker 2>a couple hours north and give another </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture at night and I'll be on zero </v>

1029
00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:50.971
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would not even attempt that if I </v>

1030
00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:50.971
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1031
00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 2>wasn't doing what I have been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've kind of figured out protocols </v>

1032
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 2>where I can allow me to function even on</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme lack of sleep.</v>

1033
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>So build the motor through it.</v>

1034
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1035
00:50:01.011 --> 00:50:06.011
<v Speaker 3>So when you land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what would you immediately take some </v>

1036
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:06.520
<v Speaker 3>sort of an exotic as ketone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of what,</v>

1037
00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:07.520
<v Speaker 3>what do you take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you,</v>

1038
00:50:07.521 --> 00:50:08.390
<v Speaker 3>ketone supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1039
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:13.700
<v Speaker 2>a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a wide variety of ketone </v>

1040
00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.500
<v Speaker 2>supplements on the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of a food guy so I just used</v>

1041
00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:20.950
<v Speaker 2>them a almost kind of sparingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do tend to use them every day.</v>

1042
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supplements that I've packed my bag </v>

1043
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:26.920
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The key genex supplement is one that I'm</v>

1044
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:31.980
<v Speaker 2>a ben using and also the Pruvit Keto os </v>
<v Speaker 2>product that mixes Beta hydroxybutyrate </v>

1045
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:38.590
<v Speaker 2>salt with mct powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a couple other forms of just </v>

1046
00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Beta hydroxy butyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our studies show that just consuming</v>

1047
00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Beta hydroxy butyrate does not give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the,</v>

1048
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 2>the ketone salt formula,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not give you a lot of the benefits </v>

1049
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:53.620
<v Speaker 2>that we see in some of the studies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're running and the Beta </v>

1050
00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 2>hydroxybutyrate needs to be mixed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>medium chain triglyceride fat and that's</v>

1051
00:50:56.571 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 2>pretty important and I think that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a number of benefits.</v>

1052
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 2>The medium chain triglyceride delays </v>
<v Speaker 2>gastric absorption,</v>

1053
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.480
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1054
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:09.490
<v Speaker 2>it also further boost ketone levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than you could get with ketone </v>

1055
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 2>salts alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get an elevation of ketone levels</v>

1056
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:16.361
<v Speaker 2>that sustained for longer and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably that sustainment is due to kind</v>

1057
00:51:17.271 --> 00:51:22.271
<v Speaker 2>of delaying gastric absorption because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fat kind of delays the release of </v>

1058
00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 2>the ketones into the blood stream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>

1059
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 2>it's stimulating your own ketone </v>
<v Speaker 2>production.</v>

1060
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:30.340
<v Speaker 2>So you're taking a fat right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens when you </v>

1061
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.651
<v Speaker 2>mobilize body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a wide variety of enzymes that </v>

1062
00:51:32.651 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 2>convert that fat into ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take a ketogenic fat,</v>

1063
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:39.041
<v Speaker 2>the same thing is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're revving up that system in </v>

1064
00:51:39.041 --> 00:51:39.920
<v Speaker 2>addition to the exogenous ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1065
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 2>the pruvit product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quito as a key gen x and,</v>

1066
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 2>and there was a couple other companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging on the market.</v>

1067
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 2>We have our own company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ketone technologies,</v>

1068
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 2>and we are partnering with government </v>
<v Speaker 2>agencies like Department of the fence,</v>

1069
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Onr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA to do research to fund research </v>

1070
00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 2>with these institutes to really nail </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the optimal formula,</v>

1071
00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:06.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for antiseizure affects the optimal </v>

1072
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.101
<v Speaker 2>formula for a motor function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affects the optimal formula even for </v>

1073
00:52:09.101 --> 00:52:09.140
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

1074
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And the one was strength will probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>involve,</v>

1075
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adding amino acids,</v>

1076
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:18.071
<v Speaker 2>adding creatine monohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these will be formulas that will be </v>

1077
00:52:18.071 --> 00:52:18.590
<v Speaker 2>optimized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our company is working on that.</v>

1078
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any products yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you sign up for the newsletter,</v>

1079
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:24.080
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will update people on the newsletter.</v>

1080
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And then when the products do come out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in emerge,</v>

1081
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll kind of let people know.</v>

1082
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say you're a food guy,</v>

1083
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.010
<v Speaker 2>are there any foods that you can eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will sardines,</v>

1084
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.520
<v Speaker 2>sardines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1085
00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.000
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1086
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I travel with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this trip it was canned chicken and </v>

1087
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 2>sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a couple of wild planet makes</v>

1088
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:48.810
<v Speaker 2>a good Ken and Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of turned him onto it and uh,</v>

1089
00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:52.400
<v Speaker 2>it really exploded the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of emailed me and thanked me,</v>

1090
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really exploding.</v>

1091
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.220
<v Speaker 2>So it's a small company.</v>

1092
00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:00.220
<v Speaker 2>They do wild wild planet sardines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're packed and olive oil and there </v>

1093
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 2>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you buy,</v>

1094
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.220
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of lemon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might have a slice of lemon or </v>

1095
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.220
<v Speaker 2>lightly lightly smoked or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are really,</v>

1096
00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1097
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean I look forward to eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1098
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 2>for me I'm kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is a treat for me.</v>

1099
00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1100
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken a lot of different things and</v>

1101
00:53:22.311 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>experimented with a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and simply just eating sardines.</v>

1102
00:53:26.221 --> 00:53:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like the perfect food and eggs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to are the perfect food.</v>

1103
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 2>You asked me like where I get my fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>from A.</v>

1104
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I do get a lot from the olive oil that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are packed in this already.</v>

1105
00:53:34.491 --> 00:53:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And so I eat a lot of fatty fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of egg yolks.</v>

1106
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I will make an egg yolk omelet and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>give the whites to my dog for protein,</v>

1107
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they need a little bit more </v>

1108
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.231
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll make an egg yolk omelet and I </v>

1109
00:53:48.231 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 2>will cook it in butter and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:53:49.321 --> 00:53:51.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe make some asparagus on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cooked in butter.</v>

1111
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:55.110
<v Speaker 2>So I get a lot of fat from a macadamia </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>

1112
00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 2>a few nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sardines,</v>

1113
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:03.051
<v Speaker 2>fatty fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of salmon and a lot of egg yolks </v>

1114
00:54:03.051 --> 00:54:03.480
<v Speaker 2>and fatty cuts of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go to the butcher and particularly</v>

1115
00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 2>pick out fatty cuts of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm olive oil,</v>

1116
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:11.450
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mct oil are all things that we have you.</v>

1117
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had issues with Sardines </v>
<v Speaker 2>and heavy metals?</v>

1118
00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.110
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1119
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I think heavy metals are more of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with larger predatory fish.</v>

1120
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1121
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I think swordfish would be kind of at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the chain there.</v>

1122
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1123
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:34.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating like a Maaco shark or </v>

1124
00:54:34.911 --> 00:54:34.911
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be ingesting.</v>

1125
00:54:34.911 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that on a daily base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want.</v>

1126
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:37.310
<v Speaker 2>If you're a pregnant woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1127
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I would stay away from big predatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>

1128
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:44.450
<v Speaker 2>but one thing about sardines is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be farmed in a sustainable way </v>

1129
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.480
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1130
00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:51.520
<v Speaker 2>the amount of heavy metals will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>typically proportional to the size of </v>

1131
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 2>the fish and whether it's predatory.</v>

1132
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.780
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I'm asking this is I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating sardines like two cans a day for </v>

1133
00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.231
<v Speaker 2>a while and I got my blood work done and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like a very trace amount of </v>

1134
00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:03.540
<v Speaker 2>arsenic and my sister arsenic and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor said,</v>

1135
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:08.870
<v Speaker 2>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was going over to different </v>

1136
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.870
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1137
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I eat a lot of sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know where it came from?</v>

1138
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Those out the sardines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:12.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1140
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 2>just whatever was on the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1141
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:18.360
<v Speaker 2>we travel all over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in Borneo and uh,</v>

1142
00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:23.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malaysia and Indonesia and all these </v>

1143
00:55:23.361 --> 00:55:25.101
<v Speaker 2>places and you see some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some boats coming in and those sardines </v>

1144
00:55:25.101 --> 00:55:25.760
<v Speaker 2>are going to various plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1145
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>and even bigger companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1146
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:31.860
<v Speaker 2>we'll source out wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever is cheapest.</v>

1147
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I like to be pretty particular about,</v>

1148
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:40.641
<v Speaker 2>especially if I'm going to eat something</v>
<v Speaker 2>in such a high volume like where it's </v>

1149
00:55:40.641 --> 00:55:44.121
<v Speaker 2>coming from to actually visit the plant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and where it's coming in and get some </v>

1150
00:55:44.121 --> 00:55:44.970
<v Speaker 2>information to where it's coming from.</v>

1151
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1152
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:51.711
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do use some of the meats from the </v>

1153
00:55:51.711 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>butcher box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so butcher box offers a wide array of,</v>

1154
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 2>of meat from grass fed animals and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1155
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our meals at nighttime are,</v>

1156
00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:00.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1157
00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 2>from butcher box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1158
00:56:02.431 --> 00:56:03.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arsenic,</v>

1159
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arsenic can,</v>

1160
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:10.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get concentrated in the ground where </v>

1161
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 2>plants are grown in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1162
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1163
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
<v Speaker 2>if rice is grown in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in China or whatever plant is grown in </v>

1164
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 2>China and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that soil has arsenic in it.</v>

1165
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived behind our house,</v>

1166
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 2>we had like a peach orchard and apple </v>
<v Speaker 2>orchards are notorious for this,</v>

1167
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:30.631
<v Speaker 2>for having high levels of arsenic just </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the chemicals that were used </v>

1168
00:56:30.631 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1169
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:36.660
<v Speaker 2>so this is something to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's something you were eating </v>

1170
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:36.660
<v Speaker 2>with the sardines or maybe it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sardines itself,</v>

1171
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 2>depending on what's already into </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>

1172
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Have the nutritionist was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that with sardines,</v>

1173
00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:43.200
<v Speaker 2>want to cut them out in one way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1174
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that it was probably just </v>
<v Speaker 2>from pollution.</v>

1175
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be.</v>

1176
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why it's really important </v>

1177
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 2>to pick out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 2>where your food's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This company you recommend wild planet.</v>

1179
00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.140
<v Speaker 2>They're fantastic coming is doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>farm in this audience.</v>

1180
00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1181
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:04.471
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different methods that you can </v>

1182
00:57:04.471 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 2>use that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would kind of put you in the category of</v>

1183
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:10.141
<v Speaker 2>sustainable farming for sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's one of the few fishes that are </v>

1184
00:57:10.141 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 2>really low on the spectrum of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of having heavy metals and things.</v>

1185
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:14.010
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1186
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 2>there's women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get this question a lot like,</v>

1187
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a woman becomes pregnant,</v>

1188
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they stop eating fish?</v>

1189
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Who did they stop eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.610
<v Speaker 2>a Ahi tuna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swordfish and things I would say.</v>

1191
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely the big predatory fish you'd </v>

1192
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:29.640
<v Speaker 2>probably want to cut back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1193
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I did take a couple courses in </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotoxicology where we went over,</v>

1194
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 2>like mercury poisoning and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every possible chemical and,</v>

1195
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 2>and just the take home message was a for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the normal person,</v>

1196
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:42.930
<v Speaker 2>probably not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1197
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:48.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're consuming really high </v>

1198
00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:48.420
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>

1199
00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 2>in Grad school I was eating these big </v>
<v Speaker 2>cans like 12,</v>

1200
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:55.381
<v Speaker 2>I think there are 12 ounce cans of tuna </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish and there was like five servings </v>

1201
00:57:55.381 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 2>per can and I would eat like three cans </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day.</v>

1202
00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I would take that and add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fat phobic at the time that it </v>

1203
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 2>would be a chunk light tuna now to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>balsamic vinegar on it.</v>

1204
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:07.081
<v Speaker 2>And I would literally eat three of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 ounce cans a day and that would be 15</v>

1205
00:58:07.691 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 2>servings of tune per day.</v>

1206
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.700
<v Speaker 2>And I did that day in and day out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1207
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:13.090
<v Speaker 2>no ill effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1208
00:58:13.091 --> 00:58:18.091
<v Speaker 2>well I never got tested at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nowadays I tend to do a lot of blood </v>

1209
00:58:18.091 --> 00:58:18.650
<v Speaker 2>work just to check different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1210
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:22.060
<v Speaker 2>but no overt signs of toxicity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1211
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like a little someone,</v>

1212
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:27.190
<v Speaker 2>one of the professors that I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something for,</v>

1213
00:58:27.191 --> 00:58:32.191
<v Speaker 2>she had or her friend had lost a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair due to eating tuna that had high </v>

1214
00:58:32.191 --> 00:58:35.560
<v Speaker 2>mercury and at the time like Kinda had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of hair loss at the time,</v>

1215
00:58:35.561 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but it was also kind of a stressful </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1216
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 2>So maybe when I stopped eating I noticed</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1217
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:45.020
<v Speaker 2>this is back in my mid twenties now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a significant amount of </v>

1218
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:45.480
<v Speaker 2>air loss since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since,</v>

1219
00:58:45.481 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1220
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.950
<v Speaker 2>and a couple people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1221
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 2>and that actually that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms to have mercury toxicity.</v>

1222
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 2>We are tingling and feelings like kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of neurological effects.</v>

1223
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.010
<v Speaker 2>So just something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you consider a,</v>

1224
00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but getting tested is probably a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>

1225
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that from people that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed ridiculous amounts of Sushi.</v>

1226
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would,</v>

1227
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine like Sushi or dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with smaller portions of the actual fish</v>

1228
00:59:09.971 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be,</v>

1229
00:59:11.891 --> 00:59:16.891
<v Speaker 2>if you do that day in and day out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably good to get tested and </v>

1230
00:59:16.891 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>sometimes may not show up in the blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the serum.</v>

1231
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>You might have to look at the red blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell because sometimes you know,</v>

1232
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:26.160
<v Speaker 2>some of these metals are more reflective</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the levels on the,</v>

1233
00:59:26.161 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 2>on the red blood cells or the hair too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's different ways that you can.</v>

1234
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 2>You can measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that you eat.</v>

1235
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Was it candy oysters as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something I usually bring it </v>

1237
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:40.380
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

1238
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I think I brought on this trip to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>candy oysters,</v>

1239
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:45.610
<v Speaker 2>King Oscar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few brands out there that I </v>

1240
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.131
<v Speaker 2>kind of vetted out things and oysters </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really rich and a lot of </v>

1241
00:59:48.131 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients that could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get depleted in,</v>

1242
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 2>on the Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So B,</v>

1243
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:56.470
<v Speaker 2>12 is something I do supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnesium to be 12 insulation from </v>

1244
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would that come from?</v>

1245
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1246
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it could be due to a sources of b 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're kind of eliminating through </v>

1247
01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.920
<v Speaker 2>food choices on the ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1248
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 was basically an animal based.</v>

1249
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1250
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:20.741
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met or I think I did measure </v>

1252
01:00:20.741 --> 01:00:23.321
<v Speaker 2>that once and it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people have reported to me that it </v>

1253
01:00:23.321 --> 01:00:26.291
<v Speaker 2>was the thing that showed up on my blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>work was lower on the low end of </v>

1254
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:30.641
<v Speaker 2>magnesium and I was getting cramps at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and that's the only you asked </v>

1255
01:00:30.641 --> 01:00:30.641
<v Speaker 2>about side effects.</v>

1256
01:00:30.641 --> 01:00:33.860
<v Speaker 2>So the only side effect that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced was cramps at nighttime,</v>

1257
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.920
<v Speaker 2>always between three and four in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and it would start in my foot </v>

1258
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.520
<v Speaker 2>and then start to creep up to my cab </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1259
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:43.640
<v Speaker 2>or if I did like legs or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes my hamstrings.</v>

1260
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:49.350
<v Speaker 2>And then when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magnesium supplementation a really </v>

1261
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>prevented much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever used an isolation tank?</v>

1262
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the cool things about her is that</v>

1263
01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you get my museum to the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1264
01:00:57.891 --> 01:01:02.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the water's filled with a salt </v>

1265
01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:02.891
<v Speaker 2>and the salt is magnesium and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1266
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's pretty legit a science behind </v>

1267
01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.040
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a traveling in,</v>

1268
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Israel and I went to the Dead Sea,</v>

1269
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 2>which is really high in magnesium and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a calming effect,</v>

1270
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is reportedly due to the very high</v>

1271
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>magnesium levels and other salts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in there.</v>

1272
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:27.490
<v Speaker 2>So that magnesium is relatively small </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular weight that anything with a </v>

1273
01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:28.900
<v Speaker 2>molecular weight like under three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400,</v>

1274
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I think can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get into your bloodstream.</v>

1275
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why people like those </v>

1276
01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:37.601
<v Speaker 2>epsom salt baths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things that </v>

1277
01:01:37.601 --> 01:01:37.601
<v Speaker 2>relaxes people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1278
01:01:37.601 --> 01:01:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And epsom salt bath is,</v>

1279
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a very small amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of salt in comparison to a tank which </v>

1280
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:47.510
<v Speaker 2>has my tank is a thousand pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>epsom salts in it and 11 inches water.</v>

1281
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So because you're so buoyant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just need to do this daily at your </v>

1282
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:52.600
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1283
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>not daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whenever I want,</v>

1284
01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:56.480
<v Speaker 2>because it's in my basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go down there and get into it,</v>

1285
01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relaxing effects.</v>

1286
01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1287
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what it brings to mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the.</v>

1288
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I've had at least a half dozen emails </v>
<v Speaker 2>about doing epsom salt baths from als </v>

1289
01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:14.081
<v Speaker 2>patients because als is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a chemical called glutamate,</v>

1290
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:19.420
<v Speaker 2>which is excitatory amino acid </v>
<v Speaker 2>transporter and high magnesium levels </v>

1291
01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.231
<v Speaker 2>can kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the cytotoxic effects of high </v>

1292
01:02:23.231 --> 01:02:26.391
<v Speaker 2>glutamate and they were there physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients that they get and twitching </v>

1293
01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 2>muscle twitching that they get and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>found that,</v>

1294
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dosing magnesium or these epson salt </v>

1295
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.450
<v Speaker 2>baths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1296
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.880
<v Speaker 2>higher and magnesium can calm them down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1297
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>and also maybe mitigate some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitching that they had,</v>

1298
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:43.610
<v Speaker 2>which is probably a reflection of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>glutamate induced neurotoxicity.</v>

1299
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 2>So the cells are dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're releasing.</v>

1300
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.330
<v Speaker 2>So maybe neuroprotective in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it definitely,</v>

1301
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know magnesium,</v>

1302
01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:57.621
<v Speaker 2>you can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take a legit source of </v>

1303
01:02:57.621 --> 01:02:58.340
<v Speaker 2>magnesium that's bioavailable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like magnesium glycinate or,</v>

1304
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.680
<v Speaker 2>or other forms of magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really feel kind of a calming </v>

1305
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has know it makes sense.</v>

1306
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people take it before they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bed.</v>

1307
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1308
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:07.550
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1309
01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 2>the tank is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just wouldn't get out of there.</v>

1310
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Your whole body just feels relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1311
01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I think part of is because the zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity effect of floating,</v>

1312
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 2>you're floating like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very buoyant,</v>

1313
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>right in this because the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very heavy rail,</v>

1314
01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1315
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 2>the Dead Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like only maybe a third of your body is </v>

1316
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of floating in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1317
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:31.011
<v Speaker 2>Or half of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half your body essentially like your </v>

1318
01:03:31.011 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 2>ears are underwater where your faces </v>
<v Speaker 2>above water.</v>

1319
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.640
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to try it.</v>

1320
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big proponent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1321
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:37.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1322
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>als,</v>

1323
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:40.990
<v Speaker 2>is there a benefit in the ketogenic diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1324
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.500
<v Speaker 2>for people they'll off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1325
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>that's another application.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1326
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:49.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy Dr Pasinetti and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at a and Mount Sinai in New York.</v>

1327
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a couple of studies on this </v>

1328
01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.691
<v Speaker 2>looking at caprylic triglyceride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a medium chain fatty acid and </v>

1329
01:03:56.691 --> 01:03:57.360
<v Speaker 2>he also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to,</v>

1330
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a clinical trial I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ongoing now.</v>

1331
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>But prior to that he demonstrated in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouse model of,</v>

1332
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of als,</v>

1333
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:11.631
<v Speaker 2>which is the sod one gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>93 a mouse model and it has a gene </v>

1334
01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:13.950
<v Speaker 2>defect that mimics the familial form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>als.</v>

1335
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Which accounts for maybe about 10 at </v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

1336
01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:20.820
<v Speaker 2>20 percent of als a pathologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he found that a ketogenic diet,</v>

1337
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.200
<v Speaker 2>a improved motor function and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological scores.</v>

1338
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.650
<v Speaker 2>It did not improve overall survival </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1339
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:33.950
<v Speaker 2>So we actually followed up on that study</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a therapy that we call the deanna </v>

1340
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>protocol therapy after Deanna to don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1341
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.470
<v Speaker 2>her father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1342
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Dr Vinson to don't observe that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter responded remarkably well to,</v>

1343
01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 2>if you supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was our Janine </v>

1344
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Alpha-ketoglutarate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1345
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:52.550
<v Speaker 2>and a Gabba and a coenzyme q 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few things that we actually put into a</v>

1346
01:04:55.231 --> 01:05:00.231
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we reproduced the same study using </v>

1347
01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:02.510
<v Speaker 2>this gold standard mouse model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we looked at motor function,</v>

1348
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:07.520
<v Speaker 2>we looked neurological score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we looked at total longterm </v>

1349
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.611
<v Speaker 2>survival too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we found that using medium chain </v>

1350
01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:14.271
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a ketogenic fat with Arginine </v>

1351
01:05:14.271 --> 01:05:18.910
<v Speaker 2>alpha-ketoglutarate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that's in preworkout </v>

1352
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:19.900
<v Speaker 2>formulas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's evasive dilator from the Argentine.</v>

1353
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used a Gabba was in that or any view </v>

1354
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.560
<v Speaker 2>if ventilated form of gamma that crosses</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood brain barrier and um,</v>

1355
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and coenzyme q 10 in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity known,</v>

1356
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:34.270
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of like the drug like </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of it,</v>

1357
01:05:34.271 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still available.</v>

1358
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 2>You can get it online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be kind of a drug or Ubiquinol,</v>

1359
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a powerful warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those supplements together I think </v>

1360
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:48.091
<v Speaker 2>offer are neuroprotective in a way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it had a therapeutic and what I would </v>

1361
01:05:48.091 --> 01:05:51.460
<v Speaker 2>call performance enhancing effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this als mouse model.</v>

1362
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:57.270
<v Speaker 2>And those supplements had a therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on Deanna to don't.</v>

1363
01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's other things in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called the Deanna Protocol,</v>

1364
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:05.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people interested in this can go to </v>

1365
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.670
<v Speaker 2>winning the fight foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1366
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a Tampa based als,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a five zero,</v>

1367
01:06:07.361 --> 01:06:12.361
<v Speaker 2>one c three foundation and you can sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on the foundation and they give you </v>

1368
01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:16.681
<v Speaker 2>the actual protocol and there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a thousand patients registered on </v>

1369
01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:19.930
<v Speaker 2>this that are benefiting from the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's several peer reviewed studies on</v>

1370
01:06:19.931 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1371
01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 2>ideally we'd like to get enough funding </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do a human study,</v>

1372
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:26.650
<v Speaker 2>but the mouse works pretty compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just,</v>

1373
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:27.640
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1374
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
<v Speaker 2>it's an extension of work that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>already been done really in further </v>

1375
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.721
<v Speaker 2>supporting a compelling support for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>proof of concept for using a metabolic </v>

1376
01:06:36.721 --> 01:06:39.250
<v Speaker 2>based approach like targeting energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolism,</v>

1377
01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:42.100
<v Speaker 2>preserving mitochondrial function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cells work better.</v>

1378
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.600
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were talking about epileptic </v>

1379
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.731
<v Speaker 4>kids and I'm supplementing their diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>with ketone supplements because a lot of</v>

1380
01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:52.500
<v Speaker 4>them have a hard time following </v>
<v Speaker 4>kidogenic diet.</v>

1381
01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Can you get the same benefits of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet by following a standard </v>

1382
01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.930
<v Speaker 4>American diet and supplementing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>exogenous ketones?</v>

1383
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it at this time with the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are commercially available.</v>

1384
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:10.590
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that was some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketone esters in development right now.</v>

1385
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.370
<v Speaker 2>We've observed using a range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different animal models that,</v>

1386
01:07:15.371 --> 01:07:20.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that these things are not </v>

1387
01:07:20.371 --> 01:07:20.371
<v Speaker 2>very palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Third,</v>

1388
01:07:20.371 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 2>pricey to make a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're working with various companies</v>

1389
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:27.120
<v Speaker 2>and doing what's required for the FDA to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be generally recognized as safe or some </v>

1390
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 2>of these compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they taste bad.</v>

1391
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people complain about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>think eugenics.</v>

1392
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was pro bono.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ingenix actually tastes pretty good.</v>

1393
01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let it sit.</v>

1394
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 2>If you mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one problem with the eugenics.</v>

1395
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.160
<v Speaker 2>If you mix it up and let it sit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's like,</v>

1396
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.390
<v Speaker 2>tastes like battery acid for were </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed.</v>

1397
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 2>But so I mix it up and if you just keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with some ice cubes in it,</v>

1398
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:48.460
<v Speaker 2>you can probably keep it around for </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a half hour.</v>

1399
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:50.260
<v Speaker 2>But I generally try to drink it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1400
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 2>But some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are nasty.</v>

1401
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1402
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:59.670
<v Speaker 2>well the ketone esters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are things that if I gave you </v>

1403
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 2>right now you would gag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would not be able to drink it.</v>

1404
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Somebody sent me some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's that jazz?</v>

1405
01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:08.080
<v Speaker 4>We still have that laying around here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that little thing to ketone esters and </v>

1406
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:08.180
<v Speaker 4>some dude sent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in like a sealed,</v>

1407
01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 4>a little foil seal plastic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be curious.</v>

1408
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:20.741
<v Speaker 4>I know all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the people behind this was here </v>

1409
01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.600
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1410
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:27.250
<v Speaker 4>This place is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What else?</v>

1411
01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:32.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like if someone had a big bowl of </v>

1412
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:32.940
<v Speaker 4>pasta and then they took something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>key genics,</v>

1413
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.660
<v Speaker 4>would that knock you back in the state </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Ketosis?</v>

1414
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1415
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could eat a bowl of pasta and then </v>

1416
01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 2>consumer key gen x product and then test</v>
<v Speaker 2>your test your blood ketones.</v>

1417
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:48.071
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it look like you're on a strict </v>

1418
01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:48.071
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet that's a mild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1419
01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:50.750
<v Speaker 2>what I would call a modified atkins diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>were as to the ketone ester.</v>

1420
01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:55.780
<v Speaker 2>You could eat a bowl of pasta and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a ketone ester and it would look </v>

1421
01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:59.981
<v Speaker 2>like you fasted for 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it puts you into starvation level </v>

1422
01:08:59.981 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 2>ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So interestingly,</v>

1423
01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:05.771
<v Speaker 2>another application of ketones is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it lowers blood glucose and we don't </v>

1424
01:09:05.771 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 2>know why we're studying that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1425
01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:13.890
<v Speaker 2>and it may do it by your liver is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main regulator of what your glucose </v>

1426
01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your liver as glycogen in it,</v>

1427
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's constantly being broken down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of spilling glucose into a.</v>

1428
01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It may be affecting that process or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>may be enhancing insulin sensitivity,</v>

1429
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.460
<v Speaker 2>which means you take ketones and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells use the glucose that there becomes</v>

1430
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 2>more readily available to the cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>which greater uptake.</v>

1431
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:37.790
<v Speaker 2>So we're looking into precisely why when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consume exogenous Ketones,</v>

1432
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>why glucose goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've replicated it many times,</v>

1433
01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:45.850
<v Speaker 4>different forms of ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So would that be a way for a person who </v>

1434
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.971
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's just not so good at being </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplined with their diet to just </v>

1435
01:09:48.971 --> 01:09:51.020
<v Speaker 4>throw it in there like say God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want him to have some ice cream,</v>

1436
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 4>but I've been really good with my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

1437
01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:57.971
<v Speaker 4>I'll just have the ice cream within.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have some key x or something like that </v>

1438
01:09:57.971 --> 01:09:57.971
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

1439
01:09:57.971 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe there's no shortcuts </v>

1440
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.870
<v Speaker 2>and I think of ketones and I try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I mentioned this on Tim Ferriss </v>

1441
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:07.901
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he put it in there that ketones are </v>

1442
01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:08.190
<v Speaker 2>just another source of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have,</v>

1443
01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 2>if you're eating 2000 calories of food </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then taken lots of ketone </v>

1444
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.371
<v Speaker 2>supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are eating a lot more than 2000 </v>

1445
01:10:16.371 --> 01:10:16.371
<v Speaker 2>calories of food</v>

1446
01:10:16.371 --> 01:10:18.040
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] can you tell as fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as far as like gaining weight,</v>

1447
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:20.590
<v Speaker 4>but as far as like keeping your body </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a state of Ketosis,</v>

1448
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.430
<v Speaker 4>it actually does work.</v>

1449
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the benefits of that would be a </v>

1450
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:30.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe not weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by elevating your blood ketone </v>

1451
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:34.410
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of beneficial effects.</v>

1452
01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Even from a signaling standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like completely independent of </v>

1453
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 2>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that it's a a,</v>

1454
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 2>a super fuel essentially for the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can.</v>

1455
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Your brain cells can generate energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1456
01:10:46.921 --> 01:10:49.650
<v Speaker 2>from ketones in a more efficient manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>than than glucose.</v>

1457
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:54.480
<v Speaker 2>That's really hard for people to believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the one thing that people</v>

1458
01:10:54.481 --> 01:10:59.481
<v Speaker 2>always would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need glucose to fuel your brain </v>

1459
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:02.900
<v Speaker 2>under certain conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are a few stipulations to that </v>

1460
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.350
<v Speaker 2>and I could get a little bit technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for example,</v>

1461
01:11:04.351 --> 01:11:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously if you have one </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficiency syndrome,</v>

1462
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:09.390
<v Speaker 2>you know you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're transporting it,</v>

1463
01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:14.391
<v Speaker 2>but they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain has a number of things that </v>

1464
01:11:14.391 --> 01:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>prevent it from using glucose </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively,</v>

1465
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 2>so in many cases ketones would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferred source of fuel.</v>

1466
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.840
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there may be like with Alzheimer's </v>

1467
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 2>disease or maybe if you even if you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a traumatic brain injury,</v>

1468
01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>there is an internalization of the glut </v>
<v Speaker 2>three transporter so that you have cells</v>

1469
01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:34.101
<v Speaker 2>right and glucose was trying to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the glut three transporter isn't on </v>

1470
01:11:34.101 --> 01:11:37.311
<v Speaker 2>the membrane or you can have a a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysregulation or an inhibition of </v>

1471
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] hydrogenate complex PDH </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>

1472
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 2>and that enzyme is really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatekeeper.</v>

1473
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:44.220
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the governor.</v>

1474
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a throttle that lets the glucose </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the cell to create the feed into </v>

1475
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.030
<v Speaker 2>what we call anaplerotic pathway is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive the TCA cycle,</v>

1476
01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:56.460
<v Speaker 2>the krebs cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that makes reduced intermediate that</v>

1477
01:11:56.461 --> 01:12:01.461
<v Speaker 2>drive the electron transport chain to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make ATP so that it's like a gatekeeper </v>

1478
01:12:01.461 --> 01:12:03.090
<v Speaker 2>and ketones completely bypass that </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

1479
01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 2>So if you have no glove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1480
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 2>if you have impaired activity of PDH </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>

1481
01:12:09.421 --> 01:12:12.330
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1482
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate components say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1483
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you're inhibiting the PDH complex.</v>

1484
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.080
<v Speaker 2>If you're on occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank diet and I don't think there's </v>

1485
01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.451
<v Speaker 2>evidence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the key tones essentially bypass </v>

1486
01:12:23.451 --> 01:12:26.191
<v Speaker 2>those steps and can restore and preserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain energy metabolism even if those </v>

1487
01:12:26.701 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 2>things are dysregulated or dysfunctional</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a number of pathologies,</v>

1488
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them dysfunctional.</v>

1489
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a general state of aging.</v>

1490
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:39.501
<v Speaker 2>It's thought that as we age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a proportional decrease in,</v>

1491
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in glucose energy metabolism in the </v>

1492
01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case with ketones.</v>

1493
01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:51.351
<v Speaker 2>So as we age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data that has been collected so far </v>

1494
01:12:51.351 --> 01:12:54.830
<v Speaker 2>shows that we have essentially the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketone energy metabolism as from young </v>

1495
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:55.950
<v Speaker 2>to adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1496
01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's major implicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can graph it out and you know,</v>

1497
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:04.580
<v Speaker 2>we've had speakers at our conference </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did that and you can see kind of </v>

1498
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.420
<v Speaker 2>like a plateauing effect and a decrease </v>
<v Speaker 2>in brain energy,</v>

1499
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1500
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.420
<v Speaker 2>consumption from glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with the ketones a,</v>

1501
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.760
<v Speaker 2>it bypasses many of the rate limiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps that are associated with impaired </v>

1502
01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.280
<v Speaker 2>glucose metabolism in the brain.</v>

1503
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:22.610
<v Speaker 4>It's almost hard to believe when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>rattle off the laundry list of benefits </v>

1504
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 4>of the Ketogenic Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1505
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:24.860
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1506
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.360
<v Speaker 4>how is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems crazy.</v>

1507
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will.</v>

1508
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:30.990
<v Speaker 4>If it seems like everyone should be on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1509
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:36.350
<v Speaker 4>And it seems crazy that so many benefits</v>
<v Speaker 4>are attributable to this fat based fat </v>

1510
01:13:36.661 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 4>burning diet.</v>

1511
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bands I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1512
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.560
<v Speaker 2>like my wife does not eat damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a relatively high carbohydrate diet</v>

1513
01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:48.580
<v Speaker 2>with people enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because she enjoys it and that's </v>

1514
01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.801
<v Speaker 2>because her carbohydrate tolerance is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really remarkably high and some people </v>

1515
01:13:51.801 --> 01:13:55.650
<v Speaker 2>do really well on high carbs and you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you're testing her.</v>

1516
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1517
01:13:57.541 --> 01:14:02.541
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I've tested her blood and are </v>

1518
01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 2>ketones to and she can get rapidly into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a state of ketosis.</v>

1519
01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:07.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're testing some products now for </v>

1520
01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:07.641
<v Speaker 2>ketone technologies or our company and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1521
01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:08.850
<v Speaker 2>various products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she can.</v>

1522
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It's the first time I've actually seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>her ketones levels up where mine are and</v>

1523
01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 2>sustain it over a period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1524
01:14:15.491 --> 01:14:18.820
<v Speaker 2>this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just from taking a product a for</v>

1525
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:23.821
<v Speaker 2>taking himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the formulation of specific </v>

1526
01:14:23.821 --> 01:14:23.821
<v Speaker 2>products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1527
01:14:23.821 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are a lot of benefits,</v>

1528
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of it as like one tool in a </v>

1529
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.590
<v Speaker 2>toolbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1530
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.570
<v Speaker 2>simple carbohydrate restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't have to be acutely drank</v>

1531
01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but simply restricting your </v>

1532
01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates is a powerful hammer.</v>

1533
01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:42.370
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for type two diabetes and a Virta health</v>

1534
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:47.371
<v Speaker 2>is doing more for the medical management</v>
<v Speaker 2>of type two diabetes than any other </v>

1535
01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>entity that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1536
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:54.001
<v Speaker 2>I think their goal is in the next decade</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reverse a $100 million cases of type </v>

1537
01:14:54.001 --> 01:14:58.801
<v Speaker 2>two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like our government spends way more a </v>

1538
01:14:58.801 --> 01:15:03.800
<v Speaker 2>like $200,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>of funding for managing diabetes.</v>

1539
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1540
01:15:06.431 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 2>NASA's budget is something like a $19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion per year or something like that.</v>

1541
01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 2>So it compare that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1542
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that type two diabetes,</v>

1543
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:19.840
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an obesity,</v>

1544
01:15:19.841 --> 01:15:23.500
<v Speaker 2>the major problem for type two diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 2>is carbohydrate intolerance.</v>

1545
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would a registered dietitian </v>

1546
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:32.910
<v Speaker 2>administer a carbohydrate based diet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a type two diabetes person who has a </v>

1547
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:36.830
<v Speaker 2>problem with carbohydrate intolerance </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1548
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:39.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's reflected in their elevated </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemoglobin h,</v>

1549
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.470
<v Speaker 2>one C or glucose levels or insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>

1550
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Virta is created a platform of </v>

1551
01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:49.690
<v Speaker 2>people who using an APP will allow you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1552
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to follow,</v>

1553
01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:55.831
<v Speaker 2>adhere to carbohydrate restriction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acute agentic diet to essentially not </v>

1554
01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:59.470
<v Speaker 2>just manage it but just like completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse it.</v>

1555
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:05.010
<v Speaker 2>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the numbers are something like </v>

1556
01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:07.590
<v Speaker 2>89,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 90 percent of people from the </v>

1557
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:10.501
<v Speaker 2>data they collected so far and publish </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 90 percent of people might be 89 </v>

1558
01:16:10.501 --> 01:16:15.331
<v Speaker 2>or 87 percent can either completely get </v>
<v Speaker 2>off insulin or like reduce it down to </v>

1559
01:16:15.331 --> 01:16:20.251
<v Speaker 2>very low levels just simply by using a </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate restricted diet.</v>

1560
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.160
<v Speaker 2>And that has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's profound.</v>

1561
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean imagine the number of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get off medication,</v>

1562
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:32.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that can do to the healthcare </v>

1563
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.810
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the healthcare burden of paying all </v>

1564
01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>these dollars for drug management of </v>
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes,</v>

1565
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 2>which is going up to epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportions.</v>

1566
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:38.820
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1567
01:16:38.821 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 2>so people are out there and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes,</v>

1568
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:46.561
<v Speaker 2>just go to Virta health and you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 2>an amazing array of clinicians,</v>

1569
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:53.010
<v Speaker 2>basic scientists and registered </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dietitians that assist people for the </v>

1570
01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:55.270
<v Speaker 2>medical management of type two diabetes.</v>

1571
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:57.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The list is.</v>

1572
01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>

1573
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Like the low hanging fruit is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes,</v>

1574
01:17:03.311 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad to see the field go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that direction.</v>

1575
01:17:05.801 --> 01:17:07.030
<v Speaker 2>But for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years,</v>

1576
01:17:07.031 --> 01:17:12.031
<v Speaker 2>many decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only application when I got into </v>

1577
01:17:12.031 --> 01:17:15.011
<v Speaker 2>this research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only application with pediatric </v>

1578
01:17:15.011 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy and then two years after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like it works for adult epilepsy.</v>

1579
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's taken so much time for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>science to prove kind of what we already</v>

1580
01:17:21.351 --> 01:17:22.110
<v Speaker 2>knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1581
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.150
<v Speaker 2>That therapeutic ketosis was supplying </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones to the brain.</v>

1582
01:17:26.151 --> 01:17:31.151
<v Speaker 2>That's an alternative form of energy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that has more implications </v>

1583
01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:33.170
<v Speaker 2>than just helping your brain for </v>
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy.</v>

1584
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many other applications,</v>

1585
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're uncovering all this and when</v>

1586
01:17:36.571 --> 01:17:39.150
<v Speaker 3>you're doing all this research and </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying it and you're finding all these</v>

1587
01:17:39.151 --> 01:17:44.151
<v Speaker 3>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you tried to figure out or </v>

1588
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 3>contemplate like what is the cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why is it so beneficial for your </v>

1589
01:17:48.091 --> 01:17:51.240
<v Speaker 3>body to live off fats versus your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>to live off glucose?</v>

1590
01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Is this something that we evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live off fats?</v>

1591
01:17:54.991 --> 01:17:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Is this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a better primary source?</v>

1592
01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Is it something that our body can exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of glucose but really were designed </v>

1593
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:03.710
<v Speaker 3>to live off fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1594
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:04.590
<v Speaker 3>what is the cause?</v>

1595
01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's multi.</v>

1596
01:18:07.401 --> 01:18:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's many answers to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

1597
01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:14.081
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you kind of what I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that many people do really well on a </v>

1598
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate based with no overt signs </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1599
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology,</v>

1600
01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.610
<v Speaker 2>especially really active people in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

1601
01:18:22.611 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I always kind of joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that are most interested</v>

1602
01:18:25.581 --> 01:18:30.581
<v Speaker 2>in the ketogenic diets are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them are athletes that contact </v>

1603
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:30.581
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1604
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:31.490
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people have health problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1605
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

1606
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:35.450
<v Speaker 2>But the athletes are typically not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones who necessarily need it,</v>

1607
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but they can benefit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1608
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1609
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:43.451
<v Speaker 2>if there's football players out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people that are predisposed to </v>

1610
01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:47.081
<v Speaker 2>concussion or brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really good to be on a key </v>

1611
01:18:47.081 --> 01:18:48.770
<v Speaker 2>to genic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Kinda like a whole nother area we</v>

1612
01:18:48.771 --> 01:18:49.370
<v Speaker 2>can go into</v>

1613
01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:54.530
<v Speaker 3>now for athletes when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about people that like maybe they don't </v>

1614
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.070
<v Speaker 3>need it for weight loss or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need it for a lot of it.</v>

1615
01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Is it because the massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>calories,</v>

1616
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:04.270
<v Speaker 3>the calories that they're burning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their nutritional requirements almost </v>

1617
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:05.490
<v Speaker 3>mitigates the negative effect of having </v>
<v Speaker 3>a glucose based diet.</v>

1618
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really does come down to calorie </v>

1619
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.421
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a surplus amount of </v>

1620
01:19:13.421 --> 01:19:13.421
<v Speaker 2>calories coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1621
01:19:13.421 --> 01:19:17.441
<v Speaker 2>even with an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna start to get some over </v>

1622
01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 2>metabolic effects and negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1623
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.060
<v Speaker 2>biomarkers kind of showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that chronically,</v>

1624
01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 2>it'll ultimately lead to chronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>

1625
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1626
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:30.460
<v Speaker 2>brain fog and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1627
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I have observed is that,</v>

1628
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're asking like a why was your</v>

1629
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:41.021
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why aren't people not following </v>

1630
01:19:41.021 --> 01:19:41.021
<v Speaker 2>this or what's the benefit</v>

1631
01:19:41.021 --> 01:19:42.360
<v Speaker 3>question was like because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying this so deeply,</v>

1632
01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.940
<v Speaker 3>like have you ever contemplated like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the root cause?</v>

1633
01:19:44.941 --> 01:19:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Like why are we so good at burning fats?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so beneficial?</v>

1634
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:54.410
<v Speaker 3>There's so many health benefits and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like there's so many negative </v>

1635
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:56.190
<v Speaker 3>consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of having a high carbohydrate diet,</v>

1636
01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:58.170
<v Speaker 3>especially for sedentary individual.</v>

1637
01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you really,</v>

1638
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:04.990
<v Speaker 2>to put this into context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think the negative effects </v>

1639
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:09.240
<v Speaker 2>from high carbohydrate diet are due to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie surplus.</v>

1640
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>So I think a carbohydrate based diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>could work fantastic for a lot of people</v>

1641
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.640
<v Speaker 2>who count their macros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who manage their calories,</v>

1642
01:20:17.641 --> 01:20:22.641
<v Speaker 2>but people are horrible predictors or </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimators of how many grams of </v>

1643
01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:23.950
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1644
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.160
<v Speaker 2>they walked into the kitchen and grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>some grapes,</v>

1645
01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:27.480
<v Speaker 2>they grab a chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

1646
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:31.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's really good if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get a handle on this to optimize</v>

1647
01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:36.391
<v Speaker 2>or total health and performance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to really have an app where they </v>

1648
01:20:36.421 --> 01:20:39.550
<v Speaker 2>can calculate their macros and uneasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 2>to do format like avatar nutrition does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1650
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:47.910
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think when you are bolusing glucose</v>

1651
01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:50.580
<v Speaker 2>or bolusing carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple meals a day,</v>

1652
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you have that scenario that I talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1653
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.510
<v Speaker 2>You have a spike in glucose and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>release of insulin and for many people,</v>

1654
01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:02.540
<v Speaker 2>which I had was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Postprandial dip in blood glucose </v>

1655
01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:06.651
<v Speaker 2>where you'd go hypoglycemic after two or</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours and that would have me </v>

1656
01:21:06.651 --> 01:21:07.800
<v Speaker 2>searching for food again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get irritable,</v>

1657
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I would get sleepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my performance would drop when you go </v>

1658
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:16.461
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even have to be like a ketogenic </v>

1659
01:21:16.461 --> 01:21:19.101
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just low carb can completely in many </v>

1660
01:21:19.101 --> 01:21:22.701
<v Speaker 2>cases if not abolished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly attenuate that rise in </v>

1661
01:21:22.701 --> 01:21:24.220
<v Speaker 2>glucose and that release and insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1662
01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1663
01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:29.871
<v Speaker 2>with a carbohydrate based Diet you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw in more fat and fiber and buffer </v>

1664
01:21:29.871 --> 01:21:33.651
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a purely ketogenic diet is kind of </v>

1665
01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:33.900
<v Speaker 2>non glycaemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1666
01:21:33.901 --> 01:21:38.901
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any rise in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the practical effects of that is </v>

1667
01:21:38.901 --> 01:21:43.071
<v Speaker 2>that it tends to allow the person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control their appetite and so they're </v>

1668
01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:48.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of controlling them and appetite </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppression and just kind of.</v>

1669
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it's thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketogenic Diet works too,</v>

1670
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:56.961
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't have these spikes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose and hormones and things like </v>

1671
01:21:56.961 --> 01:21:57.780
<v Speaker 2>that that could set off a seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1672
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:02.781
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leading scientists in this field a </v>

1673
01:22:02.781 --> 01:22:05.280
<v Speaker 2>really believed that it helps put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain into a state of homeostasis better</v>

1674
01:22:05.281 --> 01:22:10.281
<v Speaker 2>and if there's less kind of energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>spikes and less kind of noise in the </v>

1675
01:22:10.281 --> 01:22:10.660
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1676
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.110
<v Speaker 2>from a physiological standpoint that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brains,</v>

1677
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain's energy system and the,</v>

1678
01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neuropharmacology of the brain </v>

1679
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:21.960
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neurotransmitters,</v>

1680
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.320
<v Speaker 2>the balance of Gaba to glutamate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gaba and Serotonin and other things will</v>

1681
01:22:25.321 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 2>be balanced in a way that would make </v>
<v Speaker 2>seizures much less likely to occur.</v>

1682
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what it does from a,</v>

1683
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.630
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1684
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.160
<v Speaker 2>feeding behavior from a neuroendocrine </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>

1685
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:38.430
<v Speaker 2>is that it helps to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have all these hormones and,</v>

1686
01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:39.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1687
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:40.740
<v Speaker 2>metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1688
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 2>going all over in the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ketogenic diet keeps it into a range</v>

1689
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.640
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot less noise in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and you can see this,</v>

1690
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a patient,</v>

1691
01:22:49.741 --> 01:22:51.870
<v Speaker 2>a type one diabetes patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1692
01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:57.140
<v Speaker 2>who goes from eating a high carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet to a key to genic diet where their </v>

1693
01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Dexcom continuous glucose measurement is</v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>

1694
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.690
<v Speaker 2>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1695
01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:04.440
<v Speaker 2>several days of data and if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>transitioned to a ketogenic diet,</v>

1696
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way few highs and a few lows and</v>

1697
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:13.621
<v Speaker 2>it's within a tight range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there they stay within the range </v>

1698
01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 2>where they're optimized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

1699
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:18.691
<v Speaker 2>So they're in a glucose range where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're optimized and that's what </v>

1700
01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:18.691
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1701
01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens obviously with a type one </v>

1702
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:22.930
<v Speaker 2>diabetic who's trying to chase the </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose with insulin.</v>

1703
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 2>But for the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing happens.</v>

1704
01:23:25.121 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's why a lot of people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1705
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.790
<v Speaker 2>they have less cravings and there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely to adhere and stick to their</v>

1706
01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:35.500
<v Speaker 2>diet and not kind of fall off the wagon </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of overeat and you have surplus</v>

1707
01:23:35.501 --> 01:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1708
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.280
<v Speaker 2>so high carbohydrate diet is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>manageable and people who knew how to </v>

1709
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.631
<v Speaker 2>manage their calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really hard for most people </v>

1710
01:23:45.631 --> 01:23:48.251
<v Speaker 2>will do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the APP based programs that </v>

1711
01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 2>are coming out are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really handy in there.</v>

1712
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there'll be kind of the wave of </v>

1713
01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:54.300
<v Speaker 2>the future for people who want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimize their,</v>

1714
01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.050
<v Speaker 2>their body composition and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>

1715
01:23:56.051 --> 01:23:59.250
<v Speaker 2>and to have a kito option of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can tighten,</v>

1716
01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:04.290
<v Speaker 2>titrate and optimize your Keto Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was an ai system that </v>

1717
01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:08.080
<v Speaker 2>tells you how to improve those ratios </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time to hit your goals.</v>

1718
01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really the future.</v>

1719
01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.210
<v Speaker 3>The cravings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1720
01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.990
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge factor.</v>

1721
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:16.170
<v Speaker 3>The not just the energy crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the lack of hunger.</v>

1722
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really weird.</v>

1723
01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Like I always felt like if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat for a few hours,</v>

1724
01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.690
<v Speaker 3>you just started getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1725
01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:24.900
<v Speaker 3>I got to eat and you have this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling,</v>

1726
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:30.140
<v Speaker 3>but that weird feeling is entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to glucose when you're on a </v>

1727
01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.860
<v Speaker 3>fat based fat burning diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the,</v>

1728
01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:35.460
<v Speaker 3>even knowing that you're hungry is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different knowing.</v>

1729
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's in the other room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's like next to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting on your shoulder yelling in your</v>

1731
01:24:41.881 --> 01:24:43.050
<v Speaker 3>ear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on man,</v>

1732
01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.690
<v Speaker 3>let's eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1733
01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:47.430
<v Speaker 3>there's a frantic feeling that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people get.</v>

1734
01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I've seen my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it when she's hungry.</v>

1735
01:24:51.011 --> 01:24:56.011
<v Speaker 2>We gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta pull over when she needs ice </v>

1736
01:24:56.011 --> 01:24:56.011
<v Speaker 2>cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1737
01:24:56.011 --> 01:24:56.011
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1738
01:24:56.011 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give in and say,</v>

1739
01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:57.980
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna we're gonna.</v>

1740
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1741
01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:04.180
<v Speaker 2>and I remember feeling that way too when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would kind of go off the wagon and </v>

1742
01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:05.350
<v Speaker 2>need a half of a box of toll house </v>
<v Speaker 2>cookies.</v>

1743
01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yesterday I three packets of </v>

1744
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.350
<v Speaker 2>something called Quito cookies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put some in your,</v>

1745
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:13.360
<v Speaker 2>your little gift bag there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1746
01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these Quito cookie.</v>

1747
01:25:15.671 --> 01:25:20.671
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never eaten three packets </v>

1748
01:25:20.671 --> 01:25:20.671
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was curious.</v>

1749
01:25:20.671 --> 01:25:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

1750
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's energy bits.</v>

1751
01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So energy bits is I think a fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Selena.</v>

1752
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:31.530
<v Speaker 2>So spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spirulina has an enormous amount of </v>

1753
01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:35.491
<v Speaker 2>research behind it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the products I used on the </v>

1754
01:25:35.491 --> 01:25:38.611
<v Speaker 2>NASA neemo mission because we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have access to fresh vegetables </v>

1755
01:25:38.611 --> 01:25:39.130
<v Speaker 2>or fighter nutrients down there.</v>

1756
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 2>So snickerdoodle Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the snickerdoodle bar.</v>

1757
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:47.070
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a chocolate chip bar </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a fudge fudge chip bar where could </v>

1758
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.800
<v Speaker 2>just go to Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cookie.com.</v>

1759
01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>And so they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like my Quito comfort food.</v>

1760
01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:59.700
<v Speaker 2>So when I travel with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have another box out there for </v>

1761
01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.761
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have chocolate chip snicker </v>

1762
01:26:02.761 --> 01:26:02.761
<v Speaker 2>doodle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1763
01:26:02.761 --> 01:26:02.761
<v Speaker 2>fledged chip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1764
01:26:02.761 --> 01:26:06.840
<v Speaker 2>so you can eat that typically when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I like a toll house chocolate chip </v>

1765
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:11.171
<v Speaker 2>cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have that crash that we were </v>

1766
01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:11.171
<v Speaker 2>talking about and now it'd be ravenous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:12.500
<v Speaker 2>after a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1768
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no sugar.</v>

1769
01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:17.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's completely like low-glycemic for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1770
01:26:17.601 --> 01:26:19.670
<v Speaker 2>They're like non glycaemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1771
01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:20.930
<v Speaker 2>so I measured my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1772
01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:25.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose after eating three packets of </v>

1773
01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 2>them because I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1774
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:32.141
<v Speaker 2>there was the guys behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually just saw them at the low </v>

1775
01:26:32.141 --> 01:26:34.811
<v Speaker 2>carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a USA conference where a number of </v>

1776
01:26:34.811 --> 01:26:34.811
<v Speaker 2>speakers there were on the show.</v>

1777
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Gary Taubes with their robb wolf was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1778
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get to speak to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1779
01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>because it was just so busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Quito cookie is one of those food </v>

1780
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 2>that's evolving out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1781
01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:51.281
<v Speaker 2>this kind of movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that the key to genic diet </v>

1782
01:26:51.281 --> 01:26:54.640
<v Speaker 2>diet is becoming a lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not something that's used for </v>

1783
01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.821
<v Speaker 2>pediatric epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something like the average person </v>

1784
01:26:57.821 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 2>can follow to just feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

1785
01:26:58.550 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I could eat a Keto meal in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can hammer out 12 hours of work in</v>

1786
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 2>the lab and not even get any cravings to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat at all.</v>

1787
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1788
01:27:07.041 --> 01:27:10.490
<v Speaker 2>that translated into more grants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more publications,</v>

1789
01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:15.491
<v Speaker 2>more work done in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of attributed in some way </v>

1790
01:27:15.491 --> 01:27:15.491
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1791
01:27:15.491 --> 01:27:20.380
<v Speaker 2>my career has gotten a really big boost </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm more cognitively aware and </v>

1792
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 2>resilient even during periods of sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>deprivation.</v>

1793
01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:29.501
<v Speaker 2>I can just work longer periods and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of utilized Quito to my advantage </v>

1794
01:27:29.501 --> 01:27:29.501
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>

1795
01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really had no idea about exogenous </v>

1796
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:35.070
<v Speaker 4>ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improving mental function,</v>

1797
01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:40.370
<v Speaker 4>like taking them to actually really like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be a good idea to take them </v>

1798
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:43.281
<v Speaker 4>before anything taxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try and take a number for </v>

1799
01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:45.561
<v Speaker 4>podcasts and taking them before comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows or UFC events and see if maybe my </v>

1800
01:27:45.571 --> 01:27:49.170
<v Speaker 4>brain fires better because I mean that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just amazing.</v>

1801
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1802
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.910
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife was actually a,</v>

1803
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:54.350
<v Speaker 2>she spearheaded a program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1804
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.490
<v Speaker 2>looking at absence seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people have seizures,</v>

1805
01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:02.510
<v Speaker 2>don't have like tonic clonic seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll just look and stare into </v>

1806
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:05.650
<v Speaker 2>space and then wake up out of it with me</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the seizures champion.</v>

1807
01:28:05.651 --> 01:28:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know he's a good man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like an illusion and you just</v>

1808
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:11.420
<v Speaker 2>got to try them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try them.</v>

1809
01:28:11.421 --> 01:28:16.421
<v Speaker 2>Raj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have a glucose ketone </v>

1810
01:28:16.421 --> 01:28:16.610
<v Speaker 2>measurement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did have that,</v>

1811
01:28:16.611 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 2>but I have a lot of calluses and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1812
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I had a really stabbed the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my fingers.</v>

1813
01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

1814
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had calluses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1815
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I got pretty bad council.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1816
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1817
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was I gonna say?</v>

1818
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anxiety other than glucose meter,</v>

1819
01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:34.190
<v Speaker 2>the one that stabs you because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really working that well,</v>

1820
01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:34.940
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

1821
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean they go in the side of your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1822
01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.860
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man.</v>

1823
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'd go to the fingertips.</v>

1824
01:28:39.671 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I just take an actual syringe like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>needle and just plug it in or I have.</v>

1825
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

1826
01:28:45.471 --> 01:28:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't really feel that I've done it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

1827
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1828
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:52.850
<v Speaker 2>taking exogenous ketones can help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We publish a paper and frontiers.</v>

1829
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It reduced anxiety behavior about 25 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent in our rats.</v>

1830
01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:03.190
<v Speaker 2>So they would go out into what's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>an elevated plus maze into the open arm </v>

1831
01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 2>where they're like on a catwalk and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could fall off or be exposed environment</v>

1832
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:11.990
<v Speaker 2>typically produce a fear response or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could run back into the little </v>

1833
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:15.410
<v Speaker 2>cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Beta hydroxybutyrate salt plus </v>

1834
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the medium chain triglyceride </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination,</v>

1835
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:19.770
<v Speaker 2>actually reduce that fear behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1836
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.700
<v Speaker 2>maybe it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1837
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:24.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're completely comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>being out on front of the stage,</v>

1838
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:29.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for people that have anxiety </v>

1839
01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:32.061
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a big part of people who have </v>

1840
01:29:32.061 --> 01:29:32.061
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of exacerbates anxiety.</v>

1841
01:29:32.061 --> 01:29:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1842
01:29:32.431 --> 01:29:37.431
<v Speaker 2>I felt it early on in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that being in a state of Ketosis </v>

1843
01:29:37.431 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 2>just makes me more mellow.</v>

1844
01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1845
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.700
<v Speaker 3>one thing that would help me with is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1846
01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I bow hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.890
<v Speaker 3>And bowhunting is behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother was a,</v>

1849
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.960
<v Speaker 2>he was a big bow hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes for Peterson.</v>

1850
01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>But when a magazine and I saw a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a.</v>

1851
01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:55.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had that pro force extreme,</v>

1852
01:29:55.051 --> 01:29:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I think bose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a boat.</v>

1854
01:29:56.881 --> 01:30:01.881
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a hunting family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I quickly noticed some of the stuff </v>

1855
01:30:01.881 --> 01:30:01.881
<v Speaker 2>out in here.</v>

1856
01:30:01.881 --> 01:30:01.930
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1857
01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.000
<v Speaker 3>that's probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressful things I do.</v>

1858
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Like people think that like doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>

1859
01:30:05.621 --> 01:30:08.920
<v Speaker 3>a stressful or live podcast or </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast,</v>

1860
01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:12.740
<v Speaker 3>those are nothing compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting.</v>

1861
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Drawing back on a live animal and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart starts racing,</v>

1862
01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:21.600
<v Speaker 3>start adrenaline rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have target panic where you can't </v>

1863
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:26.131
<v Speaker 3>remember what you're doing and you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into autopilot and there's all sorts of </v>

1864
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:30.360
<v Speaker 3>methods to mitigate that by forcing your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain into a closed loop system instead </v>

1865
01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:33.430
<v Speaker 3>of an open loop system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeating mantras,</v>

1866
01:30:33.431 --> 01:30:36.820
<v Speaker 3>going over different facets of your shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1867
01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.510
<v Speaker 3>But maybe I'm ketones and being in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>acute agentic state,</v>

1868
01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:43.090
<v Speaker 3>especially exoticness ketones before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt,</v>

1869
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.310
<v Speaker 3>would mitigate some of those issues.</v>

1870
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Definitely help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1871
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I think you've had them on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wim Hoff method.</v>

1872
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure something I'm getting into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking with a quest ceo last night,</v>

1873
01:30:56.010 --> 01:30:57.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Butenko,</v>

1874
01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:00.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy in Russia designed some,</v>

1875
01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.600
<v Speaker 2>some system that allows you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1876
01:31:03.601 --> 01:31:06.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a program of breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the APP on my phone.</v>

1877
01:31:06.421 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't used it yet,</v>

1878
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:11.310
<v Speaker 2>but it allows you to increase your CEO </v>
<v Speaker 2>to threshold.</v>

1879
01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:14.610
<v Speaker 2>So the drive to breathe actually does </v>
<v Speaker 2>not come from a lack of oxygen.</v>

1880
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:15.130
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1881
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:18.670
<v Speaker 2>through CEO to chemo receptors on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ventral surface of your Medulla,</v>

1882
01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:19.800
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your brainstem,</v>

1883
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.650
<v Speaker 2>that senscio too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they sent ceo to that,</v>

1884
01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 2>that's your urge to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your drive.</v>

1885
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a backup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sort of like a redundant mechanism,</v>

1886
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.800
<v Speaker 2>the carotid body that the bifurcation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common carotid artery right here </v>

1887
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.370
<v Speaker 2>will since oxygen and it's kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of a fail safe that's,</v>

1888
01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.040
<v Speaker 2>I studied these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1889
01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>for my phd and these neurons like Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense how they sense things,</v>

1890
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.560
<v Speaker 2>but so you can increase your CEO to </v>
<v Speaker 2>threshold over time using various </v>

1891
01:31:45.931 --> 01:31:50.931
<v Speaker 2>breathing protocols and that can create </v>
<v Speaker 2>an enormous effect on kind of reducing </v>

1892
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:56.580
<v Speaker 2>anxiety in these situations where a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>buck comes up and you're drawing back on</v>

1893
01:31:56.581 --> 01:31:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in general,</v>

1894
01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 2>just the level oxygenation that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1895
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 2>So retaining some co two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do it through training,</v>

1896
01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:09.660
<v Speaker 2>can actually enhance the vasodilation </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect and can maybe reverse even in </v>

1897
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:13.960
<v Speaker 2>hyperoxygenate systems in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the theory.</v>

1898
01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a few studies behind it.</v>

1899
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I really have to delve into the studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1900
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:23.380
<v Speaker 2>the Wim Hoff method is one method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been fascinated with him.</v>

1901
01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I really want to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

1902
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I love that I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to bring him to the lab and </v>

1903
01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.710
<v Speaker 2>actually do some research on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1904
01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Connect your guide will be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 2>These cookies or like a mirage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you hold them,</v>

1906
01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 2>they have weight cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bite into them,</v>

1907
01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be like eating a cookie</v>

1908
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and then you chewing it and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it vanishes like fairy dust in </v>

1909
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:49.690
<v Speaker 2>front of your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's good though.</v>

1910
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.640
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

1911
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's a mirage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their bullshit.</v>

1912
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange texture to them.</v>

1913
01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously there's no grain it </v>

1914
01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 2>and there's something about eating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maturing them where your body goes,</v>

1915
01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:03.510
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1916
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:06.040
<v Speaker 2>what'd you fucking lie to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hooky Bro.</v>

1917
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Like it tastes good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about chewing it </v>

1918
01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:11.700
<v Speaker 2>and eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1919
01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it vanish.</v>

1920
01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:15.370
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty substantial to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant amount of fat in it.</v>

1921
01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was a little.</v>

1922
01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little skeptical when they came,</v>

1923
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1924
01:33:20.081 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 2>because people send me so many products </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I vet out what actually impacts,</v>

1925
01:33:24.191 --> 01:33:29.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my blood glucose and ketone levels and </v>

1926
01:33:29.191 --> 01:33:30.730
<v Speaker 2>then maybe about 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>products that people send me.</v>

1927
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I really liked like the energy bits </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1928
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the spirulina tablets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take massive amounts and actually </v>

1929
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:41.641
<v Speaker 2>get a significant amount of protein and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely no glycemic effect </v>

1930
01:33:41.641 --> 01:33:43.570
<v Speaker 2>and I'm getting huge amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phytonutrients in it.</v>

1931
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:48.930
<v Speaker 2>So I brought that on these little snack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I down like 30 at a time.</v>

1932
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's 33 servings a thousand tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1933
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be like a month supply and</v>

1934
01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can chew them,</v>

1935
01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 2>they taste kind of grassy and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little blip in there.</v>

1936
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1937
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Or if you don't shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just swallow them,</v>

1938
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.550
<v Speaker 2>you don't taste them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't.</v>

1939
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.750
<v Speaker 2>There's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I did taste like.</v>

1940
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost like sesame seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it,</v>

1942
01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I like it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunflower seeds don't sort of tastes </v>

1943
01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.051
<v Speaker 2>like the lady Catherine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was on a shark tank and actually </v>

1944
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:27.241
<v Speaker 2>they kind of slammed her because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>she evaluated the company high or they </v>

1945
01:34:27.241 --> 01:34:27.690
<v Speaker 2>didn't like the taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the main reason that,</v>

1946
01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:32.780
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean guys like you and me and most </v>

1947
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:35.290
<v Speaker 2>guys would be totally fine with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>taste and the amount of nutrition that's</v>

1948
01:34:35.291 --> 01:34:40.291
<v Speaker 2>in that and the density of that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>an awesome food for things like special </v>

1949
01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:45.241
<v Speaker 2>ops guys or even even NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of nutrition in </v>

1950
01:34:45.241 --> 01:34:47.320
<v Speaker 2>that little bag right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stunning to me.</v>

1951
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:51.670
<v Speaker 2>How much like mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure factors into people's lives?</v>

1952
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't like the taste.</v>

1953
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something can be fantastic for you.</v>

1954
01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I expect that out of my seven year </v>

1955
01:34:59.920 --> 01:34:59.920
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
01:34:59.920 --> 01:34:59.920
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1957
01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 2>taste gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

1958
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1959
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get out of a 37 year old Jesus </v>

1960
01:35:07.810 --> 01:35:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent of people really eat.</v>

1961
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:13.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a pleasurable thing to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to restrict that in any </v>

1962
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.390
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

1963
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:18.330
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy to me because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to restrict it just for the most </v>

1964
01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:21.200
<v Speaker 2>part taken healthy nutrients and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

1965
01:35:21.201 --> 01:35:23.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not bad like Jesus Christ,</v>

1966
01:35:23.181 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 2>if this is the most suffering you get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day,</v>

1967
01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.260
<v Speaker 2>talk about first world problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>these little energy bits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There weren't the best thing I've ever </v>

1969
01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to do now.</v>

1970
01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.530
<v Speaker 2>That's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see it from the general </v>

1971
01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:40.640
<v Speaker 2>consumer point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could see maybe,</v>

1972
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 2>but once they know the science behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1973
01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:47.921
<v Speaker 2>like the CEO sent me a stack of research</v>
<v Speaker 2>papers and are all off of pub med and I </v>

1974
01:35:48.891 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 2>started looking through them and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>double checking on pub med and realizing</v>

1975
01:35:52.641 --> 01:35:57.641
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of science behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually NASA was interested in </v>

1976
01:35:57.641 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 2>algae and making capsules because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

1977
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:01.350
<v Speaker 2>it's super high in protein has all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>phytonutrients and uh,</v>

1978
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you can grow it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could figure out a way to grow it in</v>

1979
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:05.720
<v Speaker 2>space and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1980
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:10.721
<v Speaker 2>so I think really that's a future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like things like Quito cookie will be a </v>

1981
01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:11.390
<v Speaker 2>gateway for people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1982
01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:16.391
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can go on this diet and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these chocolate chip cookies here </v>

1983
01:36:16.391 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then eventually your palette changes</v>

1984
01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.400
<v Speaker 2>over time and you don't crave those </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods anymore.</v>

1985
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Like it never happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's gotten close.</v>

1986
01:36:22.851 --> 01:36:27.851
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smell some fresh bread or a bowl of </v>

1987
01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:28.520
<v Speaker 2>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like linguine with clams.</v>

1988
01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm in man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can maybe control yourself a </v>

1989
01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:33.800
<v Speaker 2>little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1990
01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 2>you still crave it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually crave that at all.</v>

1991
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to crave sweets and chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

1992
01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1993
01:36:41.410 --> 01:36:44.170
<v Speaker 2>not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a big ice cream guy though.</v>

1994
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1995
01:36:46.481 --> 01:36:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was eating some on his instagram.</v>

1996
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:50.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1997
01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 2>the institute that I'm associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Institute for Human and machine </v>

1998
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.170
<v Speaker 2>cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ihmc it's run by the directors.</v>

1999
01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Ken Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a former director,</v>

2000
01:36:58.411 --> 01:37:00.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in NASA executive and NASA and they have</v>

2001
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:05.981
<v Speaker 2>a James Beard award winning chef that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they hired into Ihmc and he has a </v>

2002
01:37:05.981 --> 01:37:10.931
<v Speaker 2>specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Keto ice cream recipe which is using </v>

2003
01:37:10.931 --> 01:37:14.870
<v Speaker 2>the mct and like a pinch of Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you eat the ice cream,</v>

2004
01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just blows your mind that this is ice</v>

2005
01:37:17.901 --> 01:37:21.590
<v Speaker 2>cream that you could eat every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big bowl and stay on a ketogenic diet.</v>

2006
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:25.170
<v Speaker 2>So these kinds of editing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel innovative.</v>

2007
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.700
<v Speaker 2>You're reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2008
01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really legit.</v>

2009
01:37:28.131 --> 01:37:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Like my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

2010
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 2>she's really like the litmus test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I get products I give,</v>

2011
01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:39.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last product I got was the Quito </v>

2012
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Brownie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you like Google,</v>

2013
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brownie,</v>

2014
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.210
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll come up and,</v>

2015
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:43.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave it to my wife and she was like,</v>

2016
01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:44.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is pretty good.</v>

2017
01:37:44.361 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>But it had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shell in it,</v>

2018
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:49.430
<v Speaker 2>which kind of got caught on her teeth or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2019
01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And she loved the taste but it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

2020
01:37:52.761 --> 01:37:55.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because she's so picky,</v>

2021
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2022
01:37:55.831 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I liked it but just had a shell on it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2023
01:37:57.841 --> 01:38:02.841
<v Speaker 2>But Quito Brownie is like another food </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I see all these entrepreneurial guys</v>

2024
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of emerging on the scene and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>very innovative in the way.</v>

2025
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time to develop and test</v>

2026
01:38:09.511 --> 01:38:13.110
<v Speaker 2>a product that you can eat that's low </v>
<v Speaker 2>carb for one thing,</v>

2027
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.780
<v Speaker 2>and then you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows you to adhere,</v>

2028
01:38:15.781 --> 01:38:18.120
<v Speaker 2>to accuse yanked diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had a cave shake?</v>

2029
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:19.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>

2030
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that company got a bunch of the </v>

2031
01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:24.560
<v Speaker 2>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2032
01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can try one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2033
01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2034
01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you one right now if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2035
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll wait till after the show.</v>

2036
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm forgotten those,</v>

2037
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.170
<v Speaker 2>those are giant they're made with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of good stuff in there.</v>

2038
01:38:34.171 --> 01:38:36.400
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot of his coconut coconut</v>
<v Speaker 2>milk.</v>

2039
01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2040
01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.840
<v Speaker 2>this Keto ice cream company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it called again?</v>

2041
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually there's not a company that I </v>

2042
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.930
<v Speaker 2>know of yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2043
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2044
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I told them they needed to create some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ip around this,</v>

2045
01:38:47.351 --> 01:38:48.030
<v Speaker 2>this formula.</v>

2046
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:49.000
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was uh,</v>

2047
01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:54.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Institute for Human and machine </v>

2048
01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:54.410
<v Speaker 2>cognition that the chef there picked it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up himself.</v>

2049
01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a number of recipes because,</v>

2050
01:38:57.370 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CEO there can forward.</v>

2051
01:39:00.031 --> 01:39:05.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a huge fan of the shank diet and </v>

2052
01:39:05.031 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 2>it's how I got hooked up with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he realizes that it enhances his</v>

2053
01:39:06.930 --> 01:39:11.930
<v Speaker 2>cognition and performance and has </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually been a big help in moving </v>

2054
01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:16.551
<v Speaker 2>things into government agencies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping them acknowledge that this is a </v>

2055
01:39:16.711 --> 01:39:21.711
<v Speaker 2>very viable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a form of a way to fuel the astronaut or</v>

2056
01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:27.921
<v Speaker 2>fueled a special ops guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's been kind of instrumental in </v>

2057
01:39:27.921 --> 01:39:27.921
<v Speaker 2>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he is,</v>

2058
01:39:27.921 --> 01:39:28.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hired a,</v>

2059
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:31.800
<v Speaker 2>a chef that cooks ketogenic and in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a gourmet fashion,</v>

2060
01:39:31.801 --> 01:39:36.801
<v Speaker 2>a James Beard award winning chef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't even know what that was </v>

2061
01:39:36.801 --> 01:39:36.801
<v Speaker 2>until I looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2062
01:39:36.801 --> 01:39:38.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are very high level chefs that are</v>

2063
01:39:38.401 --> 01:39:43.401
<v Speaker 2>specifically in his expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least at the institute is to create </v>

2064
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 2>these key to genic recipes that are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra gourmet and amazing to eat.</v>

2065
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:54.430
<v Speaker 2>What about pasta?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there like an almond flour based </v>

2066
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.430
<v Speaker 2>pasta?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not that I've,</v>

2067
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:55.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried a lot of things,</v>

2068
01:39:55.711 --> 01:39:56.460
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2069
01:39:56.490 --> 01:40:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I would hesitate to recommend anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I have not been impressed </v>

2070
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.490
<v Speaker 2>enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2071
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 2>to really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some protein pasta out there </v>

2072
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:06.690
<v Speaker 2>that's a little bit low car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times they kind of fill you</v>

2073
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 2>up with a lot of soluble fiber and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just become like a gas machine,</v>

2074
01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be good for your gut microbiome</v>

2075
01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:12.960
<v Speaker 2>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2076
01:40:12.961 --> 01:40:14.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeding all the bugs in there,</v>

2077
01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2078
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:18.300
<v Speaker 2>for a large part like if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2079
01:40:18.301 --> 01:40:23.301
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a certain threshold for soluble </v>

2080
01:40:23.301 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 2>fiber which gets broken down into </v>
<v Speaker 2>butyrate and other things in the gut.</v>

2081
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you exceed that,</v>

2082
01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:27.170
<v Speaker 2>you just become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 2>gas machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe it would be good in like a </v>

2084
01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 2>small side dish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2085
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:36.990
<v Speaker 2>So that's your weakness then pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an ice cream too or.</v>

2086
01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:42.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can go without ice cream and </v>

2087
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.050
<v Speaker 2>sweets really don't get me that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2088
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:45.771
<v Speaker 2>it's not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that I massively </v>

2089
01:40:45.771 --> 01:40:45.990
<v Speaker 2>crave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a big fan of Spaghetti.</v>

2090
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem.</v>

2091
01:40:47.890 --> 01:40:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2092
01:40:48.661 --> 01:40:50.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2093
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's just one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things</v>

2094
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.670
<v Speaker 4>where I bet if I just stopped taking it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time,</v>

2095
01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:02.910
<v Speaker 4>stop eating it for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's been my cheap food for </v>

2096
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:05.341
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I just cut it out of my system </v>

2097
01:41:05.341 --> 01:41:05.950
<v Speaker 4>completely for like six months or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

2098
01:41:05.951 --> 01:41:06.400
<v Speaker 4>I probably,</v>

2099
01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2100
01:41:07.491 --> 01:41:11.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a book that has ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a recipe.</v>

2101
01:41:11.511 --> 01:41:16.511
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bullock has a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the art and science of low </v>

2102
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:19.001
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate performance and this will </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal to your crowd because a lot of </v>

2103
01:41:19.001 --> 01:41:23.021
<v Speaker 2>mma guys I refer to the book and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say this book was incredibly helpful to </v>

2104
01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:27.251
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the art and science of low </v>

2105
01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:27.620
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate performance and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrest.</v>

2106
01:41:27.621 --> 01:41:32.621
<v Speaker 2>There may be a pasta recipe in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's an ice cream recipe in </v>

2107
01:41:32.621 --> 01:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>there that's not unlike the recipe I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking about.</v>

2108
01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the pasta thing.</v>

2109
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>

2110
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:41.780
<v Speaker 2>If someone can nail that down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be pretty good.</v>

2111
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:45.590
<v Speaker 2>At logical achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be filled with some weird stuff</v>

2112
01:41:45.591 --> 01:41:47.150
<v Speaker 2>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were just in Italy.</v>

2113
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I saw some pictures where whereabouts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and did you have pasta and pizza when </v>

2114
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 2>you went off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a rocket way off.</v>

2115
01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.130
<v Speaker 2>And I do that when I was in Naples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I and I got to have pizza.</v>

2116
01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>That was quite awhile ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2117
01:42:00.021 --> 01:42:03.440
<v Speaker 2>it's moderation too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they also have different flower and</v>

2118
01:42:03.441 --> 01:42:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>

2119
01:42:04.930 --> 01:42:05.230
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2120
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:10.020
<v Speaker 4>Maynard maynard Keenan from the band </v>
<v Speaker 4>tool also has a,</v>

2121
01:42:10.021 --> 01:42:12.890
<v Speaker 4>an Osteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant and a um,</v>

2122
01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.060
<v Speaker 4>a vineyard that he runs in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a weird guy,</v>

2123
01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:18.550
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he explained on the podcast,</v>

2124
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 4>on the podcast rather than I did with </v>
<v Speaker 4>him recently.</v>

2125
01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:26.700
<v Speaker 4>The difference between the Pasta that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have today in the bread we have today </v>

2126
01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.080
<v Speaker 4>and original heirloom wheat which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>less,</v>

2127
01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:34.190
<v Speaker 4>it's lower yield per acre and it has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>less complex gluten's in it.</v>

2128
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.400
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is what,</v>

2129
01:42:36.401 --> 01:42:41.401
<v Speaker 4>when people are talking about like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between how your body </v>

2130
01:42:41.401 --> 01:42:42.760
<v Speaker 4>tolerates like certain gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's gluten sensitivity or not.</v>

2131
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:46.120
<v Speaker 4>He's like just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a different feel.</v>

2132
01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 4>And I really noticed that when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Italy when I would eat their pasta.</v>

2133
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:51.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

2134
01:42:51.551 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 4>it tastes different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels different when it's going down.</v>

2135
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:56.570
<v Speaker 4>And I actually ordered a bunch of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

2136
01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.820
<v Speaker 4>from Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I even cooked it at home and I </v>

2137
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:01.820
<v Speaker 4>noticed it</v>

2138
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she.</v>

2139
01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Did you get any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any gi?</v>

2140
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.330
<v Speaker 2>So if I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't,</v>

2141
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.480
<v Speaker 2>if I go to the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll get popcorn and I'm </v>

2142
01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:11.480
<v Speaker 2>completely okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like eating popcorn and then,</v>

2143
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day or two later and back into ketosis</v>

2144
01:43:13.381 --> 01:43:15.840
<v Speaker 2>really fast without even exoticness </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones.</v>

2145
01:43:15.841 --> 01:43:20.841
<v Speaker 2>But if I do eat pizza or pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I did in the beginning when I </v>

2146
01:43:21.271 --> 01:43:23.340
<v Speaker 2>would have like these cheat meals </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally,</v>

2147
01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:28.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have some major gi issues </v>

2148
01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:28.580
<v Speaker 2>because your body is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2149
01:43:29.130 --> 01:43:30.750
<v Speaker 2>digestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilation,</v>

2150
01:43:30.751 --> 01:43:35.751
<v Speaker 2>transport of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're typically eating on a day to day </v>

2151
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:37.800
<v Speaker 2>and then you go without eating them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like your body doesn't know what to</v>

2152
01:43:37.801 --> 01:43:41.190
<v Speaker 2>do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I did go to Italy and we travel</v>

2153
01:43:41.191 --> 01:43:42.450
<v Speaker 2>around all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

2154
01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:43.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loves to travel,</v>

2155
01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:48.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were in Naples and I ate maybe </v>

2156
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:51.441
<v Speaker 2>two or three pieces of pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had absolutely no problems whereas </v>

2157
01:43:51.441 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 2>that in the US that would have bothered </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and maybe it was just a,</v>

2158
01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 2>it may have been the flower on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee.</v>

2159
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 4>The flower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2160
01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 4>it's just a different kind of flour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what they call it,</v>

2161
01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.640
<v Speaker 4>it's called double o flour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find that jamie flower </v>

2162
01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.840
<v Speaker 4>that they use and they'll specify for </v>
<v Speaker 4>imported wheat flour from Italy that </v>

2163
01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a special type of flower and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>flower is essentially heirloom flour.</v>

2164
01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:17.230
<v Speaker 4>So the difference between like when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>buy a tomato from the grocery store and </v>

2165
01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:21.251
<v Speaker 4>it's Pale and bulletproof and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>throw it down a flight of stairs and it </v>

2166
01:44:21.251 --> 01:44:22.940
<v Speaker 4>doesn't even get bruised versus heirloom</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomatoes,</v>

2167
01:44:23.150 --> 01:44:26.520
<v Speaker 4>which are almost like a fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean really is essentially a fruit and</v>

2168
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:29.670
<v Speaker 4>they're juicy and very delicate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2169
01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:32.090
<v Speaker 4>very fragile as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

2170
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.990
<v Speaker 4>Is double o flour worth the price?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2171
01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:39.940
<v Speaker 4>pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One that had the right.</v>

2172
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2173
01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:42.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2174
01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:44.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's my,</v>

2175
01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:46.850
<v Speaker 4>that's my big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I,</v>

2176
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:48.590
<v Speaker 4>if someone does do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they save,</v>

2177
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:52.980
<v Speaker 4>they follow a key to genic diet and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat a bowl of pasta,</v>

2178
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:57.530
<v Speaker 4>I can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they take exogenous ketones and</v>

2179
01:44:57.531 --> 01:45:00.290
<v Speaker 4>it knocks them back into ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

2180
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:04.220
<v Speaker 4>will it stay that way even though they </v>
<v Speaker 4>bought the body to digest that pasta and</v>

2181
01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:06.200
<v Speaker 4>they'll be in ketosis again tomorrow?</v>

2182
01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't.</v>

2183
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:12.941
<v Speaker 2>It'll stay that way based upon the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pharmaco kinetic properties of the </v>

2184
01:45:14.061 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 2>supplement you're consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a ketone salt product,</v>

2185
01:45:17.931 --> 01:45:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you know the ones that are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

2186
01:45:19.431 --> 01:45:22.130
<v Speaker 2>If it's mixed with a fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like medium chain triglyceride,</v>

2187
01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.860
<v Speaker 2>a the Quito oms system and the eugenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

2188
01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:27.980
<v Speaker 2>our BHB and MCD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be sustained for longer.</v>

2189
01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:33.220
<v Speaker 2>But if you do choose to try to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits of ketones and you're on a </v>

2190
01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:37.121
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate based diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to consume obviously more </v>

2191
01:45:37.121 --> 01:45:39.170
<v Speaker 2>exotic ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketones to get the benefits of ketones.</v>

2192
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:42.080
<v Speaker 2>And you could do that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so someone could theoretically do that</v>

2193
01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:45.850
<v Speaker 4>and just take exogenous ketones and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain pretty much the</v>

2194
01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.630
<v Speaker 2>exact benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

2195
01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:52.960
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people are kind of </v>

2196
01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:52.960
<v Speaker 2>confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like,</v>

2197
01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the body going to do with the </v>

2198
01:45:55.961 --> 01:45:55.961
<v Speaker 2>glucose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what's the same thing?</v>

2199
01:45:55.961 --> 01:45:56.090
<v Speaker 2>You could say the same thing if you eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

2200
01:45:56.091 --> 01:46:01.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the body going to do with the </v>

2201
01:46:01.091 --> 01:46:01.091
<v Speaker 2>glucose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2202
01:46:01.091 --> 01:46:01.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well interestingly,</v>

2203
01:46:01.091 --> 01:46:04.751
<v Speaker 2>glucose goes down and we don't actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>know why we think the liver kind of </v>

2204
01:46:04.751 --> 01:46:09.160
<v Speaker 2>sends out less and these products are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not really like a huge amount of </v>

2205
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:09.160
<v Speaker 2>ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2206
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.111
<v Speaker 2>It's just enough to get you maybe into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one millimolar range and we know </v>

2207
01:46:14.111 --> 01:46:15.980
<v Speaker 2>that's enough to give your brain like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boost and give.</v>

2208
01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It's one millimolar of ketones in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

2209
01:46:19.011 --> 01:46:24.011
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>record represents a pretty significant </v>

2210
01:46:24.011 --> 01:46:24.890
<v Speaker 2>source of energy that your brain can use</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that your heart can use.</v>

2211
01:46:24.891 --> 01:46:27.230
<v Speaker 2>We know the heart runs more efficiently </v>
<v Speaker 2>off ketones.</v>

2212
01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably more importantly is that </v>

2213
01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:35.600
<v Speaker 2>the key tones function as signaling </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules that inhibit anti inflammatory</v>

2214
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:37.070
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2215
01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.260
<v Speaker 2>so deep dixit at Yale University did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>study actually with one of the captains.</v>

2216
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:44.570
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is Deep Dixit Jesus Christ.</v>

2217
01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got a scientist at a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

2219
01:46:52.471 --> 01:46:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2220
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:55.980
<v Speaker 2>hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always look at his Indian name,</v>

2221
01:46:55.981 --> 01:46:59.220
<v Speaker 2>but he always tells me to call him d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a deep Dick's,</v>

2222
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2223
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.020
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2224
01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:04.080
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good scientists and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader in,</v>

2225
01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:09.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in studying the effects of calorie </v>

2226
01:47:09.110 --> 01:47:12.261
<v Speaker 2>restriction and a and ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he observed that ketones elevating </v>

2227
01:47:12.261 --> 01:47:16.641
<v Speaker 2>ketones has a signaling effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely independent of the metabolic </v>

2228
01:47:16.891 --> 01:47:21.891
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which everybody thinks of ketones are a </v>

2229
01:47:21.891 --> 01:47:21.891
<v Speaker 2>source of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are also like a hormone.</v>

2230
01:47:21.891 --> 01:47:24.600
<v Speaker 2>They're like a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they hit specific pathways.</v>

2231
01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.960
<v Speaker 2>The pathway that he found a at the study</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Yale was the NLRP three inflammasome.</v>

2232
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:33.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2233
01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:38.150
<v Speaker 2>when that Amazon is activated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it releases a lot of inflammatory </v>

2234
01:47:38.150 --> 01:47:40.150
<v Speaker 2>cytokines in the body which are in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflamma.</v>

2235
01:47:40.151 --> 01:47:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Zoom is linked to a lot of age related </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic diseases too.</v>

2236
01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So as we age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have more systemic chronic </v>

2237
01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:51.351
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always say the people that have </v>

2238
01:47:51.351 --> 01:47:52.440
<v Speaker 2>that can benefit most from the ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

2239
01:47:52.441 --> 01:47:57.441
<v Speaker 2>You tend to be get more insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant and more trunk obesity as we </v>

2240
01:47:57.541 --> 01:48:02.541
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they are people that will be a more </v>

2241
01:48:02.541 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 2>receptive to the benefits of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketogenic Diet as we age,</v>

2242
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:05.550
<v Speaker 2>we become more carbohydrate intolerant </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we age,</v>

2243
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:10.910
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the Beta hydroxy butyrate is </v>

2244
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:13.020
<v Speaker 2>functioning as an anti inflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like independent of the energy pathways.</v>

2245
01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:18.021
<v Speaker 2>So he established that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a diet that I helped him</v>

2246
01:48:18.211 --> 01:48:19.860
<v Speaker 2>formulate with exogenous ketones.</v>

2247
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:25.040
<v Speaker 2>And after that got published a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a number of emails from </v>

2248
01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:29.301
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to sort of reverse engineer </v>

2249
01:48:29.301 --> 01:48:31.680
<v Speaker 2>something that had the same effect as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>key tone,</v>

2250
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:34.790
<v Speaker 2>but to put it into a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a,</v>

2251
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.930
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a pretty intense,</v>

2252
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in the signaling properties of </v>

2253
01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:44.601
<v Speaker 2>ketones and pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially histone deacetylase </v>

2254
01:48:44.601 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 2>inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Beta hydroxybutyrate ketone,</v>

2255
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you measure it from your blood functions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to as what we call this h Jak inhibitor,</v>

2256
01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:54.840
<v Speaker 2>which affects the genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're actually turning on genes that</v>

2257
01:48:54.841 --> 01:48:55.690
<v Speaker 2>are neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro,</v>

2258
01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 2>protective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are cellular protective,</v>

2259
01:48:58.110 --> 01:49:02.760
<v Speaker 2>that are linked to longevity pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about the rewards of developing</v>

2260
01:49:02.761 --> 01:49:05.840
<v Speaker 2>a drug that did the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the financial reward,</v>

2261
01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:10.850
<v Speaker 2>you can't patent Beta hydroxybutyrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and well in different forms maybe shows </v>

2262
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:15.531
<v Speaker 2>you whenever something's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone comes along and tries to fuck </v>

2263
01:49:15.531 --> 01:49:15.531
<v Speaker 2>with us.</v>

2264
01:49:15.531 --> 01:49:15.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2265
01:49:15.531 --> 01:49:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2266
01:49:15.630 --> 01:49:17.660
<v Speaker 2>you could say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2267
01:49:17.661 --> 01:49:20.070
<v Speaker 2>probably for the most part driven by </v>
<v Speaker 2>greed,</v>

2268
01:49:20.071 --> 01:49:22.380
<v Speaker 2>but there is a legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2269
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.440
<v Speaker 2>impact on human health and longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that just be better suited for </v>

2270
01:49:28.051 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 2>the Diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2271
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:35.241
<v Speaker 2>I think it's awesome that our body makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>this natural metabolite.</v>

2272
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:38.040
<v Speaker 2>So the ketone salt products you buy on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the market are,</v>

2273
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.870
<v Speaker 2>the ketones are derived from natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>

2274
01:49:39.871 --> 01:49:42.030
<v Speaker 2>So you are giving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2275
01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:43.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2276
01:49:43.230 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 2>you are elevating a bio identical form </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a ketone that your body a,</v>

2277
01:49:48.041 --> 01:49:53.041
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of the debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is a d form of Beta </v>

2278
01:49:53.041 --> 01:49:56.431
<v Speaker 2>hydroxy butyrate in the l form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we call that receive mic if they're </v>

2279
01:49:56.431 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're receive make.</v>

2280
01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And The d form is kind of what your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes,</v>

2281
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:04.590
<v Speaker 2>but it can also convert it to the l in </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain tissues and it can get really </v>

2282
01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:04.590
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

2283
01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:09.030
<v Speaker 2>The important thing is that the salts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you consume that are commercially </v>

2284
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:13.351
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the d form is more likely to be broken </v>

2285
01:50:13.351 --> 01:50:16.171
<v Speaker 2>down and utilized as a source of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the l form probably sticks </v>

2286
01:50:16.171 --> 01:50:20.701
<v Speaker 2>around more within the cell and we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the l form actually also functions in </v>

2287
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:25.921
<v Speaker 2>these signaling roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the l form has antiinflammatory </v>

2288
01:50:25.921 --> 01:50:25.921
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the l form,</v>

2289
01:50:25.921 --> 01:50:27.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit these signaling pathways.</v>

2290
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:32.670
<v Speaker 2>So the received make mixtures that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the salts may have extra benefits </v>

2291
01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:36.931
<v Speaker 2>over just a pure deform because the l </v>
<v Speaker 2>form can kind of hang around and </v>

2292
01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:42.721
<v Speaker 2>stimulate all these pathways we know are</v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial before it's get broken down </v>

2293
01:50:42.721 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 2>into fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there might be some sort of a benefit</v>

2294
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:48.350
<v Speaker 2>for people even honest strict ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet taking exogenous ketones.</v>

2295
01:50:48.351 --> 01:50:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2296
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2297
01:50:50.741 --> 01:50:55.741
<v Speaker 2>we work really closely with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Charlie Foundation and I think the </v>

2298
01:50:55.741 --> 01:50:59.821
<v Speaker 2>kidogenic diet should never be replaced </v>
<v Speaker 2>with exogenous ketones at this point </v>

2299
01:50:59.821 --> 01:51:03.871
<v Speaker 2>because the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research is not there yet to </v>

2300
01:51:03.871 --> 01:51:06.661
<v Speaker 2>validate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we want to go in that direction </v>

2301
01:51:06.661 --> 01:51:07.090
<v Speaker 2>because there's some kids who really </v>
<v Speaker 2>like their fat intolerant.</v>

2302
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:12.090
<v Speaker 2>They throw up when they like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet because it's too high in </v>

2303
01:51:12.090 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 2>fat and a proportion of the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2304
01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Most kids can follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2305
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:19.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even for like childhood cancers and </v>

2306
01:51:19.981 --> 01:51:19.981
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2307
01:51:19.981 --> 01:51:19.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2308
01:51:19.981 --> 01:51:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I met with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2309
01:51:21.071 --> 01:51:23.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Max love project.</v>

2310
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on Jimmy Kimmel Max.</v>

2311
01:51:25.601 --> 01:51:29.620
<v Speaker 2>He was a brain tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child with a brain tumor that is,</v>

2312
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:34.910
<v Speaker 2>his family is treating them with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet and they helped many </v>

2313
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:37.050
<v Speaker 2>families around the area and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>

2314
01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:42.060
<v Speaker 2>just Google Max love project and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his family is helping a Max adhere </v>

2315
01:51:44.381 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 2>to and stick to a key to genic diet as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an adjutant to his standard of care.</v>

2316
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:51.790
<v Speaker 2>So not a replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The huge drank diet does work remarkably</v>

2317
01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:56.791
<v Speaker 2>well for some people as maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standalone therapy for cancer and have </v>

2318
01:51:56.791 --> 01:52:00.571
<v Speaker 2>the anticancer effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as an adjunct to the standard of </v>

2319
01:52:00.571 --> 01:52:00.571
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkably effective.</v>

2320
01:52:00.571 --> 01:52:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And they're working with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2321
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I think with Orange County yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have a lifestyle medicine </v>

2322
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:11.670
<v Speaker 2>program at Children's hospital in Orange</v>
<v Speaker 2>County where they're helping a wide </v>

2323
01:52:11.670 --> 01:52:14.650
<v Speaker 2>variety of families who have kids with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

2324
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:19.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick to and adhere to a key to genic </v>

2325
01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.321
<v Speaker 2>diet as part of a wellness program after</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went through their cancer </v>

2326
01:52:22.321 --> 01:52:26.431
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're a child and you get </v>

2327
01:52:26.431 --> 01:52:29.640
<v Speaker 2>the standard chemotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are kind of left in a situation </v>

2328
01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.020
<v Speaker 2>where you're far more likely to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of different health,</v>

2329
01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:37.380
<v Speaker 2>a negative health consequences after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because the chemotherapy wipes out </v>

2330
01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.250
<v Speaker 2>your immune system and can create,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2331
01:52:39.251 --> 01:52:44.251
<v Speaker 2>additional mutation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's kind of like a fallout from </v>

2332
01:52:44.251 --> 01:52:45.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the standard of care and being on a</v>

2333
01:52:45.711 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet can be cellular </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected,</v>

2334
01:52:48.111 --> 01:52:52.250
<v Speaker 2>can help you in a neoadjuvant and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after,</v>

2335
01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:57.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before standard of care and even after </v>

2336
01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:59.831
<v Speaker 2>Sandra care help you recover and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body back into like a detoxified </v>

2337
01:52:59.831 --> 01:53:01.070
<v Speaker 2>state if you want to use that term.</v>

2338
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:06.520
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now how many cancer research places are </v>

2339
01:53:07.190 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 2>adopting this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2340
01:53:08.091 --> 01:53:11.630
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be gigantic and this is a big</v>

2341
01:53:11.631 --> 01:53:15.350
<v Speaker 2>shift over to standard care of just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few few years ago.</v>

2342
01:53:15.351 --> 01:53:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:21.310
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we wrote a grant with the Moffitt </v>

2344
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Cancer Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a tea,</v>

2345
01:53:22.551 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>like a tier one cancer research center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2346
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:27.160
<v Speaker 2>they essentially reached out to us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say there's,</v>

2347
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:30.470
<v Speaker 2>there's significant interest in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the National Cancer Institute,</v>

2348
01:53:30.471 --> 01:53:31.480
<v Speaker 2>National,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2349
01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Nih,</v>
<v Speaker 2>national institutes of health to use the</v>

2350
01:53:34.551 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet as an adjective in at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point instead of replacing standard</v>

2351
01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 2>of care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2352
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only in situations where the standard of</v>

2353
01:53:42.951 --> 01:53:45.050
<v Speaker 2>care is not effective should that be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

2354
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:50.410
<v Speaker 2>but as an event to further enhance the </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficacy of the standard care.</v>

2355
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 2>So the cues drank diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know limits glucose,</v>

2356
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:59.021
<v Speaker 2>a beat availability to the tumor which </v>
<v Speaker 2>requires a glucose for growth and </v>

2357
01:53:59.021 --> 01:53:59.021
<v Speaker 2>proliferation.</v>

2358
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:04.300
<v Speaker 2>It decreases insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adoptable bell and insulin signaling </v>

2359
01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.540
<v Speaker 2>drives cancer growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also elevates ketones.</v>

2360
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 2>And ketones may have an anticancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

2361
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:13.330
<v Speaker 2>And for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in very aggressive tumors </v>

2362
01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:17.291
<v Speaker 2>that have dysregulated Mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't use the ketones for fuel a </v>

2363
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:22.660
<v Speaker 2>nearly as well as they do like fuels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a glucose and maybe even glutamine </v>

2364
01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:27.641
<v Speaker 2>amino acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it enhances the standard of care and </v>

2365
01:54:27.641 --> 01:54:27.920
<v Speaker 2>helps them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2366
01:54:27.921 --> 01:54:30.680
<v Speaker 2>actually protects them from the healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells,</v>

2367
01:54:30.681 --> 01:54:32.720
<v Speaker 2>from the radiation damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the standard,</v>

2368
01:54:32.721 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 2>it sensitizes the tumor to radiation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills off more tumor.</v>

2369
01:54:36.111 --> 01:54:41.111
<v Speaker 2>And it protects your healthy cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when my colleague Adrian check at the</v>

2370
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Barrow Neurological Institute has done </v>
<v Speaker 2>some remarkable work in animal models </v>

2371
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:49.001
<v Speaker 2>showing this and that has translated </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a human study and actually garnered</v>

2372
01:54:49.131 --> 01:54:53.660
<v Speaker 2>more interest in this area to use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet as an edge event.</v>

2373
01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I think in some cases where the standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>of care has failed for Glioblastoma or </v>

2374
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:00.230
<v Speaker 2>advanced metastatic cancer.</v>

2375
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I think the key to genic diet can kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of be a base therapy for a more </v>

2376
01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:11.180
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive metabolic based program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wrote an article called the press</v>

2377
01:55:11.181 --> 01:55:16.181
<v Speaker 2>pulse where the key to genic diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe something like metformin and other</v>

2378
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:20.150
<v Speaker 2>drugs can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be used to weaken in the cancer.</v>

2379
01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 2>And unlimited fuel source and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can connect,</v>

2380
01:55:22.911 --> 01:55:27.911
<v Speaker 2>come in with more maybe more aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways like hyperbaric oxygen therapy,</v>

2381
01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.580
<v Speaker 2>which can reverse tumor hypoxia or </v>
<v Speaker 2>various a low dose chemo regimens so you</v>

2382
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:35.930
<v Speaker 2>will weaken the cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2383
01:55:35.931 --> 01:55:40.931
<v Speaker 2>you put your body into a state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketosis and then you come in and pulse </v>

2384
01:55:40.931 --> 01:55:45.070
<v Speaker 2>at predetermined time points maybe every</v>
<v Speaker 2>three weeks of therapy in a much lower </v>

2385
01:55:45.070 --> 01:55:49.551
<v Speaker 2>dosing regimen to gradually knocked down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and reduce the tumor volume over time </v>

2386
01:55:50.011 --> 01:55:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and you do it in a more gradual way </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of going in there,</v>

2387
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:54.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with surgery,</v>

2388
01:55:54.391 --> 01:55:57.030
<v Speaker 2>radiation and Chemo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of like slash and burn and</v>

2389
01:55:57.031 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 2>it leaves the patient.</v>

2390
01:55:58.110 --> 01:56:00.480
<v Speaker 2>The patient coming out of that therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is much,</v>

2391
01:56:00.481 --> 01:56:05.070
<v Speaker 2>much weaker than when they came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at therapy can be developed that when</v>

2392
01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 2>the patient comes in and they come out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side,</v>

2393
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.320
<v Speaker 2>they're actually in more robust health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that they can,</v>

2394
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:12.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do that doesn't grow.</v>

2395
01:56:12.190 --> 01:56:14.490
<v Speaker 2>That's possible from a theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>standpoint,</v>

2396
01:56:14.491 --> 01:56:19.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with various research being done in </v>

2397
01:56:19.491 --> 01:56:21.771
<v Speaker 2>animal models and what we know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and physiology that can be </v>

2398
01:56:21.771 --> 01:56:26.091
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to take some time to do </v>

2399
01:56:26.091 --> 01:56:28.521
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so interesting when you talk </v>

2400
01:56:28.521 --> 01:56:28.521
<v Speaker 2>about the shift of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you were in college,</v>

2401
01:56:28.521 --> 01:56:30.060
<v Speaker 3>being fat phobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2402
01:56:30.061 --> 01:56:35.061
<v Speaker 3>to now being like one of the premier </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that's out here preaching the </v>

2403
01:56:35.061 --> 01:56:36.620
<v Speaker 3>benefits of the key to genic die and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then seeing this,</v>

2404
01:56:36.690 --> 01:56:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up until really recently,</v>

2405
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 3>cancer research always dependent upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2406
01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemotherapy and radiation and all these</v>

2407
01:56:45.121 --> 01:56:48.030
<v Speaker 3>different standards that everyone's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>having success with,</v>

2408
01:56:48.031 --> 01:56:53.031
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that you could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a person healthier through the </v>

2409
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Ketogenic Diet and hyperbaric chambers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and things along those lines.</v>

2410
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

2411
01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy actually is </v>

2412
01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:04.370
<v Speaker 2>FDA approved for things like radiation </v>
<v Speaker 2>necrosis.</v>

2413
01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Like when you have radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2414
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.800
<v Speaker 2>on a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of necrotic tissue and </v>

2415
01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.310
<v Speaker 2>patients would undergo hyperbaric oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 2>for radiation necrosis.</v>

2416
01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:14.390
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:57:14.391 --> 01:57:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to these,</v>

2418
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:21.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various conferences over the years and </v>

2419
01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:24.251
<v Speaker 2>talked to these physicians and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients would make remarkable </v>

2420
01:57:24.251 --> 01:57:24.251
<v Speaker 2>recoveries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2421
01:57:24.251 --> 01:57:27.970
<v Speaker 2>even after they have therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed like something else was </v>

2422
01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:27.970
<v Speaker 2>going kind of going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2423
01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I go back early in my work,</v>

2424
01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned that we develop these </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies through our work with the </v>

2425
01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:37.310
<v Speaker 2>department of the fence and when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>officer where we,</v>

2426
01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:42.400
<v Speaker 2>we build a hyperbaric chamber and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we buy an off the shelf microscope and </v>

2427
01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.391
<v Speaker 2>install it inside the chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we close it up and then we </v>

2428
01:57:46.391 --> 01:57:47.450
<v Speaker 2>pressurize it to simulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2429
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 2>what a dive would be while we're looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Mitochondria and,</v>

2430
01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:51.770
<v Speaker 2>and even the cells.</v>

2431
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And I did that with like Kelsey's stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells and neurons.</v>

2432
01:57:54.711 --> 01:57:59.711
<v Speaker 2>And we did it with a Glioblastoma cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and we noticed that the cells were </v>

2433
01:57:59.711 --> 01:58:03.701
<v Speaker 2>exploding with high levels of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I was seeing at the </v>

2434
01:58:03.701 --> 01:58:07.211
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I looked into it more and started </v>

2435
01:58:07.211 --> 01:58:07.211
<v Speaker 2>contacting some of the leaders in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

2436
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:08.450
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2437
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:13.510
<v Speaker 2>and they reported a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was Thomas Seyfried at </v>

2438
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Boston college and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a neuro genetics professor at Yale </v>

2439
01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:18.820
<v Speaker 2>University and then had moved to Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>to expand it,</v>

2440
01:58:18.850 --> 01:58:22.430
<v Speaker 2>a ketogenic diet program for cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he told me,</v>

2441
01:58:22.431 --> 01:58:27.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're observing is damaged </v>

2442
01:58:27.431 --> 01:58:29.951
<v Speaker 2>mitochondria from cancer cells which </v>
<v Speaker 2>have damaged Mitochondria and if you </v>

2443
01:58:29.951 --> 01:58:33.521
<v Speaker 2>give them more oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will produce proportionately more </v>

2444
01:58:33.521 --> 01:58:37.090
<v Speaker 2>reactive oxygen species and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxidative stress would essentially </v>

2445
01:58:37.090 --> 01:58:41.891
<v Speaker 2>trigger a necrosis and a pop ptosis in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cell so they would be able cell </v>

2446
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:46.351
<v Speaker 2>death at a level of oxygen that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively nontoxic to the healthy </v>

2447
01:58:46.351 --> 01:58:46.351
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

2448
01:58:46.351 --> 01:58:51.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we did some work with ketones </v>

2449
01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:51.240
<v Speaker 2>and saw that ketones were stopping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth of cancer too.</v>

2450
01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:53.450
<v Speaker 2>So we had this idea of using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2451
01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.560
<v Speaker 2>nutritional ketosis plus hyperbaric </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen and studying that in a mouse </v>

2452
01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.400
<v Speaker 2>model of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2453
01:59:00.401 --> 01:59:05.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've got some remarkable results </v>

2454
01:59:05.401 --> 01:59:05.401
<v Speaker 2>that we published and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2455
01:59:05.401 --> 01:59:09.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients are doing this kind of a in an </v>

2456
01:59:09.781 --> 01:59:10.480
<v Speaker 2>off label way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing the Diet.</v>

2457
01:59:10.481 --> 01:59:15.481
<v Speaker 2>But now we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we go to clinical trials dot Gov and </v>

2458
01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:17.290
<v Speaker 2>you just look up ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see more than a dozen studies,</v>

2459
01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:19.300
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I got into this,</v>

2460
01:59:19.301 --> 01:59:23.680
<v Speaker 2>there was no studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now there's been an interest and even</v>

2461
01:59:23.710 --> 01:59:25.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe people like jumping on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bandwagon of,</v>

2462
01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:27.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have a particular drug,</v>

2463
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 2>will accuse drank diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhance it,</v>

2464
01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:32.920
<v Speaker 2>or let's see if it enhance it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard of care or let's see,</v>

2465
01:59:32.921 --> 01:59:34.330
<v Speaker 2>we're standard of care failed.</v>

2466
01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:38.620
<v Speaker 2>If we can get these patients on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic therapy and see if we can help</v>

2467
01:59:38.621 --> 01:59:41.170
<v Speaker 2>them with quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so exciting.</v>

2468
01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just really amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting stuff.</v>

2469
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so interesting seeing something like </v>

2470
01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.721
<v Speaker 2>this emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll relatively late in terms of like </v>

2471
01:59:51.721 --> 01:59:53.080
<v Speaker 2>medicine and science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 2017.</v>

2472
01:59:53.090 --> 01:59:54.670
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

2473
01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just if you google like kidogenic </v>

2474
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.001
<v Speaker 2>diet and a Google search around 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's down here and something happened </v>

2475
02:00:03.001 --> 02:00:06.560
<v Speaker 2>around 2013 or 14 or just skyrocketed it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that.</v>

2476
02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

2477
02:00:07.791 --> 02:00:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on Tim Ferriss and other things,</v>

2478
02:00:09.821 --> 02:00:11.870
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2479
02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:17.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably dating back to 2014,</v>

2480
02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:18.900
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be,</v>

2481
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:22.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's really my colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many humble,</v>

2482
02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:23.080
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2483
02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure your colleagues have a lot to </v>

2484
02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:29.701
<v Speaker 2>do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as the impact of the impact </v>

2485
02:00:29.701 --> 02:00:32.910
<v Speaker 2>cast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impact that a podcast has in terms </v>

2486
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:33.190
<v Speaker 2>of the amount of people that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to google something,</v>

2487
02:00:33.191 --> 02:00:34.210
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2488
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:39.270
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many magnitudes greater than anything </v>

2489
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.270
<v Speaker 2>that anybody is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2490
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.590
<v Speaker 2>from professor or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2491
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:40.990
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

2492
02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I realize that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2493
02:00:42.851 --> 02:00:47.851
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thank you for letting me have this </v>

2494
02:00:47.851 --> 02:00:47.851
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2495
02:00:47.851 --> 02:00:47.851
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2496
02:00:47.851 --> 02:00:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I almost feel like there's guys like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that got me into this was Dr Jiang </v>

2497
02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.890
<v Speaker 2>row and he was at Barrow Neurological </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute.</v>

2498
02:00:53.891 --> 02:00:58.891
<v Speaker 2>He mentored my colleague Adrian check </v>
<v Speaker 2>into looking at ketones for </v>

2499
02:00:59.411 --> 02:01:04.411
<v Speaker 2>Glioblastoma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's runs the pediatric center in </v>

2500
02:01:04.411 --> 02:01:04.411
<v Speaker 2>Calgary Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2501
02:01:04.411 --> 02:01:08.050
<v Speaker 2>but Dr Eric Kossoff from Johns Hopkins </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a big,</v>

2502
02:01:08.110 --> 02:01:10.450
<v Speaker 2>big help to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A number of people.</v>

2503
02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they should have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>

2504
02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:12.420
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2505
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:17.430
<v Speaker 2>they're so busy they don't do podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I realized fairly early on it was </v>

2506
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:20.641
<v Speaker 2>really important to get the message out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it does no good if you're not </v>

2507
02:01:20.641 --> 02:01:24.811
<v Speaker 2>hitting a big target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I focused on was not just one </v>

2508
02:01:24.811 --> 02:01:29.161
<v Speaker 2>application,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean we do everything from wound </v>

2509
02:01:29.161 --> 02:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>healing to these genetic diseases to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

2510
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>to various seizure disorders.</v>

2511
02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:36.430
<v Speaker 2>So I realized this was a lot bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pediatric epilepsy and uh,</v>

2512
02:01:36.431 --> 02:01:40.300
<v Speaker 2>and it's the only way you should eat it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2513
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2514
02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:43.700
<v Speaker 2>tell everybody they should eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic,</v>

2515
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:48.701
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely feel that they should </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least go into ketosis a couple times </v>

2516
02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:53.231
<v Speaker 2>a year if not for just longevity effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anti inflammatory effects when,</v>

2517
02:01:53.391 --> 02:01:58.391
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things pop up and we're under </v>

2518
02:01:58.391 --> 02:01:58.391
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2519
02:01:58.391 --> 02:02:02.470
<v Speaker 2>had an email yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person had severe shingles or severe,</v>

2520
02:02:02.651 --> 02:02:05.330
<v Speaker 2>like a outbreaks of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>

2521
02:02:05.710 --> 02:02:07.970
<v Speaker 2>like a fever blisters or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2522
02:02:07.971 --> 02:02:12.971
<v Speaker 2>or cold sores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they just fast and do the </v>

2523
02:02:12.971 --> 02:02:13.400
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it suppresses that.</v>

2524
02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Or when they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since they've been on the Ketogenic </v>

2525
02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had profound suppression of some </v>

2526
02:02:21.130 --> 02:02:25.631
<v Speaker 2>viral disorders that when the virus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's viral shedding and there's,</v>

2527
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:27.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're affected by the virus,</v>

2528
02:02:27.261 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 2>it causes profound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2529
02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:33.230
<v Speaker 2>in inflammation and neuroinflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it kind of starts with a headache and</v>

2530
02:02:33.231 --> 02:02:38.231
<v Speaker 2>then it will kind of lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>itchiness or whatever associated with </v>

2531
02:02:38.231 --> 02:02:39.230
<v Speaker 2>shingles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they described it very elegant,</v>

2532
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elegantly in an email and it was very </v>

2533
02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:44.320
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2534
02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:47.921
<v Speaker 2>before and after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since they've been doing the ketogenic </v>

2535
02:02:47.921 --> 02:02:47.921
<v Speaker 2>diet had a profound effect even more so </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the drugs,</v>

2536
02:02:47.921 --> 02:02:49.250
<v Speaker 2>anti viral drugs that they're taking.</v>

2537
02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:54.640
<v Speaker 2>So even something like HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which contributes to neuroinflammation </v>

2538
02:02:56.631 --> 02:03:00.950
<v Speaker 2>and even different types of cancers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Kaposi Sarcoma,</v>

2539
02:03:00.951 --> 02:03:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2540
02:03:02.090 --> 02:03:07.090
<v Speaker 2>being being in a state of nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis could probably offer a lot of </v>

2541
02:03:07.090 --> 02:03:09.260
<v Speaker 2>benefits to HIV patients that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle,</v>

2542
02:03:09.650 --> 02:03:14.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some symptoms that are associated </v>

2543
02:03:14.650 --> 02:03:16.280
<v Speaker 2>with inflammation and other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated.</v>

2544
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So this is another path we're going into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2545
02:03:18.501 --> 02:03:21.470
<v Speaker 2>So some of those researchers has reached</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to us and say,</v>

2546
02:03:21.471 --> 02:03:23.420
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NIH has a proposal for this.</v>

2547
02:03:23.421 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's write a grant together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in the like,</v>

2548
02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:31.031
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because I only have such so </v>

2549
02:03:31.031 --> 02:03:34.031
<v Speaker 2>much of a bandwidth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people from Ivy League institutions </v>

2550
02:03:34.031 --> 02:03:34.580
<v Speaker 2>are reaching out to me and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2551
02:03:34.581 --> 02:03:39.581
<v Speaker 2>can you help us formulate a ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet or can we use your ketone </v>

2552
02:03:39.581 --> 02:03:41.390
<v Speaker 2>supplement to do a study on things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>never thought,</v>

2553
02:03:41.391 --> 02:03:46.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nutritional ketosis would be applied </v>

2554
02:03:46.391 --> 02:03:46.391
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2555
02:03:46.391 --> 02:03:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Now what about wound healing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You brought up wound healing.</v>

2556
02:03:47.061 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big one.</v>

2557
02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my students,</v>

2558
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:51.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Shannon Kessel,</v>

2559
02:03:51.051 --> 02:03:56.051
<v Speaker 2>she actually works for the epigenics </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation now helping the dogs at the </v>

2560
02:03:56.051 --> 02:04:00.191
<v Speaker 2>Quito pet sanctuary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did her phd on the effects of </v>

2561
02:04:00.711 --> 02:04:05.570
<v Speaker 2>ketones on a wound healing model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the model that we use was,</v>

2562
02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:07.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

2563
02:04:07.281 --> 02:04:08.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of a rat.</v>

2564
02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2565
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:11.540
<v Speaker 2>animal protection people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2566
02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>but in describing what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we basically have a wound that's a </v>

2567
02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:20.321
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty nasty wound on the back of a rat </v>

2568
02:04:20.321 --> 02:04:23.290
<v Speaker 2>where one side is a schemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lacks significant blood flow and the </v>

2569
02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:26.810
<v Speaker 2>other side is non ischemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then which has normal blood flow and</v>

2570
02:04:26.811 --> 02:04:31.811
<v Speaker 2>there's like a chunk of tissue kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken out and then we look to see how </v>

2571
02:04:31.811 --> 02:04:35.201
<v Speaker 2>fast that wound closes up right over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and we do it in young animals and </v>

2572
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:40.331
<v Speaker 2>we do in aged animals and we take </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and then we feed them a standard</v>

2573
02:04:40.441 --> 02:04:43.350
<v Speaker 2>road in Chow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is high carbohydrate Roden Chow,</v>

2574
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:48.500
<v Speaker 2>and then we have a number of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups where we give them various types </v>

2575
02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:48.500
<v Speaker 2>of ketone supplements.</v>

2576
02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>And we found that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2577
02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:55.670
<v Speaker 2>admitted that the ketone supplements </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhance the wound healing not only in </v>

2578
02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:59.721
<v Speaker 2>the aged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was pretty remarkable and </v>

2579
02:04:59.721 --> 02:04:59.721
<v Speaker 2>ischemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also in the young had event.</v>

2580
02:04:59.721 --> 02:05:04.671
<v Speaker 2>So it was like for the young healthy guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has a cut or a wound on the </v>

2581
02:05:04.681 --> 02:05:08.070
<v Speaker 2>battlefield or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can help that wound heal up faster.</v>

2582
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's doing it through a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms.</v>

2583
02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Probably a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wound itself is often the,</v>

2584
02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:21.280
<v Speaker 2>the wound tissue is deficient in ATP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The energy source because the blood </v>

2585
02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:21.630
<v Speaker 2>can't get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2586
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:26.810
<v Speaker 2>So the ketones can restore like 90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of it has 90 percent less atp in</v>

2587
02:05:26.971 --> 02:05:31.971
<v Speaker 2>some cases we have ischemic wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ketones have the ability to like we </v>

2588
02:05:31.971 --> 02:05:34.260
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thin out the blood and be able to get to</v>

2589
02:05:34.261 --> 02:05:39.261
<v Speaker 2>that wound tissue that's lacking oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and blood flow and not only does it </v>

2590
02:05:39.301 --> 02:05:44.301
<v Speaker 2>restore the energy to the wound healing </v>
<v Speaker 2>which can allow cells to replicate and </v>

2591
02:05:45.091 --> 02:05:48.210
<v Speaker 2>heal up the wound faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I talked about the anti inflammatory</v>

2592
02:05:48.211 --> 02:05:48.630
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

2593
02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:53.900
<v Speaker 2>So persistent chronic inflammation can </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent the wound from healing up and by</v>

2594
02:05:54.601 --> 02:05:59.601
<v Speaker 2>suppressing some of the inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways that can kind of open the gate </v>

2595
02:05:59.601 --> 02:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>on the activity of Eris growth factors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and healing processes that can heal the </v>

2596
02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:06.960
<v Speaker 2>wound up and it seems to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>profound in the age,</v>

2597
02:06:06.961 --> 02:06:11.961
<v Speaker 2>but also happens in the young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is just taking exotic Pr Jones </v>

2598
02:06:11.961 --> 02:06:14.820
<v Speaker 2>and not even entered Chow from rodents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard child.</v>

2599
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:19.470
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't want to kind of messy up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the the data in any way.</v>

2600
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 2>We actually should've done a well if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the funding,</v>

2601
02:06:21.901 --> 02:06:25.320
<v Speaker 2>we could have done a key to genic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>plus keynote and supplementation.</v>

2602
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And you think that would be been better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2603
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think it would because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet alone suppresses some of </v>

2604
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:36.111
<v Speaker 2>these inflammatory components that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is associated with impaired wound </v>

2605
02:06:36.111 --> 02:06:40.401
<v Speaker 2>healing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially impaired wound healing in </v>

2606
02:06:40.401 --> 02:06:40.401
<v Speaker 2>like a diabetic model.</v>

2607
02:06:40.401 --> 02:06:42.030
<v Speaker 2>So I talked about hyperbaric oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>

2608
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:47.060
<v Speaker 2>the main applications that is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetic wounds that don't heal up </v>

2609
02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:48.060
<v Speaker 2>because the oxygen and glucose doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to it.</v>

2610
02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the diabetic wound,</v>

2611
02:06:51.271 --> 02:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2612
02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:58.580
<v Speaker 2>it's really a blood flow problem and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>did to answer that question that </v>

2613
02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:02.961
<v Speaker 2>determine if it was blood flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a doppler blood flow analysis of </v>

2614
02:07:02.961 --> 02:07:07.131
<v Speaker 2>the blood flow into wound and showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was something like a 25 or 30 </v>

2615
02:07:07.131 --> 02:07:11.391
<v Speaker 2>percent increase in blood flow to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wound when we induced acute ketosis.</v>

2616
02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.450
<v Speaker 2>So we'd given jd incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stimulate,</v>

2617
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:19.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis that would mimic Qj diet or </v>

2618
02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:21.801
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we do a doppler blood flow </v>

2619
02:07:21.801 --> 02:07:23.100
<v Speaker 2>analysis and we show a pretty remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase in.</v>

2620
02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge increase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2621
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:30.440
<v Speaker 2>That's being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like that would be the move </v>

2622
02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:30.490
<v Speaker 2>for someone who's recovering from some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of research or something,</v>

2623
02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:35.580
<v Speaker 2>a hyperbaric chamber combined with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketosis mutagenic and for the Va.</v>

2624
02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.260
<v Speaker 2>My collaborator on this project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dr lisa gold at one time,</v>

2625
02:07:41.261 --> 02:07:46.261
<v Speaker 2>she was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was the president of the wound </v>

2626
02:07:46.261 --> 02:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>healing society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even she was like,</v>

2627
02:07:46.871 --> 02:07:48.510
<v Speaker 2>this is really reMarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2628
02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:51.320
<v Speaker 2>to have someone of her stature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's an md phd,</v>

2629
02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:54.910
<v Speaker 2>a really comment that this is profound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2630
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:58.990
<v Speaker 2>effect on wound healing really motivated</v>
<v Speaker 2>us to follow up on this.</v>

2631
02:07:58.991 --> 02:07:59.720
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2632
02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.740
<v Speaker 2>we have not gotten funding after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we really need to keep working </v>

2633
02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:05.740
<v Speaker 2>because we need to follow up on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>

2634
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:10.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get this as a legitimate wound to a </v>

2635
02:08:10.830 --> 02:08:13.701
<v Speaker 2>lot of people are trying to enhance the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wound healing process by putting things </v>

2636
02:08:13.701 --> 02:08:14.120
<v Speaker 2>on the wound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2637
02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:19.200
<v Speaker 2>but we're wound healing is enhanced if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you alter and optimize your metabolic </v>

2638
02:08:19.391 --> 02:08:21.450
<v Speaker 2>physiology that promotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2639
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>substrate and oxygenation to the wound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2640
02:08:24.551 --> 02:08:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's what ketones do.</v>

2641
02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a vasodilation effect.</v>

2642
02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:31.000
<v Speaker 2>There is a big increase in a denison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denison is a pretty profound vasodilator</v>

2643
02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:36.020
<v Speaker 2>dilator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have a vasodilation that's </v>

2644
02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.350
<v Speaker 2>improving blood flow to the area where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not only glucose in there,</v>

2645
02:08:38.351 --> 02:08:43.060
<v Speaker 2>but there's ketones and ketones help </v>
<v Speaker 2>restore the energy in that wound that is</v>

2646
02:08:43.061 --> 02:08:48.061
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently depressed from lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood flow and it's promoting or </v>

2647
02:08:48.061 --> 02:08:52.231
<v Speaker 2>reducing a lot of the inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are preventing it from </v>

2648
02:08:52.231 --> 02:08:52.390
<v Speaker 2>healing in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2649
02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:53.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2650
02:08:53.411 --> 02:08:58.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was really like it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>presented at the wound healing society </v>

2651
02:08:58.411 --> 02:08:59.020
<v Speaker 2>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were floored by it.</v>

2652
02:08:59.021 --> 02:09:00.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shannon has a,</v>

2653
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:05.640
<v Speaker 2>my student has went and moved on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing postdoctoral work at another </v>

2654
02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:06.490
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really need to follow up on that.</v>

2655
02:09:06.491 --> 02:09:08.520
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2656
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:11.470
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to process in parallel </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

2657
02:09:11.770 --> 02:09:13.510
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I neeD another student to,</v>

2658
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:15.280
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that may have been,</v>

2659
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2660
02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:19.030
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the motor function,</v>

2661
02:09:19.031 --> 02:09:24.031
<v Speaker 2>gLucose lowering and antianxiety effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all thinGs that kinda jumped out of </v>

2662
02:09:24.191 --> 02:09:27.490
<v Speaker 2>the data from us that I like never would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have expected,</v>

2663
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I came in this to look at seizures </v>

2664
02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:34.590
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the hard data in terms of like </v>

2665
02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:34.930
<v Speaker 2>what is the percentage of increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>healing across the board with the,</v>

2666
02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:39.960
<v Speaker 2>with the routes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we look at time time for that </v>

2667
02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:41.620
<v Speaker 2>wound to close and heal up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about 20,</v>

2668
02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:45.240
<v Speaker 2>20 to 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's significant mirrors.</v>

2669
02:09:45.250 --> 02:09:46.750
<v Speaker 2>The amount of blood flow that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

2670
02:09:46.751 --> 02:09:49.450
<v Speaker 2>the increase in blood flow big about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent does.</v>

2671
02:09:49.451 --> 02:09:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you could draw a direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation to that,</v>

2672
02:09:52.181 --> 02:09:57.181
<v Speaker 2>but obviously if you have improved blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>flow that's getting nutrition to the </v>

2673
02:09:57.181 --> 02:09:58.300
<v Speaker 2>wound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2674
02:09:58.301 --> 02:10:03.301
<v Speaker 2>and we know that that blood has ketones </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it which have anti inflammatory </v>

2675
02:10:03.301 --> 02:10:04.810
<v Speaker 2>effects and things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2676
02:10:04.811 --> 02:10:07.310
<v Speaker 2>it stimulates a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the h deck,</v>

2677
02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:10.960
<v Speaker 2>each tech one and two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which stimulates superoxide dismutase,</v>

2678
02:10:10.961 --> 02:10:14.300
<v Speaker 2>another antioxidant enzymes which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>often dysregulated,</v>

2679
02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the wound site.</v>

2680
02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:20.580
<v Speaker 2>So it's doing a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only just restoring oxygenation and </v>

2681
02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:22.810
<v Speaker 2>blood flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's having like a drug like effects</v>

2682
02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:26.230
<v Speaker 2>these metabolites are really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling and it makes sense like,</v>

2683
02:10:26.231 --> 02:10:28.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're in a state of starvation,</v>

2684
02:10:28.001 --> 02:10:30.340
<v Speaker 2>ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ketones would have,</v>

2685
02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be telling the brain to do certain </v>

2686
02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:37.351
<v Speaker 2>things and different neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological pathways that it should </v>

2687
02:10:37.351 --> 02:10:39.470
<v Speaker 2>be altering our behavior in ways you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to.</v>

2688
02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:44.740
<v Speaker 2>The person that is deprived of food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes tired from hypoglycemia and qa </v>

2689
02:10:45.590 --> 02:10:50.590
<v Speaker 2>is the person that's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people that survived in the </v>

2690
02:10:50.590 --> 02:10:53.771
<v Speaker 2>absence of food availability were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that became more lucid and clear </v>

2691
02:10:53.771 --> 02:10:57.140
<v Speaker 2>and we were able to go and forage or </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt down the animal and kill it and eat</v>

2692
02:10:57.141 --> 02:10:59.270
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we Are hardwired.</v>

2693
02:10:59.330 --> 02:11:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer your question,</v>

2694
02:11:00.381 --> 02:11:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I think a while back you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2695
02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:03.950
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do we have ketones?</v>

2696
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an evolutionarily hardwired</v>

2697
02:11:06.921 --> 02:11:09.000
<v Speaker 2>system that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2698
02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:12.650
<v Speaker 2>is just built into our dna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2699
02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:13.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2700
02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>with the advent of carbohydrates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequent feedings and you know,</v>

2701
02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>a deli on every corner here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've largely silenced that genetic </v>

2702
02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:27.581
<v Speaker 2>program that becomes activated upon food</v>
<v Speaker 2>deprivation that can stimulate a host of</v>

2703
02:11:28.041 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>beneficial things from extension of </v>
<v Speaker 2>longevity to autophagy.</v>

2704
02:11:31.821 --> 02:11:32.450
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rhonda,</v>

2705
02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:33.710
<v Speaker 2>patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2706
02:11:33.711 --> 02:11:38.711
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a big fan of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's talked about this a quite a lot </v>

2707
02:11:38.711 --> 02:11:38.711
<v Speaker 2>and she's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2708
02:11:38.711 --> 02:11:39.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's super awesome.</v>

2709
02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>She actually visited the lab and we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>a podcast with her at our lab.</v>

2710
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2711
02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:46.250
<v Speaker 2>She's just scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I talked to her I'm like,</v>

2712
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:49.430
<v Speaker 2>basically a monkey knows the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>

2713
02:11:49.431 --> 02:11:54.431
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like an encyclopedia of </v>

2714
02:11:54.431 --> 02:11:54.431
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2715
02:11:54.431 --> 02:11:54.920
<v Speaker 2>and she always come prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I came prepared.</v>

2716
02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2717
02:11:55.431 --> 02:11:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda does.</v>

2718
02:11:56.431 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote down some notes here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>

2719
02:11:58.431 --> 02:12:00.410
<v Speaker 2>there's probably things I'll forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2720
02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2721
02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:08.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a system that typically was </v>

2722
02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:10.010
<v Speaker 2>activated in the normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2723
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:12.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during periods of millennia ago.</v>

2724
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually enhanced your </v>

2725
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>concentratIon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2726
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:19.640
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back to the hunting thing,</v>

2727
02:12:19.641 --> 02:12:22.730
<v Speaker 2>my friend remy warren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a pretty famous,</v>

2728
02:12:22.731 --> 02:12:25.730
<v Speaker 2>a hunter and one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that he says,</v>

2729
02:12:25.731 --> 02:12:30.731
<v Speaker 2>and he's always said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he likes to hunt hungry and one of </v>

2730
02:12:30.731 --> 02:12:34.361
<v Speaker 2>the things he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does these back pump back country </v>

2731
02:12:34.361 --> 02:12:38.120
<v Speaker 2>hunting trips solo and he purposely </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings to little food.</v>

2732
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On one of the things that he's found </v>

2733
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:46.451
<v Speaker 2>over his many years is that when he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually hungry is more tuned in and he </v>

2734
02:12:46.451 --> 02:12:48.230
<v Speaker 2>does a better job of understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

2735
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2736
02:12:49.550 --> 02:12:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Like the first time I actually started </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with fasting or even a </v>

2737
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:58.660
<v Speaker 2>calorie restricted diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a walk around my neighborhood at </v>

2738
02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:01.490
<v Speaker 2>the time and it's like my whole nostrils</v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up.</v>

2739
02:13:01.491 --> 02:13:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I could smell things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could hear things.</v>

2740
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I was more lucid in ways I had not been </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

2741
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even fasted for seven days and was able </v>

2742
02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.471
<v Speaker 2>to give a lecture and train in the gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lift weights that were not hardly </v>

2743
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:17.570
<v Speaker 2>much lower than what I typically do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I probably couldn't.</v>

2744
02:13:17.571 --> 02:13:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just at seven day per point after</v>

2745
02:13:20.631 --> 02:13:22.680
<v Speaker 2>no calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was starting to freeze at all,</v>

2746
02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:25.310
<v Speaker 2>no galleries after seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just water,</v>

2747
02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:27.380
<v Speaker 2>water and some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2748
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:32.410
<v Speaker 2>like a bullying cube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some electrolytes like sodium </v>

2749
02:13:32.410 --> 02:13:34.890
<v Speaker 2>potassium and lots of water and I allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself a,</v>

2750
02:13:34.891 --> 02:13:37.410
<v Speaker 2>about a third of the coffee that I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>typically drink.</v>

2751
02:13:37.410 --> 02:13:42.410
<v Speaker 2>So I'd have a small cup of coffee in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and I got a ton of stuff done </v>

2752
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.990
<v Speaker 2>during that week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had,</v>

2753
02:13:42.991 --> 02:13:44.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't have to,</v>

2754
02:13:44.590 --> 02:13:47.250
<v Speaker 2>to make my food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to clean up my food,</v>

2755
02:13:47.251 --> 02:13:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have time eating the food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I saved a lot of time.</v>

2756
02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I lost eight to nine pounds and </v>

2757
02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:58.000
<v Speaker 2>then within a week or two it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all came back again.</v>

2758
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:59.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it's new,</v>

2759
02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:01.610
<v Speaker 2>you're holding glycogen and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you lose like a.</v>

2760
02:14:01.710 --> 02:14:03.720
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in regards to,</v>

2761
02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:06.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time I'm like,</v>

2762
02:14:06.661 --> 02:14:10.980
<v Speaker 2>my deadlift strength was maybe eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>reps for eight or 10 reps with like five</v>

2763
02:14:11.010 --> 02:14:16.010
<v Speaker 2>65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was able to do 10 easy reps with </v>

2764
02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:16.680
<v Speaker 2>five plates on each side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about 500.</v>

2765
02:14:17.050 --> 02:14:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2766
02:14:18.571 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 2>typically going into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was parenthood when I was,</v>

2767
02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:23.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I followed,</v>

2768
02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I listened to [inaudible] podcast and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a huge follower during aids in 1994.</v>

2769
02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:34.220
<v Speaker 2>And I was eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was eating four to six meals a day </v>

2770
02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:38.091
<v Speaker 2>with shakes in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember even having like </v>

2771
02:14:38.091 --> 02:14:39.140
<v Speaker 2>nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would wake up in the middle nightmare.</v>

2772
02:14:39.150 --> 02:14:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Like the nightmare would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have like food on me after two </v>

2773
02:14:44.150 --> 02:14:44.640
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would have to eat like every two.</v>

2774
02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I was so obsessed with getting bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stronger.</v>

2775
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 2>And so for me to fast seven days and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be out of my comfort zone,</v>

2776
02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:56.600
<v Speaker 2>that was like a big step for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kinda just did it to mentally </v>

2777
02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.360
<v Speaker 2>liberate myself from chronic overfeeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things.</v>

2778
02:15:00.361 --> 02:15:05.361
<v Speaker 2>And because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had just read and studied george </v>

2779
02:15:05.361 --> 02:15:08.391
<v Speaker 2>cahill and the harvard medical school </v>
<v Speaker 2>study where they fasted for 40 days and </v>

2780
02:15:08.391 --> 02:15:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2781
02:15:08.481 --> 02:15:10.410
<v Speaker 2>all the parameters on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2782
02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to do me well.</v>

2783
02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.520
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I did it,</v>

2784
02:15:14.521 --> 02:15:17.160
<v Speaker 2>the second and third day we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kinda hard for me.</v>

2785
02:15:17.161 --> 02:15:20.580
<v Speaker 2>But after like the fifth day it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was bizarre.</v>

2786
02:15:20.581 --> 02:15:24.460
<v Speaker 2>It became like really easy and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of like floating around like,</v>

2787
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:27.750
<v Speaker 2>like my body had no inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2788
02:15:27.751 --> 02:15:32.751
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't buzzing with energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was very lucid and I didn't feel </v>

2789
02:15:32.751 --> 02:15:36.120
<v Speaker 2>like I need it to be buzzed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I realized I'm so much,</v>

2790
02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:39.570
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times I feel like I need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink coffee to amp up to be my best.</v>

2791
02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:44.900
<v Speaker 2>But I was my best when my brain was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really calm and I was able to put </v>

2792
02:15:45.211 --> 02:15:50.211
<v Speaker 2>thoughts together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote a whole lot of research </v>

2793
02:15:50.211 --> 02:15:50.400
<v Speaker 2>proposals which later became funded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2794
02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:52.800
<v Speaker 2>and I got probably of the proposals I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really worked on.</v>

2795
02:15:52.801 --> 02:15:55.410
<v Speaker 2>It probably got over a million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>of funding during that time.</v>

2796
02:15:55.410 --> 02:16:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I really intensely worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on various proposals because I just </v>

2797
02:16:00.410 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 2>transitioned into like a tenure track </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

2798
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:06.380
<v Speaker 2>So it allowed me to work on manuscripts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and proposals and just put thoughts </v>

2799
02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:09.801
<v Speaker 2>together that maybe I otherwise either </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have the time to or the mental </v>

2800
02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:14.960
<v Speaker 2>kind of resources to get into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter intuitive that you have more </v>

2801
02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:17.160
<v Speaker 2>resources with less calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2802
02:16:17.161 --> 02:16:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2803
02:16:18.061 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I was burning my body fat for fuel </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily.</v>

2804
02:16:21.691 --> 02:16:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Probably lost a little bit of muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that fuel,</v>

2805
02:16:24.241 --> 02:16:27.660
<v Speaker 2>that fat was becoming ketones and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain had switched over.</v>

2806
02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I was doing low carB but not really full</v>
<v Speaker 2>full quito at the time.</v>

2807
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:35.440
<v Speaker 2>But it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like quieted my brain in a way that</v>

2808
02:16:35.441 --> 02:16:40.441
<v Speaker 2>I was able to really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I have like mild adhd because I </v>

2809
02:16:41.321 --> 02:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>like to do so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it quieted my mind and I was able to</v>

2810
02:16:44.741 --> 02:16:47.950
<v Speaker 2>wake up like every morning I was waking </v>
<v Speaker 2>up a lot earlier than normal,</v>

2811
02:16:47.951 --> 02:16:50.620
<v Speaker 2>like 4:35</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I typically sleep till like seven.</v>

2812
02:16:50.890 --> 02:16:55.890
<v Speaker 2>But I was able to like wake up and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus and get a ton of work done the </v>

2813
02:16:55.890 --> 02:17:00.361
<v Speaker 2>first three or four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then then I would go into work </v>

2814
02:17:00.361 --> 02:17:00.361
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

2815
02:17:00.361 --> 02:17:04.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet with my students or teach or do </v>

2816
02:17:04.261 --> 02:17:06.001
<v Speaker 2>whatever I had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just remember getting a ton of </v>

2817
02:17:06.001 --> 02:17:06.001
<v Speaker 2>work done during that period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never reproduced it.</v>

2818
02:17:06.001 --> 02:17:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I never went back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did a whole bunch of blood work on</v>

2819
02:17:09.281 --> 02:17:11.280
<v Speaker 2>me to give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2820
02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of insight as to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on during,</v>

2821
02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:19.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the fasting stage and everything </v>

2822
02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:19.440
<v Speaker 2>was really positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2823
02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:20.020
<v Speaker 2>there was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2824
02:17:20.021 --> 02:17:23.890
<v Speaker 2>my insulin was really low at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My glucose was really low.</v>

2825
02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I got down to like 25 at one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

2826
02:17:27.401 --> 02:17:32.401
<v Speaker 2>I've experimented with a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and my ketones were </v>

2827
02:17:32.401 --> 02:17:32.401
<v Speaker 2>really high.</v>

2828
02:17:32.401 --> 02:17:35.940
<v Speaker 2>My ketones were like double what my </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose was at a couple time points </v>

2829
02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:36.550
<v Speaker 2>during that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an edge.</v>

2830
02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would encourage people,</v>

2831
02:17:38.051 --> 02:17:43.051
<v Speaker 2>especially maybe people that are prone </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cancer or people who have had cancer </v>

2832
02:17:43.051 --> 02:17:45.820
<v Speaker 2>in the past and maybe had treated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>are kind of in a state of remission.</v>

2833
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go,</v>

2834
02:17:47.651 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 2>if you get your body into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call the metabolic zone,</v>

2835
02:17:51.370 --> 02:17:54.250
<v Speaker 2>where the level of ketones are higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the level of glucose,</v>

2836
02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.280
<v Speaker 2>that puts tremendous metabolic stress on</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer cells or precancerous cells that </v>

2837
02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.160
<v Speaker 2>have a huge appetite for glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2838
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and that contribute can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can initiate autophagy.</v>

2839
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:11.940
<v Speaker 2>So even people who do not have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps you want to just make sure </v>

2840
02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:13.900
<v Speaker 2>they're holding off of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>preventative maintenance.</v>

2841
02:18:13.930 --> 02:18:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it can stimulate almost </v>

2842
02:18:18.930 --> 02:18:21.961
<v Speaker 2>purge your body of cancer cells that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakened by in this fasted state and </v>

2843
02:18:22.841 --> 02:18:26.470
<v Speaker 2>also precancerous cells that may be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the transition of trends,</v>

2844
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d differentiating into this.</v>

2845
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:32.020
<v Speaker 2>No cancer like cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These cells are very energy demanding,</v>

2846
02:18:32.021 --> 02:18:36.400
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're replicating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you deprive them of energy,</v>

2847
02:18:36.401 --> 02:18:41.010
<v Speaker 2>the quote unquote energy crisis signal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these cells receive can,</v>

2848
02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:46.040
<v Speaker 2>can initiate a program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell death we call apoptosis and </v>

2849
02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:48.760
<v Speaker 2>autophagy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the benefit of this.</v>

2850
02:18:48.761 --> 02:18:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like housekeeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about it,</v>

2851
02:18:50.951 --> 02:18:55.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you accumulate a lot of dead cells that </v>

2852
02:18:55.951 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 2>are kind of sluggish or mitochondria </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of sluggish.</v>

2853
02:18:55.991 --> 02:18:58.330
<v Speaker 2>And then you fast for a week and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like reboot.</v>

2854
02:18:58.390 --> 02:19:00.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like a setting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a reset button.</v>

2855
02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:03.850
<v Speaker 2>So did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2856
02:19:03.851 --> 02:19:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

2857
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I did a podcast with robb wolf or he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this morning,</v>

2858
02:19:07.391 --> 02:19:11.140
<v Speaker 2>god who went for a whole year without </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

2859
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pay attention to that?</v>

2860
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only did I pay attention to it,</v>

2861
02:19:14.831 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I've presented that at a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different meetings and people,</v>

2862
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:19.660
<v Speaker 2>people say bullshit.</v>

2863
02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:23.380
<v Speaker 2>But this is actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in a.</v>

2864
02:19:23.410 --> 02:19:24.350
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

2865
02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I may have had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to actually show it at this,</v>

2866
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:29.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this meeting.</v>

2867
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:32.420
<v Speaker 2>But I think I took the slide out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had it in his back.</v>

2868
02:19:32.421 --> 02:19:37.421
<v Speaker 2>people with this guy did 382 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only did he lose a tremendous amount</v>

2869
02:19:38.301 --> 02:19:43.301
<v Speaker 2>of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went from being morbidly obese to </v>

2870
02:19:43.301 --> 02:19:43.940
<v Speaker 2>being like a normal sized person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the big one.</v>

2871
02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:46.510
<v Speaker 2>The skin shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2872
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>That's normally one of the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2873
02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean significantly.</v>

2874
02:19:51.231 --> 02:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people have to.</v>

2875
02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:56.150
<v Speaker 2>When you're that big and you shrink down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a normal sized person,</v>

2876
02:19:56.151 --> 02:20:01.151
<v Speaker 2>they have to cut your skin or you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk around like a flying squirrel and </v>

2877
02:20:01.151 --> 02:20:02.630
<v Speaker 2>when you have like this crazy extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin,</v>

2878
02:20:02.631 --> 02:20:03.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2879
02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Well this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another through this 380 plus</v>

2880
02:20:06.891 --> 02:20:11.120
<v Speaker 2>days of fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his body shrank accordingly.</v>

2881
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2882
02:20:11.991 --> 02:20:14.660
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was about 500 pounds,</v>

2883
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:18.290
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>travis christofferson and I wrote a blog</v>

2884
02:20:18.291 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 2>article and it was part one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two and three,</v>

2885
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:23.570
<v Speaker 2>the history of the key to genic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part one,</v>

2886
02:20:23.571 --> 02:20:25.910
<v Speaker 2>two and three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's on rob wolf website.</v>

2887
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:31.180
<v Speaker 2>So if you just googled the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ketogenic diet and land on rob's </v>

2888
02:20:31.180 --> 02:20:31.220
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have,</v>

2889
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I think we talk about the story in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2890
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a remarkable story.</v>

2891
02:20:35.271 --> 02:20:40.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was like 500 pounds and he </v>

2892
02:20:40.271 --> 02:20:42.491
<v Speaker 2>fasted for like 381 days or 82 days and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he went down to 190 pounds.</v>

2893
02:20:44.421 --> 02:20:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And the remarkable thing is that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustained that over.</v>

2894
02:20:48.381 --> 02:20:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he maybe went back,</v>

2895
02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:54.020
<v Speaker 2>went back up like five or six pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but largely sustain that weight loss,</v>

2896
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:57.350
<v Speaker 2>that's the quarter time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was running completely all fat,</v>

2897
02:20:57.380 --> 02:21:02.380
<v Speaker 2>the fat that he had stored up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was studied pretty intensely and </v>

2898
02:21:02.691 --> 02:21:05.870
<v Speaker 2>the thing that came out of the data was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2899
02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:07.940
<v Speaker 2>it was a pretty significant drop in </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnesium.</v>

2900
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 2>So that actually convinced me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2901
02:21:09.621 --> 02:21:14.621
<v Speaker 2>I definitely should probably maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement magnesium was fasting </v>

2902
02:21:14.621 --> 02:21:18.790
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any vitamins or they did give him an </v>

2903
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:20.090
<v Speaker 2>electrolyte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's in the medical records and I dug</v>

2904
02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.490
<v Speaker 2>into this as much as we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2905
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:27.520
<v Speaker 2>his glucose levels got down to like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 25 a couple times and maintained it </v>

2906
02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:34.080
<v Speaker 2>was given potassium tablets to keep his </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart healthy and multivitamins every </v>

2907
02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:34.080
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2908
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm just rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have done is it robs?</v>

2909
02:21:38.390 --> 02:21:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I think I've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2911
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:41.960
<v Speaker 2>fast at 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>82 days.</v>

2912
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:46.990
<v Speaker 2>A incredible last 275 point five pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2913
02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Who was calling bullshit on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2914
02:21:49.431 --> 02:21:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I did present it to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mainstream,</v>

2915
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinicians even just coughing.</v>

2916
02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually really fun,</v>

2917
02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:02.460
<v Speaker 2>like the first it might've been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>american epilepsy society where they </v>

2918
02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:04.580
<v Speaker 2>kind of marginalized the ketogenic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it may have been another,</v>

2919
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:08.840
<v Speaker 2>it might've been neurology and epilepsy </v>
<v Speaker 2>society at the time.</v>

2920
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:11.030
<v Speaker 2>They're warming up to it just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the data,</v>

2921
02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:16.031
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't turn their back on the data </v>

2922
02:22:16.031 --> 02:22:18.131
<v Speaker 2>because data is data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a massive amount of data </v>

2923
02:22:18.131 --> 02:22:18.131
<v Speaker 2>emerging that this should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2924
02:22:18.131 --> 02:22:22.040
<v Speaker 2>this is grossly underutilized and should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be really the standard of care.</v>

2925
02:22:22.041 --> 02:22:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Even the frontline therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we all kind of realized,</v>

2926
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:30.350
<v Speaker 2>but neurologists would have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sidekick registered dietician or </v>

2927
02:22:30.350 --> 02:22:30.400
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2928
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:35.460
<v Speaker 2>but so during the time one of my first </v>
<v Speaker 2>presentations was to a medical doctors,</v>

2929
02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're in it for cme credits and </v>

2930
02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:40.490
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just standard conventional.</v>

2931
02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2932
02:22:41.491 --> 02:22:42.480
<v Speaker 2>towards the end I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2933
02:22:42.481 --> 02:22:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I followed the ketogenic diet myself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2934
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:46.560
<v Speaker 2>they're like gas or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2935
02:22:46.561 --> 02:22:51.561
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when I explained to them that </v>

2936
02:22:51.561 --> 02:22:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I was normal in the question answering </v>
<v Speaker 2>after were like,</v>

2937
02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:52.830
<v Speaker 2>well why do you do it?</v>

2938
02:22:53.170 --> 02:22:54.510
<v Speaker 2>And was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>

2939
02:22:55.170 --> 02:23:00.170
<v Speaker 2>This is going back like 2009 or 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2940
02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:06.200
<v Speaker 2>It was really bizarre to them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone would actually fall the </v>

2941
02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:07.020
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was doing like the classical,</v>

2942
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to do like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2943
02:23:08.490 --> 02:23:09.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2944
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:12.090
<v Speaker 2>the hopkins protocol or was using eric </v>
<v Speaker 2>kossoff spoke on the,</v>

2945
02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:14.620
<v Speaker 2>on the op 98 and two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2946
02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:16.340
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about 80,</v>

2947
02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I was a three to one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was like 85 to 88 percent fat and </v>

2948
02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:23.550
<v Speaker 2>I was sticking to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2949
02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:29.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people really just think it's a </v>

2950
02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:31.701
<v Speaker 2>really bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have a severe neurological </v>

2951
02:23:31.701 --> 02:23:35.151
<v Speaker 2>problem to be at the time and now that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just evidence of how mainstream because </v>

2952
02:23:35.371 --> 02:23:35.790
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2953
02:23:35.791 --> 02:23:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you see it in mass media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2954
02:23:38.191 --> 02:23:40.530
<v Speaker 2>athletes going on quote unquote the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet.</v>

2955
02:23:40.531 --> 02:23:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd question whether they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic.</v>

2956
02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need another measure of their </v>

2957
02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 2>ketones to really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ketogenic diet,</v>

2958
02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:51.680
<v Speaker 2>you're in ketosis by virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the definition that your blood </v>

2959
02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 2>ketones are elevated above zero point </v>
<v Speaker 2>five millimolar.</v>

2960
02:23:53.581 --> 02:23:56.130
<v Speaker 2>And typically most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty hard to achieve.</v>

2961
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:59.790
<v Speaker 2>If you're up to one millimolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is mild ketosis,</v>

2962
02:24:00.570 --> 02:24:02.370
<v Speaker 2>you take a hundred people out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

2963
02:24:02.371 --> 02:24:04.800
<v Speaker 2>they eat the standard american diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe one,</v>

2964
02:24:04.801 --> 02:24:09.801
<v Speaker 2>maybe two people will achieve that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they like go all day without eating or </v>

2965
02:24:09.801 --> 02:24:10.770
<v Speaker 2>something like it really takes a while </v>
<v Speaker 2>to achieve.</v>

2966
02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:15.840
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be doing something pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical to achieve that blood </v>

2967
02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.590
<v Speaker 2>measurement of a state of ketosis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not seeing that in pro athletes.</v>

2968
02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:23.130
<v Speaker 2>So I know there's a few fighters we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should take before she retired.</v>

2969
02:24:23.131 --> 02:24:24.550
<v Speaker 2>She went ketogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2970
02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:26.190
<v Speaker 2>her boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brian caraway.</v>

2971
02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I know he was key to genic for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just my experience with athletes,</v>

2972
02:24:30.450 --> 02:24:32.910
<v Speaker 2>but I know that there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are looking at it.</v>

2973
02:24:33.090 --> 02:24:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2974
02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:38.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of questioned whether they were </v>

2975
02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:38.900
<v Speaker 2>like kidogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they did low carb,</v>

2976
02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but if you eat too much protein that </v>
<v Speaker 2>converts to glucose,</v>

2977
02:24:41.490 --> 02:24:42.610
<v Speaker 2>it can kick you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2978
02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:43.820
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2979
02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:45.840
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some athletes that contact me,</v>

2980
02:24:45.841 --> 02:24:50.841
<v Speaker 2>their output is really high so they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually giving like five or six hours </v>

2981
02:24:50.841 --> 02:24:54.711
<v Speaker 2>of output a day and they're eating like </v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three chocolate bars and they're </v>

2982
02:24:54.711 --> 02:24:56.790
<v Speaker 2>getting like 250 grams of carbs a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them.</v>

2983
02:24:57.090 --> 02:24:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And there's maintaining a mild state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis,</v>

2984
02:24:59.910 --> 02:25:04.910
<v Speaker 2>especially post exercise ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even with drinking suddenly something </v>

2985
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:07.080
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start like a slow burning like a</v>

2986
02:25:07.081 --> 02:25:08.310
<v Speaker 2>soup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a slow carb,</v>

2987
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.970
<v Speaker 2>like a tim ferris advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2988
02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 2>and they stay in ketosis and if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>back off more,</v>

2989
02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:17.130
<v Speaker 2>if they back their carbohydrates down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 50 grams a day,</v>

2990
02:25:17.131 --> 02:25:19.440
<v Speaker 2>they start to lose performance on that.</v>

2991
02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are people with very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>output though.</v>

2992
02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2993
02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:26.270
<v Speaker 2>We talked about five hours of exercise a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day plus,</v>

2994
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:31.290
<v Speaker 2>and they went from a thousand grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs a day to 250 and better.</v>

2995
02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Fifty grams of carbs for the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>average person.</v>

2996
02:25:35.501 --> 02:25:38.470
<v Speaker 2>This is not applicable for an mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter is two and three days.</v>

2997
02:25:39.090 --> 02:25:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2998
02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I think you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the older guys like older </v>

2999
02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:45.550
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could readily adapt them.</v>

3000
02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I said though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that adaptation should probably </v>

3001
02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:53.251
<v Speaker 2>occur during training in the off season </v>
<v Speaker 2>and give themselves a buffer zone of </v>

3002
02:25:53.251 --> 02:25:56.890
<v Speaker 2>three months and actually work with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coach or work with an app,</v>

3003
02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:00.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like avatar nutrition or something where</v>

3004
02:26:00.311 --> 02:26:05.311
<v Speaker 2>they calculate the macros and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually know they're hitting the </v>

3005
02:26:05.311 --> 02:26:05.311
<v Speaker 2>macros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the body is amazing.</v>

3006
02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.260
<v Speaker 2>If you actually hit the macros that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculated,</v>

3007
02:26:08.410 --> 02:26:10.000
<v Speaker 2>your body will go into ketosis.</v>

3008
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very few people that you can't </v>

3009
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.971
<v Speaker 2>get into quito,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you use things like mct </v>

3010
02:26:17.971 --> 02:26:20.890
<v Speaker 2>and really adjust the macros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could also do key to key to </v>

3011
02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:23.200
<v Speaker 2>genic intermittent fasting where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of don't eat throughout the day but</v>

3012
02:26:23.201 --> 02:26:27.580
<v Speaker 2>then eat through a window or time </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted eating as a rhonda.</v>

3013
02:26:27.581 --> 02:26:30.790
<v Speaker 2>patrick calls it where you basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>just eat within,</v>

3014
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:32.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3015
02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:33.940
<v Speaker 2>a six hour window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like to do that.</v>

3016
02:26:33.941 --> 02:26:37.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat from 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM to 11:00</v>

3017
02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:42.240
<v Speaker 2>PM and just kind of eat a big meal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of graze a little bit </v>

3018
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:42.240
<v Speaker 2>throughout and then I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3019
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.220
<v Speaker 2>a pretty good chunk of the time fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after I'm done with work,</v>

3020
02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not frantically running around </v>

3021
02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:54.331
<v Speaker 2>trying to get stuff done so I can relax </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my wife and just kind of kicked </v>

3022
02:26:54.331 --> 02:26:54.520
<v Speaker 2>back and eat and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3023
02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:56.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's kinda what I wanna eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

3024
02:26:56.890 --> 02:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>So you feel like there's more of a I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a 14 hour thing you think is even </v>

3025
02:27:01.890 --> 02:27:03.280
<v Speaker 2>more benefit doing an 18?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3026
02:27:03.281 --> 02:27:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3027
02:27:04.181 --> 02:27:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3028
02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I do uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

3029
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:13.210
<v Speaker 2>for me I definitely think I do a because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about like a couple </v>

3030
02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:19.740
<v Speaker 2>hours extra where like if I fast for 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours but then go like my ketones really</v>

3031
02:27:21.911 --> 02:27:25.150
<v Speaker 2>start to go up from 14 to 18 hours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

3032
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:30.270
<v Speaker 2>And then I could actually stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis if I eat key to genic during </v>

3033
02:27:30.270 --> 02:27:32.950
<v Speaker 2>that six hours of eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I kind of pay attention to,</v>

3034
02:27:33.250 --> 02:27:38.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating really low carb like I can eat </v>

3035
02:27:38.250 --> 02:27:38.250
<v Speaker 2>and before I go to bed I test my ketones</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bam,</v>

3036
02:27:38.250 --> 02:27:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm hitting like two point two or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

3037
02:27:39.761 --> 02:27:43.480
<v Speaker 2>so I continued to get the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having ketones,</v>

3038
02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:48.070
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to like things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhonda talks about like autology,</v>

3039
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I think you can even get more benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an 18 hour fast and you do that and</v>

3040
02:27:52.031 --> 02:27:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to do it every day.</v>

3041
02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I think you could just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could actually do it just once,</v>

3042
02:27:56.261 --> 02:27:58.480
<v Speaker 2>maybe twice a week and get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits from that.</v>

3043
02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do that over the course of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year and that's not hard to do,</v>

3044
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:04.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could just convince people,</v>

3045
02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:09.360
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the breads and pastas out and just </v>

3046
02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 2>put in more vegetables and just do </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting.</v>

3047
02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

3048
02:28:11.141 --> 02:28:16.141
<v Speaker 2>every tuesday and thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they do blood work after like </v>

3049
02:28:16.141 --> 02:28:17.710
<v Speaker 2>three months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to see a profound effect.</v>

3050
02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Probably not even changing the diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to see.</v>

3051
02:28:19.811 --> 02:28:24.811
<v Speaker 2>A profound effect now is someone told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is an effective way to </v>

3052
02:28:24.811 --> 02:28:28.100
<v Speaker 2>measure ketones through breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of a breath monitor.</v>

3053
02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that real or?</v>

3054
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of,</v>

3055
02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:33.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were being showcased at the</v>

3056
02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:35.990
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the low carb usa.</v>

3057
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one that I have the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with is a product called </v>

3058
02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:44.780
<v Speaker 2>ketone x and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they have a bluetooth device out</v>

3059
02:28:44.781 --> 02:28:48.030
<v Speaker 2>where you can blow into it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>reports to your phone and it shows you,</v>

3060
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:53.110
<v Speaker 2>shows you the parts per million of </v>
<v Speaker 2>acetone in there and acetone.</v>

3061
02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:58.400
<v Speaker 2>So you make beta hydroxybutyrate nsc to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acetate as the two primary ketone bodies</v>

3062
02:28:58.401 --> 02:29:03.401
<v Speaker 2>that are used for fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also they have signaling properties </v>

3063
02:29:03.401 --> 02:29:06.430
<v Speaker 2>and acetoacetate can break down a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneously decarboxylates to </v>

3064
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:08.720
<v Speaker 2>something called acetone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you knows,</v>

3065
02:29:08.721 --> 02:29:09.950
<v Speaker 2>nail polish remover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3066
02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:15.220
<v Speaker 2>So a acetone actually has some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting a brain effects that calms </v>

3067
02:29:16.671 --> 02:29:19.490
<v Speaker 2>the brain down a sub narcotic levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>acetone,</v>

3068
02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:24.820
<v Speaker 2>a open potassium channels that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>potassium channels are opened that </v>

3069
02:29:24.951 --> 02:29:29.951
<v Speaker 2>hyperpolarizes the membrane potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>for neurons and makes them kind of more </v>

3070
02:29:29.951 --> 02:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>like charged batteries and it also kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>calms your,</v>

3071
02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:33.410
<v Speaker 2>your brain down.</v>

3072
02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:36.560
<v Speaker 2>So iT's not firing action potentials as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much and that's a good thing.</v>

3073
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:40.340
<v Speaker 2>So instead of all this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fluttering of activity,</v>

3074
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:44.690
<v Speaker 2>it helps to kind of synchronize your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain in a way by elevating.</v>

3075
02:29:44.691 --> 02:29:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And this goes back to homeostasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3076
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:51.800
<v Speaker 2>So that acetone has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can correlate with seizure control.</v>

3077
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:56.410
<v Speaker 2>So parents who have kids who do not like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get their fingers pricked,</v>

3078
02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:58.370
<v Speaker 2>have used the breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acetone,</v>

3079
02:29:58.380 --> 02:30:00.320
<v Speaker 2>you blow into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a pretty color,</v>

3080
02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you know the kids like it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3081
02:30:02.350 --> 02:30:05.300
<v Speaker 2>It is kinD of hard to like set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to calibrate it.</v>

3082
02:30:05.301 --> 02:30:10.301
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a little bit clunky to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>with but it does pretty good indicator </v>

3083
02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:13.700
<v Speaker 2>if you're registering like orange or red</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that,</v>

3084
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you are definitely in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis.</v>

3085
02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:18.770
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I call it only semi quantitative,</v>

3086
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:23.830
<v Speaker 2>so they need to work out some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs and if you just look up breath </v>

3087
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:27.761
<v Speaker 2>acetone meters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably about five on the </v>

3088
02:30:27.761 --> 02:30:27.761
<v Speaker 2>market now.</v>

3089
02:30:27.761 --> 02:30:30.740
<v Speaker 2>And the one that I have experienced with</v>
<v Speaker 2>is called a key tonics.</v>

3090
02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:34.280
<v Speaker 2>And if you're acetone is high and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking ketone supplements,</v>

3091
02:30:34.310 --> 02:30:36.920
<v Speaker 2>you are burnt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are cranking your fat metabolism,</v>

3092
02:30:37.230 --> 02:30:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3093
02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:40.880
<v Speaker 2>mobilizing fat and burning fat for </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

3094
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:44.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pretty valid indicator for </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning fat for energy.</v>

3095
02:30:44.391 --> 02:30:49.391
<v Speaker 2>Blood is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bloods of gold standard probably will </v>

3096
02:30:49.391 --> 02:30:51.080
<v Speaker 2>always be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's technologies emerging out now at</v>

3097
02:30:51.081 --> 02:30:56.081
<v Speaker 2>least you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small companies that are a essentially </v>

3098
02:30:56.081 --> 02:30:59.590
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a like a bandaid like thing on </v>

3099
02:30:59.590 --> 02:31:00.440
<v Speaker 2>your skin and it's measuring glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's measuring a,</v>

3100
02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially beta hydroxybutyrate </v>

3101
02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:07.160
<v Speaker 2>acetoacetate and things like lactate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it'll go to your smartphone.</v>

3102
02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:10.010
<v Speaker 2>So you can look at your smartphone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see your glucose levels,</v>

3103
02:31:10.011 --> 02:31:11.510
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ketones,</v>

3104
02:31:11.511 --> 02:31:16.511
<v Speaker 2>your lactate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe some potentially other things </v>

3105
02:31:16.511 --> 02:31:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you could adjust your diet or drink a </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement to optimize you into a,</v>

3106
02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maximizes your strength,</v>

3107
02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:26.780
<v Speaker 2>maximize your performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maximizes your brain protection in </v>

3108
02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:31.800
<v Speaker 2>extreme environment like high pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen or a navy seal or something like </v>

3109
02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:35.241
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That technology is in development now </v>

3110
02:31:35.241 --> 02:31:37.260
<v Speaker 2>and will probably surface sometime in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next year or two.</v>

3111
02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And I think it will be pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think of a dexcon,</v>

3112
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:45.110
<v Speaker 2>but instead of just glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll give you like a metabolomic </v>

3113
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:46.980
<v Speaker 2>profile of your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there'll be,</v>

3114
02:31:47.130 --> 02:31:52.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can augment it in with your diet or </v>

3115
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:52.130
<v Speaker 2>with various supplements.</v>

3116
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:54.580
<v Speaker 3>Now I've got two other important </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

3117
02:31:54.581 --> 02:31:57.640
<v Speaker 3>One physical performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3118
02:31:57.670 --> 02:32:02.670
<v Speaker 3>have there been studies on reaction time</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all sorts of different variables that</v>

3119
02:32:03.521 --> 02:32:05.140
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're looking at all of this,</v>

3120
02:32:05.141 --> 02:32:08.170
<v Speaker 3>increase in blood flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decrease in inflammation,</v>

3121
02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:13.590
<v Speaker 3>all those things are what you would want</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of a body that you want to perform </v>

3122
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:17.611
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like things would fire better </v>

3123
02:32:17.611 --> 02:32:17.611
<v Speaker 3>as it will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>

3124
02:32:17.611 --> 02:32:21.690
<v Speaker 3>what have there been studies on putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes through variety,</v>

3125
02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:23.830
<v Speaker 3>stress tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction times,</v>

3126
02:32:24.010 --> 02:32:25.320
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those</v>

3127
02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:28.530
<v Speaker 2>studies need to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think at some of the marketers out</v>

3128
02:32:28.531 --> 02:32:33.531
<v Speaker 2>there that are promoting ketone </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements are based on some animal </v>

3129
02:32:33.531 --> 02:32:36.990
<v Speaker 2>data and I think they're extrapolating </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the effects.</v>

3130
02:32:36.991 --> 02:32:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Will ketones offer a metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage?</v>

3131
02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:40.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

3132
02:32:40.171 --> 02:32:42.840
<v Speaker 2>you can generate more atp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

3133
02:32:42.841 --> 02:32:46.290
<v Speaker 2>it gives your brain resilience under </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation or hyperglycemia.</v>

3134
02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:48.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3135
02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.680
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is that these studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be done and they need to be </v>

3136
02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:57.471
<v Speaker 2>funded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are going on right now and </v>

3137
02:32:57.471 --> 02:32:57.471
<v Speaker 2>some of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of involved in a.</v>

3138
02:32:57.471 --> 02:33:00.720
<v Speaker 2>And probably most important is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3139
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:02.980
<v Speaker 2>what are they actually studying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

3140
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.490
<v Speaker 2>what key to genic diet are they actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>studying?</v>

3141
02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the macronutrient ratios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only the ratios,</v>

3142
02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:12.090
<v Speaker 2>but what types of fats are they using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3143
02:33:12.091 --> 02:33:13.590
<v Speaker 2>what type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's their protein source,</v>

3144
02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:14.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3145
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really important.</v>

3146
02:33:15.331 --> 02:33:20.331
<v Speaker 2>And when it comes to ketone supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a whole nother box of worms </v>

3147
02:33:20.331 --> 02:33:20.331
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3148
02:33:20.331 --> 02:33:21.130
<v Speaker 2>are they using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3149
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:23.190
<v Speaker 2>just pure sodium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beta hydroxy butyrate,</v>

3150
02:33:23.191 --> 02:33:28.191
<v Speaker 2>are they using like sodium potassium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnesium combination which would offer </v>

3151
02:33:28.191 --> 02:33:29.610
<v Speaker 2>more benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3152
02:33:29.611 --> 02:33:34.611
<v Speaker 2>are they really using [inaudible] for if</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dna or are they using a ketone </v>

3153
02:33:34.611 --> 02:33:35.850
<v Speaker 2>ester?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like lots of these,</v>

3154
02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>considerations.</v>

3155
02:33:37.531 --> 02:33:39.330
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of nuances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3156
02:33:39.331 --> 02:33:44.331
<v Speaker 2>in the way these things are formulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the way they're dosed and in what </v>

3157
02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:47.820
<v Speaker 2>type of application,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a pure strength application</v>

3158
02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:52.850
<v Speaker 2>or what I call strength performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pushups and chin ups and things </v>

3159
02:33:52.850 --> 02:33:57.051
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a or endurance or ultra endurance </v>

3160
02:33:57.051 --> 02:34:01.761
<v Speaker 2>or things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do a lot of research needs to be </v>

3161
02:34:01.761 --> 02:34:01.800
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't really give you an answer,</v>

3162
02:34:01.801 --> 02:34:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but I think the guy who's done the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>research on this clearly,</v>

3163
02:34:05.281 --> 02:34:10.281
<v Speaker 2>at least with the ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Jeff Bullock from Ohio state </v>

3164
02:34:10.281 --> 02:34:10.281
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

3165
02:34:10.281 --> 02:34:14.240
<v Speaker 2>His faster study clearly showed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes in a state of nutritional </v>

3166
02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:14.850
<v Speaker 2>ketosis burn like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3167
02:34:14.851 --> 02:34:17.140
<v Speaker 2>almost twice the amount of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3168
02:34:17.141 --> 02:34:19.150
<v Speaker 2>and they maintain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is remarkable.</v>

3169
02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does some elegant studies to show fat </v>

3170
02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:26.611
<v Speaker 2>oxford vaccination rates are like double</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we even thought were achievable </v>

3171
02:34:26.611 --> 02:34:31.590
<v Speaker 2>when guys follow a well formulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet and he recently did a </v>

3172
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:36.031
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a using a ketone salt product showing </v>

3173
02:34:36.031 --> 02:34:39.760
<v Speaker 2>that there was an enhancement of eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent performance in workout.</v>

3174
02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Put a with a cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So big number.</v>

3175
02:34:44.310 --> 02:34:48.050
<v Speaker 2>April is pretty big for cyclists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3176
02:34:48.450 --> 02:34:51.340
<v Speaker 2>it might've been time to exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just presented it here.</v>

3177
02:34:51.350 --> 02:34:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know he had the data </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

3178
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:57.961
<v Speaker 2>but I mean jeff volek is the leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>researcher on and he wrote the book the </v>

3179
02:34:57.961 --> 02:34:59.620
<v Speaker 2>art and science of low carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>

3180
02:34:59.621 --> 02:35:03.220
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of mma guys have benefited </v>
<v Speaker 2>from because they emailed me.</v>

3181
02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these,</v>

3182
02:35:04.810 --> 02:35:06.700
<v Speaker 2>these are studies that I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>

3183
02:35:06.701 --> 02:35:11.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've done a lot of work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal models and now we're </v>

3184
02:35:11.701 --> 02:35:14.821
<v Speaker 2>transitioning to a human studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a study at duke university,</v>

3185
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:18.580
<v Speaker 2>so I mentioned a oxygen toxicity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>study this,</v>

3186
02:35:18.730 --> 02:35:23.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in humans in these big environmental </v>

3187
02:35:23.730 --> 02:35:26.371
<v Speaker 2>chambers at duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we do some stuff with nasa and </v>

3188
02:35:26.371 --> 02:35:27.820
<v Speaker 2>the nasa neemo mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a,</v>

3189
02:35:27.821 --> 02:35:32.470
<v Speaker 2>but we're really interested in moving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of these animal studies,</v>

3190
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:34.930
<v Speaker 2>which we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're ready to move into humans,</v>

3191
02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:40.050
<v Speaker 2>but we still don't know what the optimal</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement is and that's why a ketone </v>

3192
02:35:40.050 --> 02:35:45.050
<v Speaker 2>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a company we developed this really </v>

3193
02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:46.801
<v Speaker 2>focused on identifying not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement that gives us the best </v>

3194
02:35:46.801 --> 02:35:50.851
<v Speaker 2>margins for sales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the supplement that's super </v>

3195
02:35:50.851 --> 02:35:53.881
<v Speaker 2>optimized for particular applications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now another question I wanted to ask you</v>

3196
02:35:53.950 --> 02:35:55.690
<v Speaker 2>was about migraines.</v>

3197
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Now I would assume that people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>headaches,</v>

3198
02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.360
<v Speaker 2>headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take nonsteroidal anti </v>

3199
02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:03.440
<v Speaker 2>inflammatories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone with migraines mean it would,</v>

3200
02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:08.580
<v Speaker 2>it would seem to me that that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that might be able to help </v>

3201
02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:08.580
<v Speaker 2>mitigate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3202
02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3203
02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:11.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on her dissertation committee,</v>

3204
02:36:11.201 --> 02:36:13.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elena gross and she was a student,</v>

3205
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:18.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduated from oxford university and is </v>

3206
02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:21.091
<v Speaker 2>now doing a clinical trial on a ketone </v>
<v Speaker 2>salts for migraine.</v>

3207
02:36:21.881 --> 02:36:26.881
<v Speaker 2>So what motivated her to even pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as a phd project is that she had </v>

3208
02:36:26.881 --> 02:36:31.450
<v Speaker 2>crippling cluster migraine headaches and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she reached out to me and,</v>

3209
02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:36.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she actually presented at our metabolic </v>

3210
02:36:36.930 --> 02:36:37.750
<v Speaker 2>therapeutics conference and that's her </v>
<v Speaker 2>area of expertise.</v>

3211
02:36:37.751 --> 02:36:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Like when it's happening to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

3212
02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:44.380
<v Speaker 2>it motivates you in a way that you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>immerse yourself in the research and you</v>

3213
02:36:44.381 --> 02:36:47.260
<v Speaker 2>become like a leading expert and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

3214
02:36:47.261 --> 02:36:52.261
<v Speaker 2>at the very young age that elena is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's got a great background of </v>

3215
02:36:52.261 --> 02:36:53.050
<v Speaker 2>education behind her.</v>

3216
02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:57.520
<v Speaker 2>She's kind of the leading authority on </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutritional ketosis for,</v>

3217
02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:02.790
<v Speaker 2>for migraines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a growing field because a lot </v>

3218
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:05.911
<v Speaker 2>of people who had migraines that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>contacted me and tried either of the </v>

3219
02:37:05.911 --> 02:37:09.220
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet or ketone supplementation</v>
<v Speaker 2>have benefited from it when nothing else</v>

3220
02:37:09.221 --> 02:37:11.590
<v Speaker 2>worked for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work for everybody,</v>

3221
02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:14.560
<v Speaker 2>but in some people that have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>crippling headaches,</v>

3222
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.110
<v Speaker 2>it better than anything that they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried so far.</v>

3223
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and migraines,</v>

3224
02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:22.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the data coming out,</v>

3225
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:27.830
<v Speaker 2>there's two sets of data that I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that migraines are linked to </v>

3226
02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:29.780
<v Speaker 2>neuroinflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3227
02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:32.840
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's caused by a viral etiology,</v>

3228
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:38.110
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of swelling of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that leads to this kind of low systemic </v>

3229
02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:44.470
<v Speaker 2>neuroinflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the ketones are working </v>

3230
02:37:44.470 --> 02:37:45.350
<v Speaker 2>through an anti a and anti inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

3231
02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes like I said before,</v>

3232
02:37:47.091 --> 02:37:52.091
<v Speaker 2>people get shingles or like a cold list </v>
<v Speaker 2>or they'll get like a headache </v>

3233
02:37:52.091 --> 02:37:54.791
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day and that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroinflammation and then there's other</v>

3234
02:37:54.831 --> 02:37:58.760
<v Speaker 2>data to show that these migraines </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually may be like a mini seizure,</v>

3235
02:37:59.090 --> 02:38:04.090
<v Speaker 2>like your brain is actually having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mini seizure that's not manifesting as a</v>

3236
02:38:04.791 --> 02:38:07.670
<v Speaker 2>grand mal or tonic clonic seizure or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even an absence seizure,</v>

3237
02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:12.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's presenting as a migraine and </v>

3238
02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:12.880
<v Speaker 2>it's seizure.</v>

3239
02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I would say some of the data is </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicating that and ketones seem to be a</v>

3240
02:38:17.661 --> 02:38:20.240
<v Speaker 2>viable strategy for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3241
02:38:21.010 --> 02:38:22.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for migraines from what I've seen.</v>

3242
02:38:22.941 --> 02:38:24.380
<v Speaker 2>and that's why it's being studied right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3243
02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:30.010
<v Speaker 2>The other question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about someone who's on a vegan </v>

3244
02:38:30.010 --> 02:38:30.010
<v Speaker 2>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3245
02:38:30.010 --> 02:38:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I get to a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a really close friend.</v>

3246
02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's vegetarian.</v>

3247
02:38:33.650 --> 02:38:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm dr don carnegie as a ihmc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about this a lot for a </v>

3248
02:38:39.261 --> 02:38:40.970
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's relatively easy,</v>

3249
02:38:40.971 --> 02:38:45.971
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you had a dairy and you have </v>

3250
02:38:45.971 --> 02:38:45.971
<v Speaker 2>eggs and eggs are a huge staple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I buy the happy eggs,</v>

3251
02:38:45.971 --> 02:38:49.330
<v Speaker 2>which actually tastes a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like the free range egg a,</v>

3252
02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:51.380
<v Speaker 2>but a vegan diet is a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging.</v>

3253
02:38:51.410 --> 02:38:55.060
<v Speaker 2>The charlie foundations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dietitian beth zoo pack,</v>

3254
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Kenya is her name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3255
02:38:56.811 --> 02:38:58.580
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the charlie foundation </v>
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>

3256
02:38:58.581 --> 02:39:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I think you may be able to find some </v>
<v Speaker 2>information or a pamphlet that describes</v>

3257
02:39:02.721 --> 02:39:07.721
<v Speaker 2>how to put together a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kidogenic diet.</v>

3258
02:39:08.210 --> 02:39:12.710
<v Speaker 2>So there's no way that you can hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>macronutrient ratios,</v>

3259
02:39:12.810 --> 02:39:17.810
<v Speaker 2>have a key to genic diet that's vegan </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless it's in a shake form.</v>

3260
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.000
<v Speaker 2>So in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3261
02:39:20.001 --> 02:39:25.001
<v Speaker 2>formulating a product that's more of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>illiquid form that you can drink is </v>

3262
02:39:25.611 --> 02:39:30.590
<v Speaker 2>probably the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do do a vegan ketogenic diet,</v>

3263
02:39:30.591 --> 02:39:35.591
<v Speaker 2>whole food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best that you could do Is really </v>

3264
02:39:35.591 --> 02:39:37.250
<v Speaker 2>about maybe 60 percent fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 70 percent fat,</v>

3265
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:40.460
<v Speaker 2>and if you formulate the diet with </v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil and mct,</v>

3266
02:39:40.461 --> 02:39:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that'll get your ketones up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you consume,</v>

3267
02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:45.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these,</v>

3268
02:39:45.131 --> 02:39:50.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various products on the market that are </v>

3269
02:39:50.131 --> 02:39:50.131
<v Speaker 2>essentially medical foods or drinks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can drink,</v>

3270
02:39:50.131 --> 02:39:51.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stay in nutritional ketosis.</v>

3271
02:39:52.370 --> 02:39:53.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a struggle.</v>

3272
02:39:53.511 --> 02:39:54.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible,</v>

3273
02:39:54.471 --> 02:39:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's way much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much harder.</v>

3274
02:39:56.870 --> 02:40:01.870
<v Speaker 2>People do do it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they follow a vegan for ethical </v>

3275
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:03.260
<v Speaker 2>reasons or for a cultural reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been able to do it.</v>

3276
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:08.330
<v Speaker 2>But vegetarian is doable of vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very doable with eggs.</v>

3277
02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.600
<v Speaker 2>If you can use eggs and dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to minimize dairy in my diet but </v>

3278
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:15.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so eggs are huge.</v>

3279
02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:20.420
<v Speaker 2>So you minimize dairy because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect it has on you or like a lot of </v>

3280
02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:23.901
<v Speaker 2>dairy protein like way it kinda started </v>
<v Speaker 2>with whey protein and I drank it for </v>

3281
02:40:23.901 --> 02:40:26.070
<v Speaker 2>years and maybe I just built up an </v>
<v Speaker 2>allergy to it.</v>

3282
02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:31.190
<v Speaker 2>But if I were to drink like a full shake</v>
<v Speaker 2>of whey protein right now it would make </v>

3283
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:32.490
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't agree with nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3284
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:36.510
<v Speaker 2>although I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can eat butter and sour cream a fine,</v>

3285
02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:38.670
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of dairy proteins,</v>

3286
02:40:38.671 --> 02:40:43.671
<v Speaker 2>especially casing if I eat a sour cream </v>
<v Speaker 2>or cottage cheese.</v>

3287
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Cottage cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3288
02:40:46.291 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 2>So something about that can start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>irritate my gut a little bit.</v>

3289
02:40:49.861 --> 02:40:51.510
<v Speaker 2>So I generally just minimize it.</v>

3290
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I do like cheese is kind of a weakness </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

3291
02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:55.710
<v Speaker 2>So I might get a little bit of cheese </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and there,</v>

3292
02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:58.050
<v Speaker 2>like almost every day even when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

3293
02:40:58.110 --> 02:41:03.110
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know dairy really was the </v>

3294
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:07.280
<v Speaker 2>cornerstone of the cute agentic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the original ketogenic diet with </v>

3295
02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:11.041
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what johns hopkins was formulating </v>

3296
02:41:11.041 --> 02:41:11.041
<v Speaker 2>because it's been so easy and it tastes </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

3297
02:41:11.041 --> 02:41:11.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3298
02:41:11.041 --> 02:41:16.040
<v Speaker 2>but I do find that when people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>following the qj diet for weight loss </v>

3299
02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:19.170
<v Speaker 2>and they kind of pulled out the dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fat loss increases.</v>

3300
02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:21.930
<v Speaker 2>So I've observed that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdotally,</v>

3301
02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if people have studied it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they just,</v>

3302
02:41:24.601 --> 02:41:29.601
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull out the heavy cream and put in a </v>

3303
02:41:29.601 --> 02:41:31.800
<v Speaker 2>concentrated coconut milk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I use for my heavy cream,</v>

3304
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>which almost has a same cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like consistency and they take out the </v>

3305
02:41:37.291 --> 02:41:39.320
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe use more coconut oil and just kind</v>

3306
02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:44.380
<v Speaker 2>of switch out dairy for other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fat loss and something about dairy</v>

3307
02:41:45.631 --> 02:41:46.440
<v Speaker 2>in some people.</v>

3308
02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3309
02:41:48.270 --> 02:41:51.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe caused them to retain water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be like a mild allergan.</v>

3310
02:41:52.260 --> 02:41:57.260
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with it as long as I kind of </v>

3311
02:41:57.260 --> 02:41:57.480
<v Speaker 2>minimize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've just heard so many stories.</v>

3312
02:41:57.700 --> 02:41:58.610
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3313
02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:04.100
<v Speaker 2>there was a case report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now have a mother who had an autistic </v>

3314
02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:06.300
<v Speaker 2>child and put them on a ketogenic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and did remarkably well and then made it</v>

3315
02:42:06.390 --> 02:42:11.390
<v Speaker 2>dairy free and it was really the dairy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was contributing to some of the </v>

3316
02:42:11.390 --> 02:42:12.840
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

3317
02:42:12.841 --> 02:42:14.820
<v Speaker 2>and this went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is in the medical literature,</v>

3318
02:42:14.821 --> 02:42:19.821
<v Speaker 2>it's like on pub med,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she use a dairy free ketogenic diet and </v>

3319
02:42:19.821 --> 02:42:22.740
<v Speaker 2>had quote unquote remission in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>autistic child.</v>

3320
02:42:22.980 --> 02:42:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I firSt saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presented an abstract at a meeting and I</v>

3321
02:42:25.981 --> 02:42:26.650
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3322
02:42:26.651 --> 02:42:31.651
<v Speaker 2>It was really blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then about a year later it came out </v>

3323
02:42:31.651 --> 02:42:31.651
<v Speaker 2>and it was in a pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3324
02:42:31.651 --> 02:42:36.500
<v Speaker 2>pretty good journal as a peer reviewed </v>
<v Speaker 2>publication and pretty well documented </v>

3325
02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:39.990
<v Speaker 2>case report of putting an autistic child</v>
<v Speaker 2>into remission with acute junk dot.</v>

3326
02:42:40.170 --> 02:42:44.130
<v Speaker 2>so we talk about emerging applications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know my colleagues,</v>

3327
02:42:44.131 --> 02:42:49.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dr jiang roe and dr susan massino are </v>

3328
02:42:49.131 --> 02:42:49.710
<v Speaker 2>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned this because they get so</v>

3329
02:42:49.711 --> 02:42:52.380
<v Speaker 2>many emails about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ketogenetic diet for autism,</v>

3330
02:42:52.530 --> 02:42:55.520
<v Speaker 2>so I think many things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be the next frontier formation.</v>

3331
02:42:56.010 --> 02:42:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3332
02:42:56.730 --> 02:42:59.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be lending if diet,</v>

3333
02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:02.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduces inflammation and if diet without</v>

3334
02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:07.851
<v Speaker 2>dairy reduces inflammation further that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people are having some </v>

3335
02:43:07.851 --> 02:43:09.150
<v Speaker 2>great effects with cbd oils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

3336
02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 2>reduce inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something I'm very interested in.</v>

3337
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a nation.</v>

3338
02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:17.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a giant factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in negative health consequences.</v>

3339
02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Ketogenic diet plus a cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plus hyperbaric oxygen therapy plus </v>

3340
02:43:24.731 --> 02:43:29.731
<v Speaker 2>ketones supplementation is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wanted to study in a brain tumor </v>

3341
02:43:29.731 --> 02:43:29.731
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

3342
02:43:29.731 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I've just gotten too many emails from </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents that have kids with epilepsy and</v>

3343
02:43:33.761 --> 02:43:38.761
<v Speaker 2>also people who have cancer who use cbd </v>
<v Speaker 2>oil and they felt it was remarkably </v>

3344
02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:40.630
<v Speaker 2>effective for them.</v>

3345
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:41.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3346
02:43:42.010 --> 02:43:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I've talked with the ceo of charlotte's </v>
<v Speaker 2>web and other cbd right here.</v>

3347
02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never actually tried.</v>

3348
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Is that the charlotte?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their brand.</v>

3349
02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:57.340
<v Speaker 2>So is this a standardize for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of thc?</v>

3350
02:43:57.971 --> 02:44:00.790
<v Speaker 2>It's below a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is each batch and standardized.</v>

3351
02:44:00.890 --> 02:44:02.410
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get you high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you mean?</v>

3352
02:44:02.650 --> 02:44:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3353
02:44:03.281 --> 02:44:08.281
<v Speaker 2>So that was sort of the problem I tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is work with our university and </v>

3354
02:44:08.281 --> 02:44:12.931
<v Speaker 2>then I need a dea number and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the students had to have a d and it </v>

3355
02:44:13.050 --> 02:44:18.050
<v Speaker 2>became so much red tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to revisit this project </v>

3356
02:44:18.050 --> 02:44:20.480
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you reconnect with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to connect you if you like,</v>

3357
02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:24.100
<v Speaker 2>because they're actually a sponsor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast real and yeah,</v>

3358
02:44:24.101 --> 02:44:29.101
<v Speaker 2>they sent me a bunch of it and I tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out for awhile before I took them on </v>

3359
02:44:29.101 --> 02:44:29.101
<v Speaker 2>as a sponsor.</v>

3360
02:44:29.101 --> 02:44:29.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff's legit.</v>

3361
02:44:29.110 --> 02:44:30.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read up about it.</v>

3362
02:44:30.430 --> 02:44:30.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3363
02:44:30.871 --> 02:44:33.980
<v Speaker 2>they use the whole plant as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has all the canals,</v>

3364
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:35.290
<v Speaker 2>the other cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3365
02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Which I think is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3366
02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's companies that have patented the</v>

3367
02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 2>specific can have a dial on there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of,</v>

3368
02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I was going to use that and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of,</v>

3369
02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>da regulation even on that I think.</v>

3370
02:44:47.980 --> 02:44:48.660
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

3371
02:44:48.730 --> 02:44:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to revisit that project </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I really think,</v>

3372
02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:56.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the things that we do with the </v>

3373
02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:57.460
<v Speaker 2>diet and supplementation will synergize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3374
02:44:57.700 --> 02:45:01.900
<v Speaker 2>either be additive or synergistic with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cbd and I mean,</v>

3375
02:45:01.901 --> 02:45:06.901
<v Speaker 2>I love this idea of developing very </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful therapies that make the patient</v>

3376
02:45:07.211 --> 02:45:12.211
<v Speaker 2>come out more healthy or does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>cripple their immune system or their </v>

3377
02:45:12.211 --> 02:45:12.850
<v Speaker 2>general health when they come out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side,</v>

3378
02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:13.870
<v Speaker 2>especially with cancer.</v>

3379
02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:17.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely incredible that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have a more robust person.</v>

3380
02:45:17.730 --> 02:45:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therapy.</v>

3381
02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible.</v>

3382
02:45:20.860 --> 02:45:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So With cancer it is tricky,</v>

3383
02:45:22.541 --> 02:45:27.541
<v Speaker 2>like every person is different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get a robust like healthy </v>

3384
02:45:27.641 --> 02:45:32.641
<v Speaker 2>person to begin with and you can develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>a therapy that manages their tumor.</v>

3385
02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen very healthy per people </v>

3386
02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:39.670
<v Speaker 2>come out severely crippled after rounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of chemo.</v>

3387
02:45:39.671 --> 02:45:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people killed with chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3388
02:45:41.291 --> 02:45:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I know quite a few people actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly,</v>

3389
02:45:43.241 --> 02:45:45.910
<v Speaker 2>that have been killed literally by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard of care.</v>

3390
02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3391
02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:50.380
<v Speaker 2>you should really have my colleague on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

3392
02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:55.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a very dynamic speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit controversial in some ways,</v>

3393
02:45:55.841 --> 02:46:00.841
<v Speaker 2>but dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor thomas seyfried from boston </v>

3394
02:46:00.841 --> 02:46:03.481
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote the book cancer as a metabolic </v>

3395
02:46:03.481 --> 02:46:04.870
<v Speaker 2>disease and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fantastic book that,</v>

3396
02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elegantly documents the theory of cancer</v>

3397
02:46:10.671 --> 02:46:12.470
<v Speaker 2>as a metabolic disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3398
02:46:12.530 --> 02:46:13.610
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of hard data.</v>

3399
02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:19.180
<v Speaker 2>And travis christofferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book called tripping over the </v>

3400
02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:22.751
<v Speaker 2>truth and I wrote the foreword to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book which discusses a why we view </v>

3401
02:46:23.151 --> 02:46:28.151
<v Speaker 2>cancer as a genetic disease and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lays out the data and um,</v>

3402
02:46:29.690 --> 02:46:34.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the evidence to support cancer as a </v>

3403
02:46:34.690 --> 02:46:36.911
<v Speaker 2>metabolic disease and what we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>most importantly like what we can do </v>

3404
02:46:36.911 --> 02:46:40.271
<v Speaker 2>about that in regards and that has major</v>
<v Speaker 2>implications for not only how we treat </v>

3405
02:46:40.271 --> 02:46:40.910
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how we prevent cancer.</v>

3406
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.880
<v Speaker 2>so I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3407
02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:45.800
<v Speaker 2>fasting to purge your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have precancerous cells so it would fall</v>

3408
02:46:45.801 --> 02:46:50.801
<v Speaker 2>in line with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's really good hard data </v>

3409
02:46:50.801 --> 02:46:51.220
<v Speaker 2>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3410
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:55.730
<v Speaker 2>this idea that cancer is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not necessarily all cancers are,</v>

3411
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic and origin,</v>

3412
02:46:57.500 --> 02:46:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but a large majority of them appear to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

3413
02:46:59.870 --> 02:47:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the national cancer </v>

3414
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:05.720
<v Speaker 2>institute and other organizations are </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of this.</v>

3415
02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And now they're funding more grants that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually target cancer metabolism and </v>

3416
02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:13.940
<v Speaker 2>even developing metabolic therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinics for,</v>

3417
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>targeting tumor metabolism.</v>

3418
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:17.360
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was never,</v>

3419
02:47:17.361 --> 02:47:18.890
<v Speaker 2>this never happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3420
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:21.080
<v Speaker 2>a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years ago when I got into this,</v>

3421
02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:26.100
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of unheard of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of interest now in </v>

3422
02:47:26.100 --> 02:47:30.581
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these target molecules that inhibit </v>

3423
02:47:30.581 --> 02:47:33.350
<v Speaker 2>specific glycolytic sugar consuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways.</v>

3424
02:47:33.770 --> 02:47:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So as evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the [inaudible] diet is great,</v>

3425
02:47:35.961 --> 02:47:40.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it hits many pathways and </v>

3426
02:47:40.961 --> 02:47:42.320
<v Speaker 2>synergy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of my slides,</v>

3427
02:47:42.321 --> 02:47:47.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have and my conversation or a in </v>

3428
02:47:47.321 --> 02:47:50.501
<v Speaker 2>the presentations that I do is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows like it could see all the boxes </v>

3429
02:47:51.021 --> 02:47:56.021
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the key to drink diet and </v>

3430
02:47:56.021 --> 02:47:56.450
<v Speaker 2>these are all the different signaling </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways that is working through.</v>

3431
02:47:57.050 --> 02:48:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And I would say pharmaceutical companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>may put billions of dollars just into </v>

3432
02:48:02.050 --> 02:48:03.230
<v Speaker 2>one of those little boxes.</v>

3433
02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:05.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to genIc diet works.</v>

3434
02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:07.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so powerful because it's many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

3435
02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:10.020
<v Speaker 2>as many different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3436
02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:15.040
<v Speaker 2>signaling is many different pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of working in synergy for a common </v>

3437
02:48:15.111 --> 02:48:20.111
<v Speaker 2>output in this particular slide was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro pharmacological effect that it has</v>

3438
02:48:20.601 --> 02:48:23.450
<v Speaker 2>on suppressing seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anticonvulsant effect.</v>

3439
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3440
02:48:24.471 --> 02:48:29.471
<v Speaker 2>and each one of these is validated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of peer reviewed publications </v>

3441
02:48:29.471 --> 02:48:34.091
<v Speaker 2>that you can bring up on pub med.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like something some guy put </v>

3442
02:48:34.091 --> 02:48:37.091
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's published and it's like you </v>

3443
02:48:37.091 --> 02:48:37.091
<v Speaker 2>go to pub med o hdac activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3444
02:48:37.091 --> 02:48:41.681
<v Speaker 2>But you knew it was like a half dozen </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications to support each one of </v>

3445
02:48:41.681 --> 02:48:44.261
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's really exciting to me </v>

3446
02:48:44.261 --> 02:48:46.970
<v Speaker 2>because there's just so much to be kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of discovered and so many different </v>

3447
02:48:47.001 --> 02:48:49.730
<v Speaker 2>applications and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feeds back to nutrition,</v>

3448
02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:52.430
<v Speaker 2>which was like one of the main things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that motivated me,</v>

3449
02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:53.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early on in college.</v>

3450
02:48:53.930 --> 02:48:56.120
<v Speaker 2>So I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3451
02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:58.280
<v Speaker 2>go back to something I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate about,</v>

3452
02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:00.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's all fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man across the board.</v>

3453
02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thank you for sharing this man.</v>

3454

<v Speaker 2>been her for that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>project,</v>

<v Speaker 2>by curing literally quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 2>reversing type two diabetes,</v>

3497
02:50:54.330 --> 02:50:59.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in up to 100 million people in the next </v>

3498
02:50:59.330 --> 02:50:59.910
<v Speaker 2>decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really.</v>

3499
02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And I talked about people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarking on diet alone or the ketogenic</v>

3500
02:51:05.401 --> 02:51:09.180
<v Speaker 2>diet avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutrition is a way that allows people to</v>

3501
02:51:09.210 --> 02:51:12.240
<v Speaker 2>not only calculate their macros because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are horrible.</v>

3502
02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Calculating what they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has an algorithm in it that if </v>

3503
02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you put in body composition changes on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekly basis,</v>

3504
02:51:19.771 --> 02:51:21.420
<v Speaker 2>it will tell you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>ultimate goal.</v>

3506
02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:27.300

<v Speaker 2>there's another system like that.</v>

3507
02:51:27.301 --> 02:51:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like think of weightwatchers,</v>

3508
02:51:29.490 --> 02:51:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but like a version like five point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I really have to give.</v>

3521
02:52:07.810 --> 02:52:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I acknowledged the charlie foundation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my tedx talk and they were probably one </v>

3522
02:52:13.091 --> 02:52:18.091
<v Speaker 2>of the leading foundations that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced me and talking with hollywood </v>

3523
02:52:18.131 --> 02:52:20.140
<v Speaker 2>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jim abrams and,</v>

3524
02:52:20.141 --> 02:52:25.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really convinced me that the diet was </v>

3525
02:52:25.141 --> 02:52:25.141
<v Speaker 2>legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3526
02:52:25.141 --> 02:52:27.430
<v Speaker 2>outside of the peer reviewed papers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading and,</v>

3527
02:52:27.850 --> 02:52:32.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a movie by meryl streep </v>

<v Speaker 2>actually called first do no harm.</v>

3529
02:52:32.850 --> 02:52:37.470
<v Speaker 2>So meryl streep did a movie on the </v>
