00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of you.</v>

9
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

10
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Really excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too.</v>

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Little bit nervous in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

12
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>but pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty jazzed.</v>

13
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to be nervous about </v>

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we would like to talk about is why </v>

16
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>don't you explain it?</v>

17
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and heather and I have been on an </v>

19
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 2>interesting adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are evolutionary biologists.</v>

20
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:50.691
<v Speaker 2>We trained with some of the finest </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biologists of the 20th </v>

21
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 2>century and we have been teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We taught for habitat for 15 years.</v>

22
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 2>I taught for 14 years at Evergreen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we spent a lot of time,</v>

23
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with students and trying to help</v>

24
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:06.201
<v Speaker 2>them see how clarifying and evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint is with respect to </v>

25
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>understanding what a human being is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we functioned and how we interact.</v>

26
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.801
<v Speaker 2>And that was very enjoyable to us and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was very empowering to students to </v>

27
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:21.231
<v Speaker 2>discover that there was actually a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of removing a lot of the confusion of </v>

28
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:25.041
<v Speaker 2>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person and we're now watching the </v>

29
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 2>conversation out in civilization about </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex and gender devolve into an </v>

30
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:34.581
<v Speaker 2>absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the one hand that's kind of </v>

31
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:34.581
<v Speaker 2>frightening.</v>

32
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

33
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not directly an issue were happily </v>

34
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we're not having to navigate</v>

35
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>romance out in the world these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our kids are too young to be </v>

36
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.651
<v Speaker 2>navigating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet maybe this will all be clarified by </v>

37
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:55.131
<v Speaker 2>the time they're involved in dating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also have a tremendous number of </v>

38
00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>millennial friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former students who are trying to </v>

39
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.041
<v Speaker 2>navigate this stuff and finding it </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult and bewildering to hear a </v>

40
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 2>conversation that frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

41
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 2>a much better alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If one can stand to think in </v>

42
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can really look at ourselves as we</v>

43
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:19.341
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we came to be through evolutionary </v>

44
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 2>forces than actually we can improve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape for romance and dating a great</v>

45
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't do it if we're committed to</v>

46
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 2>very simple truisms that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>

47
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

48
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>is disturbing both of you most about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on right now?</v>

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd love to see a third way.</v>

50
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>So they're the pre moderns as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have very traditionalist conservative </v>

51
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 1>that sucker up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close to say that.</v>

52
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The premodern.</v>

54
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>So you have a very traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative approach to gender roles,</v>

55
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>to sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to relationship.</v>

56
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of us</v>

57
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 3>in the modern world who would reject a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of that.</v>

58
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 3>And then there are the postmoderns who </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to throw out everything.</v>

59
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to throw out everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution handed us.</v>

60
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 3>And in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend that it didn't happen,</v>

61
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretend that it's not even based on </v>

62
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 3>reality and there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a third way and you know,</v>

63
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe we need to call it modern as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to pre or postmodern,</v>

64
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.410
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

65
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a third way to navigate what </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary is,</v>

66
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 3>what evolution has given us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we can change,</v>

67
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 3>what we can't change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how to actually recover some of,</v>

68
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sexiness and sex and the love and </v>

69
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 3>love and the romance and romance and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

70
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.030
<v Speaker 3>understand that human beings are what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>are from not just 100 years back,</v>

71
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 3>but a thousand and $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 million years back.</v>

72
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 3>We've had sex</v>

73
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>since you both taught at a university </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

74
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been around these students and </v>

75
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.131
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen this sort of postmodernist </v>

76
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>movement gained steam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

77
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is the cause of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

78
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:07.171
<v Speaker 1>What is the reason why people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>projecting this sort of distorted idea?</v>

79
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:13.141
<v Speaker 1>That there's no differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women and that all the differences </v>

80
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>in the genders are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all propaganda or cultural or.</v>

81
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 2>So I think it actually arises from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively simple cause that we all </v>

82
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 2>detect there's something not right about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've been taught.</v>

83
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>We detect there's something not right </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the way civilization is </v>

84
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.251
<v Speaker 2>structured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can tell that there's nobody really </v>

85
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:38.041
<v Speaker 2>at the helm and you have a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are faced with some issue that to </v>

86
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:43.771
<v Speaker 2>them is incredibly glaring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that just absolutely needs to </v>

87
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they do is they look at that</v>

88
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 2>issue and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would we have to,</v>

89
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 2>what would we have to say in order for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that issue to be fully addressed?</v>

90
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is that we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a complex system and if you </v>

91
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.471
<v Speaker 2>optimize for any one solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cause a catastrophe across all of </v>

92
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 2>the other things that it's connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not focused on those </v>

93
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:10.231
<v Speaker 2>unintended consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend not to understand why people </v>

94
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 2>are resistant to your solution.</v>

95
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.990
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's deal with the transgender issue </v>

96
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 2>for the transgender community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

97
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 2>this is not a monolith community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually know quite a number of people</v>

98
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 2>within it who have a heterodox position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in general,</v>

99
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense that it is disrespectful</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to simply recognize anybody who has </v>

100
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:37.831
<v Speaker 2>decided to transition as a full fledged </v>
<v Speaker 2>member of the sex to which they have </v>

101
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 2>moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems right.</v>

102
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 2>And if you are focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

103
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 2>the humanitarian side of the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it even is right?</v>

104
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.500
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is if you say a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who identifies as a particular sex is </v>

105
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.490
<v Speaker 2>that sex suddenly you've actually caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole bunch of consequences that you </v>

106
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:03.930
<v Speaker 2>weren't thinking of over in a biology </v>
<v Speaker 2>class over a,</v>

107
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>in the prison system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

108
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.050
<v Speaker 2>is it true that somebody who says that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are female gets to go to a women's </v>

109
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>prison?</v>

110
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to put a violent sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>offenders in a women's prison because </v>

111
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.701
<v Speaker 2>they declare themselves to be female?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not tracking the consequences that </v>

112
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:27.821
<v Speaker 2>were not in your view when you decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a particular solution is the reason </v>

113
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:32.351
<v Speaker 2>that so many people have signed up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these really absurd notions.</v>

114
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And part of what I hope we will get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>today is that there is a,</v>

115
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>a principal at the core of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>all complex adaptive systems.</v>

116
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And it is diminishing returns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminishing returns sounds kind of </v>

117
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 2>arcane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

118
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 2>it has to close in association with </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics where it was first outlined.</v>

119
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.980
<v Speaker 2>But the message of diminishing returns </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you can very often get 90 </v>

120
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:06.131
<v Speaker 2>percent of a solution that you want and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not disrupt other things unduly.</v>

121
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a hundred percent of the solution</v>

122
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>to this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll cause a catastrophe.</v>

123
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.720
<v Speaker 2>So getting people to realize don't shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Utopia in which the problem </v>

124
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about is 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved.</v>

125
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>If you can accept a 90 percent solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can have a whole bunch of other</v>

126
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 2>things that you don't even realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using</v>

127
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.390
<v Speaker 1>in defense of people that would try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go for 100 percent though,</v>

128
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.730
<v Speaker 1>isn't it one of those things where like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

129
00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>if you would negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would.</v>

130
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.870
<v Speaker 1>If you want $100 you asked for 150.</v>

131
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

132
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:42.601
<v Speaker 2>I think you're identifying something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct that in part the positions that </v>

133
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.111
<v Speaker 2>we hear being deployed are not an honest</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection of the beliefs of many of the</v>

134
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 2>people who are espousing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a negotiating tactic,</v>

135
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.850
<v Speaker 2>but we can't do that with biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't negotiate with biology.</v>

136
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Biology is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we can talk about which parts </v>

137
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.360
<v Speaker 2>of it are amenable to being changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as heather pointed out,</v>

138
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:09.361
<v Speaker 2>we're not advocating for a return to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some traditional way of interacting </v>

139
00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 2>between the sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're advocating for,</v>

140
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enlightened way that takes advantage </v>

141
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.831
<v Speaker 2>of the freedom that we have that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors didn't and tries to navigate </v>

142
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>the hazards that were stuck with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't,</v>

143
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.110
<v Speaker 2>you can't negotiate with biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're really ought to listen to what it</v>

144
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 2>is that nature is telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then say,</v>

145
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:32.350
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that leave open?</v>

146
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Where can we shift things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to require that,</v>

147
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:40.900
<v Speaker 2>we lie about what's true biologically in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to navigate to a solution,</v>

148
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it will be unstable in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

149
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The site guys to speak gun to include </v>

150
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 1>such nonsense as chromosomes exist on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuum.</v>

151
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their x chromosomes and there a y </v>

152
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.400
<v Speaker 1>chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard that one.</v>

153
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>One of our children just heard that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

154
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>what did they mean by on a continuum?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who even knows?</v>

155
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they meant anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they intended to do was </v>

156
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>carve out freedom from a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

157
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and so if you say chromosomes are on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuum,</v>

158
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.260
<v Speaker 1>then it's very hard to disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it doesn't mean anything </v>

159
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.430
<v Speaker 1>that we can say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually really easy to disagree </v>

160
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.430
<v Speaker 1>with it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

161
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gametes aren't on a continuum.</v>

162
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm and eggs are eggs.</v>

163
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discreet to have them.</v>

164
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chromosomes also not on a continuum,</v>

165
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>at least in mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex,</v>

166
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a continuum.</v>

167
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>They're Intersex is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's strongly by model,</v>

168
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are males and females and there </v>

170
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>are a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rare,</v>

171
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.411
<v Speaker 1>but real that there are intermediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenotypes and gender is even more of a </v>

172
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still strongly by modal.</v>

173
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Have you folks heard about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New crayfish that they're battling in </v>

174
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.061
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant crayfish in Europe </v>

175
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>that's female and female only and </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is a clone.</v>

176
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reproduced by cloning so they don't</v>

177
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:01.970
<v Speaker 1>need a male partner and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and there's a lot of them.</v>

178
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:07.030
<v Speaker 1>For your first two sentences there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like there was a giant </v>

179
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 1>sending on Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a female.</v>

180
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Speaker 1>She's mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's tired.</v>

181
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.650
<v Speaker 1>All these lobster dinners and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work for a while.</v>

182
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like asexuality is actually evolved </v>

183
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>in a few lineages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few vertebrate lenses.</v>

184
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>There's some lizards that are asexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all females and it goes great </v>

185
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>until the environment changes because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're cloning yourself,</v>

186
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children are going to experience </v>

187
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>exactly are going to be exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you were.</v>

188
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 1>So if you were a good fit for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

189
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.080
<v Speaker 1>the next environment better be the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>or else your kids aren't going to be a </v>

190
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>good fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my feeling is that crayfish,</v>

191
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:47.571
<v Speaker 1>I haven't followed the story a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that crayfish is going to do </v>

192
00:10:47.571 --> 00:10:50.391
<v Speaker 1>terrifically moving into exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscapes that it first mutated into </v>

193
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 1>existence in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you change the landscape of bed,</v>

194
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna stop doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they just farm it for food if</v>

195
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>it's tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

196
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>no worry about them breathing and get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of home together.</v>

197
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Crayfish are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are delicious.</v>

198
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a good tasting variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's free food.</v>

199
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

200
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.580
<v Speaker 1>So heather and I were talking before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast started about over,</v>

201
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I think a very important point when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to a lot of these,</v>

202
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:20.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either progressive or right wing issues </v>

203
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>is that people tend to be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal and what they're really concerned</v>

204
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 1>with is winning.</v>

205
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a competition of US versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

206
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.120
<v Speaker 1>It becomes our side versus their side </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tend to exploit weaknesses and </v>

207
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.741
<v Speaker 1>then attack to score points and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas of being honest intellectually or </v>

208
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>looking at things objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of go out the window.</v>

209
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:47.541
<v Speaker 1>You ignore facts that diminished your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position or your team's position and </v>

210
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>highlight things even if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

211
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>That would diminish the other side's </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

212
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.810
<v Speaker 1>This is a real problem that humans have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with arguments with,</v>

213
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>with being tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with being on different sides.</v>

214
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see it,</v>

215
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:06.061
<v Speaker 1>we forget about tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see with people where when there's a </v>

216
00:12:06.061 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>certain time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see people arguing,</v>

217
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain point where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument has deteriorated to a </v>

218
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>competition and it's no longer about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're actually discussing.</v>

219
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It's about who can win sciences for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

220
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is</v>

221
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 2>science ought to be indifferent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's done well,</v>

222
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 2>it is indifferent to who's the stronger </v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

223
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:28.171
<v Speaker 2>It should really just tell you what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true and in fact the reason to use </v>

224
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:31.981
<v Speaker 2>sciences to correct for biases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so eric and heather and I have a </v>

225
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 2>phrase that is just shorthand for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something which is bad.</v>

226
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:44.641
<v Speaker 2>Faith changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot you can do in discussion </v>

227
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.650
<v Speaker 2>with people with whom you disagree as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as you are on the same page to a </v>

228
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:54.901
<v Speaker 2>large extent and what you're describing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what happens when that system breaks </v>

229
00:12:55.031 --> 00:13:00.031
<v Speaker 2>down and people perceive themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>needing to win against the enemy rather </v>

230
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:04.651
<v Speaker 2>than on a team that is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate to what is true or what is the </v>

231
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:09.751
<v Speaker 2>most desirable outcome with respect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>values that we all share or something </v>

232
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:14.671
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're describing is a very </v>

233
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 2>common state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a lower,</v>

234
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:20.551
<v Speaker 2>less capable state than a good faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where people who may </v>

235
00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:24.811
<v Speaker 2>disagree intensely agree on the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and the desirability of figuring </v>

236
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:29.071
<v Speaker 2>out what's true and so maybe that's part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we can do here is try to point </v>

237
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.240
<v Speaker 2>to where the good faith conversation can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to that.</v>

238
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:38.150
<v Speaker 2>The bad faith conversation is incapable </v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting to the value really daily.</v>

239
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a giant point.</v>

240
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's A.</v>

241
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's really something that I would </v>

242
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:46.760
<v Speaker 1>hope more people would adopt going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

243
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.590
<v Speaker 1>stop connecting yourself to these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just let these ideas exist on their </v>

244
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:56.040
<v Speaker 1>own and they examined them objectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rely on science.</v>

245
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Rely on actual science to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

246
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.700
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

247
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.730
<v Speaker 1>when I say science is the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

248
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily that we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept.</v>

249
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 1>No one should accept the findings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science just at face value,</v>

250
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.850
<v Speaker 1>but a scientific approach is I've gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea what would have to be true if </v>

251
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:22.101
<v Speaker 1>that were true and how can I possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove it wrong and you work harder and </v>

252
00:14:22.101 --> 00:14:26.571
<v Speaker 1>harder and harder to prove it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't then you have greater </v>

253
00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:28.620
<v Speaker 1>and greater and greater confidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's right and so this,</v>

254
00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:33.621
<v Speaker 1>this is what we don't say in bad faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arguments is no one is trying to prove </v>

255
00:14:33.621 --> 00:14:37.431
<v Speaker 1>themselves wrong and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that sounds backwards the first </v>

256
00:14:37.431 --> 00:14:40.791
<v Speaker 1>time you hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you try to actually demonstrate </v>

257
00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:42.540
<v Speaker 1>that your own cherished beliefs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you can't do it,</v>

258
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you have pretty good confidence at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of that and there is no actual end,</v>

259
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>but the longer you've gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have pretty good confidence that </v>

260
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm probably seeing real here.</v>

261
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I've asked myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked,</v>

262
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.180
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have asked my enemies,</v>

263
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 2>is this thing right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

264
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 2>in an actual formal scientific setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do an experiment,</v>

265
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you run the data and you do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis,</v>

266
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 2>but is it right or is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if I can prove it's not.</v>

267
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Even though I really think it is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good test,</v>

268
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.860
<v Speaker 2>you get a bonus that comes with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is don't know what else to say.</v>

269
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.740
<v Speaker 2>It's super awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is if you've tried to take your </v>

270
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 2>cherished ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some hypothesis that you've come up with</v>

271
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.100
<v Speaker 2>and you've tried 16 different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that it's wrong and you keep </v>

272
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.520
<v Speaker 2>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well every one of those things you did </v>

273
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 2>to see whether what you thought was true</v>
<v Speaker 2>was actually false.</v>

274
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Now prepares you when somebody now </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges you and they say,</v>

275
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you haven't thought of this.</v>

276
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Well you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have been through it 16 different </v>

277
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.881
<v Speaker 2>ways and that gives you the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate almost anything that's thrown </v>

278
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:51.251
<v Speaker 2>at you because you have taken on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>role of being your own harshest critic </v>

279
00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:55.991
<v Speaker 2>in order to make sure that what's left </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of that process is really </v>

280
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:59.441
<v Speaker 2>robust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that I want to insert </v>

281
00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:03.611
<v Speaker 2>here is that I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be put in the position </v>

282
00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:07.841
<v Speaker 2>of defending everything that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>published in the scientific literature </v>

283
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 2>is true because it looks like science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it isn't.</v>

284
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what's published in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific literature is not valid.</v>

285
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.220
<v Speaker 2>The methodology does not establish what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people claim it does and that's a big </v>

286
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.671
<v Speaker 2>hazard for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people like heather and myself </v>

287
00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 2>because you have to sort the wheat from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chaff in order to figure out what to</v>

288
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.290
<v Speaker 2>defend and what to be agnostic about.</v>

289
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think those of us who more or </v>

290
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.851
<v Speaker 2>less get the story of what let's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>human sexuality is about at a scientific</v>

291
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 2>level and there's still a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery,</v>

292
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:40.811
<v Speaker 2>but there's an awful lot that those of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us who have studied it are in agreement </v>

293
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 2>about and civilization is not yet on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same page with those of us who have </v>

294
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.330
<v Speaker 2>looked at it scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing we have failed to do,</v>

295
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:52.331
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to articulate what you will get in </v>

296
00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:56.561
<v Speaker 2>exchange for signing up for a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

297
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.810
<v Speaker 2>On this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do not realize that a scientific </v>

298
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.931
<v Speaker 2>worldview is actually the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowers you to navigate your own love </v>

299
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 2>life in an intelligent way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will let you.</v>

300
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more fun than it sounds when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say it that way.</v>

301
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

302
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all of these famous arguments about </v>

303
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 2>unweaving the rainbow or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody challenged fineman that,</v>

304
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

305
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 2>he was the kind of guy who would take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of flour and destroy its beauty in </v>

306
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.240
<v Speaker 2>order to figure out how it worked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trip science will destroy beauty.</v>

307
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not true.</v>

308
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

309
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 2>You will get a lot of value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will waste less of your time on </v>

310
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 2>people that you shouldn't be interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

311
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Speaker 2>If you understand what game they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>

312
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:45.161
<v Speaker 2>even if they don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that arguments coming </v>

313
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:47.651
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The argument that science would destroy </v>

314
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:47.651
<v Speaker 2>beauty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

315
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a way in which the hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the borrower chemical analogy here,</v>

316
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:58.101
<v Speaker 2>but there's something called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>activation energy of a chemical </v>

317
00:17:58.101 --> 00:18:01.161
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the energy necessary to get it </v>

318
00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:03.711
<v Speaker 2>to happen and the activation energy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding your own self,</v>

319
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.090
<v Speaker 2>your sexual self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even as a product of evolution that is </v>

320
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:16.581
<v Speaker 2>wired in a particular way for particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectives that may or not be relevant </v>

321
00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:20.541
<v Speaker 2>to your conscious person's objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that takes a little bit.</v>

322
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

323
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.560
<v Speaker 2>if we were teaching a class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might take three or four weeks full </v>

324
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 2>time with one set of students before </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who had walked through the door,</v>

325
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 2>not thinking in those terms at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

326
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own love life could begin to spot </v>

327
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.040
<v Speaker 2>how this actually maps onto what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have experienced and what it suggests </v>

328
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 2>they might do differently.</v>

329
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So I think the answer to your question </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's not cheap to get through the </v>

330
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the end.</v>

331
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.620
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What advise you is so valuable compared </v>

332
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.100
<v Speaker 2>to what it costs you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn it.</v>

333
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.460
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't come immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you know an aphorism that </v>

334
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you can adopt and suddenly your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions,</v>

335
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 2>so let's start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

336
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.040
<v Speaker 2>but it begins to do as people start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize the power of an evolutionary </v>

337
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.751
<v Speaker 2>take on sex and gender or whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about is it opens up doors</v>

338
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:23.631
<v Speaker 2>to inquiry and it makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It allows people to make sense of their </v>

339
00:19:23.631 --> 00:19:26.061
<v Speaker 2>lives and then it becomes more beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more powerful and once people have </v>

340
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:32.421
<v Speaker 2>seen how you can use these evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools and the knowledge that evolution </v>

341
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:37.071
<v Speaker 2>that evolution has given us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like male and female are universals like</v>

342
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.140
<v Speaker 2>male and female have existed for over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred million years and everywhere it </v>

343
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 2>shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks really similar and yes,</v>

344
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 2>there are exceptions all over the place.</v>

345
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:52.070
<v Speaker 2>There's amazing ways that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this crayfish that you have a </v>

346
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.810
<v Speaker 2>sexually reproducing ancestor that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten asexual or you have six full </v>

347
00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.741
<v Speaker 2>reversal in some species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have Gina's which have a very </v>

348
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.280
<v Speaker 2>strange system going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots and lots of these exceptions,</v>

349
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 2>but the truth underlying them is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same and that's freeing.</v>

350
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.530
<v Speaker 2>So actually that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we try it with the crayfish here?</v>

351
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so looking at this system,</v>

352
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you've got a creature that is capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>going asexual and then spreading very </v>

353
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.701
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have lots of examples of creatures </v>

354
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:22.701
<v Speaker 2>that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

355
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:22.701
<v Speaker 2>Like so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

356
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Dandelions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dandelions look like a regular old </v>

357
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.051
<v Speaker 2>flour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not a dandy lion are what's </v>

358
00:20:30.051 --> 00:20:32.781
<v Speaker 2>called Apa mechanic and an academic Dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>means that they go through my tosas </v>

359
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.420
<v Speaker 2>instead of Meiosis and they produce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seed that isn't the product of sex and </v>

360
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 2>that seed dispersers as if it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>product of sex,</v>

361
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:43.660
<v Speaker 2>and so this does something for </v>
<v Speaker 2>dandelions.</v>

362
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:48.770
<v Speaker 2>It allows them to take over a landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>from one individual because it can just </v>

363
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 2>spread and spread and spread without </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to find mates.</v>

364
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:56.671
<v Speaker 2>It's very effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we see in systems like heather </v>

365
00:20:56.671 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>mentioned whiptail Lizard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whiptail lizards,</v>

366
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 2>some populations are asexual and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really cool system.</v>

367
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:08.701
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Jamie wants to bring up </v>

368
00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 2>a picture of a whip tail lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the asexual populations,</v>

369
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 2>females can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they cloned themselves,</v>

370
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more or less.</v>

371
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they.</v>

372
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.200
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason we're talking about that is </v>

373
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.200
<v Speaker 2>they're two different ways they could go</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

374
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.240
<v Speaker 2>they could make two gametes and fuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

375
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 2>or they can clone themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're effectively.</v>

376
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

377
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 2>you look at that system and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

378
00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 2>how can a population abandoned sex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to tolerate change?</v>

379
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to do one thing,</v>

380
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 2>which is it has to have some place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>borrow genetic variation from.</v>

381
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.190
<v Speaker 2>So we see some very curious behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and these whips,</v>

382
00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 2>males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females,</v>

383
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 2>mount each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically you have,</v>

384
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.720
<v Speaker 2>you have females who stimulate each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other to produce eggs that are not the </v>

385
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 2>product of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

386
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:02.731
<v Speaker 2>So they retain sexual behavior and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the student population and whether </v>

387
00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:07.441
<v Speaker 2>they're playing the female role or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>male role in the seed of copulation </v>

388
00:22:07.441 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 2>depends on their status in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambulatory cycle.</v>

389
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 2>But the kicker is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

390
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heather and I were actually teaching </v>

391
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.391
<v Speaker 2>from this and trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system could possibly be stable </v>

392
00:22:21.391 --> 00:22:24.271
<v Speaker 2>longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we predicted actually was that </v>

393
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:24.271
<v Speaker 2>they had to be borrowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

394
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:26.200
<v Speaker 2>genetic variation periodically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

395
00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

396
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 2>how do they borrow genetic variation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

397
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:34.410
<v Speaker 2>the populations at the edge of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>clonal populations are sexual and so and</v>

398
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 2>so in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what everyone's hoping for.</v>

399
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Some people are hoping for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one way.</v>

400
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 2>But then we've got another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

401
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure your audience isn't thrilled to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be talking about lizards necessarily,</v>

402
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aphids,</v>

403
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.850
<v Speaker 2>aphids are asexual will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they get away with being asexual?</v>

404
00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.860
<v Speaker 2>That seems like it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything we know about sex being so </v>

405
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 2>valuable because of its role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing genetic variation.</v>

406
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the aphids doing?</v>

407
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aphids or sexual once a season.</v>

408
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're asexual within the season and</v>

409
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the season they breed </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually.</v>

410
00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:18.301
<v Speaker 2>And so the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these exceptions are exceptions </v>

411
00:23:18.301 --> 00:23:22.231
<v Speaker 2>that prove the rule that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universality of sex in a complex </v>

412
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.980
<v Speaker 2>animals is I'm broken in certain cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but each case that it's broken has a way</v>

413
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:33.500
<v Speaker 2>of recovering the value of sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then go back to lizards referred one</v>

414
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 2>more lizard example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Komodo dragons,</v>

415
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 2>which at the biggest monitor lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's evidence from,</v>

416
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just as soon as a that </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally there's virgin birth,</v>

417
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally females can produce young </v>

418
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>without</v>

419
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.280
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so occasionally individuals will go a </v>

420
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.280
<v Speaker 3>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which right.</v>

421
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Something that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

422
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare.</v>

423
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Invertebrates at all and where it does </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

424
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 3>it tends to be lizards and it's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty rare as far as we know,</v>

425
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:04.421
<v Speaker 3>but really for the most part it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would only be in zoos that we would </v>

426
00:24:04.421 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 3>know for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

427
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.870
<v Speaker 3>The hypothesis is that this is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptation for than these two.</v>

428
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Speaker 3>These are big swimming lizards that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>living on these islands.</v>

429
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 3>They're relatively close together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can swim between these islands that</v>

430
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:22.901
<v Speaker 3>having arrived at an island where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's none of none else that looks </v>

431
00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:27.221
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably makes sense to clone </v>

432
00:24:27.221 --> 00:24:29.711
<v Speaker 3>yourself at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually I think they're not clone </v>

433
00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:29.711
<v Speaker 3>all their parthenogenetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

434
00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:30.390
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

435
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>if it requires two individuals to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that swim successfully,</v>

436
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.340
<v Speaker 3>in order to populate a new island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chances are much lower than if it </v>

437
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.911
<v Speaker 3>just takes one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you can get sex switched on and </v>

438
00:24:42.911 --> 00:24:43.280
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in Komodo dragons,</v>

439
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.860
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't.</v>

440
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Think about how many times one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals must have crossed one of these </v>

441
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:57.030
<v Speaker 2>water barriers and been alone and where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it had an island that it was perfectly </v>

442
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.830
<v Speaker 2>ecologically capable of exploiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had no way of making offspring,</v>

443
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible price to pay.</v>

444
00:25:01.811 --> 00:25:04.150
<v Speaker 2>In Darwinian terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the solution is,</v>

445
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's suspend the requirement of sex for</v>

446
00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:08.890
<v Speaker 2>a generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce some offspring,</v>

447
00:25:08.891 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 2>and then we can reinstate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so really more than likely,</v>

448
00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:18.061
<v Speaker 2>this happens a lot more than we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because we assume that sex is the </v>

449
00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:19.120
<v Speaker 2>explanation for vertebrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we see them,</v>

450
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.540
<v Speaker 2>when we encounter them in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't think is this individual the </v>

451
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.750
<v Speaker 2>result of a clonal event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this individual,</v>

452
00:25:25.751 --> 00:25:30.751
<v Speaker 2>the result of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we assume sex and it's only when </v>

453
00:25:30.751 --> 00:25:33.751
<v Speaker 2>somebody puts them in a zoo in isolation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can be 100 percent certain.</v>

454
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.900
<v Speaker 2>There is no way this animal got </v>
<v Speaker 2>fertilized by another animal and that's </v>

455
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.620
<v Speaker 2>when we start asking the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now that we've started to spot these</v>

456
00:25:41.621 --> 00:25:46.621
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see them more and more </v>

457
00:25:46.621 --> 00:25:48.430
<v Speaker 2>frequently because so many animals over </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history have been caught in</v>

458
00:25:48.431 --> 00:25:53.431
<v Speaker 2>a situation that was paradise except for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there wasn't a second one </v>

459
00:25:53.431 --> 00:25:57.780
<v Speaker 2>that is incredibly fascinating though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can just switch on and off like </v>

460
00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When and if you think about it,</v>

461
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor lizards are interesting because </v>

462
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.710
<v Speaker 2>they are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

463
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.350
<v Speaker 2>the people say they are Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the most mammal like</v>

464
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.480
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of lizards that live over poor people </v>

465
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:13.480
<v Speaker 3>who are combined are listed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can look inTo their eyes and it's</v>

466
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 3>a little bit like looking into a dog's </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>

467
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.540
<v Speaker 3>They've been paying attention too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>to lizards.</v>

468
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Crazy things I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

469
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:25.210
<v Speaker 3>Most lizards do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these animals that give you a </v>

470
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:25.210
<v Speaker 3>different impression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

471
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:25.210
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

472
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 3>But more than geckos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than lip tells more than maybe just</v>

473
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.530
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

474
00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:31.120
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

475
00:26:31.121 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 3>they're big and long living with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>information out of that big eyeball.</v>

476
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a little monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lizards don't.</v>

477
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.700
<v Speaker 3>People said the same thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>little ones,</v>

478
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.980
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

479
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.320
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what triggered this switch?</v>

480
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Profound loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

481
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Profound loneliness would would cause it</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

482
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.630
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to say whether any </v>
<v Speaker 2>lizards including monitors have </v>

483
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.020
<v Speaker 2>something like loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although in other cases,</v>

484
00:26:59.021 --> 00:27:04.021
<v Speaker 2>you know when we look at elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see clear evidence of grief and we </v>

485
00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:08.571
<v Speaker 2>know that elephants didn't get grief </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a shared ancestor with us that had </v>

486
00:27:08.571 --> 00:27:12.500
<v Speaker 2>grief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They separately evolved grief because </v>

487
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 2>they're complex social structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>required for the same reason that ours </v>

488
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not impossible.</v>

489
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>That loneliness might not feel exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same to a monitor lizard,</v>

490
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:25.791
<v Speaker 2>but if it had a value to detect how </v>
<v Speaker 2>lonely you are and then to trigger a </v>

491
00:27:25.791 --> 00:27:29.961
<v Speaker 2>physiological response that they're than</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickstarted the ability to be </v>

492
00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily successful that we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

493
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.680
<v Speaker 2>We would see that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would love to see somebody try to </v>

494
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.131
<v Speaker 2>figure out whether there was a cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger that looked like loneliness in </v>

495
00:27:40.131 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 2>monitor lizards that actually caused the</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch and if you could then maybe </v>

496
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 2>trigger it.</v>

497
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like some something that you could </v>

498
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 2>actually map and an mri or something on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>

499
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 2>like you look at their little brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see loneliness.</v>

500
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you hit,</v>

501
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>it hits a certain frequency and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs starts forming something.</v>

502
00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 2>there would be some cascade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

504
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:06.711
<v Speaker 2>there'd be some perception that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen another one like being a </v>

505
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:08.670
<v Speaker 2>very long time and then it would cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a shift in behavior.</v>

506
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it would coSt searching behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>and searching wouldn't let any evidence.</v>

507
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:13.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:18.431
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily have to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>another individual to know that they're </v>

509
00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:18.431
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

510
00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 2>there'll be some cascade of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe some,</v>

511
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a neurotransmitter would trigger the </v>

512
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.720
<v Speaker 2>release of a hormone that would call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would clearly be limited to females</v>

513
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I don't go ahead because the </v>

514
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.071
<v Speaker 3>egg can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has all the cytoplasmic material </v>

515
00:28:37.071 --> 00:28:37.860
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary to make another cell and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sperm doesn't.</v>

516
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

517
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.910
<v Speaker 3>sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sperm and egg are just different and </v>

518
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 3>eggs can't move and so they're stuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they are.</v>

519
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:49.941
<v Speaker 3>They have to be found a and m,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have all the cytoplasm and </v>

520
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:54.741
<v Speaker 3>sperm really fast but doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the material necessary to make a </v>

521
00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:57.920
<v Speaker 3>sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a sperm can't mature into a zygote on</v>

522
00:28:57.921 --> 00:29:00.190
<v Speaker 3>fertilized because it doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria and replacement,</v>

523
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.770
<v Speaker 3>particularly among all the other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a cell.</v>

524
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 3>So they're doing different things just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like male and female are different </v>

525
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 3>strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egg and sperm are different strategies.</v>

526
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.481
<v Speaker 3>So there are certain animals or certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that can switch sexes?</v>

527
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

528
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Which also which organisms can do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>while there's lots of refinish would be </v>

529
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.960
<v Speaker 3>a big cluster of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about ocean fish or their </v>

530
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.930
<v Speaker 3>land creatures that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one frog where there's a little </v>

531
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:31.341
<v Speaker 3>bit of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems that it may be an artifact </v>

532
00:29:31.341 --> 00:29:31.341
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a zoo setting effectively,</v>

533
00:29:31.341 --> 00:29:33.420
<v Speaker 3>which might mean that it can happen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild and we just haven't seen it,</v>

534
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:35.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's well known in reef fish like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

535
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:38.720
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of species of reef fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

536
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 3>that and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it goes both ways.</v>

537
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 3>So this is called a</v>

538
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.270
<v Speaker 2>sequential hermaphroditism were a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some species there.</v>

539
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's born female and then some </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition into males.</v>

540
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And in some it's the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You transitioned from male to female.</v>

541
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:56.221
<v Speaker 2>There's some spaces where you can go </v>
<v Speaker 2>both ways and it depends on the sex </v>

542
00:29:56.221 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 2>ratio around you and sort of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies there aren't enough of.</v>

543
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>So male and female are strategies and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are the most dominant female in a </v>

544
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:09.901
<v Speaker 2>landscape and the mail just died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense to turn into a male so </v>

545
00:30:09.901 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 2>that you can now fertilize all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>females.</v>

546
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 2>But they're also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the sequential,</v>

547
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're one individual will transition </v>

548
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.660
<v Speaker 2>between sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are also cases like turtles </v>

549
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.220
<v Speaker 2>where there's no chromosomal sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination and the sex is effectively</v>

550
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.340
<v Speaker 2>chosen by the environmental conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by temperature in the nest,</v>

551
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:33.670
<v Speaker 2>and so one individual lives its entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>life within a sex,</v>

552
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 2>but that sex was not dictated when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>egg was laid,</v>

553
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it was dictated by the environment the </v>
<v Speaker 2>egg mature,</v>

554
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

555
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the case with crocodiles as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>

556
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

557
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.770
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most every vertebrate that we know,</v>

558
00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:47.160
<v Speaker 2>except for mammals and birds and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals and birds,</v>

559
00:30:47.161 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a different evolution of genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex determination.</v>

560
00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 2>So most lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>

561
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 2>frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles,</v>

562
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:57.811
<v Speaker 2>turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teleost fish have some kind of </v>

563
00:30:57.811 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 2>environmental sex determination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually as long as we're going down</v>

564
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:04.741
<v Speaker 2>this road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise you there's someplace cool to </v>

565
00:31:04.741 --> 00:31:04.741
<v Speaker 2>go with school already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

566
00:31:04.741 --> 00:31:05.050
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never know.</v>

567
00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I never know how inTerested people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the animal science,</v>

568
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.770
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in human beings and mammals and not </v>

569
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.960
<v Speaker 2>all mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monitoring teams are exceptional in </v>

570
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 2>this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the kid doesn't platapus yeah,</v>

571
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:23.590
<v Speaker 2>there are three species left on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a remnant of an early,</v>

572
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.470
<v Speaker 2>early branch on the mammal tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

573
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in most mammals like us,</v>

574
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 2>we have chromosomal sex determination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and males are x,</v>

575
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and females are xx in birds.</v>

576
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 2>The situation is exactly reversed as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in butterflies.</v>

577
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>So what that tells you is that to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent that by reversed what brett means</v>

578
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:49.441
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just use different letters just </v>

579
00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 2>so as not to be confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>males are so called homo comedic or ww,</v>

580
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.620
<v Speaker 2>whereas in mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females or hamburg,</v>

581
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>munich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>xx,</v>

582
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 2>and in birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>males are comedic.</v>

583
00:31:55.721 --> 00:32:00.721
<v Speaker 2>Ww and females are wc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that female birds can't </v>

584
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 2>clone themselves as the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a komodo dragon could.</v>

585
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.330
<v Speaker 2>But the reason I raise it is because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a sense of male and female vet.</v>

586
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just wrong that male and </v>
<v Speaker 2>female are actually akin to a niche that</v>

587
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:26.191
<v Speaker 2>these are roles that the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovers periodically because they make</v>

588
00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

589
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

590
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a convergence on a set of behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fit well together.</v>

591
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Once you have a small mobile gametes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend to acquire the traits that go </v>

592
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 2>along with maleness.</v>

593
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when an animal switches sex in the </v>

594
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.371
<v Speaker 2>middle of its life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behavior switches along with the </v>

595
00:32:51.371 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 2>gametes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is true between birds and mammals.</v>

596
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 2>So the which one has two different sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes,</v>

597
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 2>does not predict the behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which one lays the egg,</v>

598
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 2>does predict the behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it gets even weirder than that.</v>

599
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 2>So jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have that image of the flower,</v>

600
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the image image of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen him look at this </v>

601
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 2>flower on the youtube version or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of flowers?</v>

602
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually just a diagram of a </v>

603
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.800
<v Speaker 2>flower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just standard flower was that woman </v>

604
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 2>who makes those flower paintings at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>according vagina's a Georgia?</v>

605
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our joke here.</v>

606
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 2>So this is not her work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a little obsessed.</v>

607
00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

608
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Hey lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you paint other stuff?</v>

609
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 2>So here's what I want to show you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

610
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.960
<v Speaker 2>And I must say I love this point even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though I'm,</v>

611
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm less jazzed about plants than I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>about animals.</v>

612
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the thing,</v>

613
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:55.781
<v Speaker 2>there is labeled stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stigma is Connected to the style </v>

614
00:33:55.781 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 2>which leads to the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the obvious ones are the.</v>

615
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 2>The eggs essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the anthers are the place to produce</v>

616
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>this pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this flower is a hermaphrodite.</v>

617
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 2>It has both male and female parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the really interesting thing.</v>

618
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:16.630
<v Speaker 2>The female parts are kind of reluctant </v>
<v Speaker 2>about sex with strangers.</v>

619
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>The male parts are really enthusiastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

620
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

621
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:25.811
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those pollen grains will try to </v>

622
00:34:25.811 --> 00:34:29.261
<v Speaker 2>fertilize anything they land on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that long style Is basically a test </v>

623
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 2>that the female part of the plant </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposes any pollen grain to the pollen.</v>

624
00:34:35.361 --> 00:34:40.361
<v Speaker 2>Grain has to grow a pollen tube down </v>
<v Speaker 2>that long style in order to get to the </v>

625
00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:40.550
<v Speaker 2>eggs.</v>

626
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.070
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that flower,</v>

627
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 2>the female parts are koi and the male </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts are a bit randy.</v>

628
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Now this is one plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one flower that does not agree </v>

629
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 2>with itself about how enthusiastic to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>about sex with strangers.</v>

630
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.390
<v Speaker 2>So you can predict this just on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers too,</v>

631
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to produce,</v>

632
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what orders of magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>more pollen than it has to be </v>

633
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:11.861
<v Speaker 2>fertilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only got a few chances at picking the </v>

634
00:35:11.861 --> 00:35:15.131
<v Speaker 2>right pond to be fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the pollen can be broadcast and go </v>

635
00:35:15.131 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and if it's successful and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that successful,</v>

636
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 2>it's still okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still kind of a win.</v>

637
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.770
<v Speaker 2>So the payoff for putting up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about plants here is if you </v>

638
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:28.691
<v Speaker 2>realize there's something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe that even when it's building a </v>

639
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 2>plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really not like an animal,</v>

640
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 2>even when it's building a plant and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at and we say,</v>

641
00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the boy parts,</v>

642
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 2>and those are the girl parts.</v>

643
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:40.330
<v Speaker 2>They actually have some analogy to males</v>
<v Speaker 2>and females amongst animals Where we can</v>

644
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.500
<v Speaker 2>spot the behavior easily and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is mind blowing because you correct</v>

645
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:52.731
<v Speaker 2>me if I'm wrong here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the common ancestor between these </v>

646
00:35:52.731 --> 00:35:55.590
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these land plants that have a pollen and</v>

647
00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like this and animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have eggs and sperm,</v>

648
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:05.650
<v Speaker 2>the common ancestor is a single celled </v>
<v Speaker 2>photosynthetic ocean creatures,</v>

649
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.190
<v Speaker 2>single cell creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like.</v>

650
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a coMmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

651
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a complex creature.</v>

652
00:36:15.251 --> 00:36:20.251
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that two totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different claims that are built around </v>

653
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:25.521
<v Speaker 2>totally different rules at the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get around to spitting out </v>

654
00:36:25.521 --> 00:36:28.941
<v Speaker 2>something that looks like two sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It recover some of the things that we as</v>

655
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 2>human beings are familiar with from </v>
<v Speaker 2>shakespeare,</v>

656
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:37.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point about male and female is so </v>

657
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 2>general that it even covers plants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then okay,</v>

658
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.350
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

659
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And then we have fungi which break every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single rule.</v>

660
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:50.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't look anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do have stuff that we would regard </v>

661
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 2>as different sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can have like 50.</v>

662
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I think they're even hundreds of mating </v>
<v Speaker 2>types in some species of fungi.</v>

663
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that the universe says this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the only way to organize a creature,</v>

664
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.500
<v Speaker 2>but it does say this is the way a </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature will be organized if certain </v>

665
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.740
<v Speaker 2>things are true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something like in something</v>

666
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.780
<v Speaker 2>sperm like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's very powerful when we're </v>

667
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.611
<v Speaker 2>reaching into Biology and we're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>male and female are patterns of behavior</v>

668
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 2>that tend to be associated with certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of gametes.</v>

669
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.330
<v Speaker 2>When you have two gammy types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something called nsi gummy,</v>

670
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you will have two sexes and the sexes </v>
<v Speaker 2>will follow rules that we see over and </v>

671
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Repeated plants,</v>

672
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

673
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we discussed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the green room before the show started </v>

674
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.530
<v Speaker 1>was that what we are as some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal that can communicate in very,</v>

675
00:37:38.951 --> 00:37:43.951
<v Speaker 1>very complex ways and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we do when we can communicate in </v>

676
00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:47.921
<v Speaker 1>such complex ways is explain all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we've learned about science,</v>

677
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:52.961
<v Speaker 1>but another thing that we do is we </v>
<v Speaker 1>distort reality to fit what we would </v>

678
00:37:52.961 --> 00:37:57.341
<v Speaker 1>desire it to be rather than what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that is what's going on </v>

679
00:37:57.981 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>

680
00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:04.450
<v Speaker 2>A huge amount and unpacking that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning not to impose your expectations</v>

681
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.460
<v Speaker 2>on nature is key to understanding it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is a skill you have to learn </v>

682
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.360
<v Speaker 2>and you know that way when nature does </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you something about what males and </v>

683
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:25.761
<v Speaker 2>females are like and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about something that </v>

684
00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:29.511
<v Speaker 2>you've learned by being human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something you've </v>

685
00:38:29.511 --> 00:38:32.631
<v Speaker 2>learned by looking at other creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a lot of power and </v>

686
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:36.111
<v Speaker 2>understanding what those patterns are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you get to humans </v>

687
00:38:36.111 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>because of all the creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is fair to say,</v>

688
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.530
<v Speaker 2>of all the creatures that I've spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime thinking aBout humans are maybe </v>

689
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 2>sexually the weirdest our ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

690
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ducks for the most part.</v>

691
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:59.340
<v Speaker 2>On average on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm human beings are partially sex </v>

692
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 2>role reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

693
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.440
<v Speaker 2>That's sex role reversal is not unheard </v>
<v Speaker 2>of in an animal's that happens,</v>

694
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.800
<v Speaker 2>but our sex role reversal is so weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is not complete.</v>

695
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 2>So there's stuff going on in human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that is absolutely novel.</v>

696
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

697
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:27.090
<v Speaker 2>here's a mindblowing fact that reallY </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could start here and just follow it </v>

698
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 2>back to the implications of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>

699
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 2>How many species of mammals do you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are?</v>

700
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Half a million?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

701
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

702
00:39:38.911 --> 00:39:39.530
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're way off.</v>

703
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Thirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

704
00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:44.760
<v Speaker 2>and then a few months there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

705
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.000
<v Speaker 2>there are aBout 4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

706
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.630
<v Speaker 2>that we think really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

707
00:39:48.631 --> 00:39:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I still think it's forecast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

708
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.780
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

709
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 2>this is going to mess me up because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to work back from $5,000.</v>

710
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know which played has Grown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

711
00:39:56.761 --> 00:40:01.761
<v Speaker 2>we've got about 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>species of the racers are pretty </v>

712
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:01.761
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Step pretty good.</v>

713
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 2>So half of them are rodents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A quarter of them are bats.</v>

714
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.710
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied bats in graduate school.</v>

715
00:40:07.711 --> 00:40:09.840
<v Speaker 2>That was my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People never expect that.</v>

716
00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:11.540
<v Speaker 2>A quarter of all mammal species for </v>
<v Speaker 2>bats.</v>

717
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:12.780
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

718
00:40:12.781 --> 00:40:16.140
<v Speaker 2>we got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been to austin for four to 5,000</v>

719
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.200
<v Speaker 2>species of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are the only one of those </v>

720
00:40:21.301 --> 00:40:25.170
<v Speaker 2>mammal species in which breasts remain </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlarged.</v>

721
00:40:25.171 --> 00:40:26.220
<v Speaker 2>When not lactating.</v>

722
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I find that fact absolutely remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

723
00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 2>You have four to 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>species of lactating animals and in </v>

724
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.800
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breasts have been made persistent when </v>

725
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.960
<v Speaker 2>not lactating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in sexual interactions,</v>

726
00:40:44.961 --> 00:40:49.961
<v Speaker 2>they've obviously become a signal and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know more or less what they already </v>

727
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.940
<v Speaker 2>signal of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are a signal of um,</v>

728
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 2>having the resources to produce a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't.</v>

729
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

730
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.160
<v Speaker 2>registered with us as important as it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>

731
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.560
<v Speaker 2>It's much more important to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors.</v>

732
00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:11.561
<v Speaker 2>It was a vital characteristic because </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time females were either </v>

733
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 2>pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were feeding a baby and therefore </v>

734
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>not fertile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were starving and therefore not </v>

735
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.471
<v Speaker 2>fertile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a fertile female who is </v>

736
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:26.921
<v Speaker 2>essentially advertising that she has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources to produce a viable offspring </v>

737
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.850
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rare commodity.</v>

738
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to talk in those.</v>

739
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing normative by it.</v>

740
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm just simply describing it in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if I was an alien looking down on </v>

741
00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.491
<v Speaker 2>people in their evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that that signal finds </v>

742
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

743
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 2>utilized in the way that it does on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet tells us where we are.</v>

744
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 2>We know what I'm saYing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the other things that is </v>

745
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.321
<v Speaker 2>unique about humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least with regard to our most recent </v>

746
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:02.321
<v Speaker 2>ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other primates,</v>

747
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:06.850
<v Speaker 2>is that we have concealed isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't tell when a woman is </v>

748
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.970
<v Speaker 2>fertile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you can tell when a baboon is </v>

749
00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.671
<v Speaker 2>fertile or a monkey or a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got sexual swellings and other </v>

750
00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 2>indicators of fertility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HoW do those lizards find out?</v>

751
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Because if they determine which female </v>
<v Speaker 2>plays the stimulation role in the </v>

752
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 2>regulation cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to be chemical.</v>

753
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:30.610
<v Speaker 2>So some kind of smell pheromone sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing vomeronasal some large.</v>

754
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.340
<v Speaker 2>So you see reptiles putting out their </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongue,</v>

755
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is they're picking up</v>

756
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:41.951
<v Speaker 2>large molecules that don't volatilize </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they are touching an organ that</v>

757
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:47.291
<v Speaker 2>they have that's connected to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains to detect a kind of chemical </v>

758
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:50.711
<v Speaker 2>signal that weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how true this story is </v>

759
00:42:50.711 --> 00:42:54.311
<v Speaker 2>going to end up being probably true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a little trepidation about </v>

760
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:54.311
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

761
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Oregon that detects these large </v>

762
00:42:59.320 --> 00:42:59.840
<v Speaker 2>molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foamer no nasal Oregon,</v>

763
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.330
<v Speaker 2>and it's like having another sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell that we just don't,</v>

764
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 2>we can't intuitive what it would be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have it.</v>

765
00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:08.630
<v Speaker 2>But we actually do have remnants of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>

766
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:09.850
<v Speaker 2>it's just not plugged in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

767
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 2>The story is humans have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

768
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not connected up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not be surprised if it is </v>

769
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.200
<v Speaker 2>something that we're not confident of.</v>

770
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I won't be surprised if it turns out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be important in some way.</v>

771
00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:25.451
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know the tonsils or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>appendix of turned out to have values </v>

772
00:43:25.451 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 2>that we should have guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but humans have these persistent,</v>

773
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.630
<v Speaker 2>constant sexual signals in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>breasts,</v>

774
00:43:30.631 --> 00:43:35.631
<v Speaker 2>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also have obscured when we are </v>

775
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 2>and are not fertile and so more than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other primates.</v>

776
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Humans have basically constant sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>availability,</v>

777
00:43:41.841 --> 00:43:43.240
<v Speaker 2>constant sexual interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

778
00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:45.070
<v Speaker 2>there are ebbs and flows and such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

779
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:49.120
<v Speaker 2>but female humans more than female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps are baboons.</v>

780
00:43:49.121 --> 00:43:54.121
<v Speaker 2>Are there any other primates are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in sex more reliably across </v>

781
00:43:54.121 --> 00:43:56.600
<v Speaker 2>their ambulatory cycle than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than any of these other primates?</v>

782
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's unpack that a little bit.</v>

783
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.420
<v Speaker 2>So in human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

784
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.880
<v Speaker 2>ovulation is concealed so that it is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear when a female is fertile,</v>

785
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 2>it is concealed from the female herself.</v>

786
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Now that always gets pushed back if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that in a room full of students </v>

787
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 2>because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

788
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is women do not know </v>

789
00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.811
<v Speaker 2>reliably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do Things like monitor </v>

790
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:22.811
<v Speaker 2>temperature and you can get a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>better sense,</v>

791
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 2>but it is novel tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

792
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 2>That no one had until 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the most to many women feel it in our</v>

793
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 2>body that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some who claimed to be able to,</v>

794
00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.680
<v Speaker 2>and there may be some self knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible there,</v>

795
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 2>so people also claim to be able to pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery tickets.</v>

796
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I can pick up winning ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not prepared to say that that never </v>

797
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

798
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:50.030
<v Speaker 2>But the interesting fact is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a woman is fertile,</v>

799
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 2>does not have to be obscure to the woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

800
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Evolution appears to have taken that </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of information away about boone </v>

801
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 2>would know when it was fertile and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would alter its behavior.</v>

802
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.970
<v Speaker 2>A female bevin boys when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fertile.</v>

803
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's because over time </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have discerned.</v>

804
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean over the course of evoLution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have discerned that having a </v>

805
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:16.301
<v Speaker 1>child also is partially a burden and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more intelligent creatures as </v>

806
00:45:19.701 --> 00:45:21.650
<v Speaker 1>humans got more and more intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

807
00:45:21.651 --> 00:45:26.651
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a little inconvenient to </v>

808
00:45:26.651 --> 00:45:28.571
<v Speaker 1>have a child or as a baboon would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that way and not contemplate the </v>

809
00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:33.581
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was some sort of evolutionary </v>

810
00:45:33.581 --> 00:45:36.071
<v Speaker 1>advantage for it to be concealed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans and for outright displays of </v>

811
00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:40.100
<v Speaker 1>sexuality to be prominent throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>their entire life.</v>

812
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I suspect the answer is a whole lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible than that really.</v>

813
00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

814
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.120
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>

815
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Which is that to the extent that a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows when she is fertile,</v>

816
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.730
<v Speaker 2>she actually may be</v>

817
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

818
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that sexual too coercive </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

819
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So vulnerable to rape.</v>

820
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:08.970
<v Speaker 1>So that if a woman was outright </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling that she was obviating the,</v>

821
00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 1>she would be more likely to be raped by </v>
<v Speaker 1>other humans.</v>

822
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no question about that.</v>

823
00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

824
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.240
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>

825
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.320
<v Speaker 2>hiding this information from everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to be an evolutionary solution </v>

826
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:29.571
<v Speaker 2>to a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can name it exactly </v>

827
00:46:29.571 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>because so much is obscure about our </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent ancestors.</v>

828
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we only have bones,</v>

829
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:38.810
<v Speaker 2>nothing else fossilizes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't mean that the behavior </v>

830
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:38.810
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fossilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot we can't say,</v>

831
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 2>but it is interesting arriving at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

832
00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 2>we have modern women and we can say it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is interesting that evolution has robbed</v>

833
00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:51.351
<v Speaker 2>women themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a piece of information that one </v>

834
00:46:51.351 --> 00:46:51.870
<v Speaker 2>would initially think would be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable</v>

835
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that it would be prominent</v>

836
00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.640
<v Speaker 2>to be obscure at all is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing that heather </v>

837
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.421
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think belongs front and center </v>

838
00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:06.431
<v Speaker 2>in this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is having sex for Pleasure rather than </v>

839
00:47:08.151 --> 00:47:11.540
<v Speaker 2>reproductive purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not the only ones to do that.</v>

840
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.060
<v Speaker 2>There was dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

841
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:15.560
<v Speaker 2>There are a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's rare.</v>

842
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a few other species that </v>

843
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:20.690
<v Speaker 2>appeared to do this and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>appear to do it.</v>

844
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.560
<v Speaker 2>The way humans done at is a dolphin </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

845
00:47:24.561 --> 00:47:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it year round?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

846
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

847
00:47:28.851 --> 00:47:33.851
<v Speaker 2>the that sex in human beings has taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>on these other important roles in pair </v>

848
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 2>bonding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

849
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.530
<v Speaker 2>is very special and the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>continues after menopause.</v>

850
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean menopause itself is special </v>
<v Speaker 2>menopause.</v>

851
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:51.331
<v Speaker 2>The idea that that's not your </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproductive apparatus failing due to </v>

852
00:47:51.491 --> 00:47:53.530
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is your reproductive apparatus.</v>

853
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Deciding to shut down because you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved into a new phase.</v>

854
00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Basically you've moved into the grandma </v>
<v Speaker 2>phase and the grandma phases essential </v>

855
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.340
<v Speaker 2>in humans where it is not essential in </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost any other creature.</v>

856
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I think elephants occasionally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>orcas,</v>

857
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I believe orc has also have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern,</v>

858
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

859
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are so different </v>
<v Speaker 2>about humans and they have so much to do</v>

860
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:21.691
<v Speaker 2>with sex that having a mind numbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about sexual signals in </v>

861
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:27.841
<v Speaker 2>modern times is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually just kind of painful to </v>

862
00:48:27.841 --> 00:48:30.790
<v Speaker 2>listen to it because you want all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these pieces of information on the table</v>

863
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:32.810
<v Speaker 2>so that at the point we get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion about what,</v>

864
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 2>what do we do about modernity that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

865
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing with toys.</v>

866
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>We're actually talking about the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

867
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:48.150
<v Speaker 2>This modernity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way human beings represent </v>

868
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 2>sexuality or the way sexuality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>

869
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with it?</v>

870
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>

871
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.760
<v Speaker 2>what are the key things that stand out </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an evolutionary biologist?</v>

872
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let me try an experiment with you.</v>

873
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a.</v>

874
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't gonna work,</v>

875
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 2>but I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it does.</v>

876
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to work.</v>

877
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

878
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.790
<v Speaker 2>w I would like to try and experiment </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you as a,</v>

879
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.440
<v Speaker 2>a red blooded male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

880
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I would like you to conjure the image in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind of a woman who is not </v>

881
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hot.</v>

882
00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

883
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

884
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you conjure the image of a woman who</v>

885
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 2>is beautiful but not hot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

886
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.990
<v Speaker 2>No Problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

887
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Me either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

888
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:42.420
<v Speaker 2>this I think actually is a window into </v>
<v Speaker 2>much that is wrong with what we think </v>

889
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.260
<v Speaker 2>about human sexuality.</v>

890
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I think most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask them without doing that </v>

891
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.451
<v Speaker 2>little experiment to conjure a or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>define what,</v>

892
00:49:55.450 --> 00:50:00.450
<v Speaker 2>what it is for somebody to be hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get answers and people would </v>

893
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:02.890
<v Speaker 2>tell you that hot was sort of like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>height of beauty,</v>

894
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is very frightening if that's true</v>

895
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:10.510
<v Speaker 2>because hotness wanes with age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It deteriorates.</v>

896
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Just can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The discovery,</v>

897
00:50:13.721 --> 00:50:18.721
<v Speaker 2>that beauty actually is a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameter tells a whole different story </v>

898
00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:23.821
<v Speaker 2>about what's going on with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People with men and with women,</v>

899
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and I think both men and women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused by I'm so if it is true,</v>

900
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.470
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I know it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can look inside my own mind and I can </v>

901
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.651
<v Speaker 2>say that at least for some men it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true that beauty and hotness are almost </v>

902
00:50:38.651 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 2>uncorrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who have both traits,</v>

903
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.850
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

904
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.400
<v Speaker 2>I have no trouble seeing that image of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who is hot but not the least bit </v>

905
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:48.400
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

906
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And I know lots of women who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and not hot.</v>

907
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:56.230
<v Speaker 2>And I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I take the category of women who are </v>

908
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 2>beautiful but not hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

909
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.410
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of older women in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

910
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I know women in their sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies who have Poise have aged </v>

911
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 2>gracefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gray as can be.</v>

912
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 2>They may be wrinkled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you talk to them,</v>

913
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.880
<v Speaker 2>one does have the sense I'm talking to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful person,</v>

914
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not,</v>

915
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being modeled in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was just a simple fact that both </v>

916
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 2>beauty and hotness wane with age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say so.</v>

917
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 2>But it is not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's going on?</v>

918
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have these two categories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>why do we assume,</v>

919
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will get the message that hotness is</v>

920
00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:39.290
<v Speaker 2>where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

921
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Hotness is the thing that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard possible.</v>

922
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:47.180
<v Speaker 2>It's the only standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so women are aspiring to it and then</v>

923
00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:49.610
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting it as it wanes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of this,</v>

924
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:54.611
<v Speaker 2>and I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I suspect is up because </v>

925
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:57.260
<v Speaker 2>males are males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

926
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to say they have to reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies really.</v>

927
00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:06.251
<v Speaker 2>They have three reproductive strategies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of them is a so awful that it's </v>

928
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 2>really just unpleasant even entered into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discussion,</v>

929
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 2>but new tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

930
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

931
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 2>So the first reproductive strategy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>men have,</v>

932
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 2>the one that would generally have </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeded and that by the way,</v>

933
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about monogamy versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamory and all of that at some point.</v>

934
00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:24.030
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

935
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherent,</v>

936
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not Inherently about monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way males have typically reproduced </v>

937
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.880
<v Speaker 2>is they have invested in their offspring</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mothers of their offspring.</v>

938
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.150
<v Speaker 2>That's the goto mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproducing as a human.</v>

939
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because human babies are so needy that </v>

940
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.631
<v Speaker 2>one person trying to raise them on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own is hobbled by just the sheer </v>

941
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 2>difficulty of trying to manage an infant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a toddler while trying to accomplish</v>

942
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:59.681
<v Speaker 2>the other things of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me just add here that the idea </v>

943
00:52:59.681 --> 00:53:03.491
<v Speaker 2>that monogamy has been ubiquitous </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout human history is not </v>

944
00:53:03.491 --> 00:53:07.240
<v Speaker 2>completely accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there is good evidence for it </v>

945
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.690
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of fronts and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>points against it is that we remain </v>

946
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 2>somewhat sexually dimorphic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That men are on average,</v>

947
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:14.600
<v Speaker 2>a bit taller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit more muscular,</v>

948
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.110
<v Speaker 2>much more muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

949
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:21.670
<v Speaker 2>but that we are so much less sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimorphic than even our ancestors beef,</v>

950
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in more times then when we were,</v>

951
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 2>she didn't read most recent common </v>
<v Speaker 2>assets with chimps that we are moving </v>

952
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.590
<v Speaker 2>towards a more monogamous situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just,</v>

953
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I think you said something that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>unclear at the beginning.</v>

954
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:41.180
<v Speaker 2>There has been a lot of polygyny where </v>
<v Speaker 2>one male has multiple females in human </v>

955
00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.951
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the majority of human cultures </v>

956
00:53:45.951 --> 00:53:45.951
<v Speaker 2>have been polygynous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

957
00:53:45.951 --> 00:53:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Majority of people on earth today belong</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cultures that are at least nominally </v>

958
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 2>monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we should talk about what that shift</v>

959
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 2>is and what it means to us and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>desirable and all of that.</v>

960
00:53:55.381 --> 00:54:00.381
<v Speaker 2>But the basic point that human babies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so expensive and difficult to raise </v>

961
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 2>that you need a team to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

962
00:54:05.911 --> 00:54:10.911
<v Speaker 2>in part this is a chicken and egg </v>
<v Speaker 2>question is not a good term because it's</v>

963
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.130
<v Speaker 2>quite clear which came first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

964
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:16.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a situation where the,</v>

965
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.530
<v Speaker 2>when you have a team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can also afford to have a baby </v>

966
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.110
<v Speaker 2>that's more needy and there is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>good about a needy baby,</v>

967
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 2>but there is something good about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get.</v>

968
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.630
<v Speaker 2>If you can tolerate a needy baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a baby that's a lot more </v>

969
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:33.381
<v Speaker 2>nuanced when it grows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So males have traditionally invested in </v>

970
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.270
<v Speaker 2>offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

971
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 2>but a male who is investing in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring,</v>

972
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:46.130
<v Speaker 2>should they happen on an opportunity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which a female who is fertile and </v>

973
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:50.301
<v Speaker 2>capable of producing an offspring does </v>
<v Speaker 2>not require commitment from them in </v>

974
00:54:50.301 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 2>order to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an evolutionary bargain.</v>

975
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:57.290
<v Speaker 2>A male who can either convince a female </v>
<v Speaker 2>or finds a female who's willing to </v>

976
00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:00.150
<v Speaker 2>produce a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not expect any support in return.</v>

977
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:05.510
<v Speaker 2>That such a power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like winning the lottery </v>

978
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:07.791
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it would have almost never happened </v>

979
00:55:07.791 --> 00:55:09.150
<v Speaker 2>in history because women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because babies are so expensive,</v>

980
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.180
<v Speaker 2>are wired to avoid like the plague.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to get stuck raising a </v>

981
00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:17.991
<v Speaker 2>baby on your own if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through committing to somebody get a </v>

982
00:55:17.991 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 2>partner in raising an offspring.</v>

983
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.590
<v Speaker 2>So how does birth control factor into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

984
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get there in a second,</v>

985
00:55:23.071 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 2>but let's just get the two strategies on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table.</v>

986
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Males in general have succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproductively by investing in their </v>

987
00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 2>offspring and their offsprings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mothers,</v>

988
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 2>when they have the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce offspring with no commitment,</v>

989
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:43.730
<v Speaker 2>they have a hard time resisting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity because it's such an </v>

990
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean it would have been</v>

991
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:46.800
<v Speaker 2>very common in history because females </v>
<v Speaker 2>would avoid it.</v>

992
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:51.330
<v Speaker 2>So my art can't look away from hot is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that second strategy,</v>

993
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:56.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hot is this channel that men can </v>

994
00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:02.990
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are wired in such a way that they </v>

995
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.810
<v Speaker 2>actually had been robbed of every useful</v>
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>

996
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:09.110
<v Speaker 2>They are triggered by the sight of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who is broadcasting hotness.</v>

997
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

998
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.930
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

999
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I think is most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this is we now live in a culture </v>

1000
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.191
<v Speaker 2>where we have advertisers essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a kind of insecurity because </v>

1001
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 2>insecurity causes people to spend money </v>
<v Speaker 2>they otherwise wouldn't.</v>

1002
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:35.730
<v Speaker 2>That insecurity has women trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>capture male attention by broadcasting </v>

1003
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:39.190
<v Speaker 2>hotness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course works because men have a</v>

1004
00:56:39.191 --> 00:56:44.191
<v Speaker 2>hard time ignoring hotness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I think women often don't </v>

1005
00:56:44.191 --> 00:56:48.511
<v Speaker 2>understand is that getting a man's </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention by broadcasting hotness has </v>

1006
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 2>him in the frame of mind of this second </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproductive strategy and it is actually</v>

1007
00:56:53.561 --> 00:56:58.561
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive to getting his </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention for the first reproductive </v>

1008
00:56:58.561 --> 00:57:02.011
<v Speaker 2>strategy because men have historically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is by the way,</v>

1009
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:08.701
<v Speaker 2>this is where I'm going to get in huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble with people because this is </v>

1010
00:57:08.701 --> 00:57:08.701
<v Speaker 2>going to sound like an accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1011
00:57:08.701 --> 00:57:13.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to describe what has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been and then we can talk about what we </v>

1012
00:57:13.261 --> 00:57:16.681
<v Speaker 2>should do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a woman who values herself </v>

1013
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:22.780
<v Speaker 2>highly in reproductive terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will not leap on,</v>

1014
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:28.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sexual opportunity just because it's </v>

1015
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 2>available because what's at stake is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1016
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Historically for women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not true anymore because of </v>

1017
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 2>birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but historically it would be true that a</v>

1018
00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:39.601
<v Speaker 2>sexual interaction is basically baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>roulette and baby roulette is a </v>

1019
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:41.320
<v Speaker 2>dangerous game to play.</v>

1020
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:46.320
<v Speaker 2>So we get at some of what's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the stereotype of the madonna</v>

1021
00:57:48.191 --> 00:57:53.191
<v Speaker 2>whore dichotomy that neither of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>words is quite right because no one </v>

1022
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 2>wants a madonna and elements of virgin </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a life partner,</v>

1023
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:03.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have a vibrant sexual </v>

1024
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 2>relationship with your life partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1025
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:08.790
<v Speaker 2>are you triggering the hotness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I get a baby out of you and never </v>

1026
00:58:08.801 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 2>see it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a strategy and men,</v>

1027
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 2>or are you triggering the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1028
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.400
<v Speaker 2>you're gorgeous and I feel like we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this together.</v>

1029
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I hate to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to pull this thing close to </v>

1030
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:23.660
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1031
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:23.660
<v Speaker 2>just just move that sucker around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1032
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:24.450
<v Speaker 2>so it's comfortable where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting.</v>

1033
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.070
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very different.</v>

1034
00:58:26.071 --> 00:58:28.890
<v Speaker 2>It sounds okay in our ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very different as the audio.</v>

1035
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1036
00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1037
00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1038
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.510
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1039
00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:34.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the madonna whore complex,</v>

1040
00:58:34.981 --> 00:58:39.981
<v Speaker 2>which is this famous thing isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox that we are led to believe men </v>

1041
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:43.010
<v Speaker 2>are interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.110
<v Speaker 2>as heather points out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>madonna and whore or the wrong terms,</v>

1043
00:58:46.111 --> 00:58:51.111
<v Speaker 2>they're very charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but men are interested in both of these </v>

1044
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.510
<v Speaker 2>reproductive strategies but they are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>

1045
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:58.410
<v Speaker 2>They're not paradoxically searching for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the same individual will.</v>

1046
00:58:58.411 --> 00:59:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there an issue also that today </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

1047
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 2>males in particular are not looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>women purely in terms of someone to </v>

1048
00:59:07.831 --> 00:59:12.831
<v Speaker 2>reproduce with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking in terms of what is </v>

1049
00:59:12.831 --> 00:59:15.411
<v Speaker 2>sexually pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did they find attractive and when </v>

1050
00:59:15.411 --> 00:59:17.640
<v Speaker 2>they see a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is almost,</v>

1051
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:20.520
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare that they look at a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

1052
00:59:20.521 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 2>this is a who I would</v>

1053
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 3>like to breed with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd say,</v>

1054
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I would like to practice reading with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1055
00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's where our language gets in </v>

1056
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1057
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Like we were telling ourselves stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on,</v>

1058
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean got birth control changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything actually and really so new.</v>

1059
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so new.</v>

1060
00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:43.121
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are not very reliable forms of </v>

1061
00:59:43.121 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 3>birth control and lots of cultures </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world,</v>

1062
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 3>but actually fully reliable birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>control is decades old,</v>

1063
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.380
<v Speaker 3>so we shouldn't expect the stories we </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell ourselves about what we're looking </v>

1064
00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:57.041
<v Speaker 3>for to be a match for what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually looking for yet because we </v>

1065
00:59:57.041 --> 01:00:00.881
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't had time to update our </v>

1066
01:00:00.881 --> 01:00:03.580
<v Speaker 3>software even ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the software is still wired the same </v>

1067
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:08.561
<v Speaker 3>way to look at a woman who you believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a good carrier of babies,</v>

1068
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.590
<v Speaker 3>someone who would be very maternal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's attractive,</v>

1069
01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:16.580
<v Speaker 3>they have good features.</v>

1070
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.380
<v Speaker 3>This would be someone who you'd want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breed with.</v>

1071
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the second option would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who you could sneak it in on.</v>

1072
01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I would say with regard to the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy,</v>

1073
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more than that.</v>

1074
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 3>More so that the first strategy as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just described,</v>

1075
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 3>it sounds very traditional female role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1076
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:38.710
<v Speaker 3>And mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when populations are moving </v>

1077
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.701
<v Speaker 3>across frontiers and actually like </v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding the scope of where humans </v>

1078
01:00:42.701 --> 01:00:43.520
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you needed in a partner,</v>

1079
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:48.550
<v Speaker 3>both male and female with someone with </v>
<v Speaker 3>whom you could share all of life's </v>

1080
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:48.550
<v Speaker 3>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1081
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just about taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby,</v>

1082
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1083
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:54.620
<v Speaker 3>dad was a also doing parental care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1084
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>mothers and fathers were in it together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was their division of labor of </v>

1085
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And was the specialization of course,</v>

1086
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.330
<v Speaker 3>that that specialization always look the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same?</v>

1087
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't.</v>

1088
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:05.570
<v Speaker 3>In fact cross culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fascinating,</v>

1089
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 3>like some tasks and up highly gendered </v>
<v Speaker 3>across cultures.</v>

1090
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 3>But which gender does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is different,</v>

1091
01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:15.221
<v Speaker 3>like weaving turns out to be a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly gendered task and different </v>

1092
01:01:15.221 --> 01:01:18.641
<v Speaker 3>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes it's only women who do it </v>

1093
01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:18.641
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes it's only men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1094
01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:22.220
<v Speaker 3>there are some things that really only </v>
<v Speaker 3>men do in most cultures.</v>

1095
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a great review,</v>

1096
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.660
<v Speaker 3>an anthropology paper from the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>

1097
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 3>So this is mostly preindustrial cultures</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at.</v>

1098
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:33.500
<v Speaker 3>But the jobs that across cultures where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens,</v>

1099
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.390
<v Speaker 3>only men do include the hunting of large</v>
<v Speaker 3>marine mammals,</v>

1100
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.390
<v Speaker 3>an iron smelting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those two things,</v>

1101
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 3>those two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a few others,</v>

1102
01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:43.730
<v Speaker 3>but those are the top,</v>

1103
01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>the largest marine mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time it's whale hunting </v>

1104
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.580
<v Speaker 2>and smelting of ors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1105
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely don't do that.</v>

1106
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:57.430
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't burn a hole in your boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep quenching the thing by </v>

1107
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.430
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1108
01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:00.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you know,</v>

1109
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 2>the answer to the question you asked is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the whole system has been hijacked </v>

1110
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:09.510
<v Speaker 2>by the novelty of our current </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>

1111
01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:14.511
<v Speaker 2>And what I was trying to get at before </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the size of the wind of an </v>

1112
01:02:16.861 --> 01:02:21.861
<v Speaker 2>ancestral male who reproduced with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't require investment from </v>

1113
01:02:21.861 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The size of that,</v>

1114
01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:28.461
<v Speaker 2>when is so great that it causes men to </v>
<v Speaker 2>default to thinking about that when it </v>

1115
01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:35.661
<v Speaker 2>appears to be available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in a world where there's birth </v>

1116
01:02:35.661 --> 01:02:39.051
<v Speaker 2>control and therefore the stakes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>women for having sex had been greatly </v>

1117
01:02:39.051 --> 01:02:43.461
<v Speaker 2>reduced and therefore more women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in having sex without </v>

1118
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:43.461
<v Speaker 2>commitment.</v>

1119
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:48.290
<v Speaker 2>The problem is men don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're looking for because there </v>

1120
01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1121
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 2>this level of triggering that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot overcome.</v>

1122
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 2>And so the other point I want to make on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this front is yes,</v>

1123
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:03.741
<v Speaker 2>men are interested in sexual pleasure as</v>
<v Speaker 2>our women men and women are overlapping </v>

1124
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:10.101
<v Speaker 2>but distinct in what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think if we were to say,</v>

1125
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:16.340
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual pleasure is awesome and you </v>

1126
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.331
<v Speaker 2>should live your life so as to maybe not</v>
<v Speaker 2>maximize it,</v>

1127
01:03:20.371 --> 01:03:23.180
<v Speaker 2>but come close to maximizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sexual pleasure,</v>

1128
01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 2>so desirable that you should live your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life in a way that you get as much of </v>

1129
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.611
<v Speaker 2>that thing as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would not necessarily say that the </v>

1130
01:03:31.611 --> 01:03:32.820
<v Speaker 2>way to do it was to go around banging </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers,</v>

1131
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is a multifaceted,</v>

1132
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>a phenomenon and there is one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets left out of this discussion almost </v>

1133
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:48.450
<v Speaker 2>every time I hear people talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the sex that one has,</v>

1134
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 2>when the stakes are really high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:56.210
<v Speaker 2>When you're really into somebody that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very pleasurable kind of sex </v>

1136
01:03:57.301 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>that is not reproduced by low stakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1137
01:04:00.721 --> 01:04:04.470
<v Speaker 2>And so we're comparing things and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds like,</v>

1138
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual pleasure is what you're after </v>

1139
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 2>then more sex is certainly the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get there.</v>

1140
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1141
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 2>it tends to look like the argument tends</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be more sex with more people,</v>

1142
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:19.140
<v Speaker 2>more varied sex partners is the obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to optimize sexual pleasure.</v>

1143
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.340
<v Speaker 2>And actually that assumption hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigated and wasn't a difficult to </v>

1144
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.820
<v Speaker 2>accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that,</v>

1145
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:29.220
<v Speaker 2>why it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't really been investigated.</v>

1146
01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:34.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people are having sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>with multiple partners and take notes </v>

1147
01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 2>and being studied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't know.</v>

1148
01:04:35.131 --> 01:04:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean college students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.940
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But tell you anything for 50 bucks.</v>

1150
01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:43.941
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of these studies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>do involve asking a lot of college </v>

1151
01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:43.941
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not,</v>

1152
01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a very broad sample but,</v>

1153
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:50.210
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fairly new phenomenon of the </v>

1154
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:52.011
<v Speaker 2>last five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six decades where you could do it and </v>

1155
01:04:52.011 --> 01:04:52.011
<v Speaker 2>not worry about reproducing.</v>

1156
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the question really is if we step </v>

1157
01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>back from our own lives and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1158
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:04.850
<v Speaker 2>what would the rules be if I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximize this set of things,</v>

1159
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>if I wanted to get these values out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>

1160
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:11.440
<v Speaker 2>how would I alter my behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1161
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you would come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1162
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>sex with strangers is the answer to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

1163
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sex with strangers is,</v>

1164
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:25.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty low grade in terms of what </v>

1165
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.800
<v Speaker 2>it delivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1166
01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 2>so there are some cultures that </v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage a lot of early fooling around </v>

1167
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:36.780
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between individuals and it's considered </v>

1168
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.281
<v Speaker 2>low stakes and it stops at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one thing that what's going </v>

1169
01:05:41.281 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>on in modern american culture is there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no end point.</v>

1170
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just considered a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1171
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:52.500
<v Speaker 2>that more sex with more strangers is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherently going to result in more </v>

1172
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:52.500
<v Speaker 2>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore,</v>

1173
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.980
<v Speaker 2>if we're actually interested in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>

1174
01:05:53.981 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>that's what we should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

1175
01:05:55.631 --> 01:06:00.190
<v Speaker 2>if you look at cultures that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual pleasure seriously,</v>

1176
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:02.350
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like a tantric sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1177
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.980
<v Speaker 2>It isn't about sex with strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about cultivating a sexual </v>

1178
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.961
<v Speaker 2>relationship that increases sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure to an extreme height that you </v>

1179
01:06:12.961 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 2>won't reach if you aren't careful in </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecting it.</v>

1180
01:06:16.331 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 2>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about delayed gratification.</v>

1181
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really that's the missing a idea here is</v>

1182
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:25.570
<v Speaker 2>that delayed gratification is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong contributor to sexual pleasure.</v>

1183
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Isn't this sex with strangers thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive because it's difficult to </v>

1184
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.190
<v Speaker 1>accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of it?</v>

1185
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it's not accomplished for men,</v>

1186
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>but not very difficult to accomplish for</v>
<v Speaker 1>women rights.</v>

1187
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:43.710
<v Speaker 1>It does not that attractive to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as attractive to women as it </v>

1188
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:47.170
<v Speaker 1>is to men for the simple reason that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be attractive to us in the city.</v>

1189
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's because it's imagined that </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetry is equality.</v>

1191
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1192
01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1193
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's</v>

1194
01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe one of the main things we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing back against here is that we are</v>

1195
01:06:59.581 --> 01:07:03.270
<v Speaker 2>not making the claim that one sex is </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than the other,</v>

1196
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:06.540
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that we are identical is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurd on its face.</v>

1197
01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our culTure today,</v>

1198
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that is a big standout</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being very novel is social media.</v>

1199
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 1>This is a completely new thing and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media also being used to attract </v>

1200
01:07:19.971 --> 01:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>sex partners is a very new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1201
01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole bit in my last act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1202
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:29.820
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last netflix special about some girl </v>

1203
01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>who lives in Florida who has not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she probably have 9 billion people on </v>

1204
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.171
<v Speaker 1>our instagram now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had 9 million followers and all she </v>

1205
01:07:37.171 --> 01:07:41.501
<v Speaker 1>does is take pictures of her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying science needs to study </v>

1206
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>her [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new type of human being.</v>

1207
01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she,</v>

1208
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>she has nothing to do with what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

1209
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with what she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished in life.</v>

1210
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>It literally is about people focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her ass so fast.</v>

1211
01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is she doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tension,</v>

1212
01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but she's getting attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's an economic benefit to </v>

1213
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that came later.</v>

1214
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:08.650
<v Speaker 1>The attention came first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't embark on this journey like </v>

1215
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'll do.</v>

1216
01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure out how to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money off my ass.</v>

1217
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:16.020
<v Speaker 1>She decided she comes of age and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovers that that's asset when</v>

1218
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.900
<v Speaker 2>you want it to be or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm being a little bit,</v>

1219
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.580
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to play it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some number of people play it.</v>

1220
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1221
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.420
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1222
01:08:24.421 --> 01:08:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is what I would call it two way</v>

1223
01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.480
<v Speaker 2>failure of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll give me a little,</v>

1224
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>a little leash here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We empathize with another individual by </v>

1225
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:44.610
<v Speaker 2>using our own minds and whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have as the content of our </v>

1226
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:49.051
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we run the data of somebody </v>

1227
01:08:49.051 --> 01:08:49.051
<v Speaker 2>else's situation through our minds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>

1228
01:08:49.051 --> 01:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>how would I feel in that situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in general,</v>

1229
01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>this works really well if you share </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuitry with somebody and it works not</v>

1230
01:08:56.321 --> 01:08:58.090
<v Speaker 2>so well where your circuitry is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1231
01:08:58.150 --> 01:09:03.150
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of places where males </v>
<v Speaker 2>and females who grew up,</v>

1232
01:09:03.611 --> 01:09:08.611
<v Speaker 2>heather and I both grew up in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount of stuff that </v>

1233
01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:12.840
<v Speaker 2>we can intuit about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the other would think about </v>

1234
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.781
<v Speaker 2>something just based on the fact that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in the same period in the same </v>

1235
01:09:15.781 --> 01:09:15.781
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1236
01:09:15.781 --> 01:09:20.100
<v Speaker 2>but males and females there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a place where we top out and we </v>

1237
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.541
<v Speaker 2>can't understand what the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is experiencing because it is very </v>

1238
01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:26.200
<v Speaker 2>unlike what we would experience.</v>

1239
01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:28.210
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1240
01:09:28.211 --> 01:09:30.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were walking down the street,</v>

1241
01:09:30.161 --> 01:09:32.560
<v Speaker 2>let's say before you were a well known </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

1242
01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.860
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an anonymous guy walking down the</v>

1243
01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:40.780
<v Speaker 2>street and imagine that there's a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>of women talking somewhere and uh,</v>

1244
01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.920
<v Speaker 2>you walk by and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1245
01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:49.120
<v Speaker 2>That's one fine hunky man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel?</v>

1246
01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.520
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1247
01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.020
<v Speaker 2>whoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel pretty good,</v>

1248
01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 2>but I don't feel threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does certainly don't feel the difference</v>

1249
01:09:57.021 --> 01:10:02.021
<v Speaker 2>between a man experiencing that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>women is I'm not going to get gang </v>

1250
01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:02.021
<v Speaker 2>raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:02.730
<v Speaker 2>But do you feel good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1252
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1253
01:10:03.651 --> 01:10:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Of course you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He that implemented.</v>

1254
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's very different with the </v>

1255
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.510
<v Speaker 2>opposite sex because there's no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very different for the,</v>

1256
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:16.540
<v Speaker 2>with the opposite sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only because it lets neutralize the </v>

1257
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:16.540
<v Speaker 2>threat part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1258
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's huge for sure,</v>

1259
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but there's other stuff going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the part that I think men </v>

1260
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:26.201
<v Speaker 2>don't intuit until somebody points it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to them because men have two </v>

1261
01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:29.810
<v Speaker 2>different reproductive strategies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them is about longterm investment</v>

1262
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.990
<v Speaker 2>and the other one is about have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1263
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:38.050
<v Speaker 2>impregnate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and never see them again when a man </v>

1264
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>whistles at a woman.</v>

1265
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he compliments essentially how hot </v>

1266
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:46.751
<v Speaker 2>she looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is essentially offering to stick her </v>

1267
01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:49.781
<v Speaker 2>with a child that will then be her </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for the better part of </v>

1268
01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 2>two decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very nice compliment.</v>

1269
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a weird way of looking at </v>

1270
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

1271
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.990
<v Speaker 2>but I see exactly where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1272
01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:04.991
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about that way before </v>

1273
01:11:04.991 --> 01:11:04.991
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think most people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

1274
01:11:04.991 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Well that was my point though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right in front of us.</v>

1275
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.280
<v Speaker 2>The other thing to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've just identified,</v>

1276
01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single guy kept calling maybe,</v>

1277
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a woman walking</v>

1278
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 3>past a construction site and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1279
01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven guys whistling.</v>

1280
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Who are those girls for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily for her.</v>

1281
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.940
<v Speaker 3>It's communication between the men </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're signaling than not getting to </v>

1282
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.940
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1283
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:31.170
<v Speaker 3>did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

1284
01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm into that and I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1285
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:38.510
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a total objectification and it </v>

1286
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:40.491
<v Speaker 3>renders the woman involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was receiving this thing as almost a </v>

1287
01:11:40.491 --> 01:11:43.791
<v Speaker 3>nonentity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it feels totally personal and yet </v>

1288
01:11:43.791 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily about the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

1289
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:48.310
<v Speaker 3>all the discussion of oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these calls or are awful and it's just,</v>

1290
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:53.320
<v Speaker 3>it's a pain in the ass to walk down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street and have to deal with it for a </v>

1291
01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:53.320
<v Speaker 3>young woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1292
01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 3>But it's also ignoring the fact of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>being communication between men and,</v>

1293
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should they stop probably,</v>

1294
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:05.030
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just about male female </v>

1295
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.490
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's male male competition as well.</v>

1296
01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:10.710
<v Speaker 3>That type of communication though only </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurs if you've been raised poorly.</v>

1297
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any sisters or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have any daughters and if you,</v>

1298
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.170
<v Speaker 3>if you have all those things years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a monster,</v>

1299
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:24.470
<v Speaker 3>like if you have a mother that you love </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a sister that you love and if you </v>

1300
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 3>have daughters and you still can't call </v>
<v Speaker 3>it some woman walking down the street,</v>

1301
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.480
<v Speaker 3>there's something really wrong with you.</v>

1302
01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.820
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1303
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was day,</v>

1304
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1305
01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very wrong,</v>

1306
01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is also so calm.</v>

1307
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1308
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean it must,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must work.</v>

1309
01:12:42.951 --> 01:12:45.210
<v Speaker 3>A case works to let the other guys know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gay.</v>

1310
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1311
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it doesn't even do that.</v>

1312
01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually let's,</v>

1313
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think this is something actually heather</v>

1314
01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:55.880
<v Speaker 2>probably won't intuit either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm wondering if you'll spot it.</v>

1315
01:12:55.881 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I mentioned it,</v>

1316
01:12:57.530 --> 01:13:02.210
<v Speaker 2>which is there is a part of being a male</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1317
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is most males in history are </v>

1318
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 2>losers who didn't reproduce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1319
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Reproduction was not that easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish in human history.</v>

1320
01:13:12.231 --> 01:13:16.460
<v Speaker 2>It was way easier to starve or die on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield or a lot of other things.</v>

1321
01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1322
01:13:19.431 --> 01:13:24.431
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a way in which there a part of </v>

1323
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.870
<v Speaker 2>the male psyche that plays very remote </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

1324
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1325
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:37.090
<v Speaker 2>it's weird if you're talking about being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a city and construction workers </v>

1326
01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:38.240
<v Speaker 2>sitting on a girder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whistling at somebody walking by.</v>

1327
01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:44.020
<v Speaker 2>If we calculate the chances that any one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them ended up actually in a </v>

1328
01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.980
<v Speaker 2>conversation with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chances are pretty low.</v>

1329
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:50.690
<v Speaker 2>But if you imagine that those guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually acting from a mind that evolved</v>

1330
01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.720
<v Speaker 2>in much smaller circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A small town where everybody knew </v>

1331
01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.900
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so whatever it is in their mind that</v>

1332
01:13:56.901 --> 01:14:01.130
<v Speaker 2>causes them to have these interactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been much more likely.</v>

1333
01:14:01.131 --> 01:14:03.530
<v Speaker 2>There would be later interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same person.</v>

1334
01:14:03.531 --> 01:14:08.531
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that a male that is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking carefully about what they are </v>

1335
01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.640
<v Speaker 2>doing ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:18.060
<v Speaker 2>flirting with and basically building a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapport that is about some future </v>

1337
01:14:20.591 --> 01:14:24.190
<v Speaker 2>potential that's almost certain never to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be realized.</v>

1338
01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>But it makes sense to cultivate because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1339
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:33.450
<v Speaker 2>if you cultivate a thousand tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentials and almost all of them go </v>

1340
01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 2>bust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally one works out.</v>

1341
01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point is the cost is small.</v>

1342
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1343
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman who gets cat called might,</v>

1344
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine the circumstance,</v>

1345
01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:50.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>

1346
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:55.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dig a hole in the middle of the </v>

1347
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.350
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might find gold.</v>

1348
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a hail mary,</v>

1349
01:14:56.291 --> 01:15:01.291
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes hail mary's work happen some </v>

1350
01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:05.071
<v Speaker 2>time in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had to look at the numbers </v>

1351
01:15:05.071 --> 01:15:05.350
<v Speaker 2>would probably be pretty staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1352
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:10.380
<v Speaker 2>So as long as we're in this territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it must have happened in history,</v>

1353
01:15:10.391 --> 01:15:15.391
<v Speaker 2>but so many things that were very remote</v>
<v Speaker 2>contingencies in history have apparently</v>

1354
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 2>produce offspring like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1355
01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1356
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:24.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparent tendency of people being hung </v>

1357
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 2>to orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1358
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.960
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is likely to be the body taken one </v>

1359
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.190
<v Speaker 2>last shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no point.</v>

1360
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:38.100
<v Speaker 2>There's no way a new one on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about creation.</v>

1361
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.440
<v Speaker 2>So we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually I wasn't talking about </v>

1362
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:43.440
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a better example.</v>

1363
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.400
<v Speaker 2>It shows you that there's some part </v>
<v Speaker 2>hung.</v>

1364
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.280
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean then?</v>

1365
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean the actual execution think </v>
<v Speaker 2>grammatically.</v>

1366
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean being hanged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being hanged.</v>

1367
01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so confused.</v>

1368
01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:55.940
<v Speaker 2>So that'd be a little more orgasms when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>

1369
01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm working from anecdote here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have read that I,</v>

1370
01:15:58.321 --> 01:16:01.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know of any checking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwear people just got hung.</v>

1371
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.080
<v Speaker 2>But my point would be what has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>true in order for such a pattern to </v>

1372
01:16:07.961 --> 01:16:12.961
<v Speaker 2>evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's take auto erotic asphyxiation </v>

1373
01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:12.961
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1374
01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:14.930
<v Speaker 2>is what you're arguing basically this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1375
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:20.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dandelions who go to seed as after you </v>

1376
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.180
<v Speaker 2>pick them and spread their seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1377
01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:26.181
<v Speaker 2>Like is that going to work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last ditch effort to the production </v>

1378
01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:26.920
<v Speaker 2>channel are predict hail marys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the point is,</v>

1379
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably not obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're used to thinking </v>

1380
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.521
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in order for a pattern to occur </v>

1381
01:16:35.521 --> 01:16:39.390
<v Speaker 2>where some entity releases sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagules on death,</v>

1382
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:45.270
<v Speaker 2>in order for that to evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to have worked enough times for </v>

1383
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:49.141
<v Speaker 2>that pattern to have accumulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if autoerotic fixation is the </v>

1384
01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Speaker 2>result of people tapping into that thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1385
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:58.860
<v Speaker 2>traversing a landscape near death in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to increase sexual pleasure,</v>

1386
01:16:59.051 --> 01:17:04.051
<v Speaker 2>what that suggests is that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape near death has actually had a </v>

1387
01:17:04.051 --> 01:17:08.851
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of reproduction happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it that has resulted in this </v>

1388
01:17:08.851 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>circuitry being present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine a scenario?</v>

1389
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And can you imagine a scenario where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that trait would be passed down to the </v>

1390
01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:15.280
<v Speaker 1>offspring?</v>

1391
01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine that.</v>

1392
01:17:16.021 --> 01:17:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just do it the other way.</v>

1393
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have had a lot of sex over </v>

1394
01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:26.781
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of bad things have happened to </v>

1395
01:17:26.781 --> 01:17:30.141
<v Speaker 2>people over evolutionary history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every so often those two things </v>

1396
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:30.930
<v Speaker 2>intersect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1397
01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.220
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every so often the catastrophe,</v>

1398
01:17:35.221 --> 01:17:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the enemy spills over the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

1399
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:41.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1400
01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1401
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the pattern would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may simply be that jeopardy is the </v>

1402
01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:53.970
<v Speaker 2>key factor and actually jeopardy would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be expected to happen an awful lot.</v>

1403
01:17:55.350 --> 01:18:00.240
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that had,</v>

1404
01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 2>in fact we see a lot of this stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>primates where there's a question about </v>

1405
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 2>how public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1406
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>the sexual interaction between two </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals amongst chimps is,</v>

1407
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:12.720
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when two chimps are having sex,</v>

1408
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:16.470
<v Speaker 2>if the mailchimp is not the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>male,</v>

1409
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.080
<v Speaker 2>he has everything to lose in being </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered.</v>

1410
01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:20.800
<v Speaker 2>So malicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1411
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:23.220
<v Speaker 2>They hide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>

1412
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:26.790
<v Speaker 2>is the female advertising that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>having sex by making noises that make it</v>

1413
01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:28.950
<v Speaker 2>visible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case that creates jeopardy.</v>

1414
01:18:28.951 --> 01:18:33.951
<v Speaker 2>So there's a whole landscape of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has happened in evolutionary </v>

1415
01:18:34.081 --> 01:18:37.110
<v Speaker 2>history both with humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with pre humans,</v>

1416
01:18:37.111 --> 01:18:41.000
<v Speaker 2>with apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1417
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 2>they're not anymore.</v>

1418
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that argued as well about </v>
<v Speaker 1>women with very loud moaning of pleasure</v>

1419
01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>that they're really trying to</v>

1420
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 2>attract other males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1421
01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that that waS in sex at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1422
01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I was running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be super cautious about sex at </v>

1423
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:00.020
<v Speaker 2>dawn as a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That particular finding,</v>

1424
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I think is probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you be cautious about sex at </v>

1425
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.870
<v Speaker 2>dawn as a book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the book is,</v>

1426
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite cherry picked in order to produce </v>

1427
01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:17.981
<v Speaker 2>a particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I regard as a false sophistication </v>

1428
01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:21.850
<v Speaker 2>about human sexual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes us out to be wantonly </v>

1429
01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:25.961
<v Speaker 2>promiscuous across time in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem to actually fit with a more</v>

1430
01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:28.850
<v Speaker 2>careful reading of what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you,</v>

1431
01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:31.490
<v Speaker 2>chris ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you?</v>

1432
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1433
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.420
<v Speaker 1>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1434
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's right.</v>

1435
01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That book is a pretty good strategy for </v>

1436
01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:41.580
<v Speaker 2>getting people to go to bed with you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel sophisticated about.</v>

1437
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Ooh hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll leave that there.</v>

1438
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the chimps hiding in the bushes,</v>

1439
01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beta chimps as it were,</v>

1440
01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:57.690
<v Speaker 1>the males would have to hide their </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality from the alphas because the </v>

1441
01:19:58.031 --> 01:20:03.031
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger males would probably take the </v>

1442
01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:03.520
<v Speaker 1>meat from them and then their likelihood</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reproducing whoops.</v>

1443
01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Would be greaTly diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1444
01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>It would be punished for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get cuffed to.</v>

1445
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get cuffed or,</v>

1446
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:11.310
<v Speaker 1>or more cuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting.</v>

1447
01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>What does cuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:17.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coughed.</v>

1449
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we are.</v>

1450
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get stuck there.</v>

1451
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1452
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my apologies.</v>

1453
01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I should know what that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it before,</v>

1454
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1455
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:36.590
<v Speaker 1>what out of all this can we unpack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1456
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:41.750
<v Speaker 1>about the way we're interpreting what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable and not acceptable about male</v>

1457
01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:46.480
<v Speaker 1>and female interaction in 2018?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

1459
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.870
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be getting redefined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1460
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hot mess.</v>

1461
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with it as like as a </v>

1462
01:20:57.630 --> 01:20:58.620
<v Speaker 1>biologist is a person who understands </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

1463
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1464
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:04.410
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go to me to write the me too.</v>

1465
01:21:04.411 --> 01:21:09.411
<v Speaker 3>Movement looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like an honorable thing at first </v>

1466
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.600
<v Speaker 3>because most men are not nasty human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and don't behave towards women in</v>

1467
01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:22.920
<v Speaker 3>a way that most women have been behaved </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards by men.</v>

1468
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Almost every woman who at all fits </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1469
01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.710
<v Speaker 3>the norms for their culture has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>harassed in some way.</v>

1470
01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were young woman.</v>

1471
01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.890
<v Speaker 3>That is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is true.</v>

1472
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Most men don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also true.</v>

1473
01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 3>So imagining that most men are behaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some kind of a toxic way.</v>

1474
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:43.860
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that word,</v>

1475
01:21:43.861 --> 01:21:48.861
<v Speaker 3>but I'm imagining that because most </v>
<v Speaker 3>women have experienced harassment,</v>

1476
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:53.100
<v Speaker 3>most men are therefore harassing is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>error of logic,</v>

1477
01:21:53.101 --> 01:21:57.540
<v Speaker 3>of statistics of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we go from this place of,</v>

1478
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:59.730
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there some monsters out there?</v>

1479
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it a good moment to reveal some of </v>

1480
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.370
<v Speaker 3>the monstrosity that was happening?</v>

1481
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:10.790
<v Speaker 3>And are there some bright lines like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared to draw a couple of bright </v>

1482
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:14.811
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone deserves not to be touched if </v>

1483
01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:17.571
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to be touched and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone deserves to exist in a </v>

1484
01:22:17.571 --> 01:22:20.610
<v Speaker 3>situation where there are no quid pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>quos a for instance,</v>

1485
01:22:20.611 --> 01:22:25.611
<v Speaker 3>of their employment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to stay employed or if you </v>

1486
01:22:25.611 --> 01:22:25.770
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be an advanced in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>employment,</v>

1487
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.220
<v Speaker 3>then you need going to need to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual thing with me.</v>

1488
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Quid pro quos don't don't be touched </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you don't want to be touched.</v>

1489
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Those things seem honorable and true and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for god's sake,</v>

1490
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:40.910
<v Speaker 3>can't we all agree to those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it went too far and women are </v>

1491
01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:47.211
<v Speaker 3>arguing some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some women are arguing that it doesn't </v>

1492
01:22:47.211 --> 01:22:51.291
<v Speaker 3>matter if innocent men go down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because many women have experienced </v>

1493
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:52.920
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be all men.</v>

1494
01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:58.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were actually hearing from people </v>

1495
01:22:58.730 --> 01:22:59.910
<v Speaker 3>that any boy that you are raising is </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially a rapist.</v>

1496
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1497
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Most men I know couldn't right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

1498
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 3>it's just it's not</v>

1499
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:11.430
<v Speaker 1>what men are so me two went off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rails and it had an opportunity to </v>

1500
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:18.661
<v Speaker 1>actually really wake a lot of good men </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to how ubiquitous the experience of </v>

1501
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.540
<v Speaker 1>walking around on the streets and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>being catcalled and being harassed and </v>

1502
01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:28.261
<v Speaker 1>so on as being groped and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than that is for a woman and it </v>

1503
01:23:28.261 --> 01:23:32.080
<v Speaker 1>took it to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this absurd point where now most I think</v>

1504
01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:33.940
<v Speaker 1>increasingly reasonable people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>

1505
01:23:33.941 --> 01:23:38.941
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then if you're claiming that what </v>

1506
01:23:38.941 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 1>else that you're saying isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that puts the.</v>

1507
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That puts the early stages of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement at risk.</v>

1508
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Now when you see the monsters and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are real,</v>

1509
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:52.210
<v Speaker 1>the male monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters are real and you.</v>

1510
01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:55.780
<v Speaker 1>You see that now when they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed,</v>

1511
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 1>like harvey weinstein is a perth easiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1512
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 1>He's the classic example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1513
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:04.000
<v Speaker 1>When a guy or bill cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when these monsters get exposed,</v>

1514
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing,</v>

1515
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:10.540
<v Speaker 1>but second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that the reason why they</v>

1516
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:15.541
<v Speaker 1>got away with it in the first place was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were able to victimize </v>

1517
01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:19.411
<v Speaker 1>these people and secret and that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they either had enablers or in cosby's </v>

1518
01:24:20.281 --> 01:24:21.610
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was unconscious.</v>

1519
01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some great good to exposing </v>

1520
01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:29.320
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in doing so,</v>

1521
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the overzealous approach of accusing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>men of being potential rapists is an </v>

1522
01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:40.681
<v Speaker 1>adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just an overreaction and the balance </v>

1523
01:24:40.681 --> 01:24:44.341
<v Speaker 1>itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you or do you think that it's more </v>

1524
01:24:44.341 --> 01:24:44.341
<v Speaker 1>complicated than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

1525
01:24:44.341 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna backfire because the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a power grab,</v>

1526
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but won't the backfiring balance itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

1527
01:24:48.611 --> 01:24:53.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people like you or myself or </v>

1528
01:24:53.611 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 1>we're always going to recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference that there are monsters.</v>

1529
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1530
01:24:56.111 --> 01:25:01.111
<v Speaker 1>and we're not going to deny monsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone goes too far and they </v>

1531
01:25:01.111 --> 01:25:02.020
<v Speaker 1>accused garrison keillor of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

1532
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:04.660
<v Speaker 1>When we know that that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1533
01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:09.661
<v Speaker 1>The story doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because most people who I've talked </v>

1534
01:25:09.661 --> 01:25:13.441
<v Speaker 1>to about the garrison keillor story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he was consoling a woman and he </v>

1535
01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:17.050
<v Speaker 1>touched her back and then she pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and he apologized and I didn't mean</v>

1536
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:22.051
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he sent her an email </v>

1537
01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:22.051
<v Speaker 1>apologizing and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no big deal,</v>

1538
01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:22.051
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

1539
01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 1>They were good for awhile and then years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

1540
01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:28.820
<v Speaker 1>right when all this me too thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just decides I remember something </v>

1541
01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:31.400
<v Speaker 1>that was wrong and let's let's take this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy down,</v>

1542
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.210
<v Speaker 1>which didn't make any sense that first </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

1543
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.940
<v Speaker 1>well let's leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't make any sense,</v>

1544
01:25:36.941 --> 01:25:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but where's garrison keillor now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like he hasn't been resurrected,</v>

1545
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:43.380
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been resurrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took his shows off the air.</v>

1546
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:48.410
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to decide whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like him as an artist or creator </v>

1547
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:49.660
<v Speaker 1>just like they actually destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just him,</v>

1548
01:25:49.661 --> 01:25:54.661
<v Speaker 1>but his legacy for a hug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something that at the time both </v>

1549
01:25:54.661 --> 01:25:57.700
<v Speaker 1>parties agreed was no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand it.</v>

1550
01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.270
<v Speaker 1>It's completely unacceptable and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of justice.</v>

1551
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that just getting caught up in the </v>

1552
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.880
<v Speaker 1>hysteria of just like trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>todd.</v>

1553
01:26:06.881 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 1>There's one put that fire out </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

1554
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:15.640
<v Speaker 2>So we have a couple of problems and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the problems is that the folks who </v>

1555
01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:22.580
<v Speaker 2>are advancing this movement and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other parallel,</v>

1556
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I wish they hadn't taken the term social</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice because we need a replacement </v>

1557
01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:33.041
<v Speaker 2>term for that that is not overzealous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those movements have engaged in a </v>

1558
01:26:36.381 --> 01:26:41.381
<v Speaker 2>kind of naive conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making that makes them inevitably </v>

1559
01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:51.190
<v Speaker 2>hijack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get inevitably hijacked by bad </v>

1560
01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:51.500
<v Speaker 2>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

1561
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 2>you are essentially looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

1562
01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:59.291
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must believe all victims,</v>

1563
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:05.380
<v Speaker 2>that's like putting out a neon sign for </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad actors that wished to utilize this </v>

1564
01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1565
01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:11.390
<v Speaker 2>So and there will be bad actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1566
01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Every population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male as a population,</v>

1567
01:27:13.821 --> 01:27:18.821
<v Speaker 2>female population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monstrous males who have been behaving </v>

1568
01:27:18.821 --> 01:27:22.480
<v Speaker 2>predatorily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be women who will take </v>

1569
01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 2>advantage of this and accused people </v>
<v Speaker 2>without reason.</v>

1570
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether the numbers are </v>

1571
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:31.841
<v Speaker 2>robust or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard numbers that somewhere </v>

1572
01:27:31.841 --> 01:27:34.160
<v Speaker 2>between one percent to four percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the population are sociopathic.</v>

1573
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:39.490
<v Speaker 2>If you set up a system in which we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligated to believe every victim,</v>

1574
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 2>then those people will come out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woodwork and they will use this to level</v>

1575
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:50.621
<v Speaker 2>their enemies and so at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that tells you is rule number one,</v>

1576
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:56.360
<v Speaker 2>you cannot make the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must believe all victims or you will</v>

1577
01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:59.870
<v Speaker 2>have lots of people piling into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>category of victim that don't deserve to</v>

1578
01:27:59.871 --> 01:28:04.871
<v Speaker 2>be there and who is hurt most by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only the people who are going to be </v>

1579
01:28:04.971 --> 01:28:09.971
<v Speaker 2>sabotaged by bad actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people who have suffered the </v>

1580
01:28:09.971 --> 01:28:14.530
<v Speaker 2>worst cases of rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are effectively having the terrible</v>

1581
01:28:16.311 --> 01:28:21.311
<v Speaker 2>things that have happened to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>diluted by stories that are either </v>

1582
01:28:21.311 --> 01:28:23.090
<v Speaker 2>fictional or minor that are being lumped</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1583
01:28:23.091 --> 01:28:28.091
<v Speaker 2>So it's further victimization of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a transfer of wellbeing from the </v>

1584
01:28:28.091 --> 01:28:32.801
<v Speaker 2>people who have been most harmed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have been less harmed or are </v>

1585
01:28:32.801 --> 01:28:34.960
<v Speaker 2>cynically using these structures.</v>

1586
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>So if the idea of a me too of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reckoning that has finally come for </v>

1587
01:28:42.861 --> 01:28:47.861
<v Speaker 2>these really terrible guys who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting away with all of this awful </v>

1588
01:28:47.861 --> 01:28:49.310
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that is close to your heart than what</v>

1589
01:28:49.311 --> 01:28:54.311
<v Speaker 2>you should want is a set of rules that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is careful enough and robust enough that</v>

1590
01:28:54.801 --> 01:28:58.820
<v Speaker 2>we can keep holding those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to account what will happen if we</v>

1591
01:28:58.821 --> 01:29:03.821
<v Speaker 2>don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I promise you this from a game </v>

1592
01:29:03.821 --> 01:29:06.561
<v Speaker 2>theoretic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we decide you must believe all </v>

1593
01:29:06.561 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 2>victims and all transgressions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>equally bad,</v>

1594
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:12.720
<v Speaker 2>we're going to turn the thing to 11 for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything from happen.</v>

1595
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how did that happen?</v>

1596
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're cynical,</v>

1597
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it's the type of nuance in part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.880
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a death of nuance because if </v>

1599
01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you're Wielding this thing as a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1600
01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

1601
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 2>What you want to do is turn the tables </v>
<v Speaker 2>on all men.</v>

1602
01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:29.460
<v Speaker 2>If you want to take power and say you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1603
01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a frightening weapon.</v>

1604
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:36.230
<v Speaker 2>So in order to make that weapon </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximally dangerous you,</v>

1605
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:39.420
<v Speaker 2>you equate your cat call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:40.740
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say it's all one.</v>

1607
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.940
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing a woman could ever do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would increase her likelihood of </v>

1608
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:49.200
<v Speaker 2>facing any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1609
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 2>we should cover that in a second because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the,</v>

1610
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:56.301
<v Speaker 2>that's another one of these booby traps </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can very easily say the wrong </v>

1611
01:29:56.581 --> 01:30:01.581
<v Speaker 2>thing and suddenly you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive even though what you said is </v>

1612
01:30:01.581 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 2>very rational,</v>

1613
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:05.750
<v Speaker 3>but also it denies the reality of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>

1614
01:30:05.751 --> 01:30:08.390
<v Speaker 3>female relationships look like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're at all healthy.</v>

1615
01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:12.890
<v Speaker 3>There'S goIng to be risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is risk as you get to know people.</v>

1616
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:14.900
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1617
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:19.790
<v Speaker 3>we're just meeting say instead of having</v>
<v Speaker 3>met in high school so many years ago,</v>

1618
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:23.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I like you yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know if you liked me yet.</v>

1619
01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:28.630
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take some chances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're going to say something </v>

1620
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:28.630
<v Speaker 3>wrong and I'm not going to be thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

1621
01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Are you at fault?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I?</v>

1622
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Do I blame you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I cry?</v>

1623
01:30:33.491 --> 01:30:38.491
<v Speaker 3>Harassment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you said something that didn't </v>

1624
01:30:38.491 --> 01:30:40.891
<v Speaker 3>quite fall right on my ears or did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound right and I kind of like you </v>

1625
01:30:41.351 --> 01:30:42.460
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I go like,</v>

1626
01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:43.880
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1627
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:45.250
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1628
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.380
<v Speaker 3>it really depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1629
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:52.390
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I receive that depends a lot on how </v>

1630
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I feel about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you could say exactly the same</v>

1631
01:30:54.101 --> 01:30:59.101
<v Speaker 3>words and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say it and someone else could </v>

1632
01:30:59.101 --> 01:31:01.981
<v Speaker 3>say it and from that guy I might feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I kind of wished you hadn't said </v>

1633
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:04.951
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that has to mean that that isn't a </v>

1634
01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:07.471
<v Speaker 3>deep problem that he said it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're engaged with something we're </v>

1635
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:08.170
<v Speaker 3>trying to discover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we like each other,</v>

1636
01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:10.090
<v Speaker 3>are we into each other like what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on here?</v>

1637
01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.890
<v Speaker 3>So the process of discovery is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>involve mistake and risk and,</v>

1638
01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.570
<v Speaker 3>and even some sort of game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1639
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:23.580
<v Speaker 3>you're involved in the social game in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which you're trying to figure out who </v>

1640
01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.581
<v Speaker 3>each other are and after the fact saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is kinda gross.</v>

1641
01:31:27.701 --> 01:31:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So the thing that he said was harris </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant.</v>

1642
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1643
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:32.650
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not acceptable.</v>

1644
01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:37.770
<v Speaker 3>It's changing the rules of the game </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on whether or not you liked a </v>

1645
01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:38.020
<v Speaker 3>particular individual and that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit move.</v>

1646
01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to be super careful here.</v>

1647
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>One thing that is true is we are facing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a landscape in which</v>

1648
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:55.580
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think effectively rewriting the rules </v>

1649
01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:59.660
<v Speaker 2>of male female interaction in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sex with strangers perfectly safe.</v>

1650
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with strangers can't be perfectly </v>

1651
01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:09.150
<v Speaker 2>safe in a world in which you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1652
01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's one percent sociopath's </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make a world in which it's </v>

1653
01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:15.970
<v Speaker 2>safe to take a sociopath home and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with them,</v>

1654
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1655
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in order to try to make it safe,</v>

1656
01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>we're going to turn up all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>protections.</v>

1657
01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.310
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1658
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.580
<v Speaker 2>we've got the issue of affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent.</v>

1659
01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmative consent is a great fail safe</v>

1660
01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 2>in a circumstance where you are dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a stranger.</v>

1661
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:46.740
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it would be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>essential because the danger of a </v>

1662
01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:52.351
<v Speaker 2>miscommunication is so great that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be perfectly explicit and there </v>

1663
01:32:52.691 --> 01:32:55.480
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for,</v>

1664
01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:00.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any coyness or subtlety about it.</v>

1665
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:04.540
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to effectively be transactional,</v>

1666
01:33:04.730 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 2>but no courtship that's going to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the history books or literature is </v>

1667
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 2>going to involve affirmative consent at </v>
<v Speaker 2>every stage.</v>

1668
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:12.970
<v Speaker 2>You into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1669
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:13.810
<v Speaker 2>How about now?</v>

1670
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys remember that video that </v>

1671
01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:19.080
<v Speaker 1>they released?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a video that,</v>

1672
01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.200
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who did it,</v>

1673
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:25.500
<v Speaker 1>but as essentially showing how consent </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be sexy and so it shows this </v>

1674
01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:30.871
<v Speaker 1>millennial couple making out and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every few seconds the guy has to ask the</v>

1675
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:35.530
<v Speaker 1>girl if it's okay if he kisses her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1676
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.040
<v Speaker 1>is it okay if I touch you here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay if I take your shirt off?</v>

1677
01:33:39.041 --> 01:33:44.041
<v Speaker 1>And she says not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they keep going and going and </v>

1678
01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:44.530
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the girls asking that guy,</v>

1679
01:33:44.531 --> 01:33:46.810
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay if I do this?</v>

1680
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is imagined.</v>

1681
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1682
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not symmetric phosphorus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1683
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was also an issue with.</v>

1684
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.750
<v Speaker 1>They've sort of abandoned this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a few years ago there was this thing</v>

1685
01:33:58.751 --> 01:34:02.290
<v Speaker 1>where if you had sex with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol was involved,</v>

1686
01:34:02.291 --> 01:34:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you raped them because they could not </v>
<v Speaker 1>consent,</v>

1687
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:06.130
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1688
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:11.131
<v Speaker 1>that means I've been raped a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times because that's ridiculous like it </v>

1689
01:34:11.131 --> 01:34:11.410
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never worked that way.</v>

1690
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want symmetry,</v>

1691
01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:18.090
<v Speaker 1>you would have to say that if the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>has consumed alcohol and the woman </v>

1692
01:34:18.090 --> 01:34:18.250
<v Speaker 1>hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the woman is raping the man.</v>

1693
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to freak you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

1694
01:34:21.730 --> 01:34:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Heather and I have been assuming each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's consent for 30 years.</v>

1695
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have inferred it from cues that were </v>

1696
01:34:31.890 --> 01:34:31.890
<v Speaker 1>not verbal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys didn't discuss.</v>

1697
01:34:31.890 --> 01:34:33.280
<v Speaker 1>What about reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing things down?</v>

1698
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a chalkboard or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1699
01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is the only thing that </v>

1700
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:39.780
<v Speaker 1>keeps us safe from being arrested for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1701
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.650
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've both done it right now.</v>

1702
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1703
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you're both criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1704
01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.210
<v Speaker 1>these changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these shifting of the rules.</v>

1705
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's almost like you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about game theory.</v>

1706
01:34:53.411 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does seem like a type of game.</v>

1707
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:03.040
<v Speaker 2>It is life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a thing where people are </v>

1708
01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.850
<v Speaker 2>looking to call people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking to score,</v>

1709
01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>electing to score a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1710
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:12.821
<v Speaker 2>you're finding someone who's done </v>
<v Speaker 2>something inappropriate or finding </v>

1711
01:35:12.821 --> 01:35:15.791
<v Speaker 2>someone that has done something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be appropriate but is no longer </v>

1712
01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:19.210
<v Speaker 2>and we're looking to establish this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameter and this new way of existing </v>

1713
01:35:19.210 --> 01:35:23.260
<v Speaker 2>and that there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes on this competition element </v>

1714
01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.040
<v Speaker 2>which I'm very familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand competition so I.</v>

1715
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.710
<v Speaker 2>When I see it clearly and I see like </v>
<v Speaker 2>team behavior,</v>

1716
01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1717
01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I see what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not rational thinking.</v>

1718
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:33.200
<v Speaker 2>This is someone who's trying to score </v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

1719
01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:35.310
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to get one on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1720
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely competitive and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly competitive at the moment.</v>

1721
01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:42.230
<v Speaker 2>It looks like said if within women and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to destroy.</v>

1722
01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:44.630
<v Speaker 2>It's actively making male female </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

1723
01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Impossible to navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand it for as a man,</v>

1724
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I get the motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that women overwhelmingly have </v>

1725
01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:58.271
<v Speaker 2>been victimized as opposed to like men </v>
<v Speaker 2>being victimized by women in that </v>

1726
01:35:58.271 --> 01:35:58.580
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of being sexually harassed.</v>

1727
01:35:58.581 --> 01:35:59.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1728
01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:04.830
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most unbalanced things in </v>

1729
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:05.420
<v Speaker 2>our culture ever completely right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's posted in our culture,</v>

1730
01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're talking,</v>

1731
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:11.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we want out of this now that </v>

1732
01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:14.301
<v Speaker 2>we've now that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you want a hundred percent </v>

1733
01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:18.191
<v Speaker 2>safety?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to maximize safety at the </v>

1734
01:36:18.191 --> 01:36:18.200
<v Speaker 2>cost of what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to kill sociopath.</v>

1735
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:19.730
<v Speaker 2>So I want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is,</v>

1736
01:36:19.731 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 2>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want absolute safety,</v>

1737
01:36:22.071 --> 01:36:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1738
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 2>we're getting to the point where this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just robbing.</v>

1739
01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the point of this is to make sex safe</v>

1740
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:33.410
<v Speaker 2>because it's pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to rob all of the pleasure</v>

1741
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.190
<v Speaker 2>from sex.</v>

1742
01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1743
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:39.290
<v Speaker 2>it's getting to the point where you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy to have sex without witnesses.</v>

1744
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1745
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1746
01:36:42.681 --> 01:36:46.160
<v Speaker 2>the point is now that the stuff is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the table right now,</v>

1747
01:36:46.161 --> 01:36:51.161
<v Speaker 2>that we know that there are monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that there are economic forces </v>

1748
01:36:51.161 --> 01:36:55.001
<v Speaker 2>that actually protect these monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which frankly is a big part of this </v>

1749
01:36:55.001 --> 01:36:55.570
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1750
01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Is that the economic structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like hollywood causes this to </v>

1751
01:37:00.831 --> 01:37:05.831
<v Speaker 2>continue with it being effectively an </v>
<v Speaker 2>open secret that these people are </v>

1752
01:37:05.831 --> 01:37:10.320
<v Speaker 2>abusing women and then silencing them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and contractually obligating them not to</v>

1753
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:15.400
<v Speaker 2>do anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that cancer on the social system is</v>

1754
01:37:16.611 --> 01:37:21.611
<v Speaker 2>now open for discussion and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us decent folk know that we have </v>

1755
01:37:22.851 --> 01:37:27.851
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get rid of it though on false </v>

1756
01:37:27.851 --> 01:37:30.911
<v Speaker 2>pretenses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise you the very same game theory </v>

1757
01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.660
<v Speaker 2>that caused it to happen in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place will cause it to reemerge.</v>

1758
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:36.080
<v Speaker 2>The only reason it will be harder to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address the next time.</v>

1759
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overreaction though has pretty much </v>

1760
01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:44.621
<v Speaker 2>calmed down post garrison keillor and al</v>
<v Speaker 2>franken and with al frankin,</v>

1761
01:37:44.841 --> 01:37:48.530
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's some pretty obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>political ramifications to it.</v>

1762
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1763
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't knoW what state it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the nuanced conversation </v>

1764
01:37:56.530 --> 01:38:01.530
<v Speaker 2>breakout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the description of what </v>

1765
01:38:01.530 --> 01:38:05.480
<v Speaker 2>the admin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back up the second scene is a </v>

1766
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.730
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no differences between men and</v>

1767
01:38:07.731 --> 01:38:12.731
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all a social construct who's </v>

1768
01:38:12.731 --> 01:38:14.981
<v Speaker 2>doubling down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where is this happening and the </v>

1769
01:38:14.981 --> 01:38:14.981
<v Speaker 2>universities where the universities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's spreading.</v>

1770
01:38:14.981 --> 01:38:14.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1771
01:38:14.981 --> 01:38:19.160
<v Speaker 2>this is what the replies to the google </v>
<v Speaker 2>memo we're about.</v>

1772
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1773
01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.270
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't google in a sense an extension</v>

1774
01:38:23.271 --> 01:38:25.180
<v Speaker 2>of the universities in that regard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1775
01:38:25.181 --> 01:38:25.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's everywhere.</v>

1776
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.900
<v Speaker 2>But it's also a defacto governance </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

1777
01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:31.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very frightening.</v>

1778
01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

1779
01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking this morning about a how </v>
<v Speaker 2>a jury of your peers.</v>

1780
01:38:40.210 --> 01:38:45.210
<v Speaker 2>That phrase is now increasingly erie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which peers are they peers that believed</v>

1781
01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.980
<v Speaker 2>some false,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1782
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:54.250
<v Speaker 2>some false story about what human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>are or are these people who are going to</v>

1783
01:38:54.251 --> 01:38:59.251
<v Speaker 2>be able to hear a story that has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuance in some gray area in it and take </v>

1784
01:38:59.531 --> 01:39:01.300
<v Speaker 2>it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact is people,</v>

1785
01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.580
<v Speaker 2>if you look at what advertisers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>using to access people,</v>

1786
01:39:06.581 --> 01:39:09.550
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the narratives that exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>in movies,</v>

1787
01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.930
<v Speaker 2>people are capable of understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subtlety of human interactions,</v>

1788
01:39:13.931 --> 01:39:18.931
<v Speaker 2>but they are either pretending or </v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing themselves in the public </v>

1789
01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:21.220
<v Speaker 2>space that things are way simpler than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually are.</v>

1790
01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.000
<v Speaker 2>And what I don't want to see and what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

1791
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:26.950
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dog in this fight.</v>

1792
01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm happily married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking for anything else,</v>

1793
01:39:33.710 --> 01:39:37.450
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do want to see this solved in tiMe foR</v>

1794
01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:40.240
<v Speaker 2>our chIldren to face a landscape that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

1795
01:39:40.241 --> 01:39:43.590
<v Speaker 2>And I would like are many students who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have talked to us about the,</v>

1796
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the confusion of trying to navigate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>romance in the current circumstance.</v>

1797
01:39:48.341 --> 01:39:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I would like them to what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie came out yesterday,</v>

1798
01:39:51.871 --> 01:39:56.871
<v Speaker 2>said you guys are talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it affects what you're </v>

1799
01:39:56.871 --> 01:39:59.031
<v Speaker 2>talking about currently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how an outright bought network took </v>

1800
01:39:59.031 --> 01:39:59.700
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Al franken was on newsweek.</v>

1801
01:39:59.701 --> 01:40:04.701
<v Speaker 2>They found it started actually in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they traced the whole thing of like </v>

1802
01:40:04.701 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 2>the day before Roger Stone tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about al franken even starting</v>

1803
01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.380
<v Speaker 2>to be taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they traced the whole interaction of</v>

1804
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:14.670
<v Speaker 2>bots on twitter doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this all for a couple of weeks.</v>

1805
01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does actual women that said he </v>

1806
01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:21.870
<v Speaker 2>grabbed there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that's this.</v>

1807
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:24.120
<v Speaker 2>They asked him for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked him for comment and he didn't</v>

1808
01:40:24.121 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 2>respond yet because this was just within</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 24 hours.</v>

1809
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what we should do with the </v>

1810
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.281
<v Speaker 2>franken story because the franken story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not empty the way the garrison </v>

1811
01:40:34.531 --> 01:40:36.780
<v Speaker 2>keillor story appears to be totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>empty.</v>

1812
01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:41.781
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I think this is probably why </v>

1813
01:40:41.781 --> 01:40:45.140
<v Speaker 2>jamie put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to think carefully when you're </v>

1814
01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:48.951
<v Speaker 2>talking about a senator being brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on the basis of these claims that </v>

1815
01:40:54.971 --> 01:40:59.971
<v Speaker 2>are tied up in a movement which does not</v>
<v Speaker 2>appear nuanced about the degree of harm </v>

1816
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 2>done and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is something at stake.</v>

1817
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Just you know when there is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination,</v>

1818
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:11.410
<v Speaker 2>you have to ask yourself who benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the absence of this person?</v>

1819
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the political aSsassination is not </v>

1820
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.950
<v Speaker 2>a normal murder.</v>

1821
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:19.240
<v Speaker 2>It is a political act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shifts the balance of something.</v>

1822
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.120
<v Speaker 2>This is not an assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it functions like one.</v>

1823
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:27.150
<v Speaker 2>It takes a political actor who stood for</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things and against other things </v>

1824
01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:31.411
<v Speaker 2>and represented certain constituencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for others it takes them off the </v>

1825
01:41:31.411 --> 01:41:32.710
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when that happens,</v>

1826
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:37.980
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually an extension of what we </v>

1827
01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:38.710
<v Speaker 2>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad actor problem before a bad actor</v>

1828
01:41:38.711 --> 01:41:43.711
<v Speaker 2>can be a sociopath that wants to advance</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own cause or take out a,</v>

1829
01:41:43.901 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 2>an enemy or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can also be a,</v>

1830
01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:53.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a political apparatus or a corporate </v>

1831
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.480
<v Speaker 2>entity that wishes to shift the balance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the political body like theu ,</v>

1832
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 2>s senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to be mindful.</v>

1833
01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.000
<v Speaker 2>It is yet another reason that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>build naive really.</v>

1834
01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:07.340
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very good point because we </v>

1835
01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.621
<v Speaker 2>don't know the motivation of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who came out and we don't know if it's </v>

1836
01:42:09.621 --> 01:42:09.621
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>

1837
01:42:09.621 --> 01:42:09.840
<v Speaker 2>He says it's not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1838
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:14.990
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's the price point for a botnet </v>

1839
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.480
<v Speaker 2>that can cause the internet to turn on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1840
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the entry point to that story was he</v>

1841
01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:22.020
<v Speaker 2>took a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedic picture.</v>

1842
01:42:22.210 --> 01:42:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Pretend someone's breasts pretending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1843
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it in good taste now,</v>

1844
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:28.680
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1845
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:30.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a little more to that.</v>

1846
01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:35.690
<v Speaker 2>She actually said that he kissed her </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were doing some sort of a </v>

1847
01:42:35.690 --> 01:42:40.011
<v Speaker 2>sketch together and he insisted on </v>
<v Speaker 2>kissing and then he wants to be wanting </v>

1848
01:42:40.291 --> 01:42:42.960
<v Speaker 2>to practice the kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She found inappropriate.</v>

1849
01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I,</v>

1850
01:42:44.761 --> 01:42:45.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1851
01:42:45.381 --> 01:42:50.381
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't love the franken story as an </v>

1852
01:42:50.381 --> 01:42:51.630
<v Speaker 2>example here because it's murky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1853
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garrison keillor,</v>

1854
01:42:53.941 --> 01:42:58.941
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very careful to make sure not to accept </v>

1855
01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you're damned if you do and damned if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like garrison keillor is the </v>

1856
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.280
<v Speaker 2>only one that seems completely clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can basically guarantee you </v>

1857
01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.560
<v Speaker 2>statistically that there are good men </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are being taken down.</v>

1858
01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the last time I was on,</v>

1859
01:43:16.130 --> 01:43:21.130
<v Speaker 2>we talked about matt taibbi and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know one way or the other.</v>

1860
01:43:21.621 --> 01:43:26.621
<v Speaker 2>I don't know matt taibbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that story also looked to me like </v>

1861
01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:30.311
<v Speaker 2>one in which the portrayal was </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufactured and he has now just won a </v>

1862
01:43:30.891 --> 01:43:34.280
<v Speaker 2>settlement from the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The basis of this.</v>

1863
01:43:34.281 --> 01:43:37.700
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one appears to have gone in.</v>

1864
01:43:37.701 --> 01:43:40.630
<v Speaker 2>What I imagine is the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1865
01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:42.950
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's positive,</v>

1866
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:45.530
<v Speaker 2>but I want to return to an earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1867
01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.990
<v Speaker 2>We are talking about what the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction should.</v>

1868
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:56.320
<v Speaker 2>It is good that we are talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's good that we're finally </v>

1869
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.321
<v Speaker 2>addressing the issue of monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why this didn't get a set loose by bill </v>

1870
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:06.101
<v Speaker 2>cosby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because that one appeared </v>

1871
01:44:06.101 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>crystal clear to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Built that one.</v>

1872
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.480
<v Speaker 2>It started off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1873
01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say as a person who worked as an </v>

1874
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.531
<v Speaker 2>actor for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about that story in the </v>

1875
01:44:17.531 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of those weird ones where</v>

1876
01:44:18.231 --> 01:44:23.231
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know if it was like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>richard gere journal story because that </v>

1877
01:44:23.231 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1878
01:44:23.650 --> 01:44:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I had heard that bill cosby does </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to women like,</v>

1879
01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1880
01:44:27.730 --> 01:44:30.710
<v Speaker 2>it's so beyond the pale that feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't.</v>

1881
01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you know,</v>

1882
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:34.630
<v Speaker 2>when it's 50 women that come out and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug them go,</v>

1883
01:44:34.690 --> 01:44:36.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's going on.</v>

1884
01:44:36.071 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Becomes clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is,</v>

1885
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:39.230
<v Speaker 2>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a case like that,</v>

1886
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:45.250
<v Speaker 2>what would have to be true for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories to be false is pretty extreme.</v>

1887
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.610
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1888
01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:48.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's also him.</v>

1889
01:44:48.531 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 2>There's evidence of him mocking drugging</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1890
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1891
01:44:52.071 --> 01:44:54.920
<v Speaker 2>he did an episode of the cosby show </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he drug people.</v>

1892
01:44:55.250 --> 01:45:00.250
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would talk about it on talk shows </v>

1893
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:00.250
<v Speaker 2>about drugging girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1894
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:03.080
<v Speaker 2>he most likely was guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1895
01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I think there's no question and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to.</v>

1896
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:08.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't need the due process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this crazy.</v>

1897
01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.450
<v Speaker 2>If it was the most complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy of all time,</v>

1898
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:14.980
<v Speaker 2>of all these gals got together and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we should do it.</v>

1899
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Make some noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

1900
01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll make up the same story for decades </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1901
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:23.770
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be some sort of evidence of </v>

1902
01:45:23.770 --> 01:45:23.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1903
01:45:23.770 --> 01:45:25.490
<v Speaker 2>so in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in harvey weinstein's case,</v>

1904
01:45:25.491 --> 01:45:30.491
<v Speaker 2>and I think in matt lauer's case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence is so overwhelming that it </v>

1905
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:36.040
<v Speaker 2>overrides our need as members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public to see,</v>

1906
01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:41.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to withhold judgment until due process </v>

1907
01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:41.250
<v Speaker 2>has unfolded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

1908
01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:45.461
<v Speaker 2>there's a place at which that stops </v>
<v Speaker 2>right at which things are murky enough </v>

1909
01:45:45.461 --> 01:45:49.961
<v Speaker 2>that you have to wait for due process </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that this movement is </v>

1910
01:45:49.961 --> 01:45:53.291
<v Speaker 2>actually not really interested in due </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and it's in fact it challenged </v>

1911
01:45:53.291 --> 01:45:55.610
<v Speaker 2>his due process and says you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe victims,</v>

1912
01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asking for evidence is augmenting the </v>

1913
01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>problem is victim blaming or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1914
01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thIs is a terrible error.</v>

1915
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:08.060
<v Speaker 2>And so if we are to get to a state that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense,</v>

1916
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:13.630
<v Speaker 2>it has to be one in which monsters are </v>
<v Speaker 2>held to account in which there's nuance </v>

1917
01:46:14.451 --> 01:46:19.451
<v Speaker 2>and degrees of guilt and that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw everybody out piece.</v>

1918
01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Some people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't imagine that bill cosby can </v>

1919
01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.300
<v Speaker 2>be rehabilitated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But could al franken be rehabilitated?</v>

1920
01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:28.280
<v Speaker 2>If that's the story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he could be.</v>

1921
01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing where we get to a </v>

1922
01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:33.520
<v Speaker 2>certain age where we no longer thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can grow.</v>

1923
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like if he was 20 avow frank and </v>

1924
01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:39.410
<v Speaker 2>took that picture when he was 20 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be like,</v>

1925
01:46:39.411 --> 01:46:41.120
<v Speaker 2>that's silly kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing?</v>

1926
01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not something that's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if that was your mom,</v>

1927
01:46:43.610 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 2>mom swore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you learn and you grow,</v>

1928
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:50.950
<v Speaker 2>but for those of us who I'm value </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty,</v>

1929
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:58.310
<v Speaker 2>a situation in which we re organize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire landscape to make sex with </v>

1930
01:46:59.011 --> 01:47:04.011
<v Speaker 2>strangers as safe as it can possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a landscape that is good for</v>

1931
01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:10.761
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to make a landscape in which </v>

1932
01:47:10.761 --> 01:47:10.830
<v Speaker 2>people who want to do that are free to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

1933
01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 2>but not everybody is compelled to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>that game.</v>

1934
01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:19.460
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who want to engage in some kind </v>

1935
01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:22.910
<v Speaker 2>of courtship that is more nuanced and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly fun and deeper and more subtle </v>

1936
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:30.150
<v Speaker 2>are free to engage in that and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't be perfectly safe either,</v>

1937
01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:35.340
<v Speaker 2>but what we should want is a landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>in which we generate safety for people </v>

1938
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.720
<v Speaker 2>at the level that doesn't cost us </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly in terms of how </v>

1939
01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 2>civilization functions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we need to actually say also,</v>

1940
01:47:46.890 --> 01:47:51.890
<v Speaker 2>and this was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another tough point where I'm </v>

1941
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:52.440
<v Speaker 2>worried that people will hear it in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>monolithic way,</v>

1942
01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:57.770
<v Speaker 2>but the following thing is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe a woman,</v>

1943
01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:03.180
<v Speaker 2>if civilization functioned well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman should be able to put on the </v>

1944
01:48:05.551 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 2>minimum close that the law will allow to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover herself in oil,</v>

1945
01:48:10.231 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 2>to walk through town in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

1946
01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying things that indicate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's hot to trot.</v>

1947
01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 2>If she can find the right guy and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be safe to do it,</v>

1948
01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.910
<v Speaker 2>but a woman would have to be insane to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1949
01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:27.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we should want a civilization issues,</v>

1950
01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.960
<v Speaker 2>legal protection for her to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sane person should choose to do it </v>

1951
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 2>because because people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's no sane person,</v>

1952
01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:43.010
<v Speaker 2>would choose to flip bmx bikes on the x </v>
<v Speaker 2>games and no sane person would choose to</v>

1953
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:47.190
<v Speaker 2>jump out of planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should allow them the right to do</v>

1954
01:48:47.191 --> 01:48:52.191
<v Speaker 2>so for that thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push back on that a lIttle </v>

1955
01:48:52.191 --> 01:48:55.161
<v Speaker 2>bit and say risk taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you are putting yourself at risk </v>

1956
01:48:55.161 --> 01:49:00.141
<v Speaker 2>and you aren't involving someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is going to see your signals and </v>

1957
01:49:00.141 --> 01:49:03.681
<v Speaker 2>maybe act on them and then is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have acted on signals that you shouldn't</v>

1958
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:05.310
<v Speaker 2>have been sending in the first place.</v>

1959
01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bmx bike jumping out of a plan,</v>

1960
01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:14.550
<v Speaker 2>risk taking is a more common in men than</v>
<v Speaker 2>women on average across cultures.</v>

1961
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to say that a lot of women don't </v>

1962
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:19.950
<v Speaker 2>take risks and have fun doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Physical risks,</v>

1963
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:24.590
<v Speaker 2>but absolutely as risk taking adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and enjoyable and interesting.</v>

1964
01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:29.610
<v Speaker 2>and if you're risk taking results in you</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying and no one else getting hurt,</v>

1965
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:32.100
<v Speaker 2>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is the man getting her?</v>

1966
01:49:32.101 --> 01:49:34.500
<v Speaker 2>If the woman is taking these risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking on this tree,</v>

1967
01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 2>oiled up with a bikini on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling out that she's randy.</v>

1968
01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.680
<v Speaker 2>If there's a chance that later he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>held accountable for the kid that </v>

1969
01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.791
<v Speaker 2>results or she changed her mind or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that the claim is,</v>

1970
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>especially in</v>

1971
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.320
<v Speaker 3>this current climate of believable </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

1972
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 3>that is potentially a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

1973
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I see where it would be more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 3>than just jumping out of a plane and </v>

1974
01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 3>parachuting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still voluntary risk taking,</v>

1975
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:06.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are involved involving another </v>

1976
01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:06.810
<v Speaker 3>person who's also voluntarily getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in that.</v>

1977
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:10.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately there's no.</v>

1978
01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:16.380
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be no set rule that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can establish that neutralizes these </v>

1979
01:50:18.791 --> 01:50:19.570
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1980
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>you go to disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been to disneyland in decades,</v>

1981
01:50:22.541 --> 01:50:24.890
<v Speaker 2>but you should go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice right now.</v>

1982
01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 2>It's fun place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go to disneyland,</v>

1983
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 2>everything has been rendered perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>

1984
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:36.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have been through it with a fine </v>

1985
01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:38.431
<v Speaker 2>tooth comb so that nothing bad can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you and you can have all of </v>

1986
01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:39.700
<v Speaker 2>this excitement on the rides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing bad is gonna happen to you.</v>

1987
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:43.600
<v Speaker 2>We cannot turn civilization into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of landscape.</v>

1988
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:48.750
<v Speaker 2>The price of turning it into a landscape</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which you can be a moron and walk </v>

1989
01:50:49.031 --> 01:50:50.910
<v Speaker 2>through life and nothing bad is gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you.</v>

1990
01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.600
<v Speaker 2>That price is way too high.</v>

1991
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:54.700
<v Speaker 3>This is it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean this,</v>

1992
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:58.840
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this moment in time in 2018 is a natural</v>

1993
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:02.430
<v Speaker 3>outgrowth of things like helicopter </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting where you pray,</v>

1994
01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.890
<v Speaker 3>you keep your children from all possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>danger,</v>

1995
01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:11.190
<v Speaker 3>all possible physical risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you then end up with children who </v>

1996
01:51:11.190 --> 01:51:14.470
<v Speaker 3>find a fence at and feel unsafe in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>manner of situations.</v>

1997
01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:19.860
<v Speaker 3>It is impossible to be an adult if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do trial and error and it's </v>

1998
01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:23.431
<v Speaker 3>impossible to become a sexual adult if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't engage in some trial and </v>

1999
01:51:23.431 --> 01:51:23.431
<v Speaker 3>error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That involves a little bit of risk and I</v>

2000
01:51:23.431 --> 01:51:25.780
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want physical risk and sexual.</v>

2001
01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I'M a play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is going to be some </v>

2002
01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:37.410
<v Speaker 3>experimenting with those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be some even meeting </v>

2003
01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:37.410
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2004
01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:37.880
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some,</v>

2005
01:51:37.890 --> 01:51:42.890
<v Speaker 3>and I think the totally non fraught </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of this is that we took our kids</v>

2006
01:51:43.001 --> 01:51:48.001
<v Speaker 3>and a 30 undergraduates to the amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's one of the most </v>

2007
01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.570
<v Speaker 3>biodiverse places on earth and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary.</v>

2008
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:51.880
<v Speaker 3>And for evolutionary biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't you go if you could?</v>

2009
01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:58.510
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of our friends thought you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking this little boy's amazon.</v>

2010
01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:03.510
<v Speaker 3>The first time we took them there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 and eight and you know,</v>

2011
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:04.220
<v Speaker 3>we waited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted,</v>

2012
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.630
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to take them sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2013
01:52:05.631 --> 01:52:10.631
<v Speaker 3>so I was leading the study abroad trips </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier and brett said they're too </v>

2014
01:52:10.631 --> 01:52:10.631
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2015
01:52:10.631 --> 01:52:14.101
<v Speaker 3>basically they're too young for us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give them the shots that western </v>

2016
01:52:14.101 --> 01:52:14.200
<v Speaker 3>civilization has afforded us to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2017
01:52:14.201 --> 01:52:15.220
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2018
01:52:15.370 --> 01:52:17.320
<v Speaker 3>to keep them safe with things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow fever</v>

2019
01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:22.890
<v Speaker 2>too young to deal with the instructions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you need to actually remain.</v>

2020
01:52:23.210 --> 01:52:26.900
<v Speaker 3>So say from jaguars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jaguars are not the issue.</v>

2021
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:30.080
<v Speaker 3>It's more like three falls under it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees falling on you.</v>

2022
01:52:30.081 --> 01:52:34.370
<v Speaker 3>It's water that rises quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly at the point we took them,</v>

2023
01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:38.090
<v Speaker 3>we talked to them a lot in advance as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to our students in advance.</v>

2024
01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And then we trusted them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our younger son found a gigantic coral </v>

2025
01:52:43.941 --> 01:52:48.941
<v Speaker 3>snake at one point and walking ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us on the trail along with the guide </v>

2026
01:52:48.941 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 3>that we happen to have with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he ran back and I'm,</v>

2027
01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>the guide ran forward and actually pin </v>
<v Speaker 3>the snakes so we could see it.</v>

2028
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2029
01:52:55.340 --> 01:53:00.340
<v Speaker 3>that was a danger that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and god forbid something had happened,</v>

2030
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:02.780
<v Speaker 3>it would be very hard for us to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>with ourselves,</v>

2031
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:08.260
<v Speaker 3>had that gone differently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've exposed your children to </v>

2032
01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:10.220
<v Speaker 3>risks so that they can then know what to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do in risk happens to them.</v>

2033
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:15.580
<v Speaker 3>You expose yourself to sexual situations</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't stranger sex so that you can</v>

2034
01:53:16.971 --> 01:53:21.110
<v Speaker 3>know how to build courtship and romance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and love and sex later on,</v>

2035
01:53:22.050 --> 01:53:23.600
<v Speaker 3>like friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a trial and error.</v>

2036
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2037
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 3>So there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we learn what</v>

2038
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:32.530
<v Speaker 2>we learn in order to manage the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our developmental environments have to </v>

2039
01:53:32.530 --> 01:53:36.821
<v Speaker 2>give us model situations that are close </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to the situations that we run </v>

2040
01:53:37.371 --> 01:53:40.610
<v Speaker 2>into as adults that we have the tools to</v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate them.</v>

2041
01:53:40.611 --> 01:53:43.310
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2042
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I think very difficult things to accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a parent is that if your child is </v>

2043
01:53:50.871 --> 01:53:53.480
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to manage risk as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult,</v>

2044
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:56.570
<v Speaker 2>they cannot be made perfectly safe as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

2045
01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:01.600
<v Speaker 2>which means that you are running the </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk that something disastrous will </v>

2046
01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:02.480
<v Speaker 2>happen and that you'll have to live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2047
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:06.980
<v Speaker 2>If you make your child perfectly safe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood,</v>

2048
01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:10.700
<v Speaker 2>they will be terrible at managing risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>as adults and then something terrible is</v>

2049
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:12.230
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2050
01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:13.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2051
01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:16.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I operate on,</v>

2052
01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:20.720
<v Speaker 2>or maybe I'm reverse engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the way I think I've learned how to</v>

2053
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:25.370
<v Speaker 2>behave is something I call a the theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>of close calls,</v>

2054
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:30.730
<v Speaker 2>which is that you don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster strike.</v>

2055
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:32.330
<v Speaker 2>And in facT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've told our children,</v>

2056
01:54:32.331 --> 01:54:32.930
<v Speaker 2>we've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2057
01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:35.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't want you to break your arm or </v>
<v Speaker 2>your leg,</v>

2058
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:41.710
<v Speaker 2>but you may have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may end up doing it and you're </v>

2059
01:54:41.710 --> 01:54:44.231
<v Speaker 2>allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are the things you're not allowed </v>

2060
01:54:44.231 --> 01:54:44.870
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to damage your skull.</v>

2061
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:49.190
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to damage your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to damage your back.</v>

2062
01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You protect those who protect those </v>

2063
01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:56.531
<v Speaker 2>things at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually when we took the students </v>

2064
01:54:56.531 --> 01:54:56.531
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2065
01:54:56.531 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 2>to Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

2066
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really the only rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we called it the one rule and it was</v>

2067
01:55:02.151 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 2>really the central guiding principle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trip,</v>

2068
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:07.880
<v Speaker 2>which was 11 week trip through all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems and Ecuador.</v>

2069
01:55:07.881 --> 01:55:10.490
<v Speaker 2>It's really long extended trip with </v>
<v Speaker 2>students that we knew,</v>

2070
01:55:10.491 --> 01:55:15.491
<v Speaker 2>well we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had been with them all year and we </v>

2071
01:55:15.491 --> 01:55:15.491
<v Speaker 2>had cultivated community so we knew him </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2072
01:55:15.491 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 2>And what we said is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2073
01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of things are gonna happen.</v>

2074
01:55:19.821 --> 01:55:21.770
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have to navigate on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly.</v>

2075
01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Nobody comes home in a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody comes home in a box.</v>

2076
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:29.690
<v Speaker 2>And we actually had three close calls on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this trip.</v>

2077
01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people told us actually that when </v>

2078
01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:37.550
<v Speaker 2>they experienced serious danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing actually occurred to them.</v>

2079
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Nobody comes home in a box and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like sober them up.</v>

2080
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 2>But to go back to the theory of close </v>
<v Speaker 2>calls,</v>

2081
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:49.130
<v Speaker 2>you can't learn how not to get run over </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a car,</v>

2082
01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:52.800
<v Speaker 2>by getting somewhat run over by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2083
01:55:53.070 --> 01:55:56.260
<v Speaker 2>But you can learn from your close calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had a,</v>

2084
01:55:56.410 --> 01:55:57.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good friend,</v>

2085
01:55:57.481 --> 01:56:01.050
<v Speaker 2>actually somebody that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So heather and I were not dating in high</v>

2086
01:56:01.051 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were friends.</v>

2087
01:56:01.981 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 2>We went to the same high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody we knew in high school.</v>

2088
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:09.590
<v Speaker 2>It happened to go to the same college </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I started at penn and we were </v>

2089
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:13.551
<v Speaker 2>walking down the street one day and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepped into the street thinking it was </v>

2090
01:56:15.751 --> 01:56:19.650
<v Speaker 2>clear and this car whizzed by her at 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour,</v>

2091
01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:21.850
<v Speaker 2>didn't touch her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2092
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:27.050
<v Speaker 2>and so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about something like </v>

2093
01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:27.570
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was unscratched,</v>

2094
01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:31.290
<v Speaker 2>but had she been one second ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she was,</v>

2095
01:56:31.291 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 2>she would have probably been dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you could think,</v>

2096
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:39.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must be doing something right because </v>

2097
01:56:39.891 --> 01:56:42.381
<v Speaker 2>I got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you could be thinking the difference </v>

2098
01:56:42.381 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 2>between my death and not being scratched</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case wasn't something that I did</v>

2099
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:47.070
<v Speaker 2>with any sort of intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pure luck.</v>

2100
01:56:47.071 --> 01:56:51.240
<v Speaker 2>That saved my life right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore I need to figure out how it is</v>

2101
01:56:51.241 --> 01:56:55.080
<v Speaker 2>that I stepped off that curb without </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing that that car was coming.</v>

2102
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:57.570
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong in my model of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to live that,</v>

2103
01:56:57.571 --> 01:57:00.630
<v Speaker 2>that I could have gotten that close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you experienced close calls,</v>

2104
01:57:00.631 --> 01:57:04.860
<v Speaker 2>they tell you something about where your</v>
<v Speaker 2>model is broken and you can fix it.</v>

2105
01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:10.070
<v Speaker 2>And so I think what heather's getting at</v>
<v Speaker 2>is learning how to interact with other </v>

2106
01:57:10.351 --> 01:57:15.351
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're talking about </v>

2107
01:57:15.351 --> 01:57:17.241
<v Speaker 2>high stakes stuff like romance and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to have some room to figure out</v>

2108
01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:23.931
<v Speaker 2>how these relationships are negotiated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the point is these rules are </v>

2109
01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:29.780
<v Speaker 2>going to be negotiated by some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are going to lay down the law and </v>

2110
01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:31.290
<v Speaker 2>say you must seek affirmative consent </v>
<v Speaker 2>every 37 seconds.</v>

2111
01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:36.560
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to teach anyBody how you </v>

2112
01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 2>actually manage with another human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

2113
01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how you teach that to a</v>

2114
01:57:46.231 --> 01:57:50.670
<v Speaker 2>child to manage risk versus reward in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

2115
01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2116
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.700
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know?</v>

2117
01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:59.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we hope is that </v>

2118
01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:01.341
<v Speaker 2>they gained some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of human interaction when </v>

2119
01:58:01.341 --> 01:58:03.120
<v Speaker 2>they're in their teen years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there are still at home,</v>

2120
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.840
<v Speaker 2>then they're protected somewhat when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to college.</v>

2121
01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And then as they go out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2122
01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:12.090
<v Speaker 2>it's tough how much information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they accumulated.</v>

2123
01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:17.180
<v Speaker 2>You have to let them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them do it and allow them to judge </v>

2124
01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:19.200
<v Speaker 2>for god's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this don't judge thing going on.</v>

2125
01:58:19.201 --> 01:58:20.750
<v Speaker 2>You know they will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2126
01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:25.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no exclusion of anyone at any time on </v>

2127
01:58:25.810 --> 01:58:26.670
<v Speaker 2>the school yard and don't judge anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what they say,</v>

2128
01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:29.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad for the kid that gets judged.</v>

2129
01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:34.250
<v Speaker 2>That's because there's some behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sucks and they need to know that </v>

2130
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.310
<v Speaker 2>it's very uncomfortable for other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be around you when you're like that,</v>

2131
01:58:35.311 --> 01:58:40.311
<v Speaker 2>and that's how you understand social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction and this is a big part of </v>

2132
01:58:40.311 --> 01:58:41.860
<v Speaker 2>how kids grow into adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how humAns become humans.</v>

2133
01:58:41.861 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2134
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.460
<v Speaker 1>not just top down from parents and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers.</v>

2135
01:58:45.461 --> 01:58:50.461
<v Speaker 1>It's largely from peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what you said about helicopter </v>

2136
01:58:50.461 --> 01:58:50.461
<v Speaker 1>parenting because I think you're totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2137
01:58:50.461 --> 01:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that is part of what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2138
01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I think part of what's going on here </v>
<v Speaker 1>also is this new found ability to </v>

2139
01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.970
<v Speaker 1>complain and communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful in the fact that you </v>

2140
01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:00.400
<v Speaker 1>could exchange information at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible pace.</v>

2141
01:59:00.401 --> 01:59:05.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll never had anything remotely like </v>

2142
01:59:05.401 --> 01:59:05.401
<v Speaker 1>this in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's terrible.</v>

2143
01:59:05.401 --> 01:59:06.130
<v Speaker 1>In the fact that it's hard to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's noise,</v>

2144
01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 1>there's so much chatter going on and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a dummy,</v>

2145
01:59:08.891 --> 01:59:13.891
<v Speaker 1>you could find other dummies that think </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you and you organize a very </v>

2146
01:59:13.891 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 1>volatile group and you reinforced </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias.</v>

2147
01:59:16.811 --> 01:59:20.980
<v Speaker 1>You all get together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We interact on a forum and there's a few</v>

2148
01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 1>forums that are frequent that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with.</v>

2149
01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 1>They're just echo chambers and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing and like,</v>

2150
01:59:27.041 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody that thinks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this but are here.</v>

2151
01:59:29.411 --> 01:59:34.411
<v Speaker 1>They are all collected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced that there is no biological </v>

2152
01:59:34.411 --> 01:59:35.710
<v Speaker 1>difference in the sexes and that a trans</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is a woman.</v>

2153
01:59:35.711 --> 01:59:38.650
<v Speaker 1>If you don't date trans women that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bigot.</v>

2154
01:59:38.930 --> 01:59:42.070
<v Speaker 1>You know even if you're a heterosexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>male and she has a penis,</v>

2155
01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of squirrelly thinking </v>

2156
01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:49.621
<v Speaker 1>going on and it's reinforced by others </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start thinking you're right and </v>

2157
01:59:49.621 --> 01:59:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that you are the future and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there that are living in this</v>

2158
01:59:52.661 --> 01:59:54.010
<v Speaker 1>archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient way,</v>

2159
01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 1>they there are artifacts of the past and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will soon be relegated.</v>

2160
01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:59.420
<v Speaker 2>The history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2161
01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:02.660
<v Speaker 2>there's a summary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't good enough there.</v>

2162
02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:07.730
<v Speaker 2>there is a a property of our current </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives that people just need to be more </v>

2163
02:00:10.221 --> 02:00:13.100
<v Speaker 2>aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We arrive at the present.</v>

2164
02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:18.130
<v Speaker 2>We are partially updated by various </v>
<v Speaker 2>features like school for modern </v>

2165
02:00:19.491 --> 02:00:23.210
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are also partially throwbacks and</v>

2166
02:00:23.211 --> 02:00:25.890
<v Speaker 2>we aren't throwbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evolutionary psychology,</v>

2167
02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:30.940
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has aired in imagining that we are </v>

2168
02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:32.981
<v Speaker 2>simply stone age hunter gatherers </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering around civilization,</v>

2169
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:36.590
<v Speaker 2>but we are throwbacks to various places </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our past,</v>

2170
02:00:36.591 --> 02:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>some of them recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>

2171
02:00:37.821 --> 02:00:42.821
<v Speaker 2>much more remote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we face is an epidemic of </v>

2172
02:00:43.191 --> 02:00:48.191
<v Speaker 2>novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So novelty Is all of the stuff that we </v>

2173
02:00:48.381 --> 02:00:53.381
<v Speaker 2>don't have programming on board to </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate all of the stuff that your </v>

2174
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:57.020
<v Speaker 2>instincts don't tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The foods you know,</v>

2175
02:00:57.021 --> 02:01:02.021
<v Speaker 2>the refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporation that wants to advertise </v>

2176
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:07.450
<v Speaker 2>the cereal to your child so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat more of it than they should or they </v>

2177
02:01:07.450 --> 02:01:08.280
<v Speaker 2>eat different stuff than they would be.</v>

2178
02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Novelty makes us sick and novelty can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make you physically sick.</v>

2179
02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It can make you psychologically sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can make you socially sick,</v>

2180
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:21.140
<v Speaker 2>and we can also be the source of great </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

2181
02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Evolution can deal with novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not at the rate of change that is </v>

2182
02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:29.891
<v Speaker 2>happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rate of change is so high that our </v>

2183
02:01:29.891 --> 02:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary capacity to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty is outstripped.</v>

2184
02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:33.020
<v Speaker 2>And so I do want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2185
02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:35.390
<v Speaker 2>there is a way in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2186
02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just listened to little sound </v>

2187
02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:42.411
<v Speaker 2>soundbites from what we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get the wrong idea that were </v>

2188
02:01:42.411 --> 02:01:44.660
<v Speaker 2>very traditional and in fact our </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship isn't traditional at all.</v>

2189
02:01:45.010 --> 02:01:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I asked him to carry the second </v>

2190
02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:50.010
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't do it.</v>

2191
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I would after he was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quite a lot.</v>

2192
02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:58.420
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have not thought carefully about the </v>

2193
02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>fact that porn is effectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning like,</v>

2194
02:02:03.490 --> 02:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>

2195
02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:08.120
<v Speaker 2>school for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2196
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:12.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn about sex in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex ed is kind of a choke.</v>

2197
02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:15.350
<v Speaker 2>People don't take it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where do they learn about sex?</v>

2198
02:02:15.351 --> 02:02:20.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learned about it from what they </v>

2199
02:02:20.351 --> 02:02:20.351
<v Speaker 2>encounter on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the problem with that.</v>

2200
02:02:20.351 --> 02:02:22.580
<v Speaker 2>That is not an honest report of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2201
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.480
<v Speaker 2>What that Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the result of competition,</v>

2202
02:02:26.481 --> 02:02:31.481
<v Speaker 2>economic competition between porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers to capture your attention.</v>

2203
02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that it pushes in </v>

2204
02:02:37.930 --> 02:02:40.421
<v Speaker 2>the direction of all sorts of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people might not be that interested in </v>

2205
02:02:40.421 --> 02:02:43.370
<v Speaker 2>because this producer wants to take your</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention away from that producer and so</v>

2206
02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:48.371
<v Speaker 2>they make something more extreme or </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly triggers that second male </v>

2207
02:02:48.371 --> 02:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2208
02:02:48.421 --> 02:02:53.421
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the second male strategy of the no </v>

2209
02:02:53.421 --> 02:02:56.330
<v Speaker 2>strings attached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person who you could just hook up with</v>

2210
02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.290
<v Speaker 2>a on a whim.</v>

2211
02:02:57.410 --> 02:03:00.320
<v Speaker 2>You're delivering a pizza and she grabs </v>
<v Speaker 2>you by your shirt and pulls you in.</v>

2212
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:01.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

2213
02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:03.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the norm.</v>

2214
02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bingo.</v>

2215
02:03:04.731 --> 02:03:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And so what we've effectively done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidentally economically,</v>

2216
02:03:09.351 --> 02:03:14.351
<v Speaker 2>we've announced two children that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what sex looks like and maybe they </v>

2217
02:03:14.351 --> 02:03:18.761
<v Speaker 2>even get proficient at that kind of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mechanical,</v>

2218
02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:23.891
<v Speaker 2>uninteresting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and has very little to do with the most </v>

2219
02:03:23.891 --> 02:03:25.790
<v Speaker 2>rewarding stuff in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what it is to be a human being,</v>

2220
02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>which has to do with deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long lasting relationships.</v>

2221
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>So it shouldn't surprise us at all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've arrived at a dysfunctional moment </v>

2222
02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:36.650
<v Speaker 2>where people are shouting at each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what the rules have to be.</v>

2223
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Because what we've installed as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism for learning about these </v>

2224
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 2>things is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not have our interests at heart.</v>

2225
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 2>It is an economic entity that is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>under anyone's control.</v>

2226
02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:53.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2227
02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.330
<v Speaker 2>before the inevitable backlash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2228
02:03:56.331 --> 02:03:59.900
<v Speaker 2>he said porn was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do think porn is bad,</v>

2229
02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think erotica is bad.</v>

2230
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:08.500
<v Speaker 2>If somebody wants to make sexual content</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some purpose other than trying to </v>

2231
02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:13.070
<v Speaker 2>grab your attention and take your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's valid.</v>

2232
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:15.290
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't mean everybody's got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be interested in it.</v>

2233
02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't mean that everybody's got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce it.</v>

2234
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>But I don't want to see us prevent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from making valid sexual </v>

2235
02:04:23.961 --> 02:04:27.980
<v Speaker 2>statements that are interesting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever form they take.</v>

2236
02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily want to see children</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to it willy nilly.</v>

2237
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:33.590
<v Speaker 2>But my real point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2238
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as there's a distinction between </v>

2239
02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.500
<v Speaker 2>the really good stuff that you sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>see on your television screen because </v>

2240
02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:47.900
<v Speaker 2>somebody put together a well thought out</v>
<v Speaker 2>series and broadcast television,</v>

2241
02:04:48.271 --> 02:04:50.310
<v Speaker 2>which is often pretty garbagey.</v>

2242
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of garbagy view of sex that people </v>

2243
02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.201
<v Speaker 2>are getting because the economics are </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving us in that direction and some </v>

2244
02:05:00.201 --> 02:05:02.040
<v Speaker 2>more interesting nuanced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2245
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:07.041
<v Speaker 2>adventurous version that we might see if</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landscape wasn't saturated with the,</v>

2246
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2247
02:05:09.451 --> 02:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the porn version.</v>

2248
02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to defend porn.</v>

2249
02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I think there's got to be a spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>porn.</v>

2250
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:22.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a porn investigator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that there's some </v>

2251
02:05:22.491 --> 02:05:25.700
<v Speaker 2>romantic couple porn that makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it is a husband and wife or </v>

2252
02:05:26.370 --> 02:05:31.370
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend and girlfriend and the video </v>
<v Speaker 2>or boy and boy or whatever the fuck you </v>

2253
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.370
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

2254
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:33.870
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is natural and healthy.</v>

2255
02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:38.900
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a market for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't all be extreme crazy stuff </v>

2256
02:05:39.091 --> 02:05:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that's just designed to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

2257
02:05:40.831 --> 02:05:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must.</v>

2258
02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's,</v>

2259
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:44.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it's miscategorized.</v>

2260
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:49.940
<v Speaker 2>So I mean of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not really interested in porn </v>

2261
02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:53.030
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my understanding is that actually </v>

2262
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>there are many people who are producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>amateur stuff and maybe they have an </v>

2263
02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:59.040
<v Speaker 2>exhibitionist streak or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there is,</v>

2264
02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:01.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are naturally fascinated by</v>

2265
02:06:01.711 --> 02:06:04.110
<v Speaker 2>human human sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2266
02:06:04.111 --> 02:06:09.111
<v Speaker 2>That's a big category I believe is </v>
<v Speaker 2>couples like amateur couples and some </v>

2267
02:06:09.111 --> 02:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>people actually prefer that because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like real people who were </v>

2268
02:06:13.730 --> 02:06:18.261
<v Speaker 2>attracted to each other actually having </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex because it might actually have some </v>

2269
02:06:18.261 --> 02:06:18.261
<v Speaker 2>information in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might be,</v>

2270
02:06:18.261 --> 02:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fRankly it might be more exciting </v>

2271
02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:23.700
<v Speaker 2>because it has some reality to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point iS,</v>

2272
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:25.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a gray area,</v>

2273
02:06:25.591 --> 02:06:30.591
<v Speaker 2>I would say the distinction between porn</v>
<v Speaker 2>and erotic is actually pretty easy to </v>

2274
02:06:30.591 --> 02:06:33.900
<v Speaker 2>draw and it has to do with whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation that caused it to be produced</v>

2275
02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:35.670
<v Speaker 2>is economic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2276
02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.890
<v Speaker 2>If the motivation that caused it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>

2277
02:06:37.891 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>if it would not have been produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>absent that economic motivation,</v>

2278
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:45.950
<v Speaker 2>it's porn and I'm suspicious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 50 shades of grey as porn then I </v>

2279
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:47.070
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

2280
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Neither have I.</v>

2281
02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:52.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's erotic radical.</v>

2282
02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>If none of the female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's talk about.</v>

2283
02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's definitely cast judgment.</v>

2284
02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2285
02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2286
02:07:00.490 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely agree that it's school set </v>

2287
02:07:05.490 --> 02:07:09.350
<v Speaker 2>sex school for children and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant issue in that because it is an </v>

2288
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:13.311
<v Speaker 2>unrealistic depiction of actual sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction for the most part,</v>

2289
02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like most sexual encounters are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go the way they are in porn and</v>

2290
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:24.060
<v Speaker 2>just like setting your kid in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen when he or she is really young.</v>

2291
02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Mom does not teach that kid how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with real human beings.</v>

2292
02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If porn is your exposure to sex,</v>

2293
02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:35.290
<v Speaker 2>it's going to create a kind of sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>autism,</v>

2294
02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2295
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:41.100
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna know how to engage with</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual real human beings who can give </v>

2296
02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:42.120
<v Speaker 3>you feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2297
02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Way to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2298
02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a little,</v>

2299
02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a little dangerous obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

2300
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:49.750
<v Speaker 3>Well for various reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2301
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:54.870
<v Speaker 3>but just from the point of view that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>denies you a sense of what the </v>

2302
02:07:54.941 --> 02:07:59.941
<v Speaker 3>feedback's would look like because </v>
<v Speaker 3>feedbacks between two people don't look </v>

2303
02:07:59.941 --> 02:08:00.640
<v Speaker 3>like what happens when somebody writes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>script.</v>

2304
02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:02.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not universal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not generalizable.</v>

2305
02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the very nature of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction?</v>

2306
02:08:04.211 --> 02:08:09.211
<v Speaker 3>Is that it's one off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's something along the </v>

2307
02:08:09.211 --> 02:08:09.211
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously.</v>

2308
02:08:09.211 --> 02:08:11.630
<v Speaker 3>See here's the problem with porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the problems with porn is because</v>

2309
02:08:11.631 --> 02:08:16.631
<v Speaker 3>of the accessibility is so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like x rated a violent movies </v>

2310
02:08:16.961 --> 02:08:18.450
<v Speaker 3>or used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be.</v>

2311
02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Some movies were x rated for violence.</v>

2312
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or nc?</v>

2313
02:08:21.851 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2314
02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

2315
02:08:24.590 --> 02:08:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you could be 13 with a cell phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have access to all the poor of the </v>

2316
02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:30.910
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just think,</v>

2317
02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:36.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many of these issues I think know we </v>

2318
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:39.031
<v Speaker 3>need to be nuanced and very careful once</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about adults when people </v>

2319
02:08:39.521 --> 02:08:44.521
<v Speaker 3>become adults as a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we're talking about clearly </v>

2320
02:08:44.521 --> 02:08:44.830
<v Speaker 3>still kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2321
02:08:44.831 --> 02:08:49.330
<v Speaker 3>should children be exposed to porn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2322
02:08:49.331 --> 02:08:54.331
<v Speaker 3>They are still developing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still figuring out how to be </v>

2323
02:08:54.331 --> 02:08:56.491
<v Speaker 3>adults should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should children be given sex hormones of</v>

2324
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:05.100
<v Speaker 3>the sex that they are not born to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they might end up transitioning </v>

2325
02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:09.301
<v Speaker 3>and becoming translator on almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly not because the vast number of</v>

2326
02:09:10.691 --> 02:09:14.830
<v Speaker 3>people who end up realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh actually I was experimenting.</v>

2327
02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:17.080
<v Speaker 3>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what childhood is.</v>

2328
02:09:17.081 --> 02:09:22.081
<v Speaker 3>I was trying on something else and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've made it permanent by virtue of </v>

2329
02:09:22.081 --> 02:09:23.320
<v Speaker 3>medicalizing the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2330
02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another subject entirely,</v>

2331
02:09:25.631 --> 02:09:27.140
<v Speaker 3>but I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2332
02:09:27.141 --> 02:09:31.330
<v Speaker 3>you're essentially making a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision for a trial as early as.</v>

2333
02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it argued three years old,</v>

2334
02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:34.880
<v Speaker 3>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2335
02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.750
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't seem to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem to suit.</v>

2336
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:42.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem to fit any logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that seems to fit is this</v>

2337
02:09:42.521 --> 02:09:45.130
<v Speaker 3>agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a natural,</v>

2338
02:09:45.131 --> 02:09:48.280
<v Speaker 3>normal part of our society in which you </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforce it as early as possible.</v>

2339
02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to push back on that a little </v>

2340
02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:55.600
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very clear there's so much,</v>

2341
02:09:55.690 --> 02:10:00.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender confusion that sorts itself out </v>

2342
02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:04.930
<v Speaker 2>through the natural process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>development that the idea that we should</v>

2343
02:10:04.931 --> 02:10:09.931
<v Speaker 2>intervene medically when we have no idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is going to grow out of it and who's</v>

2344
02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:18.500
<v Speaker 2>going to transition if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think we will ever be there </v>

2345
02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:19.600
<v Speaker 2>because of the nature of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

2346
02:10:19.601 --> 02:10:24.601
<v Speaker 2>but if it were possible to know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually was committed to this road and </v>

2347
02:10:25.841 --> 02:10:30.841
<v Speaker 2>going to transition than there is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument to be made that the earlier </v>

2348
02:10:30.841 --> 02:10:35.010
<v Speaker 2>that they transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more completely they are able to </v>

2349
02:10:35.010 --> 02:10:38.711
<v Speaker 2>jump the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the precautionary principle has </v>

2350
02:10:38.711 --> 02:10:38.711
<v Speaker 2>to apply here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

2351
02:10:38.711 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans trans is a real condition and some</v>

2352
02:10:41.151 --> 02:10:43.430
<v Speaker 2>people have it and should be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>

2353
02:10:43.431 --> 02:10:48.431
<v Speaker 2>but allowing children to make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision for themselves when more than,</v>

2354
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:54.550
<v Speaker 2>more often than not they end up not </v>
<v Speaker 2>transitioning is frankly,</v>

2355
02:10:55.401 --> 02:10:56.190
<v Speaker 2>it looks criminal too.</v>

2356
02:10:56.390 --> 02:11:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I think in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the modern situation with how little </v>

2357
02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:04.781
<v Speaker 2>we understand about why it is that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people end up a gender dysphoric for </v>

2358
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:11.830
<v Speaker 2>life and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no way that we should be a </v>

2359
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.510
<v Speaker 2>inner interfering early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to let children sort this stuff</v>

2360
02:11:14.511 --> 02:11:16.400
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying in the abstract,</v>

2361
02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not that there's no argument for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it early.</v>

2362
02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:24.371
<v Speaker 2>It's at the argument for doing it early </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't come anywhere near the strength </v>

2363
02:11:24.371 --> 02:11:27.940
<v Speaker 2>to the argument for not doing it early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that these things sort </v>

2364
02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:31.691
<v Speaker 2>themselves out and actually if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have been born into the wrong </v>

2365
02:11:31.691 --> 02:11:31.691
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know as,</v>

2366
02:11:31.691 --> 02:11:33.670
<v Speaker 2>as is the phrase that is used by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2367
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>by people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them will have known who are </v>

2368
02:11:39.070 --> 02:11:42.160
<v Speaker 2>actually legitimately trans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The earlier the hormonal inputs came in,</v>

2369
02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:46.310
<v Speaker 2>the more fully they would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition.</v>

2370
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.280
<v Speaker 2>You have a more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They drank,</v>

2371
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:49.120
<v Speaker 2>the risk is too high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The risk is it,</v>

2372
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:49.550
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

2373
02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>unconscionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2374
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so we're,</v>

2375
02:11:53.821 --> 02:11:58.821
<v Speaker 1>we're into some strange blind territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start saying legitimately </v>

2376
02:11:58.821 --> 02:12:01.500
<v Speaker 1>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who was illegitimately trans?</v>

2377
02:12:01.501 --> 02:12:05.820
<v Speaker 1>If you decided we trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're legitimately trans people who are</v>

2378
02:12:05.821 --> 02:12:07.980
<v Speaker 1>wearing it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fashion statement.</v>

2379
02:12:08.010 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 1>How could you discuss how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can anyone make that distinction if </v>

2380
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 1>they're not that person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2381
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's,</v>

2382
02:12:13.770 --> 02:12:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2383
02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2384
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disagreeing with you,</v>

2385
02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:21.420
<v Speaker 1>but how would we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2386
02:12:21.421 --> 02:12:26.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cost of being trans in a </v>

2387
02:12:26.421 --> 02:12:31.131
<v Speaker 1>society that views trans the way ours </v>
<v Speaker 1>does is so high that there is a</v>

2388
02:12:31.410 --> 02:12:36.410
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a barrier to telling the world that</v>

2389
02:12:36.831 --> 02:12:41.600
<v Speaker 2>this is how you feel is substantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to prevent people from.</v>

2390
02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm flirTing with it</v>

2391
02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:48.250
<v Speaker 1>casually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would push back on that because </v>

2392
02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:50.120
<v Speaker 1>there's people that get face tattoos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do weird body modifications.</v>

2393
02:12:50.121 --> 02:12:55.121
<v Speaker 1>It's looked down upon constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do a lot of things for self hate </v>

2394
02:12:55.121 --> 02:12:56.870
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of things to shock people.</v>

2395
02:12:57.110 --> 02:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of things because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to get a reaction out of </v>

2396
02:13:02.110 --> 02:13:02.870
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily agree with that.</v>

2397
02:13:02.871 --> 02:13:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I think you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be right,</v>

2398
02:13:05.211 --> 02:13:07.640
<v Speaker 1>that there are people that wear it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion statement,</v>

2399
02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but who are people who have assumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional or semi traditional gender </v>

2400
02:13:14.721 --> 02:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>roles to make that distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2401
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>if we believe in real freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to let people choose.</v>

2402
02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I think we can for sure children choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't let,</v>

2403
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.510
<v Speaker 1>we certainly can't let parents leap to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2404
02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And so heather has said a number</v>

2405
02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 2>so people don't know how they should </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that she</v>

2406
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:37.280
<v Speaker 3>is a dyed in the wool toMboy and has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a for her whole life.</v>

2407
02:13:37.291 --> 02:13:38.230
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2408
02:13:38.290 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 3>since I was destroying the frilly </v>
<v Speaker 3>dresses,</v>

2409
02:13:40.321 --> 02:13:45.321
<v Speaker 3>my mother was putting me destroying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>frilly dresses and resenting the pink </v>

2410
02:13:45.631 --> 02:13:47.520
<v Speaker 3>color that your room was painted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2411
02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:52.550
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you essentially a modeled yourself </v>

2412
02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:57.990
<v Speaker 3>after your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your dad was a computer scientist,</v>

2413
02:13:57.991 --> 02:14:00.840
<v Speaker 3>one of the early pioneers in operating </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

2414
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:03.840
<v Speaker 3>a authorship and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

2415
02:14:03.841 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 3>heather and her had a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with her dad and she played</v>

2416
02:14:08.131 --> 02:14:12.660
<v Speaker 3>like a boy and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heather has asked things.</v>

2417
02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:16.620
<v Speaker 3>He said to me on several occasions was I</v>
<v Speaker 3>will not raise a weak girl.</v>

2418
02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I will not raise a hopeless or helpless </v>
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>

2419
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:20.820
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2420
02:14:20.821 --> 02:14:25.821
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'd have my nose buried in a book </v>

2421
02:14:25.821 --> 02:14:26.280
<v Speaker 3>and he'd be out back building a fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to come out and help me dig</v>

2422
02:14:26.281 --> 02:14:29.400
<v Speaker 3>postholes and pour the cement and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2423
02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:31.230
<v Speaker 3>put in the posts and you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2424
02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:34.320
<v Speaker 3>not because I expect that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go into fence building,</v>

2425
02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:36.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because you need to know how to work</v>

2426
02:14:36.751 --> 02:14:41.751
<v Speaker 3>with your hands and do physical work in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe and see what the </v>

2427
02:14:41.751 --> 02:14:41.751
<v Speaker 3>ramifications are.</v>

2428
02:14:41.751 --> 02:14:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Not that he didn't want you reading the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

2429
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>

2430
02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

2431
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he on other weekends he was taking me to</v>

2432
02:14:46.761 --> 02:14:48.300
<v Speaker 3>a math competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2433
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:53.301
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of abstraction and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and play with numbers and science as </v>

2434
02:14:53.301 --> 02:14:57.681
<v Speaker 3>well in sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was specifically about not </v>

2435
02:14:57.681 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 3>assuming what I was going to be capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of because I was born a girl.</v>

2436
02:15:00.970 --> 02:15:01.320
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

2437
02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:05.830
<v Speaker 1>a giant problem with this category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women.</v>

2438
02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:10.831
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's this giant spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside each category and that should be </v>

2439
02:15:11.381 --> 02:15:13.360
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be all right.</v>

2440
02:15:13.410 --> 02:15:15.040
<v Speaker 1>It means to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be,</v>

2441
02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 1>it has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the problems with </v>

2442
02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:22.861
<v Speaker 1>assuming traditional gender roles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming types of behavior and what some</v>

2443
02:15:24.191 --> 02:15:29.191
<v Speaker 1>people like sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people would hate and vice verse </v>

2444
02:15:29.191 --> 02:15:33.301
<v Speaker 1>and some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people can get away with </v>

2445
02:15:33.301 --> 02:15:36.091
<v Speaker 1>things because women find it attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas another man could do the exact </v>

2446
02:15:36.091 --> 02:15:38.560
<v Speaker 1>same thing and women who think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting and that's okay too.</v>

2447
02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to err in the direction of </v>

2448
02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:45.431
<v Speaker 3>keeping people safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can't turn the dial on safety to </v>

2449
02:15:45.431 --> 02:15:47.220
<v Speaker 3>11 because it will destroy everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else will till all the fun.</v>

2450
02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:47.920
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

2451
02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that these categories </v>
<v Speaker 3>are invariant,</v>

2452
02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:55.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That male looks one way and I mean this </v>

2453
02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:55.540
<v Speaker 3>is exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2454
02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:55.540
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2455
02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:55.790
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2456
02:15:55.820 --> 02:16:00.820
<v Speaker 3>many of the people who are arguing </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the biology of sex and gender </v>

2457
02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:02.810
<v Speaker 3>say things like gender isn't binary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right.</v>

2458
02:16:02.930 --> 02:16:04.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2459
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:05.420
<v Speaker 3>it's bi-modal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

2460
02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:10.450
<v Speaker 3>these are population distributions with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of variation in them and they're </v>

2461
02:16:10.450 --> 02:16:14.290
<v Speaker 3>widely overlapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that the same </v>

2462
02:16:14.290 --> 02:16:15.440
<v Speaker 3>identical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are broadly overlapping.</v>

2463
02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:17.190
<v Speaker 1>They certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2464
02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:22.400
<v Speaker 1>and there's been some interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushback from these older european </v>

2465
02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:24.240
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly french women who are like,</v>

2466
02:16:24.241 --> 02:16:29.241
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ruining sex romance in courtship </v>

2467
02:16:29.241 --> 02:16:34.020
<v Speaker 1>and exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a different attitude about it </v>

2468
02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and they think that there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of aggressive behavior from men </v>

2469
02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:39.100
<v Speaker 1>that they enjoy and they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>douse that.</v>

2470
02:16:39.370 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somehow this.</v>

2471
02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad we're getting to thiS part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation.</v>

2472
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:50.400
<v Speaker 2>One thing to say is I didn't finish the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that heather is that heather has </v>

2473
02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:54.580
<v Speaker 2>vocalized that if she grew up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern era,</v>

2474
02:16:55.210 --> 02:16:58.150
<v Speaker 2>she worries that somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her parents wouldn't have.</v>

2475
02:16:58.151 --> 02:17:03.151
<v Speaker 2>They would have fought back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that some people would have been </v>

2476
02:17:03.151 --> 02:17:03.151
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2477
02:17:03.151 --> 02:17:03.151
<v Speaker 2>you're trans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to,</v>

2478
02:17:03.151 --> 02:17:07.860
<v Speaker 2>we need to take care of you and we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give you hormones and things like </v>

2479
02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.281
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the fact that she played like a </v>

2480
02:17:11.281 --> 02:17:13.291
<v Speaker 2>boy would have been taken as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication that she was born in the </v>

2481
02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:14.800
<v Speaker 2>wrong body or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that can't happen.</v>

2482
02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:18.910
<v Speaker 2>We have to protect people so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can sort out their own stuff in it.</v>

2483
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000
<v Speaker 2>So I mean we have to expand and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really feel like we had already kind of </v>

2484
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.291
<v Speaker 2>gotten here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've talked to people who identify </v>

2485
02:17:28.291 --> 02:17:32.101
<v Speaker 2>as trans who say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trans because I don't fit into my </v>

2486
02:17:32.741 --> 02:17:37.741
<v Speaker 2>father's mold of a macho man and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefer to read poetry and to which I </v>

2487
02:17:38.351 --> 02:17:40.120
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrific.</v>

2488
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be that man and then that that if,</v>

2489
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:47.260
<v Speaker 2>if that is the extent of why you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling yourself trans,</v>

2490
02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that makes you trans.</v>

2491
02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there an issue and this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti any of this,</v>

2492
02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:59.221
<v Speaker 1>but isn't there an issue with saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that who you really truly are is </v>

2493
02:17:59.221 --> 02:18:03.601
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon you getting injections of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones that are not native to your </v>

2494
02:18:03.761 --> 02:18:08.761
<v Speaker 1>body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that very odd that we've taken </v>

2495
02:18:08.761 --> 02:18:13.561
<v Speaker 1>synthetic hormones and made them an </v>
<v Speaker 1>integral part of who a person is?</v>

2496
02:18:13.690 --> 02:18:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to </v>

2497
02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:18.690
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly should be able to do it,</v>

2498
02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:22.561
<v Speaker 1>but it's oddly almost a biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentialist push perspective coming </v>

2499
02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:24.730
<v Speaker 1>from people who are denying biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's this thing that I'm saying.</v>

2500
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>If you are who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is no one willing to accept who they</v>

2501
02:18:30.281 --> 02:18:35.110
<v Speaker 1>are in this situation and instead wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to or not.</v>

2502
02:18:35.111 --> 02:18:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say no one is a bad way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrasing it.</v>

2503
02:18:37.210 --> 02:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Why is it assumed that if you do feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were born in the wrong body,</v>

2504
02:18:44.111 --> 02:18:49.111
<v Speaker 1>the only way to change that is to inject</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones that are not native to your </v>

2505
02:18:49.271 --> 02:18:50.860
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have surgery,</v>

2506
02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:56.100
<v Speaker 1>to alter yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assume traditional gender dress and </v>

2507
02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.430
<v Speaker 1>look of the opposite sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like,</v>

2508
02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:03.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that pushed back</v>
<v Speaker 1>against women sexualiZing themselves,</v>

2509
02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but celebrate trans women sexualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to look more like women </v>

2510
02:19:10.301 --> 02:19:15.301
<v Speaker 1>because they think this is a feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>empowerment for these women that look </v>

2511
02:19:15.301 --> 02:19:15.301
<v Speaker 1>how beautiful they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go girl,</v>

2512
02:19:15.301 --> 02:19:18.550
<v Speaker 1>look at those legs like there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about it where it's like,</v>

2513
02:19:18.551 --> 02:19:23.551
<v Speaker 1>it's celebrated as this merging of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>true self.</v>

2514
02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:24.940
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2515
02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:30.160
<v Speaker 2>this is one of these places I believe we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have at least a one way failure and </v>

2516
02:19:30.921 --> 02:19:33.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe a two way failure of empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2517
02:19:33.921 --> 02:19:34.600
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2518
02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I've spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2519
02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:41.231
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have lots of history with trans </v>

2520
02:19:41.231 --> 02:19:41.231
<v Speaker 2>students who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2521
02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:46.540
<v Speaker 2>at first I must say there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans folks at evergreen and at first </v>

2522
02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:49.550
<v Speaker 2>when we first arrived it was odd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what percentage?</v>

2523
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Well that is a hard question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you ask people to self report,</v>

2524
02:19:54.171 --> 02:19:59.171
<v Speaker 2>the number is absurdly high but I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly high like it's so I that it is</v>

2525
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:05.960
<v Speaker 2>reported as 40 percent at evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2526
02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:08.270
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't really make any 48,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

2527
02:20:08.271 --> 02:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four 0:40,</v>

2528
02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 2>which you can't really can't be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

2529
02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:17.381
<v Speaker 2>which is part of why I say some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying it on trying it on as an </v>

2530
02:20:17.381 --> 02:20:18.750
<v Speaker 2>identity as opposed to any of that.</v>

2531
02:20:18.890 --> 02:20:22.640
<v Speaker 2>That includes lgb but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too high.</v>

2532
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:25.110
<v Speaker 2>When they gravitate though towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>school like that,</v>

2533
02:20:25.111 --> 02:20:27.500
<v Speaker 2>that so minded they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2534
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:31.430
<v Speaker 2>we have an intuitive sense by just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population when people are faking it.</v>

2535
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2536
02:20:32.050 --> 02:20:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that there's like a,</v>

2537
02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:40.210
<v Speaker 2>a desire to affirm a folks in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>category and so placing yourself,</v>

2538
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather than faking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say people who don't agree with </v>

2539
02:20:48.861 --> 02:20:53.861
<v Speaker 2>the gender norms associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gender they were born to run </v>

2540
02:20:53.861 --> 02:20:55.040
<v Speaker 2>themselves trans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me that doesn't look like trans.</v>

2541
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.940
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2542
02:20:56.180 --> 02:21:01.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a misrepresentation of what trans</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because we've also known many </v>

2543
02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:02.290
<v Speaker 2>students who are really legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcend,</v>

2544
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:07.300
<v Speaker 2>have done surgery or hormones or both </v>
<v Speaker 2>and are and are better off in their </v>

2545
02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:13.760
<v Speaker 2>bodies and more at peace with themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>having done so.</v>

2546
02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think it is very hard to appreciate</v>

2547
02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are all in some sense not well by </v>

2548
02:21:26.421 --> 02:21:31.421
<v Speaker 2>virtue of the fact that we live in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization that is not a good match </v>

2549
02:21:31.421 --> 02:21:31.421
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2550
02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:35.570
<v Speaker 2>for what we bring to the table even are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environments we grew up in.</v>

2551
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:37.580
<v Speaker 2>His children do not match our adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>

2552
02:21:37.581 --> 02:21:42.581
<v Speaker 2>And so we don't intubate them well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that causes all kinds of health </v>

2553
02:21:42.581 --> 02:21:43.580
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological and otherwise,</v>

2554
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:49.270
<v Speaker 2>when people find themselves in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicament that we are calling trans,</v>

2555
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 2>they have access to a remedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2556
02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:59.800
<v Speaker 2>imagine it's just put yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset of somebody who feels like they </v>

2557
02:22:00.771 --> 02:22:03.200
<v Speaker 2>should have been a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2558
02:22:03.350 --> 02:22:08.350
<v Speaker 2>mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now learning that some trans people </v>

2559
02:22:08.350 --> 02:22:10.541
<v Speaker 2>actually don't feel this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling like you were born in the </v>

2560
02:22:10.541 --> 02:22:10.541
<v Speaker 2>wrong body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a universal,</v>

2561
02:22:10.541 --> 02:22:12.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very commonly said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is not universal.</v>

2562
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:14.870
<v Speaker 2>But imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is how you felt.</v>

2563
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:18.800
<v Speaker 2>You felt like you were being addressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a man.</v>

2564
02:22:18.801 --> 02:22:23.801
<v Speaker 2>You were being understood as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not how you internally felt </v>

2565
02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:27.160
<v Speaker 2>and there was access to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some set of things that would cause the </v>

2566
02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:30.750
<v Speaker 2>world to finally register you as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt you were right.</v>

2567
02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 2>It would be very tempting to avail </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself of that stuff.</v>

2568
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:41.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's hard for those of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>who feel at home enough in the bodies </v>

2569
02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:45.600
<v Speaker 2>that were in to appreciate what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure must be like.</v>

2570
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>If there is something available to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go for it and to cross that gap and I</v>

2571
02:22:50.731 --> 02:22:55.731
<v Speaker 2>also think it's creating a problem as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to discuss issues like </v>

2572
02:22:56.430 --> 02:23:01.430
<v Speaker 2>sexual signaling and makeup and high </v>
<v Speaker 2>heels and things as people have been </v>

2573
02:23:01.430 --> 02:23:06.411
<v Speaker 2>discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThiS causes a special problem for trans </v>

2574
02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:10.131
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a trans women because in many cases,</v>

2575
02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:16.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe almost all cases they are using </v>
<v Speaker 2>these signs that are,</v>

2576
02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:22.100
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to get in trouble here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These makeup is well understood to </v>

2577
02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:25.890
<v Speaker 2>amplify sexual signaling and is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only role is playing,</v>

2578
02:23:25.930 --> 02:23:30.930
<v Speaker 2>is not inherently conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not inherently intended to be </v>

2579
02:23:30.930 --> 02:23:32.400
<v Speaker 2>triggering everybody broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>

2580
02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:33.930
<v Speaker 2>makeup high heels.</v>

2581
02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:34.870
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2582
02:23:36.390 --> 02:23:41.390
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms for amplifying a certain set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of signals are being used by trans folks</v>

2583
02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:47.480
<v Speaker 2>as a mechanism for amplifying their sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2584
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:53.000
<v Speaker 2>if somebody puts on a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup in order to send a signal that </v>

2585
02:23:56.311 --> 02:23:58.260
<v Speaker 2>they are looking for a mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2586
02:23:58.470 --> 02:24:00.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying everybody who puts on </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup is doing that,</v>

2587
02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but somebody might put on makeup in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to attract male attention.</v>

2588
02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:07.920
<v Speaker 2>That's one kind of signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're trans,</v>

2589
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:11.100
<v Speaker 2>you may put on that makeup in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>send a signal.</v>

2590
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I am female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2591
02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:16.020
<v Speaker 2>So you're sending a signal that is of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different nature.</v>

2592
02:24:16.021 --> 02:24:21.021
<v Speaker 2>And so I think there is a way in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans people are feeling backed against </v>

2593
02:24:21.021 --> 02:24:24.801
<v Speaker 2>the wall by a discussion that is now </v>
<v Speaker 2>very clumsily happening about these </v>

2594
02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:29.820
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms of sexual signaling because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts them in a particular predicament</v>

2595
02:24:29.821 --> 02:24:34.821
<v Speaker 2>where they're feeling like they're about</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be robbed of the very stuff that </v>

2596
02:24:34.821 --> 02:24:35.460
<v Speaker 2>allows them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2597
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.500
<v Speaker 2>to accentuate their femininity does very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well put.</v>

2598
02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a very important </v>

2599
02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:47.151
<v Speaker 2>distinction to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're talking about </v>

2600
02:24:47.151 --> 02:24:48.490
<v Speaker 2>someone who's trying to self affirm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2601
02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2602
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:55.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that came up real </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently was this Jordan Peterson </v>

2603
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:58.780
<v Speaker 1>interview with vice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in my opinion,</v>

2604
02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.310
<v Speaker 1>especially when you look at the sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>

2605
02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.240
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about women in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace and women wearing makeup and </v>

2606
02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.950
<v Speaker 1>high heels and things in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know Jordan very well.</v>

2607
02:25:08.951 --> 02:25:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

2608
02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:13.460
<v Speaker 1>He came off aggressive there and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know why I don't.</v>

2609
02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's tired of it or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's digging his heels in.</v>

2610
02:25:16.690 --> 02:25:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's apparently part of a two hour </v>

2611
02:25:21.690 --> 02:25:23.911
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of felt like he was on the ropes </v>

2612
02:25:23.911 --> 02:25:23.911
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2613
02:25:23.911 --> 02:25:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And he also coming off of that big kathy</v>
<v Speaker 1>newman interview in the uk,</v>

2614
02:25:26.411 --> 02:25:30.130
<v Speaker 1>which was like an assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing was just crazy,</v>

2615
02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:33.880
<v Speaker 1>but he came out ahead on that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2616
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:35.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2617
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.920
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much easier to make the argument </v>

2618
02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:40.920
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't come out ahead and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vice thing,</v>

2619
02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 1>especially in the way that they framed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2620
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:47.050
<v Speaker 1>but he was talking about women in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace and maybe women shouldn't wear</v>

2621
02:25:47.051 --> 02:25:51.910
<v Speaker 1>makeup in the workplace and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't wear high heels or dresses.</v>

2622
02:25:53.410 --> 02:25:55.630
<v Speaker 3>So hE did say maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

2623
02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

2624
02:25:56.620 --> 02:26:00.050
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say women shouldn't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The interviewer,</v>

2625
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:05.070
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>king king j king maybe said so do you </v>

2626
02:26:05.621 --> 02:26:07.510
<v Speaker 3>think women shouldn't wear makeup and </v>
<v Speaker 3>high heels then?</v>

2627
02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

2628
02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

2629
02:26:10.330 --> 02:26:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2630
02:26:11.350 --> 02:26:12.870
<v Speaker 3>he's thinking he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2631
02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 3>he's considering options here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not prepared upon first being asked</v>

2632
02:26:17.321 --> 02:26:19.660
<v Speaker 3>a question to say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely or no.</v>

2633
02:26:19.661 --> 02:26:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2634
02:26:20.651 --> 02:26:25.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a sign of a nuanced thinking </v>

2635
02:26:25.651 --> 02:26:25.651
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2636
02:26:25.651 --> 02:26:27.400
<v Speaker 3>brain in action in real time.</v>

2637
02:26:27.570 --> 02:26:32.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the reaction is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact problem that you're trying to </v>

2638
02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:32.640
<v Speaker 1>avoid here though when you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get in trouble here,</v>

2639
02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you preface that and then you slowly </v>

2640
02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:37.690
<v Speaker 1>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Jordan was like,</v>

2641
02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:37.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

2642
02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:39.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are they wearing makeup?</v>

2643
02:26:39.331 --> 02:26:41.400
<v Speaker 3>But what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say that,</v>

2644
02:26:41.401 --> 02:26:46.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the generous interpretation and the </v>

2645
02:26:46.401 --> 02:26:46.710
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary interpretation of what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said was,</v>

2646
02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:53.060
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the me too movement is arguing that </v>

2647
02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:56.451
<v Speaker 3>there should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there can be no sexual signals in </v>

2648
02:26:56.451 --> 02:26:57.000
<v Speaker 3>the workplace at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Full Stop.</v>

2649
02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:03.800
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to be possible because </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at how many other sexual signals </v>

2650
02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:07.650
<v Speaker 3>there are makeup heels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the response has been,</v>

2651
02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:12.800
<v Speaker 3>those aren't sexual signals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wear heels and I'm not sexually </v>

2652
02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:15.981
<v Speaker 3>signaling and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to which the evolutionary response is </v>

2653
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:20.190
<v Speaker 3>what heals do is augment sexual signals </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were born with.</v>

2654
02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you're conscious of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that that is why you were doing it,</v>

2655
02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:25.650
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make it any less of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual signal.</v>

2656
02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:30.740
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what peterson was saying was if </v>

2657
02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:34.580
<v Speaker 3>we really are going to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that all signals of this type </v>

2658
02:27:34.580 --> 02:27:37.560
<v Speaker 3>need to be abandoned from you need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten rid of from the workplace,</v>

2659
02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:42.420
<v Speaker 3>then maybe we actually need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigate all of the other things that</v>

2660
02:27:42.421 --> 02:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>are sexual signals that aren't being </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about right now.</v>

2661
02:27:45.090 --> 02:27:47.280
<v Speaker 3>So there are a couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2662
02:27:47.281 --> 02:27:48.810
<v Speaker 3>have you seen the</v>

2663
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.000
<v Speaker 2>clip filmed from the audience of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about what happened with that </v>

2664
02:27:54.231 --> 02:27:55.360
<v Speaker 2>vice interview?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2665
02:27:55.390 --> 02:28:00.390
<v Speaker 2>It's well worth your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's seven or eight minutes of </v>

2666
02:28:00.390 --> 02:28:03.910
<v Speaker 2>him talking about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think peterson who I also know,</v>

2667
02:28:03.911 --> 02:28:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can give you the cliff </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes of what.</v>

2668
02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the cliff notes are.</v>

2669
02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:08.620
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2670
02:28:08.890 --> 02:28:13.890
<v Speaker 2>this is how one engages in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought one advances an idea.</v>

2671
02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:16.870
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean something's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2672
02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I think he literally says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say women shouldn't wear in the</v>

2673
02:28:21.531 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2674
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:24.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what we do,</v>

2675
02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:26.510
<v Speaker 2>and then he describes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

2676
02:28:26.970 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2677
02:28:28.821 --> 02:28:33.821
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's agree that I'm going to put </v>

2678
02:28:33.821 --> 02:28:37.661
<v Speaker 2>forward 10 things that might happen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then let's agree that none of them are </v>

2679
02:28:37.661 --> 02:28:40.460
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we can discuss the possibilities.</v>

2680
02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:45.700
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think we know what the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview with jay kang looked like </v>

2681
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:50.930
<v Speaker 2>because there was two hours of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen 15 minutes.</v>

2682
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why won't they release more of it?</v>

2683
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I think they should release the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2684
02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I do think what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't know the context,</v>

2685
02:28:57.740 --> 02:29:02.740
<v Speaker 2>which my guess is a peterson's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful in what he says.</v>

2686
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:05.030
<v Speaker 2>My guess is the context would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>revealing.</v>

2687
02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I think based on the part that we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he said because it is in the clips </v>

2688
02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.071
<v Speaker 2>that we've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know something's funny because the </v>

2689
02:29:15.071 --> 02:29:17.500
<v Speaker 2>editing juxtaposes him seeming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradict himself and he's actually </v>

2690
02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:18.370
<v Speaker 2>pretty careful not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2691
02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:23.920
<v Speaker 2>but what he did actually say contains </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I regard as at least one </v>

2692
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:28.700
<v Speaker 2>significant error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>

2693
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:34.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that in response to the </v>

2694
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:37.931
<v Speaker 2>question of our women hypocrites for </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing makeup to work and then,</v>

2695
02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:42.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put words in his mouth,</v>

2696
02:29:42.801 --> 02:29:47.450
<v Speaker 2>but something like demanding not to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassed,</v>

2697
02:29:47.451 --> 02:29:48.470
<v Speaker 2>harassed or something like that.</v>

2698
02:29:48.470 --> 02:29:53.470
<v Speaker 2>So he's forgetting that many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>signals aren't conscious and not only </v>

2699
02:29:53.470 --> 02:29:54.020
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not conscious,</v>

2700
02:29:54.021 --> 02:29:56.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw somebody online discussing this.</v>

2701
02:29:56.571 --> 02:30:01.571
<v Speaker 2>They made a very good point when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty hard to field if these </v>

2702
02:30:01.571 --> 02:30:02.810
<v Speaker 2>are signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even unconscious ones,</v>

2703
02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:08.020
<v Speaker 2>if they are sexual signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I wearing one to go to a family </v>

2704
02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:11.111
<v Speaker 2>reunion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>WhY am I wearing high heels to go to a </v>

2705
02:30:11.111 --> 02:30:11.111
<v Speaker 2>family reunion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2706
02:30:11.111 --> 02:30:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I secretly trying to get lucky at my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>family reunion.</v>

2707
02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is no.</v>

2708
02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:19.040
<v Speaker 2>This is not a matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what peterson said when,</v>

2709
02:30:19.041 --> 02:30:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peterson has done so many interviews.</v>

2710
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:26.590
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he says at clumsy thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here doesn't strike me one way or the </v>

2711
02:30:26.590 --> 02:30:31.091
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to be put in the </v>

2712
02:30:31.091 --> 02:30:33.191
<v Speaker 2>position of defending that women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocritical for wearing makeup and high</v>

2713
02:30:33.681 --> 02:30:34.040
<v Speaker 2>heels.</v>

2714
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:35.660
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of reasons that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to wear them,</v>

2715
02:30:35.661 --> 02:30:40.661
<v Speaker 2>including social pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the fact that you are in a </v>

2716
02:30:40.661 --> 02:30:45.640
<v Speaker 2>landscape of other people wearing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you stand out as being playing in</v>

2717
02:30:46.581 --> 02:30:49.470
<v Speaker 2>a world of other women who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>amplifying these things,</v>

2718
02:30:49.471 --> 02:30:52.130
<v Speaker 2>that may actually have implications for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to earn.</v>

2719
02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:55.520
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of reasons that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might do it that have nothing to do With</v>

2720
02:30:55.521 --> 02:30:58.370
<v Speaker 2>you as an individual trying to signal </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sexual attention.</v>

2721
02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:02.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that those things didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve as sexual signals,</v>

2722
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:04.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexual signals to us,</v>

2723
02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:07.310
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is no news.</v>

2724
02:31:07.311 --> 02:31:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a woman and you've got breasts</v>

2725
02:31:10.251 --> 02:31:15.251
<v Speaker 2>and you're walking around in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're broadcasting a sexual signal and </v>

2726
02:31:15.251 --> 02:31:16.460
<v Speaker 2>that one is completely unconscious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>involuntary physiological,</v>

2727
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:21.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that these signals are out </v>

2728
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:24.351
<v Speaker 2>there and common should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should become something we become </v>

2729
02:31:24.351 --> 02:31:27.980
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with the fact that males are</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in all kinds of signaling all </v>

2730
02:31:28.411 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2731
02:31:29.930 --> 02:31:31.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corner office,</v>

2732
02:31:31.141 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 2>the mahogany desk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2733
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not that a woman can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner office and my desk,</v>

2734
02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:40.040
<v Speaker 2>but traditionally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those hallmarks of a statue acquisition,</v>

2735
02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:46.560
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things have implication in the </v>

2736
02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:46.560
<v Speaker 2>sexual landscape.</v>

2737
02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:47.790
<v Speaker 2>That's very powerful as does frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humor.</v>

2738
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:53.060
<v Speaker 2>The way humor is used has powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications in terms of sexual </v>

2739
02:31:53.791 --> 02:31:57.090
<v Speaker 2>signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as does who laughs at your jokes.</v>

2740
02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the boss makes a joke,</v>

2741
02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:01.560
<v Speaker 2>everybody laughs whether or not it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

2742
02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got power.</v>

2743
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:07.290
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can't get rid of all of this.</v>

2744
02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:12.320
<v Speaker 2>We can't get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we look at something like an </v>

2745
02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:13.410
<v Speaker 2>engagement ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2746
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:17.760
<v Speaker 2>If you were to analyze an engagement </v>
<v Speaker 2>ring anthropologically,</v>

2747
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:20.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are these stones.</v>

2748
02:32:20.161 --> 02:32:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Actually the truth of it is there these </v>
<v Speaker 2>stones that aren't really that rare,</v>

2749
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:29.150
<v Speaker 2>but they've been made artificially </v>
<v Speaker 2>scarce and a man will get one of these </v>

2750
02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:34.610
<v Speaker 2>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he will put it on a thing that can </v>

2751
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:38.241
<v Speaker 2>be put on a woman's finger and the size </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the stone and the quality of the </v>

2752
02:32:38.241 --> 02:32:42.651
<v Speaker 2>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the stone is not actually </v>

2753
02:32:42.651 --> 02:32:42.651
<v Speaker 2>useful for very much.</v>

2754
02:32:42.651 --> 02:32:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It is symbolically important and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of the woman's worth in some </v>

2755
02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:47.940
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2756
02:32:47.970 --> 02:32:52.970
<v Speaker 2>the larger the stone indicates that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>man values her at a greater level of </v>

2757
02:32:52.970 --> 02:32:55.860
<v Speaker 2>this is an absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an absurd set of signals.</v>

2758
02:32:55.861 --> 02:32:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And we treat it as if it's just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2759
02:32:59.041 --> 02:33:04.041
<v Speaker 2>a woman gets an engagement ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if she's traditional or friends </v>

2760
02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 2>will look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2761
02:33:05.341 --> 02:33:06.380
<v Speaker 2>that's marvelous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2762
02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:10.380
<v Speaker 2>so we're engaged in all of this archaic </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling anyway.</v>

2763
02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.620
<v Speaker 2>And when you tune into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very jarring.</v>

2764
02:33:14.310 --> 02:33:19.170
<v Speaker 2>But it does not make sense to isolate </v>
<v Speaker 2>one set of these signals and say,</v>

2765
02:33:19.171 --> 02:33:21.360
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're signaling right?</v>

2766
02:33:21.361 --> 02:33:26.361
<v Speaker 2>Because those signals are embedded in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape of signals that we go through </v>

2767
02:33:26.361 --> 02:33:30.090
<v Speaker 2>our entire life not realizing that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are making.</v>

2768
02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:35.720
<v Speaker 2>A last poInt I would make is that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>also need to recognize that we have a </v>

2769
02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:39.080
<v Speaker 2>mismatch between personal signaling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast signaling.</v>

2770
02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:45.140
<v Speaker 2>So it may be that a woman wears </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in order to catch a particular</v>

2771
02:33:48.871 --> 02:33:53.871
<v Speaker 2>male's attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that she's wearing it may </v>

2772
02:33:53.871 --> 02:33:56.571
<v Speaker 2>catch other male's attention and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact may confuse the landscape because,</v>

2773
02:33:57.510 --> 02:34:02.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men in general may take it as a sign </v>

2774
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:05.871
<v Speaker 2>that she's interested in something when </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact she's not interested in </v>

2775
02:34:05.871 --> 02:34:08.901
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's interested in someone who happens </v>

2776
02:34:08.901 --> 02:34:11.211
<v Speaker 2>to be in this landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I hope is that we will recognize</v>

2777
02:34:12.301 --> 02:34:17.301
<v Speaker 2>that the thing that we should all agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>on is that it is desirable to have the </v>

2778
02:34:18.371 --> 02:34:23.371
<v Speaker 2>freedom to engage life as you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage us as long as you're not harming </v>

2779
02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:25.930
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be.</v>

2780
02:34:25.931 --> 02:34:30.931
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not think a polyamorous folks are </v>

2781
02:34:30.931 --> 02:34:33.910
<v Speaker 2>on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what they're up to is.</v>

2782
02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know from the ones who are serious </v>

2783
02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:40.981
<v Speaker 2>about it and talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even within the polyamorous </v>

2784
02:34:40.981 --> 02:34:44.161
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a recognition about just how </v>

2785
02:34:44.161 --> 02:34:44.161
<v Speaker 2>difficult it is to make it work.</v>

2786
02:34:44.161 --> 02:34:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really want to interfere </v>

2787
02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:49.771
<v Speaker 2>with their right to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to be able to talk about </v>

2788
02:34:49.771 --> 02:34:52.291
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it has societal implications </v>

2789
02:34:52.291 --> 02:34:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that we should be aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but body,</v>

2790
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they're not on the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>track and isn't everyone's track.</v>

2791
02:34:55.750 --> 02:35:00.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can accept trans folk and we can </v>

2792
02:35:00.750 --> 02:35:02.860
<v Speaker 2>accept a women to subscribe to cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>norms and wearing high heels and make up</v>

2793
02:35:02.861 --> 02:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't we accept polyamorous behavior</v>

2794
02:35:06.311 --> 02:35:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I'm telling you.</v>

2795
02:35:08.111 --> 02:35:13.111
<v Speaker 2>Is That difficult though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally would counsel somebody if </v>

2796
02:35:13.111 --> 02:35:17.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have had this conversation with </v>

2797
02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:17.160
<v Speaker 2>many students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2798
02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:21.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would counsel them away from it </v>

2799
02:35:21.210 --> 02:35:23.280
<v Speaker 2>because I think it actually prioritizes </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing which is desirable,</v>

2800
02:35:24.131 --> 02:35:26.560
<v Speaker 2>but that the cost of it is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>

2801
02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what does it prioritize?</v>

2802
02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:33.840
<v Speaker 2>It prioritizes not locking yourself into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single sexual relationship.</v>

2803
02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a way in which there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a terror that surrounds locking </v>

2804
02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:42.400
<v Speaker 2>yourself into a single sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

2805
02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:47.401
<v Speaker 2>And part of the tara goes back to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about at the beginning </v>

2806
02:35:47.401 --> 02:35:47.740
<v Speaker 2>of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that,</v>

2807
02:35:48.090 --> 02:35:53.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty max is maxed out at 20 and then </v>

2808
02:35:53.651 --> 02:35:58.651
<v Speaker 2>it wanes over live then as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trapped in this terrible </v>

2809
02:36:00.431 --> 02:36:05.431
<v Speaker 2>situation where you've got this power </v>
<v Speaker 2>long before you know what to do with it </v>

2810
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:08.370
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to evaporate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see better capitalize on it.</v>

2811
02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:11.250
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very frightened that you're going</v>

2812
02:36:11.251 --> 02:36:16.251
<v Speaker 2>to get into a relationship and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to watch this person that </v>

2813
02:36:16.251 --> 02:36:18.970
<v Speaker 2>you love fall apart in front of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes and you're going to be,</v>

2814
02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be caught in that </v>

2815
02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:24.180
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2816
02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:25.660
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think this is the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pair bond.</v>

2817
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I think the reality of a pair bond is </v>
<v Speaker 2>way better than we fear,</v>

2818
02:36:29.770 --> 02:36:34.270
<v Speaker 2>but that because we've got this overly </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplistic mythology surrounding it,</v>

2819
02:36:34.271 --> 02:36:36.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are trying to solve that</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2820
02:36:36.191 --> 02:36:41.191
<v Speaker 2>How do I not get locked into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that's going to trap me </v>

2821
02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:42.400
<v Speaker 2>with somebody who's had do not get bored</v>
<v Speaker 2>and decaying in front of me,</v>

2822
02:36:42.430 --> 02:36:43.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2823
02:36:43.450 --> 02:36:45.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a decaying thing.</v>

2824
02:36:45.311 --> 02:36:50.311
<v Speaker 2>I would push back against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say people just want more </v>

2825
02:36:50.311 --> 02:36:50.311
<v Speaker 2>variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want,</v>

2826
02:36:50.311 --> 02:36:54.511
<v Speaker 2>they're attracted to other people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to act on that and if they </v>

2827
02:36:54.511 --> 02:36:55.210
<v Speaker 2>find a partner who's also willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they stay together,</v>

2828
02:36:55.570 --> 02:36:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't see what would be the issue if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to do it.</v>

2829
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2830
02:36:59.330 --> 02:37:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you specifically that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to stop them from doing it,</v>

2831
02:37:02.561 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 2>but I do want people to think very </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully about the issues.</v>

2832
02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just speaking as one guy who's lived</v>

2833
02:37:11.710 --> 02:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>one life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2834
02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:17.480
<v Speaker 2>the value that I get out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2835
02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:23.260
<v Speaker 2>having as close to perfect security at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home as I can have in a relationship.</v>

2836
02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heather and I have been all over the </v>

2837
02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:32.711
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've taken our kids into parts of the </v>

2838
02:37:32.711 --> 02:37:35.261
<v Speaker 2>amazon that are four hours by boat from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nearest road.</v>

2839
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a boring relationship.</v>

2840
02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:41.480
<v Speaker 2>This relationship has been a nonstop </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>

2841
02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no one's trying to push polyamory on</v>

2842
02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:44.360
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2843
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that that's true.</v>

2844
02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I would say that the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as an individual,</v>

2845
02:37:50.090 --> 02:37:55.090
<v Speaker 2>but what I would say is they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting an idea that this is the </v>

2846
02:37:55.491 --> 02:37:58.450
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the wave of the future if they.</v>

2847
02:37:58.770 --> 02:38:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that it common is this,</v>

2848
02:38:00.350 --> 02:38:00.770
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2849
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you mentioned sex at dawn </v>

2850
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:05.950
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

2851
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:07.100
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but chris is my friend and he's crazy.</v>

2852
02:38:08.330 --> 02:38:10.650
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I would say leaves it.</v>

2853
02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:12.770
<v Speaker 2>He might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm does believe it.</v>

2854
02:38:12.771 --> 02:38:13.420
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2855
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:17.570
<v Speaker 2>fortunately it is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been convinced by a,</v>

2856
02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:22.900
<v Speaker 2>a friend who I had a long standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument with on this topic and what he </v>

2857
02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:25.310
<v Speaker 2>convinced me is that a friend who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamorous,</v>

2858
02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:30.380
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend who is polyamorous and this </v>

2859
02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:30.860
<v Speaker 2>friend has convinced me that it can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished,</v>

2860
02:38:30.861 --> 02:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>that there's somewhere to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he acknowledges that it actually,</v>

2861
02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:39.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the case that he points to took </v>

2862
02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:41.020
<v Speaker 2>several generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally several generations to </v>

2863
02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:42.530
<v Speaker 2>arrive at a stable a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2864
02:38:42.531 --> 02:38:44.660
<v Speaker 2>you guys have a wonderful relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2865
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I know many people who have terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible relationships.</v>

2866
02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:51.500
<v Speaker 2>And for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion of monogamy seems absurd.</v>

2867
02:38:51.690 --> 02:38:53.510
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get stuck in,</v>

2868
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:58.750
<v Speaker 2>you grow to resent each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he gets sick of each other and </v>

2869
02:38:58.750 --> 02:38:59.390
<v Speaker 2>then you fight in court until you figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out who gets all the money.</v>

2870
02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

2871
02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people shouldn't be together.</v>

2872
02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2873
02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:06.830
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a conflation between </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamory and promiscuity,</v>

2874
02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just a free for all a sex with </v>

2875
02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:13.961
<v Speaker 2>strangers free for all is different from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of careful approach to </v>

2876
02:39:15.141 --> 02:39:20.141
<v Speaker 2>polyamory that this friend takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which still looks extraordinarily </v>

2877
02:39:20.141 --> 02:39:24.371
<v Speaker 2>difficult to pull off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given what human beings are from a </v>

2878
02:39:24.410 --> 02:39:29.410
<v Speaker 2>jealousy perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't monogamy externally difficult </v>

2879
02:39:29.410 --> 02:39:32.201
<v Speaker 2>to pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is the rate of divorce in this </v>

2880
02:39:32.201 --> 02:39:32.870
<v Speaker 2>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's somewhere around 50 percent.</v>

2881
02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:37.430
<v Speaker 2>And chris rock famously said that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent who had the courage to leave.</v>

2882
02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:39.980
<v Speaker 2>How many coward still but here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is.</v>

2883
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.000
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the point about novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are living in a situation where our </v>

2884
02:39:45.831 --> 02:39:49.580
<v Speaker 2>narratives sell us a false picture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our opportunities.</v>

2885
02:39:50.390 --> 02:39:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Our narratives are partially driven by </v>
<v Speaker 2>an economy that wants us to be insecure </v>

2886
02:39:55.390 --> 02:39:56.510
<v Speaker 2>enough to spend money like crazy.</v>

2887
02:39:57.070 --> 02:40:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm not telling people that they </v>

2888
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:06.731
<v Speaker 2>should live one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling them that they should </v>

2889
02:40:06.731 --> 02:40:09.850
<v Speaker 2>understand what their real options are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And polyamory as an experiment is all </v>

2890
02:40:11.091 --> 02:40:16.091
<v Speaker 2>well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happens when you introduce </v>

2891
02:40:16.091 --> 02:40:17.390
<v Speaker 2>children into the mix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2892
02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:18.600
<v Speaker 2>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

2893
02:40:18.601 --> 02:40:23.601
<v Speaker 2>It's very different because children are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so costly to raise and because human </v>

2894
02:40:24.571 --> 02:40:29.571
<v Speaker 2>males are wired to fear raising </v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring that they themselves did not </v>

2895
02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:35.540
<v Speaker 2>produce genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't think it makes sense to </v>

2896
02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:38.490
<v Speaker 2>actually care very much about your genes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and advancing their interests.</v>

2897
02:40:38.491 --> 02:40:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I think this is something evolution has </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck us with that is not valuable.</v>

2898
02:40:42.991 --> 02:40:46.740
<v Speaker 2>It's actually destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless eventually move past.</v>

2899
02:40:47.010 --> 02:40:52.010
<v Speaker 2>But we are wired for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I'm expecting to happen is </v>

2900
02:40:52.010 --> 02:40:56.220
<v Speaker 2>if you have a large scale experiment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamory,</v>

2901
02:40:56.550 --> 02:41:01.550
<v Speaker 2>what it's going to do is it is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>break down into polygyny and it's going </v>

2902
02:41:03.631 --> 02:41:06.930
<v Speaker 2>to break down into single motherhood.</v>

2903
02:41:06.930 --> 02:41:11.930
<v Speaker 2>As men leave these relationships in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to engage in perhaps more </v>

2904
02:41:11.930 --> 02:41:16.341
<v Speaker 2>polyamory with younger women and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be yet one more thing that is a</v>

2905
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:21.360
<v Speaker 2>unevenly distributed between the sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So choose your mate wisely.</v>

2906
02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose your mate wisely,</v>

2907
02:41:23.281 --> 02:41:27.270
<v Speaker 2>but we don't even realize that we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfering with your ability to do that</v>

2908
02:41:27.271 --> 02:41:29.060
<v Speaker 2>in ways that we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2909
02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:34.580
<v Speaker 2>we don't intuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a landscape in which nobody is </v>

2910
02:41:34.580 --> 02:41:38.190
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to the way we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfering in the normal processes that</v>

2911
02:41:38.191 --> 02:41:42.480
<v Speaker 2>would cause you to find a mate with whom</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have a very rewarding,</v>

2912
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:47.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what lifelong processes are you </v>

2913
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:47.790
<v Speaker 2>referring to all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me take an absurd one.</v>

2914
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what effect deodorant is</v>

2915
02:41:51.181 --> 02:41:54.570
<v Speaker 2>having on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choosing the right mate.</v>

2916
02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:59.490
<v Speaker 2>We do know that in studies that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are molecules that you can't consciously</v>

2917
02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:04.491
<v Speaker 2>tell you're detecting that do affect </v>
<v Speaker 2>mate choice and we know that we're </v>

2918
02:42:04.491 --> 02:42:04.950
<v Speaker 2>interfering with that stuff.</v>

2919
02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that birth control affects that </v>

2920
02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:11.660
<v Speaker 2>as well as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women's fertility specifically women's </v>

2921
02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:15.860
<v Speaker 2>ability to smell whether or not she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>even genetically compatible with the </v>

2922
02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:15.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2923
02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And was really freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those lizards,</v>

2924
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:21.030
<v Speaker 2>how do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No rubbing up against each other.</v>

2925
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So I think I think what to wear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deodorant.</v>

2926
02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:31.520
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to at the moment I'm wearing </v>

2927
02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it because sweat stains would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially.</v>

2928
02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wearing.</v>

2929
02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:35.130
<v Speaker 2>You're wearing anti person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I am.</v>

2930
02:42:35.131 --> 02:42:40.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I do important distinction </v>

2931
02:42:40.131 --> 02:42:40.131
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dangerous.</v>

2932
02:42:40.131 --> 02:42:41.190
<v Speaker 2>But here this is taking up your poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great.</v>

2933
02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:44.490
<v Speaker 2>This is a great example because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually did spend a,</v>

2934
02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was a year as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>

2935
02:42:47.011 --> 02:42:49.260
<v Speaker 2>not wearing deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd that go?</v>

2936
02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was already married,</v>

2937
02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.390
<v Speaker 2>so a couple of interesting facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2938
02:42:57.391 --> 02:43:00.630
<v Speaker 2>it did drive some people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2939
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not me though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

2940
02:43:02.731 --> 02:43:04.650
<v Speaker 2>You didn't drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't bother you at all?</v>

2941
02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna leave all been around people </v>
<v Speaker 2>we love who at some point we're like </v>

2942
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:11.480
<v Speaker 2>take a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

2943
02:43:11.530 --> 02:43:11.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2944
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:16.980
<v Speaker 1>as long as you took a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually the thing is though is </v>

2945
02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:17.590
<v Speaker 1>shave the armpits thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you shave your armpits,</v>

2946
02:43:17.591 --> 02:43:19.390
<v Speaker 1>do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one spot,</v>

2947
02:43:19.391 --> 02:43:24.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not putting deodorant anywhere </v>

2948
02:43:24.391 --> 02:43:24.391
<v Speaker 1>else on our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just putting it on the armpits,</v>

2949
02:43:24.391 --> 02:43:26.230
<v Speaker 1>like is it the shaving thing I'll give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you shave your armpits.</v>

2950
02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:31.260
<v Speaker 1>If you shave your armpits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decrease the rate at which it </v>

2951
02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>diffuses into the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it should make a judgment call.</v>

2952
02:43:33.310 --> 02:43:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense,</v>

2953
02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:35.950
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which it is.</v>

2954
02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're being</v>

2955
02:43:37.020 --> 02:43:39.330
<v Speaker 2>wusses right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're being,</v>

2956
02:43:39.331 --> 02:43:44.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got an industry of I don't know </v>

2957
02:43:44.331 --> 02:43:45.420
<v Speaker 2>how much they make per year selling us </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things because we're afraid of our</v>

2958
02:43:45.421 --> 02:43:47.200
<v Speaker 2>own human smell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2959
02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:52.550
<v Speaker 2>But there's a huge difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way somebody smells if they don't </v>

2960
02:43:53.221 --> 02:43:58.221
<v Speaker 2>have good hygiene and somebody who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>the luxury of daily showers and doesn't </v>

2961
02:43:58.561 --> 02:44:03.500
<v Speaker 2>wear shorter and frankly I don't find </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who is taking daily showers and</v>

2962
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:05.610
<v Speaker 2>isn't wearing deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find it that off putting.</v>

2963
02:44:05.611 --> 02:44:08.520
<v Speaker 2>And in europe it's considered much less </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different smell.</v>

2964
02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:12.270
<v Speaker 2>You smell them as opposed to smelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>right guard or whatever it is.</v>

2965
02:44:12.450 --> 02:44:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

2966
02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea whether if we backed our </v>

2967
02:44:19.260 --> 02:44:23.840
<v Speaker 2>deodorant and antiperspirant stuff off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it would change who ended up </v>

2968
02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:27.450
<v Speaker 2>with whom and whether or not marriage is</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a small degree of change,</v>

2969
02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:30.600
<v Speaker 2>but how many other things are there on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the list that we wouldn't think to name?</v>

2970
02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:33.510
<v Speaker 2>What about makeup into women stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing makeup?</v>

2971
02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:36.000
<v Speaker 2>how much would that change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who hooks up with who?</v>

2972
02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:37.710
<v Speaker 2>How much would it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2973
02:44:37.711 --> 02:44:42.711
<v Speaker 2>if we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much would it change if we actually </v>

2974
02:44:42.711 --> 02:44:47.000
<v Speaker 2>learned that there's a difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between hotness and beauty and we </v>

2975
02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.291
<v Speaker 2>actually allowed little girls to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that maybe they weren't so </v>

2976
02:44:52.171 --> 02:44:55.050
<v Speaker 2>interested in being hot because although</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets you a lot of attention,</v>

2977
02:44:55.051 --> 02:44:57.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dead end,</v>

2978
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:59.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much would that change?</v>

2979
02:44:59.071 --> 02:45:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Who ends up with whom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of who ends up with whom at</v>

2980
02:45:02.311 --> 02:45:07.311
<v Speaker 2>the moment is presumably dictated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people having had their attention </v>

2981
02:45:07.311 --> 02:45:11.001
<v Speaker 2>captured through hotness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a question of whether </v>

2982
02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:13.791
<v Speaker 2>there's anything there to back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I want to see for my own kids' </v>

2983
02:45:15.961 --> 02:45:20.961
<v Speaker 2>sake is I want to see a world in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the noise of the way the market </v>

2984
02:45:22.651 --> 02:45:27.651
<v Speaker 2>influences how we interact with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and the notions that get promoted </v>

2985
02:45:28.261 --> 02:45:33.261
<v Speaker 2>as sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where that noise is reduced so that </v>

2986
02:45:33.261 --> 02:45:34.590
<v Speaker 2>people can really begin to detect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns in their life.</v>

2987
02:45:35.010 --> 02:45:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this worked for me.</v>

2988
02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I dated in this way and this worked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2989
02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I dated in that way and it didn't work </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

2990
02:45:42.331 --> 02:45:47.331
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that begins to tell you something </v>

2991
02:45:47.331 --> 02:45:47.331
<v Speaker 2>and all I'm saying about my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2992
02:45:47.331 --> 02:45:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredibly lucky to have a </v>

2993
02:45:52.050 --> 02:45:52.270
<v Speaker 2>relationship that's really rewarding and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2994
02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a lifelong bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

2995
02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:57.810
<v Speaker 2>it may say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got together early.</v>

2996
02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I felt weird about that for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it suggested something.</v>

2997
02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:06.510
<v Speaker 2>You hear about people getting together </v>
<v Speaker 2>in high school and was like,</v>

2998
02:46:06.511 --> 02:46:07.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cute,</v>

2999
02:46:07.351 --> 02:46:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but you know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how well you have chosen in high school.</v>

3000
02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3001
02:46:11.721 --> 02:46:13.370
<v Speaker 2>I met heather in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were friends.</v>

3002
02:46:13.371 --> 02:46:16.160
<v Speaker 2>We knew each other pretty well by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time we got together.</v>

3003
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3004
02:46:18.050 --> 02:46:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I was a dumb kid in my early twenties at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point that the relationship began,</v>

3005
02:46:23.091 --> 02:46:27.560
<v Speaker 2>but it had an advantage that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily know to think about,</v>

3006
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 2>which is heather and I have spent all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

3007
02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm adventuring together and that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that instead of looking for the perfect </v>

3008
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:39.980
<v Speaker 2>partner who's exactly the right fit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3009
02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:45.340
<v Speaker 2>to people who had the right starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>material sort of grew together into a </v>

3010
02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:46.360
<v Speaker 2>partnership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The growing together,</v>

3011
02:46:46.361 --> 02:46:47.520
<v Speaker 2>apart together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3012
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:49.070
<v Speaker 2>That'S a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part.</v>

3013
02:46:49.071 --> 02:46:52.610
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend a lot of time with their mates,</v>

3014
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:54.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3015
02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:56.840
<v Speaker 2>people grow apart to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys get lucky.</v>

3016
02:46:57.080 --> 02:46:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

3017
02:46:58.420 --> 02:47:00.290
<v Speaker 2>A lot of friends that are living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

3018
02:47:00.980 --> 02:47:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

3019
02:47:02.450 --> 02:47:06.170
<v Speaker 2>It's unfortunately really common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more common than not.</v>

3020
02:47:06.171 --> 02:47:11.171
<v Speaker 2>You guys are the outliers role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists taking your kids to the </v>

3021
02:47:11.171 --> 02:47:11.180
<v Speaker 2>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3022
02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:13.690
<v Speaker 2>not the most common thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

3023
02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

3024
02:47:15.351 --> 02:47:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because I've only lived one</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

3025
02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:22.360
<v Speaker 2>but I think there is a lesson because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that what we did actually was </v>

3026
02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:27.400
<v Speaker 2>fairly simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was we played it by ear and the </v>

3027
02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:31.451
<v Speaker 2>stuff that didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we chucked it and the stuff that did </v>

3028
02:47:31.451 --> 02:47:32.270
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we augmented it and so there are no hard</v>

3029
02:47:32.271 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 2>and fast rules.</v>

3030
02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're also exceptional people.</v>

3031
02:47:35.930 --> 02:47:40.500
<v Speaker 2>You're both very unusually smart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>openminded well thanks to each other,</v>

3032
02:47:40.830 --> 02:47:45.830
<v Speaker 2>but we found each other and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think openminded display important </v>

3033
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:47.600
<v Speaker 2>than smart in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like being able to look at each other.</v>

3034
02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3035
02:47:49.191 --> 02:47:51.410
<v Speaker 2>this is true for any interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3036
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I look at unc,</v>

3037
02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:58.940
<v Speaker 2>you as a human being with real emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and feelings and reality to your </v>

3038
02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:03.251
<v Speaker 2>experiences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I feel like we disagree </v>

3039
02:48:03.251 --> 02:48:03.251
<v Speaker 2>completely so even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3040
02:48:03.251 --> 02:48:05.120
<v Speaker 2>even when we're at our angriest with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

3041
02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:11.360
<v Speaker 2>if we can see each other's humanity </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it and you get through that,</v>

3042
02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:15.780
<v Speaker 1>that is a lesson for every human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all walks of life.</v>

3043
02:48:15.810 --> 02:48:18.150
<v Speaker 1>In any situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you disagree with someone,</v>

3044
02:48:18.390 --> 02:48:21.390
<v Speaker 1>not just your lover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a friend,</v>

3045
02:48:21.450 --> 02:48:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but people that you don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3046
02:48:23.461 --> 02:48:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to dehumanize someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagrees with you,</v>

3047
02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:29.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think to bring this all back </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

3048
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:35.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a part of the problem with male </v>
<v Speaker 1>female interaction today is this </v>

3049
02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:39.960
<v Speaker 1>dehumanization on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the men are demons,</v>

3050
02:48:39.961 --> 02:48:41.910
<v Speaker 1>that the woman are this and the men of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3051
02:48:41.911 --> 02:48:43.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3052
02:48:43.650 --> 02:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>these rash generalizations in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme tribalism.</v>

3053
02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3054
02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:55.620
<v Speaker 2>there is kind of a secret weapon and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a secret.</v>

3055
02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.040
<v Speaker 2>The secret is heather and I have a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>second channel on which to navigate,</v>

3056
02:49:03.041 --> 02:49:07.740
<v Speaker 2>which is that we both know the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary story.</v>

3057
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a way,</v>

3058
02:49:09.061 --> 02:49:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's an idea that's important.</v>

3059
02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:16.290
<v Speaker 2>You can very often understand more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a given human interaction,</v>

3060
02:49:16.291 --> 02:49:20.810
<v Speaker 2>especially a contentious one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you turn down the sound right,</v>

3061
02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:23.640
<v Speaker 2>so you can't hear what's being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sounds wrong,</v>

3062
02:49:24.010 --> 02:49:24.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like,</v>

3063
02:49:24.610 --> 02:49:29.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the most important piece of </v>

3064
02:49:29.610 --> 02:49:31.671
<v Speaker 2>information you could have is what these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are saying to each other as </v>

3065
02:49:31.671 --> 02:49:31.671
<v Speaker 2>they're arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

3066
02:49:31.671 --> 02:49:36.291
<v Speaker 2>that's not how human beings work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the important information is </v>

3067
02:49:36.291 --> 02:49:40.761
<v Speaker 2>on that vocal channel and sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocal channel is actually almost purely </v>

3068
02:49:41.071 --> 02:49:42.570
<v Speaker 2>noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3069
02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:45.390
<v Speaker 2>and so if both literally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically,</v>

3070
02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:50.940
<v Speaker 2>but if heather and I both know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a part of us that's sort of</v>

3071
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:52.530
<v Speaker 2>always outside if we.</v>

3072
02:49:52.530 --> 02:49:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't fight that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really pretty rare,</v>

3073
02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:00.440
<v Speaker 2>but when we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a part of us that's </v>

3074
02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:03.740
<v Speaker 2>watching the interaction and knows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain pattern may have to unfold in </v>

3075
02:50:06.121 --> 02:50:07.860
<v Speaker 2>order for us to get to the other part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3076
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes heather notes that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in theater at some level even </v>

3077
02:50:13.070 --> 02:50:14.070
<v Speaker 2>though neither of us wants to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way to put it.</v>

3078
02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Engaging in couples theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

3079
02:50:17.730 --> 02:50:20.000
<v Speaker 2>and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>

3080
02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:22.310
<v Speaker 2>it's the perfect example of this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

3081
02:50:22.311 --> 02:50:27.311
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about peterson and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into work and wearing makeup and you </v>

3082
02:50:27.311 --> 02:50:27.480
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I sending sexual signals?</v>

3083
02:50:27.481 --> 02:50:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

3084
02:50:28.411 --> 02:50:31.110
<v Speaker 2>we're all involved in weird stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3085
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:36.590
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you and your mate could </v>
<v Speaker 2>both be aware that your argument is in </v>

3086
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:38.780
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some way theater and that even though</v>

3087
02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3088
02:50:39.721 --> 02:50:41.380
<v Speaker 2>if it's theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can just skip it now.</v>

3089
02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:46.500
<v Speaker 2>You can't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things that have to happen in </v>

3090
02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:49.170
<v Speaker 2>order for you to get to the next act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

3091
02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:54.560
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm not saying something I </v>

3092
02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:54.560
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a,</v>

3093
02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:56.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing I'm not the easiest guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live with.</v>

3094
02:50:56.731 --> 02:51:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a very decent person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also fine,</v>

3095
02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:05.250
<v Speaker 2>but thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a part of me that's not good</v>

3096
02:51:05.251 --> 02:51:08.610
<v Speaker 2>at certain stuff that makes heather's </v>
<v Speaker 2>life heart right.</v>

3097
02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:12.390
<v Speaker 2>And that stuff she's good at putting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it to a certain extent.</v>

3098
02:51:12.391 --> 02:51:16.170
<v Speaker 2>And then there are things that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it to get even to get bad.</v>

3099
02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I need to know that that's happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order for us to get past it and she </v>

3100
02:51:21.901 --> 02:51:23.280
<v Speaker 2>needs to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3101
02:51:23.430 --> 02:51:26.090
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the normal level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3102
02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really frustrated considering </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploding.</v>

3103
02:51:30.430 --> 02:51:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3104
02:51:31.451 --> 02:51:36.451
<v Speaker 2>But it sound that come the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the necessity of us being able to </v>

3105
02:51:36.451 --> 02:51:39.180
<v Speaker 2>exchange that information is there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact you know,</v>

3106
02:51:39.181 --> 02:51:44.181
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so much less charged if we both </v>

3107
02:51:44.181 --> 02:51:47.630
<v Speaker 2>know that sort of that process has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfold and that is not an infinite </v>

3108
02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:51.231
<v Speaker 2>process and we will be on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it once you know she's conveyed,</v>

3109
02:51:51.301 --> 02:51:53.390
<v Speaker 2>which needs to convey and I've let her </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that I've heard.</v>

3110
02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:55.470
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more times you've done this,</v>

3111
02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:57.720
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

3112
02:51:57.721 --> 02:51:58.770
<v Speaker 2>this is going to end up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3113
02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:01.500
<v Speaker 2>this feels awful right now like we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting in.</v>

3114
02:52:01.501 --> 02:52:05.590
<v Speaker 2>This feels awful and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done this before and actually this</v>

3115
02:52:05.591 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 2>proves to</v>

3116
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.470
<v Speaker 3>be necessary because it reset some </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you know,</v>

3117
02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:11.110
<v Speaker 3>just every relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter if it's romantic or not,</v>

3118
02:52:11.350 --> 02:52:14.360
<v Speaker 3>needs resets on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is,</v>

3119
02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:19.380
<v Speaker 3>this is one way that you consider </v>
<v Speaker 3>theatrically reset some important </v>

3120
02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:23.520
<v Speaker 3>points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a great lesson for reasonable </v>

3121
02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:26.071
<v Speaker 3>people and everybody would aspire to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable people loose ended up that we</v>

3122
02:52:27.281 --> 02:52:29.370
<v Speaker 3>just did three hours but just flew right</v>
<v Speaker 3>by it,</v>

3123
02:52:29.371 --> 02:52:30.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3124
02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:32.750
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>

3125
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Really fun.</v>

3126
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:38.050
<v Speaker 4>Three hours.</v>
