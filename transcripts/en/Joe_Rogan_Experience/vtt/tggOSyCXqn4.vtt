00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>That was gonna be like some Disney thing.</v>

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:06.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>holy cow.</v>

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.333
<v Speaker 1>What movie was that?</v>

7
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Literally called chimpanzee.</v>

8
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

9
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.321
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

10
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:11.154
<v Speaker 1>A documentary?</v>

11
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't realize chimps did calculator.</v>

13
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.083
<v Speaker 1>Cruelty.</v>

14
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

16
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>we know better because we've advanced,</v>

18
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>but if we hadn't,</v>

19
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.511
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>

20
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:21.781
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

21
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking live in a house.</v>

22
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I like the champ.</v>

23
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Why his brow chimp ways to go?</v>

24
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.911
<v Speaker 1>This is it,</v>

25
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

26
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.253
<v Speaker 1>Chimp life.</v>

27
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm now,</v>

28
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>but we in a way to the AI might be like those chimps.</v>

29
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much do we think about chimps?</v>

30
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.091
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>

31
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:39.924
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

32
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>These chimps are at war.</v>

33
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw that David Attenborough documentary on Champs when they were eating those</v>

34
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>call bus monkeys and ripping them apart.</v>

35
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

36
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>this is why people were so crazy.</v>

38
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We came from that thing.</v>

39
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

40
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

41
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>But I got a better philosophy.</v>

44
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.083
<v Speaker 1>They like swingers.</v>

46
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.823
<v Speaker 1>They really are.</v>

48
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>They just seem to resolve.</v>

49
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:02.364
<v Speaker 1>Everything was sex.</v>

50
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>The only rules they have is the mom won't bang the Sun.</v>

51
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

52
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.713
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

53
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.883
<v Speaker 1>They're good women,</v>

54
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>good women in the community.</v>

55
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.471
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else.</v>

56
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Just banging it out.</v>

57
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen the winova movie.</v>

59
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>they're disturbing just at a zoo,</v>

61
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>at the zoo.</v>

62
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.611
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly going.</v>

63
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:21.444
<v Speaker 1>Constantly fucking,</v>

64
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.021
<v Speaker 1>and they don't care.</v>

66
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Gay,</v>

67
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:25.861
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

68
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

69
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fuck it.</v>

70
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.673
<v Speaker 1>These labels</v>

71
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen when I was at a zero.</v>

72
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That's probably not on the PGA section.</v>

73
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have them at many zoos.</v>

74
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at that before too.</v>

75
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a thing that they'd be like to keep regular chimps at zoos.</v>

76
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause Bonilla was just always jacking off.</v>

77
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>What's that they have in San Diego?</v>

78
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

79
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.253
<v Speaker 1>Probably separate them.</v>

80
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>how many other in a cage,</v>

82
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be pretty intense.</v>
