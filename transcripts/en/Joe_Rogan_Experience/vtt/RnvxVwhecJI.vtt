00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.133
<v Speaker 1>It's good to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a statistic that I was going </v>

5
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you divvied up all the money,</v>

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>all the money in the entire country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the money that we have,</v>

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>everyone would get $179,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all the money.</v>

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.923
<v Speaker 1>The U s 300 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the 2010 Federal Reserve </v>

10
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a few years old.</v>

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.833
<v Speaker 1>Their total net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>net worth of all us households and </v>

12
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.271
<v Speaker 1>nonprofits is around 54 point $9 </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's $179,000</v>

14
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>per person based on 307 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that include children?</v>

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three of them.</v>

16
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>7 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your kids would get a hundred grand,</v>

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>179 that's pretty sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty sweet.</v>

18
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Your 11 year old fat with cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>imagine the 11 year old or the hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>and $79,000</v>

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>how much candy can you buy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

21
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.604
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pool is filled with inflatable </v>

22
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>flamingos.</v>

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why you shouldn't be </v>

24
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>allowed to have that kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Matt,</v>

25
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>when I was at Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>talking to this guide and a real nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

28
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:24.874
<v Speaker 1>He's super cool because he's got like so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much knowledge about Disneyland and </v>

29
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.461
<v Speaker 1>shortest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

30
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>his name is philander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his actual name,</v>

31
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>which is not a philanderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice gentleman.</v>

32
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>But he was talking to me about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a prince from like,</v>

34
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these Middle Eastern countries.</v>

35
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And one time it was a little boy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was five years old.</v>

36
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had all these grown men,</v>

37
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.881
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>40 year old men around him if that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to every fucking word he said.</v>

39
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>He said it had to run over with candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun to see the mouse.</v>

40
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does whatever he wants.</v>

41
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>And he's five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

42
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said he has like ungodly amounts of</v>

43
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do whatever you want.</v>

44
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally probably worth $1 billion guys</v>

45
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.623
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's probably just becoming aware of </v>

46
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>his power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's always been aware.</v>

47
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I think or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>but I think his model of how people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're servants all servants.</v>

49
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's royalty.</v>

50
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>My kids would be awful if they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>

51
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.323
<v Speaker 1>You would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be the idea that you could take </v>

52
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.624
<v Speaker 1>a five year old kid and give him ungodly</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money and power is kind of </v>

53
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.513
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with their mood swings at </v>

54
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:49.824
<v Speaker 1>that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all like in the middle of his </v>

55
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>knee and like I want to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane now.</v>

56
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.773
<v Speaker 1>I want an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what's funny with kids is when they </v>

57
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>get tired they just can't deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

58
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just fall apart.</v>

59
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 2>But my favorite is when my daughter goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry me.</v>

60
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Like she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine you get to a point where</v>

61
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to lift me around.</v>

62
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I know it's too much effort to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk.</v>

63
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Carry me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still does that at 11 and it's just like</v>

64
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I physically can't.</v>

65
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I can for two steps and then when </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you down what?</v>

66
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>His 11 year old way.</v>

67
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.170
<v Speaker 3>11 or she told me the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like 89.</v>

68
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It's too big and long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's long.</v>

69
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>You're picking her up and her legs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging on the ground.</v>

70
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they want you to carry him</v>

71
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 2>like a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're carrying a log.</v>

72
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can like lumber.</v>

73
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if I had to carry,</v>

74
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.233
<v Speaker 3>like I can carry my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could feel my shoulders like a </v>

75
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 3>fireman's carry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

76
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.553
<v Speaker 3>But that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nobody wants to be carried like </v>

77
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

78
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

79
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 3>they want to be a little little cuddle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want him nuzzle in.</v>

80
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to make it easy on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms or your body.</v>

81
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does squats with like in the curl</v>

82
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.014
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like do a curl and then do </v>

83
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 3>squats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time we went to seaworld and uh,</v>

84
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.783
<v Speaker 3>my daughter wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was before we knew it was bad and </v>

85
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 3>we just knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just knew it was a lame place to go.</v>

86
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know it was evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my daughter,</v>

87
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 3>my oldest one was like a kid and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>four or something.</v>

88
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:28.454
<v Speaker 3>can you pick me up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had like that macho squat moment </v>

91
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 3>her up right into a tree branch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no impact.</v>

92
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Knock Dong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

93
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.523
<v Speaker 3>And then you feel so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you want to blame somebody other </v>

94
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 3>than you and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the,</v>

95
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.540
<v Speaker 3>the seaworld branch people assholes with</v>
<v Speaker 3>their tree placement.</v>

96
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a rough one,</v>

97
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she always,</v>

98

<v Speaker 3>year old is not asking be carried.</v>

99
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 3>But the 11 year olds still have moments </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Dan.</v>

100
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.453
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's also this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on with kids where they're </v>

101
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 3>realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be responsible for myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>

103
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 3>This is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This day is coming.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's like puberty time,</v>

107
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.203
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she is so aware of it and she </v>

108
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 3>literally said out loud the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to stop being a kid.</v>

109
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

110
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at our friends,</v>

111
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.920

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

112
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 3>look at Erin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a grown up.</v>

113
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.800

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

114
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 3>but she's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not.</v>

115
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.381
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

116
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.100

<v Speaker 3>having a good time.</v>

117
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:42.934
<v Speaker 3>And I then I got kind of bummed out as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was saying it because I want to say to </v>

118
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.011
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

119
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:48.844
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that much of a grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to her it's like I'm a serious guy </v>

120
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.440
<v Speaker 3>that's walking around scowling </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

121
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.343
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of stuff that they wouldn't </v>

122
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 3>relieve her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

123
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 3>she sees me as a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not having that much fun</v>

124
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.393
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well don't you look at people that have </v>

125
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.170
<v Speaker 1>incredible responsibilities like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president and you go fuck that job.</v>

126
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

127
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Ceos of giant corporations are </v>

128
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>working 2030 hours a day or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they're doing.</v>

129
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I think you just get in it and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>work 30 hours a day.</v>

130
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>You just get in it and you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

131
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:24.284
<v Speaker 1>But I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you look at them from an outsider's </v>

132
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>perspective and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is just,</v>

133
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times kids look at that</v>

134
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>about adults like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

135
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>do you have your passport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's your keys?</v>

136
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Where's it all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

137
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>got my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that.</v>

138
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.971
<v Speaker 1>They look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

139
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got so much to handle.</v>

140
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.850
<v Speaker 1>So much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you lock the doors were going out.</v>

141
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Could you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you call the bill guy?</v>

142
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Did you make sure the payment and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the plumber is,</v>

143
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 1>is that fixed or can we turn the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

144
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:51.164
<v Speaker 1>Is it the though</v>

145
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Speaker 3>the thing that drives me crazy when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at those guys,</v>

146
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 3>the business guys and the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not this president so much cause he</v>

147
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:01.660
<v Speaker 3>seems pretty funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is the,</v>

148
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 3>they're so serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing like is I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>take anything that serious around.</v>

150
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Even if people are screaming about </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I keep it light.</v>

153

166
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Your daily eight hours centers is to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to an office and do something you hate.</v>

00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:32.590
<v Speaker 4>they ground their flour on like mortar </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pestle.</v>

236
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.420
<v Speaker 4>But they were really shitty and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd get a lot of sand in the flower.</v>

237
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.630
<v Speaker 4>So the people in ancient Egypt all had </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up teeth,</v>

238
00:10:40.631 --> 00:10:45.631
<v Speaker 4>like worn down to the nerves cause they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were chewing sand all day.</v>

239
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.420
<v Speaker 4>So the inside of their body was like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

240
00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:51.790
<v Speaker 4>what are those things called on birds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that called?</v>

241
00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

242
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.820
<v Speaker 4>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that thing?</v>

243
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.280
<v Speaker 4>That thing that they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The crop where you,</v>

244
00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Speaker 4>you have your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your gizzard.</v>

245
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We both fucking rocks in there and you </v>

246
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Speaker 4>chew up your Food God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is apparently,</v>

247
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why they made,</v>

248
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>led shot illegal in California.</v>

249
00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:13.234
<v Speaker 4>Cause like if people do like shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>clays or if they shoot things and those </v>

250
00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 4>little lead pellets from shotguns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

251
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.640
<v Speaker 4>Birds will actually eat those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

252
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.870
<v Speaker 4>And it goes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're gizzard and they use it to,</v>

253
00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:27.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to grind things up,</v>

254
00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:28.774
<v Speaker 4>but then they get lead poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing with the California </v>

255
00:11:30.581 --> 00:11:31.900
<v Speaker 4>condor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

256
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why California</v>

257
00:11:34.301 --> 00:11:35.890
<v Speaker 4>condors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

258
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why they made led </v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal for a ammunition in California.</v>

259
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.380
<v Speaker 4>It was because of California condors </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause they wouldn't hear it dump fucks.</v>

260
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.580
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

261
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 4>eating pellets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

262
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a rock.</v>

263
00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:51.040
<v Speaker 4>You stupid fuck condor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look dumb.</v>

264
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.540
<v Speaker 4>They have dominance fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really do it.</v>

265
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 4>But we need this should be toasted.</v>

266
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean toasted would really be the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would get you to tie right now.</v>

267
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:58.414
<v Speaker 3>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

268
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy to see you eat bread.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

275
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.590

276
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Flour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water and salt.</v>

277
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.330
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

278
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from your sourdough starter bread,</v>

279
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 3>like the healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whole wheat bread,</v>

<v Speaker 3>32.</v>

282
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.833
<v Speaker 3>This is pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is that just because it's preserved </v>

283
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 3>preservatives and flavors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And young people could show mad when you</v>

284
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 3>eat on a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Normally folks,</v>

286
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:49.714
<v Speaker 3>I would never do this to you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>only doing this to you because Tom Papa </v>

287
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 3>brought some bread in and I'm gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>break my diet for a few hours.</v>

288
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 3>The sour dough flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that little after flavor in the top</v>

289
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:00.454
<v Speaker 3>of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an that's a bacteria that's </v>

290
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:04.530
<v Speaker 3>lactobacillius or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

291
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really good.</v>

292
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.950
<v Speaker 3>You're in a excellent bread guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool.</v>

293
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Standup comedy thing doesn't pan out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

294
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.973
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just go into it after doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>your podcast and then talking about it </v>

295
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 3>on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just kind of erupted.</v>

296
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:21.990
<v Speaker 3>People were just so interested in just </v>
<v Speaker 3>this pure earth,</v>

297
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.460
<v Speaker 3>making something small and simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

298
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.520
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I told you when I saw you at the</v>

299
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

300
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:29.854
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some,</v>

301
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.783
<v Speaker 3>you have some real man listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like dudes who look like they're going </v>

302
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 3>to call you for like advice on a truck </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

303
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't get my starter right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's some like,</v>

304
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 3>and people would start sending me </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of,</v>

305
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 3>there's bread and pictures of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>sourdough and then this guy from the New</v>

306
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 3>York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam sift in the editor,</v>

307
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 3>it was doing an article on it.</v>

308
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 3>So he contacted me and I was part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sour dough.</v>

309
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing about people keep their</v>
<v Speaker 3>sourdough starter like a pet.</v>

310
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 3>So it was kind of like this revival of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this little method.</v>

311
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up in this article in the New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York Times.</v>

312
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it.</v>

313
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of people send me articles </v>
<v Speaker 3>about starters to yeah,</v>

314
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:12.934
<v Speaker 3>like people in England than have 150 </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old starters and all this crazy </v>

315
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:16.534
<v Speaker 3>shit weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good that I'd never even heard </v>

316
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 3>about until you brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

317
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea either until a month </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that I had the,</v>

318
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.510
<v Speaker 3>I was under the impression I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was with zero research,</v>

319
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 3>just my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how you make bread.</v>

320
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 3>I thought you'd take flour and water and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eggs and yeast.</v>

321
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You add used poor Euston and that's all </v>

322
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:37.841
<v Speaker 3>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

323
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:38.674
<v Speaker 3>I never knew that you had like did you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take flour and mix it with water and </v>

324
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>then you get east out of the air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

325
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.340
<v Speaker 3>When you told me that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

326
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:49.150
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

327
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Just floating around this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did you know that that's what the</v>

328
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>case with nitrogen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

329
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 1>like the reason why there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on this planet,</v>

330
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 1>and this is from a radio lab podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>that highlighted,</v>

331
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called the bad show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

332
00:15:06.161 --> 00:15:06.994
<v Speaker 1>the radiolab podcast was highlighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>how sometimes really bad people do </v>

333
00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:12.464
<v Speaker 1>really good things or really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes it's difficult to </v>

334
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.793
<v Speaker 1>differentiate between someone who's bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>or good because what they've done is so </v>

335
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

336
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy named Fritz harbor and </v>

337
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:27.551
<v Speaker 1>Fritz Haber was a scientist in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what harbor did was he figured out a</v>

338
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:28.574
<v Speaker 1>way to extract nitrogen from the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>because apparently our air is mostly </v>

339
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive part of what's in the air</v>

340
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>is nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

341
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what percentage young </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

342
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 1>what percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

343
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please put percentage of the oxygen.</v>

344
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You're like the five year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding the five year old.</v>

345
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

346
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to know how much nitrogen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the air.</v>

347
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Amy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>

348
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 1>20% okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

349
00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 1>by all by volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dry Air contains 78% nitrogen,</v>

350
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 1>20% oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

351
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:03.764
<v Speaker 1>78% nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the air is mostly nitrogen and we </v>

352
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>need nitrogen for fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Fritz harbor came up with this method</v>

353
00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:12.524
<v Speaker 1>called the hopper method of extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen from air and that is what we </v>

354
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:17.954
<v Speaker 1>use primarily for fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of what we need to make </v>

355
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 1>sure that the ground is viable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing food.</v>

356
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 1>While the harbor method is responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the nitrogen,</v>

357
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:29.834
<v Speaker 1>apparently that's in 50% of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet extracted directly from </v>

358
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 1>the harbor method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean in the people?</v>

359
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.093
<v Speaker 1>The pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nitrogen from from say if you grow </v>

360
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>plants right and you eat those plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nitrogen that gets in your body from</v>

361
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:45.284
<v Speaker 1>those plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50% of it is coming from this one guy's </v>

362
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:52.130
<v Speaker 1>method that he invented in world war one</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

363
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

364
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So what was in us in the 18 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer from fish,</v>

365
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.390
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

366
00:16:58.391 --> 00:16:59.224
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to get mulch and compost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how a lot of people do it </v>

367
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 1>today with organic farming they use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

368
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Like at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take our chicken eggs and,</v>

369
00:17:08.411 --> 00:17:13.411
<v Speaker 1>and things that we don't eat and it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this pile with leaves and Oh yeah,</v>

370
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to compost is tricky.</v>

371
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

372
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.993
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of create an </v>

373
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 1>environment for bacteria and stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

374
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And when plants eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just eat water.</v>

375
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just photosynthesis,</v>

376
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 1>but they also need nutrients from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soil and they get their nutrients in the</v>

377
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:34.110
<v Speaker 1>soil from dead things from decaying </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies for right.</v>

378
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from worms and bugs and all kinds of </v>

379
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this guy,</v>

380
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:40.634
<v Speaker 1>Fritz Haber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to get the nitrogen in </v>

381
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:43.540
<v Speaker 1>order to fertilize the ground.</v>

382
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.540
<v Speaker 1>He just getting it out of the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also created Zyklon b client a,</v>

383
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:51.204
<v Speaker 1>and b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit that they used to kill a Jews </v>

384
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 1>in the concentration camps that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>created that.</v>

385
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>But he actually did the eval name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 1>that's bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they say as I close icon,</v>

387
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>that's why I say it right as I call him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

388
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:09.591
<v Speaker 1>so he came up with Xy clon a in Zyklon a</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this gas,</v>

389
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but there was a scent attached to it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could smell it right.</v>

390
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 1>So that you could know it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck deafness.</v>

391
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.270
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis switched it to Zyklon b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took out that smell and that's what</v>

392
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 1>they used to gas people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps.</v>

393
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.190
<v Speaker 1>So Fritz Haber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way was a Jew,</v>

394
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 1>his harbor method created this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

395
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.823
<v Speaker 1>He also was one of the first people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>institute some form of chemical warfare </v>

396
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 1>in world war one.</v>

397
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.243
<v Speaker 1>They would use the same method that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to extract nitrogen from the </v>

398
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 1>oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>

399
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 1>he utilize that method to bomb allied </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops with poison gas.</v>

400
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.943
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was apparently he was a fucking </v>

401
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:57.410
<v Speaker 1>maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.253
<v Speaker 1>And it was directly his idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only was it directly his idea to </v>

403
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 1>bomb the allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like super excited about it.</v>

404
00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:04.524
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

405
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

406
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.180
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

407
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 1>he just had this power knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went right to evil.</v>

408
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of because he thought he was doing </v>

409
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 1>good because he was doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

410
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

411
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.600
<v Speaker 1>But then he was eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Hitler rose to power,</v>

412
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.570
<v Speaker 1>he was fucked because he was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because he was Jewish,</v>

413
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

415
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 1>because he was so valuable as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

416
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:30.564
<v Speaker 1>they didn't immediately lock him up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was in this weird position where </v>

417
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:33.984
<v Speaker 1>he had to take a stand and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what he was responsible for doing </v>

418
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 1>ultimately went on to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 1>untold millions of people.</v>

420
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Did he survive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they know I'm alive now?</v>

421
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died,</v>

422
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking,</v>

423
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

424
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 1>some sort of health care in Switzerland </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

425
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I think he had like a bad heart really </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he died,</v>

426
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:57.114
<v Speaker 1>trying to make it there because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of exiled by country and they </v>

427
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't take him in England because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

428
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was wanted at the same time,</v>

429
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:05.850
<v Speaker 1>he's received a Nobel prize for creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hopper method.</v>

430
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>He was wanted for crimes against </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

431
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>It was wanted as a war criminal for </v>
<v Speaker 1>using this gas on the allied troops.</v>

432
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.550
<v Speaker 1>She's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so complicated.</v>

433
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:15.384
<v Speaker 1>So in one on one hand he was responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the death of all these people and </v>

434
00:20:18.171 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible way.</v>

435
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.633
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hopper method again is responsible </v>

436
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:23.424
<v Speaker 1>for like literally they believe that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>populates population boom is directly </v>

437
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 1>attributable to his invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

438
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just a side thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

439
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.443
<v Speaker 1>at what point did it become a war crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use gas if I think nobody had ever </v>

440
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:38.214
<v Speaker 1>done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just saw how bad it wasn't </v>

441
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 1>immediately it was like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is a,</v>

442
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.690
<v Speaker 1>well the idea of a war crime is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

443
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky because when</v>

444
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.933
<v Speaker 4>you said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he thought he was doing a good </v>

445
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:50.824
<v Speaker 4>thing cause it's his country that he is </v>
<v Speaker 4>protecting and it hadn't been done </v>

446
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:54.064
<v Speaker 4>before that you people were using gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like why would that be a crime </v>

447
00:20:58.151 --> 00:20:58.984
<v Speaker 4>at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what's a war crime and what isn't </v>

448
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is dropping a bomb?</v>

449
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Is that a war cry was drop a bomb on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>city,</v>

450
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 4>hydrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear,</v>

451
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

452
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:08.344
<v Speaker 4>isn't it a war crime?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you indiscriminately kill people </v>

453
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 4>happen to be in the area that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>bombing,</v>

454
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 4>what's the crime like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

455
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Tom.</v>

456
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 4>Papa is still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the problem.</v>

457
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 4>It's of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the problem is,</v>

458
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the chip grabbed that bitch up.</v>

459
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:24.244
<v Speaker 4>So we don't keep doing this because </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise people will tolerate like a </v>

460
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 4>session of a podcast and chewing.</v>

461
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 4>You're chewing brown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if we keep going,</v>

462
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 4>that'd be fucking pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam Cro will get more viewers.</v>

463
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

464
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.250
<v Speaker 4>that you ate it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

465
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.093
<v Speaker 4>I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew it'd be concerned about the </v>

466
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 4>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

467
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:42.220
<v Speaker 4>I hit a milestone this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One 90.</v>

468
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 4>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

469
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 4>I've lost more than 10 pounds in a since</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

470
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long has it been?</v>

471
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 4>Like five or six months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

472
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 4>Five months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five months.</v>

473
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.920
<v Speaker 4>Just go real clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

474
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I cut all the bullshit out and I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating a high fat diet,</v>

475
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 4>a high healthy fats like Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coconut oil,</v>

476
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.680
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things along those lines and um,</v>

477
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 4>I just cut out bread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>

478
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.570
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No car.</v>

479
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very little.</v>

480
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.660
<v Speaker 4>I get most of my carbs from vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

481
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 4>I tell you like as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically,</v>

482
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:20.620
<v Speaker 4>like my energy level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

483
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 4>I feel so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

484
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Speaker 4>I've never felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

485
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to try this.</v>

486
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 4>I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just get used to feeling like shit.</v>

487
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.210
<v Speaker 4>It's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

488
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.200
<v Speaker 4>It's totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just get used to it.</v>

489
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 4>You get used to like people were hung </v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

490
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just kind of like in this fog and </v>

491
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 4>you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just how I am.</v>

492
00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.200
<v Speaker 4>Think it's bad diet or booze or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

493
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 4>What about the GCL Kimmel lust is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

494
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.000

<v Speaker 4>That fasting thing,</v>

495
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 4>that five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

496
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 4>two diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

497
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:51.190
<v Speaker 4>two diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's five days.</v>

498
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:54.040
<v Speaker 4>He just eats whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a crazy person.</v>

499
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 4>And then two days he eats under 500 </v>
<v Speaker 4>calories and he tributes.</v>

500
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 4>He says he's been doing it for years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why he's slim.</v>

501
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:04.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a lot slimmer than you used to base</v>

502
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.710
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

503
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.441
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

504
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 4>two days don't eat like 500 calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

505
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like pickles and coffee and then,</v>

506
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:12.454
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the rest of the days he just </v>

507
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:17.560
<v Speaker 4>eats whatever he wants to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't be good for your body.</v>

508
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

509
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm just too stupid for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

510
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 4>I do the minimal amount of research on </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everything.</v>

511
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 4>You seem so knowledgeable about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>though when I seemed knowledgeable about</v>

512
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 4>a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

513
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I have these kind of questions </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Gel,</v>

514
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:33.004
<v Speaker 4>now I know a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you let go into depth with me </v>

515
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 4>about them and you find out how shallow </v>
<v Speaker 4>my knowledge true.</v>

516
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching uh,</v>

517
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.043
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this woman came to my show in San </v>

518
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Francisco this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A doctor Rhonda Patrick.</v>

519
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You met her.</v>

520
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.340
<v Speaker 4>She now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she hit me on twitter after she had been</v>

521
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:56.320
<v Speaker 4>at the show and was thanking me for </v>
<v Speaker 4>being so hilarious and uh,</v>

522
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I saw she had a lot of twitter followers</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just looked her up and uh,</v>

523
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 4>saw her on your show and she was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and she's like,</v>

524
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.774
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

525
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.703
<v Speaker 4>super smart about all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just goes the facts just pouring out of </v>

526
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

527
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're acting or not,</v>

528
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.310
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

529
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 4>you looked like you knew what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing acting.</v>

530
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 4>But it's a perfect example because in </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison to her,</v>

531
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

532
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:25.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was off the charts,</v>

533
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 4>but that's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

534
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 4>Paired right person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

535
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you what ketosis is and I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you why.</v>

536
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 4>It's better to have your body burn fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>allegedly.</v>

537
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although people disagree with it.</v>

538
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.860
<v Speaker 4>This is stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

539
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.720
<v Speaker 4>Bobby Lee doesn't know this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Bobby Lane,</v>

540
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 4>he has a beautiful body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think so?</v>

541
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's into different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a scallop those old,</v>

542
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.373
<v Speaker 4>like a scallop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a scout challenged with </v>

543
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 4>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember those old days.</v>

544
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.610
<v Speaker 4>That was like a hot look what being </v>
<v Speaker 4>levee.</v>

545
00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those like Victorian days.</v>

546
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.643
<v Speaker 4>People would just lie around and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>look like a lard ass and everybody was </v>

547
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:03.794
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aw,</v>

548
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 4>it meant wealth.</v>

549
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 4>I know that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can afford food and not amazing.</v>

550
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:08.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was because back then it was </v>

551
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:10.904
<v Speaker 4>probably difficult to get that fat too </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause they weren't eating processed </v>

552
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:15.254
<v Speaker 4>foods like rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff that we today like candy </v>

553
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:20.060
<v Speaker 4>bars and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coca Cola,</v>

554
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.350
<v Speaker 4>it just right to fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Immediate.</v>

555
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.520
<v Speaker 4>So like back then if you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get that fat,</v>

556
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:29.630
<v Speaker 4>like I always picture whenever I picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reuben NASC I picture somehow or another</v>

557
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 4>a picture of them naked on a couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

558
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.160
<v Speaker 4>Do you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have like,</v>

559
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.933
<v Speaker 4>like when you think of like overweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>people from that part time I was </v>

560
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 4>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like lounging naked food around just</v>

561
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:43.340
<v Speaker 4>fat as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

562
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to eat a lot of food back then.</v>

563
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 4>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

564
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 4>isn't it probably until like the last 40</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

565
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 4>Because like when you look at movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even like in the 60s,</v>

566
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either the extras,</v>

567
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.190
<v Speaker 4>the stars beyond the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the people and they're all thin.</v>

568
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.473
<v Speaker 4>They're all thin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just not the puffiness that we </v>

569
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:06.404
<v Speaker 4>all have now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a puffiness that comes because </v>

570
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to eat this bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We think it's whole wheat bread from the</v>

571
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:14.870
<v Speaker 4>store and it's got sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got fruit,</v>

572
00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 4>it's got stuff in it that's puffing us </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

573
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 4>That didn't exist even in the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 4>and seventies a big part is corn syrup.</v>

574
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.360
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see king corn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

575
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

576
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy documentary with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

577
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:30.970
<v Speaker 4>They're students and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

578
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.903
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go and they get their body examine </v>

579
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 4>and they examine the doctor who does the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tests on them,</v>

580
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:38.834
<v Speaker 4>examines their carbon and their body and</v>
<v Speaker 4>finds out that most of it comes from </v>

581
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were</v>

582
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

583
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is that?</v>

584
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:46.674
<v Speaker 1>So it sends them on this journey where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they start examining the role that corn </v>

585
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>plays in our diet and food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they ultimately went and,</v>

586
00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got their own farmland and started </v>

587
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:57.234
<v Speaker 1>growing some corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they go into the whole process of </v>

588
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:00.714
<v Speaker 1>corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how corn is subsidized by the u s </v>

589
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 1>government and how much corn is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different products that we eat.</v>

590
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:08.563
<v Speaker 1>So these guys go to the supermarket and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they walked down the aisle and just </v>

591
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:14.430
<v Speaker 1>randomly start grabbing stuff and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out this says corn protein.</v>

592
00:27:14.431 --> 00:27:17.520
<v Speaker 1>This has corn syrup that says this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that and this.</v>

593
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.250
<v Speaker 1>And fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use corn for everything every then,</v>

594
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.280
<v Speaker 1>and even the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the meat is all corn fed animals.</v>

595
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they're so fat and the,</v>

596
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 1>and they shouldn't be eating corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

597
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Well then when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have steak and it's corn fed,</v>

598
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 1>that big thick layer of fat and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marbling,</v>

599
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:34.420
<v Speaker 1>which we call marbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

600
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 1>That's like the cow dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a cow being a fat fuck.</v>

601
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

602
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tasty pie.</v>

603
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.570
<v Speaker 1>That's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:46.404
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

605
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

606
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that we liked,</v>

607
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

608
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 1>tastes good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

609
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 1>But to think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a fatty piece of meat,</v>

610
00:27:55.770 --> 00:28:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I know a fat thick Ribeye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's well marbled,</v>

611
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go lord.</v>

612
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so good if it's bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

613
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Why the good things bad for you tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>pile?</v>

614
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the,</v>

615
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you God wants you to come see him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven is that whole sweetie.</v>

616
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.460
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

617
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.150
<v Speaker 3>my new movement is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

618
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 3>try and not eat factory farmed meat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

619
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 3>which basically means you're not eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat most of the time.</v>

620
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't eat it when you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't eat Pepperoni Pizza,</v>

621
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.950
<v Speaker 3>candy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

622
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Like if you really want to try and know </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly where your meat is coming from,</v>

623
00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:37.641
<v Speaker 3>you're basically cutting a ton of meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of your diet because you,</v>

624
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.370
<v Speaker 3>you can for home use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to a farmer's market,</v>

625
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 3>pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

626
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.040
<v Speaker 3>beef that is grown by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

627
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 3>raised it by this local cattle hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

628
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:48.444
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to go out in the world on the road </v>

629
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:50.844
<v Speaker 3>and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only going to eat me where I know </v>

630
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 3>where it's come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at a room service menu.</v>

631
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to happen.</v>

632
00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:57.950
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to go to</v>

633
00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.460
<v Speaker 1>a restaurant where you knew what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farm was that they'd got it from,</v>

634
00:29:01.461 --> 00:29:02.900
<v Speaker 1>which she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those now.</v>

635
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

636
00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:04.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

637
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to these places now and they say </v>

638
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:09.610
<v Speaker 3>farm raised and farm to table places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

639
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.460
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cities,</v>

640
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>I'd never had it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you gotta like Cleveland,</v>

641
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 3>which was the Tory is for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

642
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:20.840
<v Speaker 3>not giving a shit about their diet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now is a lot of them.</v>

643
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 1>This is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Well I think the Internet has sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded people's idea of what food is.</v>

645
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.233
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of chefs who really </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy food but don't really enjoy this </v>

646
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:34.120
<v Speaker 1>whole idea of factory farming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out what,</v>

647
00:29:34.121 --> 00:29:37.470
<v Speaker 1>what this gotta be on a more wholesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to getting your food.</v>

648
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.673
<v Speaker 1>And so they make relationships with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these farmers and then they buy their </v>

649
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 1>food directly from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this one place in Maine that was</v>

650
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 1>on a Anthony Bourdain's show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on his early show,</v>

651
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 1>the no reservation show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people in Maine,</v>

652
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 1>they do everything and it's a short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

653
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 1>they're not open in the winter cause you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

654
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 1>winters in Maine are just brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

655
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 1>So they're closed in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during the summer,</v>

656
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:02.524
<v Speaker 1>Spring and fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have everything on the menu is </v>

657
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 1>vegetables a day grow.</v>

658
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they butchered their own </v>

659
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:12.520
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They raised their own animals.</v>

660
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.413
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really weird because like they </v>

661
00:30:14.181 --> 00:30:15.014
<v Speaker 1>were petting this pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the pig and they were petting </v>

662
00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:17.550
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

663
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

664
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.690
<v Speaker 1>after you kill a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start looking at them like,</v>

665
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.171
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

666
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>this is a nice ham hock here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

667
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 1>the Bacon's going to be good off of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

668
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

669
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it's dark because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your direct connect it to it.</v>

670
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:32.944
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that like a middleman </v>

671
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:36.543
<v Speaker 1>that gives you a nice filter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to think about the </v>

672
00:30:38.411 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 1>morality behind that little piggy.</v>

673
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.953
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like those people are able </v>

674
00:30:44.421 --> 00:30:46.700
<v Speaker 3>to do it like it is kind of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

675
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's natural for farmers.</v>

676
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.610
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talked to farmers,</v>

677
00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:51.290
<v Speaker 1>they get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.320
<v Speaker 1>You get used to this idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have these things,</v>

679
00:30:54.321 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 1>you're raising me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love Him.</v>

680
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Then you shoot him in the head and eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

681
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

682
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:01.323
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get rid of factory </v>

683
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 3>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people that are eating.</v>

684
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to exist,</v>

685
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 3>but I just feel like maybe I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to participate in it.</v>

686
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Is it always going to exist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

687
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:12.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

688
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's reading and it's getting stronger.</v>

689
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:17.104
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farming is now ending up in </v>

690
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 3>places that never had a meat based diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>sending up all throughout Asia.</v>

691
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's spreading.</v>

692
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not getting smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just because it's profitable.</v>

693
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people just out</v>

694
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 1>people jump in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of that,</v>

695
00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

696
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And the demand drops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

697
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 1>We got to do is I've got to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in America all that money.</v>

698
00:31:38.351 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 1>So they get that $179,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

699
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could afford that sweet,</v>

700
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:48.061
<v Speaker 3>sweet farm raised protein hay back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

701
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 3>back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

702
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 3>the science guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

703
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 3>made the Xy clon yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Spring Harbor.</v>

704
00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Harbor Harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like an evil,</v>

705
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>like that's a guy that has like a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

706
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.053
<v Speaker 3>a lot of good in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it becomes like this evil kind </v>

707
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:09.430
<v Speaker 3>of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

708
00:32:09.431 --> 00:32:12.300
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were asking what like,</v>

709
00:32:12.301 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 3>what's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a war crime?</v>

710
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fuzzy.</v>

711
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what side you're on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you're living,</v>

712
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:20.284
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could say the same thing about </v>

713
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:21.963
<v Speaker 3>being a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we see someone as being a </v>

714
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:26.500
<v Speaker 3>terrorist as being something evil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful,</v>

715
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.320
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure like if you talk to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

716
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.933
<v Speaker 3>18 year old kid is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand how my family is </v>

717
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:33.964
<v Speaker 3>suffering in the middle of this desert </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're being tortured by these </v>

718
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 3>governments that came in and raped our </v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

719
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 3>He could make a case that would make you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

720
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 4>well you blowing up something is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>really a war crime.</v>

721
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:44.324
<v Speaker 4>It's you fighting for your survival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like Tom pops a terrorist </v>

722
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 4>sympathizer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

723
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.573
<v Speaker 4>Two things about Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bobby likes bread and terror and I love </v>

724
00:32:52.691 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 4>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

725
00:32:54.861 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying is that fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

726
00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Someone had asked me that question in </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to like the uh,</v>

727
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.730
<v Speaker 4>our own revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when we started fighting outside of</v>

728
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:05.564
<v Speaker 4>the lines and hiding in trees and doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>some crazy kind of fighting and we </v>

729
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 4>weren't in those lines anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

730
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:12.230
<v Speaker 4>these guys are rebels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys are,</v>

731
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.630
<v Speaker 4>we're chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

732
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.520
<v Speaker 4>you're cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it,</v>

733
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.170
<v Speaker 4>you could probably dig back to the root </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and be like,</v>

734
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 4>well you're hurting innocent people or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

735
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:24.590
<v Speaker 4>There probably is a line we can say this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a war crime.</v>

736
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 4>Well what's interesting is at one point </v>
<v Speaker 4>in time war was handled in a gentlemanly</v>

737
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

738
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.403
<v Speaker 4>Like the leaders of one army would meet </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the leaders of the other and the </v>

739
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:36.344
<v Speaker 4>general would actually hand his sword </v>
<v Speaker 4>over to the other general and they </v>

740
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.023
<v Speaker 4>either take it or occasionally in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gesture of good faith it would give the </v>

741
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 4>sword back to him except except defeat </v>
<v Speaker 4>or except victory.</v>

742
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.243
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they handled war by these like very </v>

743
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 4>strict codes at that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least at the highest levels.</v>

744
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 4>And then somewhere along the line we </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured that we don't,</v>

745
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 4>I think that was because it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>super intimate,</v>

746
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 4>like for war back then you had to kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of be on top of each other.</v>

747
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to be like stabbing each other,</v>

748
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.783
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are shooting each other with arrows at </v>

749
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 4>the very low and it's not that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 yards,</v>

750
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.130
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with like much shorter </v>
<v Speaker 4>distances and then once they figured out</v>

751
00:34:16.131 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 4>bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't even know where this bomb's</v>

752
00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:19.370
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fuck those people.</v>

753
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.093
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

754
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.690
<v Speaker 4>Where's the general?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm dropping this on to him.</v>

755
00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:29.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean his sword isn't World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ultimate example of that,</v>

756
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.373
<v Speaker 4>I mean World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they drop those bombs and Nagasaki </v>

757
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 4>and Hiroshima bombs are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the ultimate,</v>

758
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>down there.</v>

759
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to let this motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>drop this.</v>

760
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.043
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never dropped a bomb in a city </v>

761
00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:43.790
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

762
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.200
<v Speaker 4>And this is the first time they dropped </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

763
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 4>It only happened twice ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those two nuclear bombs,</v>

764
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.390
<v Speaker 4>it dropped in those cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally were like,</v>

765
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.100
<v Speaker 4>whoever the fuck's down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

766

<v Speaker 4>Tough Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So long babies.</v>

767
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to end this.</v>

768
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You drop a bomb on a city for sure.</v>

769
00:34:57.351 --> 00:34:58.880
<v Speaker 4>You're killing babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

776

<v Speaker 4>outside of the area that gets affected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:22.280
<v Speaker 4>the guy who's has doesn't get touched </v>

<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Well there was one guy who escaped </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hiroshima and went to Nagasaki and then,</v>

780
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.420
<v Speaker 4>and he got blown up and Nagasaki to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker must have thought the world</v>

<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to read Samurai books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking dude's to drop a nuclear bomb.</v>

785
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.840
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

786
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I saw Adrian Brody had a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a cool quote on a woody</v>

787
00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:56.284
<v Speaker 3>Allen yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just back to the thing and be like good </v>

788
00:35:59.081 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 3>and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether this guy was,</v>

789
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.300
<v Speaker 3>was a good person or a bad person and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were asking him about Woody Allen.</v>

790
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.250
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

791
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.180
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a complicated thing being a,</v>

792
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.280
<v Speaker 3>being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a complicated,</v>

793
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 3>messy affair and he's an artist and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like his films and he's,</v>

794
00:36:17.651 --> 00:36:18.484
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be irresponsible of me to </v>

795
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.550
<v Speaker 3>assume I know something of which I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>very little.</v>

796
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on in a man's </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

797
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:29.690
<v Speaker 3>let alone his sexual life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let alone you know,</v>

798
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.143
<v Speaker 3>to assume that you know these things as </v>
<v Speaker 3>and treat them as truth when they </v>

799
00:36:34.481 --> 00:36:37.420
<v Speaker 3>haven't even been proven true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a difficult thing.</v>

800
00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:40.270
<v Speaker 3>The thing I latched on to is it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a mess.</v>

801
00:36:40.271 --> 00:36:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a mess.</v>

802
00:36:42.191 --> 00:36:46.990
<v Speaker 3>So complicated and especially a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been around for years,</v>

803
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:47.621
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:51.640
<v Speaker 3>you're seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been around trying to be a person</v>

805
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.130
<v Speaker 3>for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

806
00:36:54.131 --> 00:36:55.210
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time,</v>

807
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.103
<v Speaker 3>you are going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are going to be at the very least a </v>

808
00:37:00.341 --> 00:37:02.420
<v Speaker 3>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

809
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're standing,</v>

810
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.920
<v Speaker 1>like when you stand against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

811
00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:09.754
<v Speaker 1>You're not just standing against a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being who may or may not have done some </v>

812
00:37:12.551 --> 00:37:13.384
<v Speaker 1>fucked up things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also standing against the </v>

813
00:37:15.641 --> 00:37:19.780
<v Speaker 1>idea of people doing the things that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>is alleged to have done.</v>

814
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Like sexual abuse of minors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

815
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.733
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that the deal?</v>

1041
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 4>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1042
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.530
<v Speaker 4>obviously my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my life,</v>

1043
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1044
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 4>the way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm not looking at someone who</v>

1045
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:15.880
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nor are you when you have children,</v>

1046
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 4>you know what it's like to raise a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little tiny people and then have them be</v>

1047
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 4>grown up.</v>

1048
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.953
<v Speaker 4>And then the idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say if you and your wife got divorced </v>

1049
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.450
<v Speaker 4>when you were younger and your four year</v>
<v Speaker 4>old went to live with another guy and he</v>

1050
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:29.284
<v Speaker 4>lived with her until she was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he wound up marrying her and </v>

1051
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 4>fucking write and having kids with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what I'm saying?</v>

1052
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:34.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you see what I'm saying?</v>

1053
00:48:34.951 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 4>But that is exactly what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1054
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's an intense flaw.</v>

1055
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that being said,</v>

1056
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 4>two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will you watch his movies?</v>

1057
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.580
<v Speaker 4>I've watched these movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.121
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1059
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:49.954
<v Speaker 4>it's a stink in the air though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he calls you and wants you to be in </v>

1060
00:48:52.681 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 4>his next film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't work with them.</v>

1061
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 4>You do not go no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No fucking way.</v>

1062
00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Not like he's calling me or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you grow up thinking woody Allen was</v>

1063
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 4>like a comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1064
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1065
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up thinking it was very funny.</v>

1066
00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:08.770
<v Speaker 4>Like his movies were really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it.</v>

1067
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:10.050
<v Speaker 4>A lot of his movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1068
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:10.923
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't like one of your guys deeper </v>
<v Speaker 4>Annie Hall and know he had a lot of </v>

1069
00:49:13.601 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 4>great films.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1070
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:17.740
<v Speaker 4>he's amazing films.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He uses the misdemeanors,</v>

1071
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 4>Hannah and her sisters and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even the most recent stuff,</v>

1072
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:22.690
<v Speaker 4>the dice clay movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

1073
00:49:22.691 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Jasmine blue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1074
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.180
<v Speaker 4>that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1075
00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 4>Barcelona.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.950
<v Speaker 4>that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Barcelona and what was the missing?</v>

1077
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 4>Midnight in Paris that was really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>to amazing.</v>

1078
00:49:31.331 --> 00:49:31.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're owned,</v>

1079
00:49:31.891 --> 00:49:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Wilson actually plays Woody Allen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woody Allen impression.</v>

1080
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Woody Allen got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1081
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.420
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where he joined.</v>

1082
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:41.590
<v Speaker 4>Brodie was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was playing Salvador Dali.</v>

1083
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I am done Dolly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1084
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.251
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1085
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 4>he's obviously really good at making </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies,</v>

1086
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.013
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we played some of stand up on the </v>

1087
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:53.550
<v Speaker 4>podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1088
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.513
<v Speaker 4>And from like the 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the early sixties and he was always a </v>

1089
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 4>pervert and early stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like really pervy yes.</v>

1090
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.143
<v Speaker 4>We'll look at sleeper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a giant tip chasing him across </v>

1091
00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:10.570
<v Speaker 4>the park in central park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This giant lactating tip,</v>

1092
00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 4>50 feet up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quit.</v>

1093
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 4>This guy was a pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a weird fucking guy.</v>

1094
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

1095
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:17.021
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

1096
00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 4>ands or buts about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a weird fucking guy.</v>

1097
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 4>And he is a weird fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1098
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:23.063
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I guess what he's done is not a </v>

1099
00:50:25.121 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 4>crime because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1100
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.250
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the actual law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do anything wrong.</v>

1101
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not as biological daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1102
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:35.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet with soon.</v>

1103
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1104
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.333
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he can kind of do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a thing that his </v>

1105
00:50:39.341 --> 00:50:42.260
<v Speaker 1>biological daughter says that he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird shit to her.</v>

1106
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.740
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his daughter was coached by the mom</v>

1107
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:50.090
<v Speaker 1>and there's just no way to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1108
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:50.953
<v Speaker 1>I know it would be horrible if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused him of sexually molesting his </v>

1109
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 1>daughter and was really just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation by the mother.</v>

1110
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And that is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1111
00:50:59.981 --> 00:51:00.814
<v Speaker 1>And there's this idea that you're never </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to judge someone who's making </v>

1112
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:07.190
<v Speaker 1>an accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never supposed to question them.</v>

1113
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.440
<v Speaker 1>They are the victim about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that,</v>

1114
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.303
<v Speaker 1>I think that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an incredibly large amount of </v>

1115
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:15.290
<v Speaker 1>fake rape cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake molestation cases.</v>

1116
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 1>These people lie about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lie about money,</v>

1117
00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:22.820
<v Speaker 1>they lie about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lie fuck by Frank Sinatra</v>

1118
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.740
<v Speaker 2>married exactly till he turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>old blue eyes.</v>

1119
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Just that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that you're like,</v>

1120
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:30.330
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

1121
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 2>you got a problem with the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1122
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the other side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1124
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:35.144
<v Speaker 2>She's not claiming there's taking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>crooner Dick while she was living with </v>

1125
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:38.354
<v Speaker 2>woody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she'd sneak off or a common just </v>

1126
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 2>going to go out and get a coffee and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking toupee falls off.</v>

1127
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave you a kid.</v>

1128
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden he became dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1130
00:51:57.321 --> 00:51:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1131
00:51:58.461 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1132
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.073
<v Speaker 3>if your wife had any hint that something</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going on with you like crazy and </v>

1133
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:05.930
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1134
00:52:05.931 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 3>just please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1135
00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.700
<v Speaker 3>it's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very sleek.</v>

1136
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Did eventually leave her for the Suny </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mama?</v>

1137
00:52:15.911 --> 00:52:18.030
<v Speaker 1>What do we like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gossipers I just think,</v>

1138
00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:18.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's money.</v>

1139
00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:19.794
<v Speaker 3>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is kind of an interesting thing </v>

1140
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:21.451
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1141
00:52:21.451 --> 00:52:22.284
<v Speaker 3>if you were to what you said of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it represents other people that do </v>

1142
00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:29.790
<v Speaker 3>this as the kind of the swing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody,</v>

1143
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.583
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't work with people because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their private life and things you </v>

1144
00:52:34.681 --> 00:52:36.780
<v Speaker 3>didn't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would never work with anybody.</v>

1145
00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Would you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a mess down</v>

1146
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.240
<v Speaker 2>with them and go over their private </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1147
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever lied to a cop?</v>

1148
00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1149
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever lied about speeding,</v>

1150
00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.910
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever not paid your taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's get into your sex life.</v>

1151
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think about other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come?</v>

1152
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1153
00:52:58.031 --> 00:52:58.864
<v Speaker 2>This meeting is over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy of mine that actually got </v>

1154
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:02.110
<v Speaker 2>an argument like that with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend.</v>

1155

<v Speaker 1>supposed to do is keep your mind pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1197
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.113

<v Speaker 1>me what I can and can't do with my </v>

1198
00:54:59.271 --> 00:55:01.430
<v Speaker 1>thoughts because sometimes my thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fun.</v>

1199
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I like to explore the idea of,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want her to keep her thoughts to </v>

1235
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:45.724
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she's bang some big redneck and a </v>

<v Speaker 2>bang or thinking about bang.</v>

1239
00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want anything?</v>

<v Speaker 2>and how about she cooks something once </v>

1243
00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:08.824
<v Speaker 2>in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I baking bread like I'm an old </v>

1244
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:11.314
<v Speaker 2>lady.</v>

1245
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Why am I running around with a flower on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my shirt?</v>

1246
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 2>She's sitting on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wear an apron?</v>

1247
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have thought about it,</v>

1248
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:22.530
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it's going over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:26.110
<v Speaker 2>What did you keep in the pocket?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder one head pocket.</v>

1250
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that even come up?</v>

1251
00:57:28.571 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who throws shit and that front pocket,</v>

1252
00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A one hit and the razor blade.</v>

1253
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.383
<v Speaker 2>A one hitter and a razor blade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never see anybody using that front </v>

1254
00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:39.430
<v Speaker 2>pocket on the Apron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Never comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1256
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's in there?</v>

1257
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're lighter.</v>

1258
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show is go out and smoke a little.</v>

1259
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do smoke.</v>

1260
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Which is interesting because cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dell,</v>

1261
00:57:48.521 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 2>your taste buds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care.</v>

1262
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is food.</v>

1263
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Fuck God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat in the shit.</v>

1264
00:57:57.190 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 2>But I always thought that was weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>about chefs because the whole idea about</v>

1265
00:58:00.941 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 2>preparing food is making something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's delicious.</v>

1266
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:05.080
<v Speaker 2>It's an art form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1267
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1268
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dulling,</v>

1269
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:09.370

<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm really in a sec,</v>

1270
00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 2>but I love condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

1271
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never smoke.</v>

<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1273
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't never smoked either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but allegedly it does.</v>

1274
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that I've talked to that quit</v>

1275
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:21.850
<v Speaker 2>smoking say that was one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable things about it.</v>

1276
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Is it right after you quit smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your taste buds back?</v>

1277
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Eh Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't look as cool.</v>

1278
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that about?</v>

1279
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.863
<v Speaker 2>What's it about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something so stupid when you're sucking </v>

1280
00:58:33.551 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 2>on some burning leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A prop.</v>

1281
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 2>A good prop though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people that vape do not look cool.</v>

1282
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.660
<v Speaker 2>They look like they've got a pacifier </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking on a robot's Dick,</v>

1283
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1284
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:51.490

00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 2>How much you vape thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give a fucking battery that can charge a</v>

1286
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:55.804
<v Speaker 2>car and it glows like Rudolph and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they blow the smoke clouds out like </v>

1287
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.200
<v Speaker 2>fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

1288
00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:04.960
<v Speaker 2>There's so much that comes out and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into it.</v>

1289
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:07.040
<v Speaker 2>They get into the big giant clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She sent me one and he sent me one that </v>

1291
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I could literally kill someone with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could beat someone to death with it.</v>

1292
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:16.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a big thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy copper one.</v>

1293
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Do we still have that stupid thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying around tobacco or for weed?</v>

1294
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 2>It's for tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could use it for,</v>

1295
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 4>we'd definitely use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd have yet like weed oil.</v>

1296
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.003
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a weird thing where you had to </v>

1297
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:32.411
<v Speaker 4>like Ge drip the oil into this thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we don't need to see a jamie.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you though.</v>

1299
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:37.970

<v Speaker 4>but it was fucking heavy.</v>

1300
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Like it probably weighed a pound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1301
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.040
<v Speaker 4>At least a pound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 4>For home use or you're not taking that </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the bar.</v>

1303
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:46.670
<v Speaker 4>I supposed to just fucking carry it </v>
<v Speaker 4>around in a slang.</v>

1304
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.390
<v Speaker 4>It looked like brass knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really huge.</v>

1306
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.910
<v Speaker 4>Fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it didn't have a case.</v>

1307
00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:53.744
<v Speaker 4>It should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should have a wheeler case so you can </v>

1308
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:55.940
<v Speaker 4>take it through the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not cool.</v>

1309
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 4>But cigarette to sit there with just the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette in your hand.</v>

1310
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.600
<v Speaker 4>It's a nudge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A baby.</v>

1311
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:06.430
<v Speaker 4>That stripe baby sending Mia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell me.</v>

1312
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to talk into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jus the chairman of the boat has spoken.</v>

1313
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 4>It's the coolest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a cool prop.</v>

1314
01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 4>You can do stuff with it apparently can </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a point.</v>

1315
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.773
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's a really good cognitive </v>

1316
01:00:23.001 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 4>enhancer to oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1317
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Nicotine is apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1318
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.000
<v Speaker 4>it's as effective as like a new tropic </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a co,</v>

1319
01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.580
<v Speaker 4>as a cognitive enhancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like vitamins,</v>

1320
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:36.410
<v Speaker 4>like Parasso tem and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamins.</v>

1321
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:37.244
<v Speaker 4>Coleen that had been shown to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects on memory and cognitive </v>

1322
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:40.604
<v Speaker 4>function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nicotine apparently has a positive </v>

1323
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:42.854
<v Speaker 4>effect on cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of guys who smoke like </v>

1324
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:48.890
<v Speaker 4>e-cigarettes before they go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really just to get a little,</v>

1325
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:50.150
<v Speaker 4>a little buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little buzz,</v>

1326
01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 4>a little go coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the same thing.</v>

1327
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.413
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think coffee actually has a </v>

1328
01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:01.090
<v Speaker 4>cognitive enhancing performance benefits</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been proven.</v>

1329
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Just makes you busy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you happier.</v>

1330
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.400
<v Speaker 4>I know it increases euphoria and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it lights you up.</v>

1331
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.323
<v Speaker 4>You like [inaudible] stimulates you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's probably some benefit in </v>

1332
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just being more awake.</v>

1333
01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.540
<v Speaker 4>If you are awake though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it really benefits you.</v>

1334
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Like there's times when I'm writing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I'm writing in the afternoon and</v>

1335
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:23.264
<v Speaker 4>I'll have an espresso and they come back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden I'll catch myself </v>

1336
01:01:26.571 --> 01:01:27.404
<v Speaker 4>like 15 minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just humming along and like doing </v>

1337
01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:30.531
<v Speaker 4>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1338
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 4>like you just get busy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just get like,</v>

1339
01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:33.524
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going.</v>

1340
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:34.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Without being aware that it was really </v>

1341
01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:37.070
<v Speaker 4>the caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1342
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:38.323
<v Speaker 4>Do you take the note?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it neurotropic nootropic </v>

1343
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 4>nootropics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd take them.</v>

1344
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 4>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan.</v>

1345
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I want to take more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

1346
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.433
<v Speaker 4>I'm so into like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept for a long time it was like I'm </v>

1347
01:01:51.171 --> 01:01:53.340
<v Speaker 4>not taking anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1348
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 4>now I'm at a point where it's like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>live in the 21st century.</v>

1349
01:01:56.961 --> 01:02:00.290
<v Speaker 4>It's time to start taking some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what kind of stuff?</v>

1350
01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I take vitamin D now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

1351
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:05.030
<v Speaker 4>D Three d three yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good.</v>

1352
01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.230
<v Speaker 4>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good,</v>

1353
01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:06.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1354
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Well the only way you get it is through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the son or through certain foods.</v>

1355
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.260
<v Speaker 4>It's particularly important for Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1356
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Be 12 and [inaudible] are two of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most common things.</v>

1357
01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Be 12 too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it comes from</v>

1358
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1359
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:21.743
<v Speaker 1>we get it primarily be 12 especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get it primarily from an animal </v>

1360
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>protein and they apparently get it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>

1361
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to vegans can get it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain forms of bacteria.</v>

1362
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Microorganisms like you have to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>living things to get it.</v>

1363
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be 12 I should add also be 12 huge be</v>

1364
01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>12 big a d three is tig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three d,</v>

1365
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>h e a or not thca a Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish oil.</v>

1366
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fish oil,</v>

1367
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Omega threes and sixes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super,</v>

1368
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>super important for brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omega,</v>

1369
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Omega threes and sixes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take that as a supplement that yes,</v>

1370
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get some of it from flax oil and</v>

1371
01:02:57.601 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>from hemp oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as effective as fish oil.</v>

1372
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is taken out ideology and you know,</v>

1373
01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:04.554
<v Speaker 1>eating plants versus eating animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist uniformly believe that fish </v>

1374
01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>oil is the better method for absorbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1375
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:12.953
<v Speaker 1>But then you go online and you look up </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish oil and there's just as much as </v>

1376
01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:20.310
<v Speaker 1>many articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fish oil does nothing.</v>

1377
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omega threes and sixes are critical,</v>

1378
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what fish oil is.</v>

1379
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:26.960
<v Speaker 1>We just know that from the official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1380
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.530
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about that.</v>

1381
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>So someone's saying the fish oil does </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1382
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>

1383
01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 1>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1384
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the number one big deal.</v>

1385
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:36.564
<v Speaker 1>People think that they like to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and then feeling an immediate </v>

1386
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:41.820
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you're doing when you're taking</v>

1387
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:42.654
<v Speaker 1>vitamins and supplements and eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy food is your building your body </v>

1388
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.890
<v Speaker 1>with these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these materials.</v>

1389
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Like if you eat cake and Ho hos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you eat,</v>

1390
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that's what your body uses to regenerate</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

1391
01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>That's where it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body uses to grow.</v>

1392
01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.093
<v Speaker 1>I mean all your tissue is eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be made out of everything you </v>

1393
01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>eat of birthday deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthing kit,</v>

1394
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:06.210
<v Speaker 1>and then then sourdough bread.</v>

1395
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:08.063
<v Speaker 1>So what we are today is your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption of all the different foods </v>

1396
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:15.600
<v Speaker 1>and nutrients that you've taken in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what it's built with it.</v>

1397
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And it can only make a good body off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good ingredients.</v>

1398
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really that simple.</v>

1399
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.543
<v Speaker 1>If you're not getting any vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body starts pulling them out of </v>

1400
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.880
<v Speaker 1>your bones and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1401
01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>pulling calcium out of your bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1402
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>But your body freaks the fuck out when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough stuff.</v>

1403
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's where a lot of diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

1404
01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:36.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of problems come from just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the proper building blocks.</v>

1405
01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when you eat healthy,</v>

1406
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 1>you give your body what it needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuild and build.</v>

1407
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:43.583
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your growth from there on represents </v>

1408
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:48.540
<v Speaker 1>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever you're putting in,</v>

1409
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>the healthier the stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the healthier your body is.</v>

1410
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:51.684
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to be an immediate </v>

1411
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>effect I've had.</v>

1412
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.370
<v Speaker 1>It would be pretty quick though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairly quick.</v>

1413
01:04:56.371 --> 01:05:00.630
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better and over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like weeks or months like this,</v>

1414
01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>a wacky die that I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initially it didn't feel good.</v>

1415
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>It didn't know there's lack of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did not feel good.</v>

1416
01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:08.573
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like headaches the first few </v>

1417
01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1418
01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to sugar will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know.</v>

1419
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And then forms of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even just bread while you yeah,</v>

1420
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1421
01:05:18.731 --> 01:05:19.564
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bread,</v>

1422
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.570
<v Speaker 1>even alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1423
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:22.803
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful even how much </v>

1424
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>fruit you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1425
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:26.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1426
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>like someone had a glass of orange juice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about it.</v>

1427
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:31.384
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how many fucking oranges go </v>

1428
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>into the glass of orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like seven oranges.</v>

1429
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Like really fuck sits down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eats seven oranges.</v>

1430
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>And we were laughing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1431
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>but not even with fiber.</v>

1432
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you take the fiber out so your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body's like,</v>

1433
01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>what is all this God damn sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1434
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>But we have it in our head that sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>from fruit juice is healthy,</v>

1435
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar from Coca Cola is not,</v>

1436
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>but apparently your body doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference.</v>

1437
01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 1>But if you eat an apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that just the fiber offset?</v>

1438
01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.870
<v Speaker 1>How much sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does have an impact.</v>

1439
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a positive way,</v>

1440
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.693
<v Speaker 1>your body's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how your body's supposed to get </v>

1441
01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:06.721
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1442
01:06:06.721 --> 01:06:07.554
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be attached almost like</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an incentive to eat things that are </v>

1443
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:11.940
<v Speaker 1>healthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1444
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:12.833
<v Speaker 1>So the vitamins and the fiber or all </v>
<v Speaker 1>intertwined with this delicious flavor </v>

1445
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:17.404
<v Speaker 1>that makes you attracted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore like you eat an orange is </v>

1446
01:06:19.991 --> 01:06:21.250
<v Speaker 1>in fact good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1447
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't eat,</v>

1448
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.210
<v Speaker 1>go crazy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:29.170
<v Speaker 1>You just shouldn't have 20 ounces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>orange juice is squeezed out.</v>

1450
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:30.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially when we have that </v>

1451
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:34.630
<v Speaker 1>concentrate stuff or it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>really orange juice anymore.</v>

1452
01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like this weird frozen thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.250
<v Speaker 1>But when you like with your kids in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

1454
01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:40.084
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you should give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>some orange juice if they're like </v>

1455
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>feeling kind of a vitamin C?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1456
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C's definitely good for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1457
01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a good antioxidant and he signed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them run down.</v>

1458
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1459
01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:53.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the worst thing in the world.</v>

1460
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.503
<v Speaker 1>Have a little orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is like a big ass glass </v>

1461
01:06:57.701 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 1>of orange juice as a jolt of sugar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your system.</v>

1462
01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Or in the afternoon I preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1463
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink fruit juices anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.513
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat,</v>

1465
01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:07.373
<v Speaker 1>but I still eat fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that juicing is very </v>

1466
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:11.884
<v Speaker 1>problematic in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you could just figure out a way to </v>

1467
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:14.974
<v Speaker 1>condense a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the sugar from all these different </v>

1468
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:18.214
<v Speaker 1>fruits and one thing that you jolt into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and just a few seconds you </v>

1469
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 1>chug a glass of orange juice.</v>

1470
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:24.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1471
01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tidal wave of sugar wall.</v>

1472
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take glucosamine.</v>

1473
01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.990
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Can Jordan,</v>

1474
01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:32.824
<v Speaker 1>do you take those two together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just glucosomine does are both really </v>

1475
01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glucosomines good.</v>

1476
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:37.503
<v Speaker 1>Glucosomine was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people might be wrong about </v>

1477
01:07:40.481 --> 01:07:42.670
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This came from this book by this guy,</v>

1478
01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Joel Wallach who wrote this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>book called dead doctors don't lie.</v>

1479
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.120
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about mineral </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies and um,</v>

1480
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 1>how few doctors really do understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and how they give you a really</v>

1481
01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:57.034
<v Speaker 1>shitty advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really they're completely </v>

1482
01:07:57.881 --> 01:07:58.714
<v Speaker 1>uneducated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be a good podiatrist or a </v>

1483
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>good orthopedic surgeon or what have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1484
01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 1>but how many of them actually understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanisms of nutrition?</v>

1485
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 1>That's where Doctor Rhonda Patrick comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1486
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking genius when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1487
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever I have any questions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>different nutrients or vitamins and will</v>

1488
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>just go over</v>

1489
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 4>the tasks and she's super analytical and</v>
<v Speaker 4>objective about it.</v>

1490
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:20.714
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she'll tell you the pros and cons </v>

1491
01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:24.680
<v Speaker 4>and goods and bads and what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1492
01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:25.514
<v Speaker 4>what could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could be going on and what is </v>

1493
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.270
<v Speaker 4>definitely going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1494
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1495
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:31.730
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot going on when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating food.</v>

1518
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:37.803
<v Speaker 4>Too much electricity over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking Atlanta and you're </v>

<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1521
01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.673
<v Speaker 4>Let's stop thinking about it when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think we've heard my podcast when I use </v>

1522
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:50.060
<v Speaker 4>like this little recorder and just no </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

1523
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:54.590
<v Speaker 4>This is a reason it sounds so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vape pens we have in this room.</v>

1524
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.163
<v Speaker 4>I know I have one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how many things do you take in the </v>

1525
01:09:58.341 --> 01:09:58.640
<v Speaker 4>morning?</v>

1526
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.220
<v Speaker 4>Like 12 in the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1527
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.533
<v Speaker 4>especially lately the morning I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>relaxed a lot of what I do as far as </v>

1528
01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 4>like my diet cause in the morning a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of times I'm not hungry.</v>

1529
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:13.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I used to eat because I felt like it</v>

1530
01:10:13.511 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 4>had to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I read this thing recently.</v>

1531
01:10:15.741 --> 01:10:16.574
<v Speaker 4>You know they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say that breakfast is your most </v>

1532
01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 4>important meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've heard.</v>

1534
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:23.840
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's important is meals,</v>

1535
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say that breakfast is not your most</v>

1536
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 4>important meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it's just a meal.</v>

1537
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.030
<v Speaker 4>The idea of like loading up so you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>go on about your day is like it.</v>

1538
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it slows you down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1539
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.930
<v Speaker 4>And then the car bloating is what a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people do.</v>

1540
01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 4>They're eating cereal and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to cause a crash.</v>

1541
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ramp it up with the carb loading.</v>

1542
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.850
<v Speaker 4>Your body has to process all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

1543
01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:44.693
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a nice cup of coffee and some </v>

1544
01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:48.410

<v Speaker 4>That's what you do.</v>

1545
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.850
<v Speaker 4>That's your move and once in a while and</v>

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.430
<v Speaker 3>oh I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

1609
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:44.263
<v Speaker 3>I'm not old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I tired to before a show at 10 </v>

1610
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:50.400
<v Speaker 3>o'clock?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I really think I just wasn't getting</v>

1611
01:13:50.401 --> 01:13:51.234
<v Speaker 3>enough protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really was just like eating salads in </v>

1612
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1613
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:58.820
<v Speaker 3>once I started kind of drifting back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I interesting back.</v>

1614
01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Were you vegetarian or Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegetarian.</v>

1615
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.274
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go back and forth but mostly </v>

1616
01:14:03.421 --> 01:14:05.740
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes you were looking for like a</v>

1617
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For a whole year.</v>

1618
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd that go?</v>

1619
01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1620
01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.000
<v Speaker 3>you start talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sizing people.</v>

1621
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got very snotty.</v>

1622
01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt better than everyone.</v>

1623
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought I was better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>

1624
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1625
01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:21.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult thing to do.</v>

1626
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:22.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to really make sure that you </v>

1627
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>monitor your protein correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people say,</v>

1628
01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:27.880
<v Speaker 1>where do you get your protein from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1629
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.170
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about this gorilla?</v>

1630
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

1631
01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 1>you're not a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1632
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 1>You're not a fucking horse either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horses eat hay all day and they're fine.</v>

1633
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Have giant muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1634
01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Your body's different dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people,</v>

1635
01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:39.363
<v Speaker 1>people need certain amounts of protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you certainly need a complex amino </v>

1636
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 1>acid profile and some proteins that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting from plants.</v>

1637
01:14:46.901 --> 01:14:48.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a full amino acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>profile.</v>

1638
01:14:48.611 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go vegan and you want</v>

1639
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 1>to really make sure that your diet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced,</v>

1640
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you got to really do some reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really pay attention to what I was good.</v>

1641
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Chemo was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hemp is one of the best.</v>

1642
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1643
01:15:00.521 --> 01:15:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Hemp protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some stuff that we sell it on it</v>

1644
01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:03.664
<v Speaker 1>called hemp force protein powder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the best ones because it's </v>

1645
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:08.760
<v Speaker 1>super easy to digest a very fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>proteins.</v>

1646
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a really expensive because I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it from fucking Canada.</v>

1647
01:15:12.861 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the goofiest laws that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have going today in this country that</v>

1648
01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:19.570
<v Speaker 1>you can't grow hemp still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1649
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:20.523
<v Speaker 1>well some states are allowing it now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eventually going to roll out and </v>

1650
01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:25.390
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be nationwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1651
01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the easiest things to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like bamboo grows crazy.</v>

1652
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't require nearly the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a service that other plants do.</v>

1653
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially it's a weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1654
01:15:36.521 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1655
01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 1>the point is it's a full amino acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>profile profile.</v>

1656
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.133
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's only a few plants that are </v>

1657
01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:44.140
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what other ones?</v>

1658
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.123
<v Speaker 1>I just couple.</v>

1659
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:46.800
<v Speaker 3>In all honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>

1660
01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it for health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it cause I have a lot of,</v>

1661
01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:50.534
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high cholesterol and heart stuff and my </v>

1662
01:15:51.501 --> 01:15:52.670
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1663
01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to go on any drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1664
01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:56.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to keep it at bay and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to eat clean.</v>

1665
01:15:56.781 --> 01:16:00.560
<v Speaker 3>And I ate that way for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And eventually just this last year,</v>

1666
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.590
<v Speaker 3>my genetics kind of caught up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1667
01:16:03.591 --> 01:16:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating this way and I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my cholesterol was high,</v>

1668
01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:08.870
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1669
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go on a stat and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower it.</v>

1670
01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a exercise I exercise.</v>

1671
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:16.520
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run and weights.</v>

1672
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I ask this is Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bordain was on status and he got on stat</v>

1673
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:23.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's just because his body was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1674
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.361
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1675
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:26.194
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly going on the road and </v>

1676
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:28.203
<v Speaker 1>traveling and drinking and eating food </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his body wasn't responding well to </v>

1677
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:33.700
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had real problems with blood pressure</v>

1678
01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1679
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I can either restrict my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to him is offensive,</v>

1680
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a chef and it's a big part </v>

1681
01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 1>of his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially with his job,</v>

1682
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.600
<v Speaker 1>he wants to get on the stat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he got on the standards,</v>

1683
01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but then he got into Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got obsessed with Jujitsu,</v>

1684
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 1>lost 30 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got off the statens.</v>

1685
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's super healthy.</v>

1686
01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1687
01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.710
<v Speaker 3>I had high cholesterol and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go on the statens.</v>

1688
01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.753
<v Speaker 3>So increased how I was working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went Vegan for a long time and a </v>

1689
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:05.993
<v Speaker 3>lowered it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was able to lower it and keep it at </v>

1690
01:17:07.681 --> 01:17:10.760
<v Speaker 3>bay doing that for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just started inching up,</v>

1691
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:14.750
<v Speaker 3>starting to kind of coming back and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1692
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:17.220
<v Speaker 3>So I just figured it's the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

1693
01:17:17.221 --> 01:17:18.054
<v Speaker 3>and let me embrace the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is a negative consequences </v>

1694
01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>with your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that correct?</v>

1695
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be tested.</v>

1696
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:26.880
<v Speaker 3>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to stay on top of,</v>

1697
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.120
<v Speaker 3>you got to do your blood work or is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue?</v>

1698
01:17:29.121 --> 01:17:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I've only been on it for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

1699
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:32.870
<v Speaker 3>mostly just randomly went on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brand new.</v>

1700
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:37.910
<v Speaker 6>Now have you ever thought about cutting </v>
<v Speaker 6>bread out and pasta and sugar?</v>

1701
01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.013
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've thought about it and I didn't like </v>

1702
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:43.700
<v Speaker 6>what I was thinking while you eating a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sandwich.</v>

1703
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if I couldn't have this.</v>

1704
01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:50.700
<v Speaker 3>The bread thing is really new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I wasn't eating a lot of red.</v>

1705
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 3>This is pretty new and I do love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem honestly is I grew up,</v>

1706
01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.970
<v Speaker 3>food is a celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Food as a way to unite people.</v>

1707
01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a big Italian family.</v>

1708
01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Pasta was a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1709
01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I was like at eating as a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked into who?</v>

1710
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:08.924
<v Speaker 3>A Italian grocer in Burbank and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Salamis and the pursuit or hanging from </v>

1711
01:18:14.821 --> 01:18:15.654
<v Speaker 3>the ceiling next to the provolone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's pastas and there's breads and </v>

1712
01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:20.400
<v Speaker 3>this gelato.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1713
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:24.360
<v Speaker 3>my ancestors would just pummel me in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1714
01:18:24.361 --> 01:18:28.380
<v Speaker 3>in the alley if I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not eating this because I'm a Vegan.</v>

1715
01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:31.140
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too much fun.</v>

1716
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 3>It's too much fun to celebrate and live </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and do the,</v>

1717
01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:36.660
<v Speaker 3>so if I could just do that once in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>

1718
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.823
<v Speaker 3>I can't say I'm going to be a vegan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not eat that stuff for the rest of my </v>

1719
01:18:40.741 --> 01:18:41.080
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1720
01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.620
<v Speaker 6>Not going to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in his eyes,</v>

1729
01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:07.034
<v Speaker 6>somehow or another he is going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually figure out how to lose all </v>

1730
01:19:10.701 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 6>this weight without changing God damn </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing about his lifestyle or his diet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They wanted to give him cash.</v>

1765
01:20:50.151 --> 01:20:53.300
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even give him a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to go and get garbage bags.</v>

1766
01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.253
<v Speaker 1>So they came back with those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>black hefty bags and they stuff $7 </v>

1767
01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:01.460
<v Speaker 1>million in hefty bags and then left the </v>
<v Speaker 1>casino.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1776
01:21:23.661 --> 01:21:26.350
<v Speaker 2>If it's hundred dollar bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I assume it is right there.</v>

1777
01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I know there are $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>bills.</v>

01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen one?</v>

<v Speaker 2>mama is a $5,000</v>

1782
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:38.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a $500 bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1783
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Recently sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone hit it to trump and he signed it</v>

1784
01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:42.320
<v Speaker 2>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1785
01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1786
01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like you're deprived when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat this way?</v>

1787
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel deprived of anything?</v>

1788
01:21:49.011 --> 01:21:50.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody can seem</v>

1789
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 1>benefits are extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like physically I feel great.</v>

1790
01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the stuff that I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>drank the stuff in front of you.</v>

1791
01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:00.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a exogenous ketones because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1792
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:03.390
<v Speaker 1>my body's essentially in a ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1793
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>So I take this mineral and amino acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>

1794
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It's called key genics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a ketogenic state?</v>

1795
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:09.923
<v Speaker 1>Ketogenic state means your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning fat as opposed to burning </v>

1796
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:17.070
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one way to manipulate that state and</v>

1797
01:22:17.071 --> 01:22:19.230
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that your body stays cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kid Keyed.</v>

1798
01:22:19.231 --> 01:22:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Atonic Ketotonic Kita Janice Ci </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketogenic is,</v>

1799
01:22:23.281 --> 01:22:24.114
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take exogenous ketones and this </v>

1800
01:22:25.981 --> 01:22:29.820
<v Speaker 1>stuff allows your body to go back into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of Ketosis,</v>

1801
01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>which means it's primarily using fat as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel versus using.</v>

1802
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people right now are going,</v>

1803
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.680
<v Speaker 1>will</v>

1804
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.680
<v Speaker 2>you stop fucking talking about Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ?</v>

1805
01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screws pop abroad folks.</v>

1806
01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You all right?</v>

1807
01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're good.</v>

1808
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.910
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1809
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1810
01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to eat lean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to cut some of that stuff.</v>

1811
01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat that much bread shit buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

1812
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:02.090
<v Speaker 2>You and Artie Lange get together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a diary.</v>

1813
01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it called the make-believe diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>

1814
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's make believe</v>

1815
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 6>one day we're going to do something </v>
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>

1816
01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.043
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel different because I still </v>
<v Speaker 6>eat like really healthy and really </v>

1817
01:23:12.371 --> 01:23:14.530
<v Speaker 6>delicious foods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How's this different from Atkins?</v>

1818
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:16.263
<v Speaker 6>Atkins is mostly protein and the problem</v>
<v Speaker 6>when that is in does kind of put you in </v>

1819
01:23:20.201 --> 01:23:23.710
<v Speaker 6>a state of ketosis but that's not really</v>
<v Speaker 6>what your body wants.</v>

1820
01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.573
<v Speaker 6>Apparently your body wants more fats </v>
<v Speaker 6>than it does protein and there's huge </v>

1821
01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 6>fattier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1822
01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.690
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm eating is like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Avocados,</v>

1823
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.660
<v Speaker 6>a lot of coconut oil and a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 6>along those lines.</v>

1824
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 6>Almond butter and when you eat a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>nuts and things like you're getting fats</v>

1825
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:42.490
<v Speaker 6>that are healthy oils and fats that your</v>
<v Speaker 6>body processes really well.</v>

1826
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:43.893
<v Speaker 6>The biggest benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is something that my friend </v>

1827
01:23:45.791 --> 01:23:48.940
<v Speaker 6>Denny had said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is thing I recognize too,</v>

1828
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 6>is cognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm more awake really the day.</v>

1829
01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.133
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't like the way I am right now </v>

1830
01:23:55.691 --> 01:23:56.320
<v Speaker 6>here at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1831
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.153
<v Speaker 6>1220.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll be like this at seven o'clock at </v>

1832
01:23:58.391 --> 01:24:00.850
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's even through the day.</v>

1833
01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:03.960
<v Speaker 6>I was never even before man crash in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>afternoon,</v>

1834
01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:04.803
<v Speaker 6>I'd have these fucking meals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I want to take a nap that's not </v>

1835
01:24:07.631 --> 01:24:09.250
<v Speaker 6>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So after I eat,</v>

1836
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.143
<v Speaker 6>when I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what I normally eat is like salads </v>

1837
01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 6>with avocado and some sort of piece of </v>
<v Speaker 6>protein,</v>

1838
01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:20.020
<v Speaker 6>whether a piece of fish or chicken or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that or meet when I'd eat</v>

1839
01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't get tired.</v>

1840
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:22.780
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

1841
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:24.520
<v Speaker 6>it's my body's telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1842
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 6>this is way more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's way better for us.</v>

1843
01:24:27.431 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 6>And it's not like I'm eating fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>cardboard and Tofu.</v>

1844
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:32.220
<v Speaker 6>It's delicious food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:33.910
<v Speaker 6>It's just no bread,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no pasta.</v>

1846
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:34.893
<v Speaker 6>And what about your family?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would ever the fuck they want two </v>

1847
01:24:37.441 --> 01:24:37.620
<v Speaker 6>weeks.</v>

1848
01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.800
<v Speaker 6>Sit down and eat dinner with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1849
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.160
<v Speaker 6>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1850
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 6>I just eat different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1851
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:44.880
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that eat,</v>

1852
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:47.320
<v Speaker 6>if we have pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I eat squash,</v>

1853
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 6>I take squash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zucchini,</v>

1854
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:49.990
<v Speaker 6>squash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1855
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.410
<v Speaker 6>And I run it through this machines,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this thing that spins,</v>

1856
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 6>he cranked this handle and it Toros this</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zucchini through this cutter,</v>

1857
01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:58.953
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That makes these little swirly pasta </v>

1858
01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:03.580
<v Speaker 6>like noodle things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I put spaghetti sauce on that.</v>

1859
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:04.420
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1860
01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And your kids are like,</v>

1861
01:25:05.321 --> 01:25:06.370
<v Speaker 6>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you doing?</v>

1862
01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.140
<v Speaker 6>They don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They even eat some of it.</v>

1863
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 6>They're used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My kids have eaten everything.</v>

1864
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1865
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.540
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1866
01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.770
<v Speaker 6>that's right from my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my page.</v>

1867
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.420
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the,</v>

1868
01:25:16.421 --> 01:25:18.670
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see it twirls and into those noodles.</v>

1869
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:22.300
<v Speaker 6>And then that's a ground venison.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Joe,</v>

1870
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.553
<v Speaker 6>if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you eat like this and then that one </v>

1871
01:25:25.931 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 6>meal you had pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does that blow the whole thing?</v>

1872
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:29.131
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1873
01:25:29.131 --> 01:25:29.441
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1874
01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:32.230
<v Speaker 6>But it puts you out of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it knocks you out of Ketosis.</v>

1875
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:34.540
<v Speaker 6>But this stuff right here and knocks you</v>
<v Speaker 6>right back in.</v>

1876
01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.613
<v Speaker 6>So like even you could have like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>syrupy glass of soda and then have this </v>

1877
01:25:39.491 --> 01:25:41.550
<v Speaker 6>stuff and it'll put you right back into </v>
<v Speaker 6>ketosis.</v>

1878
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.440
<v Speaker 6>It's just manipulating the way your body</v>
<v Speaker 6>processes fuel.</v>

1879
01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:52.240
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I just find just for me that when my</v>

1880
01:25:52.241 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 6>boss and not just me like Shaw Brennan </v>
<v Speaker 6>Chubb,</v>

1881
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.030
<v Speaker 6>my buddy who got on in a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two months ago,</v>

1882
01:25:58.031 --> 01:26:00.190
<v Speaker 6>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's lost a shitload of way.</v>

1883
01:26:00.191 --> 01:26:01.024
<v Speaker 6>He looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody I know that's done it loves </v>

1884
01:26:02.351 --> 01:26:03.170
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

1885
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.003
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think that your body's </v>

1886
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 6>meant to eat that much sugar in that </v>
<v Speaker 6>many process.</v>

1887
01:26:07.851 --> 01:26:09.590
<v Speaker 6>Carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think it is.</v>

1888
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:10.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

1889
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do it.</v>

1890
01:26:12.170 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 3>That's even like with this bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1891
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the only thing that you would,</v>

1892
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.770
<v Speaker 3>that would be the carb that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>

1893
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have a little b.</v>

1894
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.240
<v Speaker 3>The percentage in your diet was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>

1895
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1896
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:28.390
<v Speaker 3>then you were eating vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating meats and fish and nuts,</v>

1897
01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:31.960
<v Speaker 6>salads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>folks eat some fucking salad.</v>

1898
01:26:31.961 --> 01:26:32.794
<v Speaker 6>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the things that drives me </v>

1899
01:26:34.271 --> 01:26:36.500
<v Speaker 6>the most crazy about vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1900
01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:39.310
<v Speaker 6>one of the things is they'll assume that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't eat what they do.</v>

1901
01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:40.330
<v Speaker 6>Eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1902
01:26:40.331 --> 01:26:41.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Vegans,</v>

1903
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:41.953
<v Speaker 6>like that guy was like telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm eating all these vegetables and I'm </v>

1904
01:26:45.101 --> 01:26:46.780
<v Speaker 6>getting all these nutrients and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>

1905
01:26:46.781 --> 01:26:47.614
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well actually I am because I mean all </v>

1906
01:26:48.761 --> 01:26:50.050
<v Speaker 6>those vegetables too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1907
01:26:50.051 --> 01:26:51.640
<v Speaker 6>but also have steak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1908
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.370
<v Speaker 6>Like what the fuck are you to like this </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea that they're mutually exclusive.</v>

1909
01:26:54.371 --> 01:26:55.720
<v Speaker 6>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1910
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.790
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you definitely should have vegetables.</v>

1911
01:26:57.791 --> 01:27:01.060
<v Speaker 6>Everyone should eat vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea that you shouldn't eat meat</v>

1912
01:27:01.061 --> 01:27:01.894
<v Speaker 6>because we're not designed for meat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that who comes like an ideological </v>

1913
01:27:04.361 --> 01:27:06.460
<v Speaker 6>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then they start saying things like,</v>

1914
01:27:06.461 --> 01:27:08.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the body was not designed for that.</v>

1915
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.450
<v Speaker 6>Human beings are herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1916
01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.530
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually we're not.</v>

1917
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:13.660
<v Speaker 6>It's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's proof positive.</v>

1918
01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:18.250
<v Speaker 6>It's been proven that one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasons why the human brain got large is</v>

1919
01:27:18.251 --> 01:27:19.990
<v Speaker 6>because of meat consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1920
01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:22.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's the monkeys figured out,</v>

1921
01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:23.490
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

1922
01:27:23.491 --> 01:27:26.100
<v Speaker 6>there's better protein out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started eating some,</v>

1923
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:28.660
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck they did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did they</v>

1924
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:29.641
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see?</v>

1925
01:27:29.641 --> 01:27:33.830
<v Speaker 3>They just found this walt whitman guide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone found it in a,</v>

1926
01:27:33.831 --> 01:27:35.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a library.</v>

1927
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:36.403
<v Speaker 3>It was like this finding of a Walt </v>
<v Speaker 3>Whitman stuff that he wrote that people </v>

1928
01:27:39.811 --> 01:27:40.920
<v Speaker 3>hadn't seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they got excited.</v>

1929
01:27:40.921 --> 01:27:43.590
<v Speaker 3>It was about health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about uh,</v>

1930
01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.693
<v Speaker 3>a guide to being a healthy man or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in the first thing was eat </v>

1931
01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:50.430
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course that was his first thing.</v>

1932
01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what people thought back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

1933
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1934
01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 3>there was</v>

1935
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 6>super important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that thing recently?</v>

1936
01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.293
<v Speaker 6>They discovered the remains of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>mastodon that had been slaughtered by </v>

1937
01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:04.694
<v Speaker 6>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they found it in Florida in a </v>

1938
01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:11.930
<v Speaker 6>bog or something like that or sink hole </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it was 14,000</v>

1939
01:28:11.931 --> 01:28:12.764
<v Speaker 6>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it threw a monkey wrench into the </v>

1940
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:15.464
<v Speaker 6>timeline of people being in North </v>
<v Speaker 6>America because it pushed it back by </v>

1941
01:28:19.941 --> 01:28:20.774
<v Speaker 6>1500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like a new mystery as far like </v>

1942
01:28:25.731 --> 01:28:26.564
<v Speaker 6>they've really just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of just ramping </v>

1943
01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:31.250
<v Speaker 6>speculation once you get past a couple </v>
<v Speaker 6>of thousand years ago,</v>

1944
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:33.470
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck knows this?</v>

1945
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:34.550
<v Speaker 6>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1946
01:28:34.551 --> 01:28:37.490
<v Speaker 6>there's current theories and they try to</v>
<v Speaker 6>work on them and they try to,</v>

1947
01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're trying to decipher the past</v>

1948
01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:42.224
<v Speaker 6>based on these little small clues that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they dig up here and there and </v>

1949
01:28:45.591 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 6>occasionally they dig up a new clue and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they just go,</v>

1950
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:48.470
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1951
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:50.030
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right everybody,</v>

1952
01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:50.864
<v Speaker 6>let's get together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's get together because we'd just </v>

1953
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:53.054
<v Speaker 6>fucked our timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've got to go back and rewrite the </v>

1954
01:28:55.491 --> 01:28:56.650
<v Speaker 6>whole timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1955
01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:58.670
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty cool looking though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it is.</v>

1956
01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:01.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They pulled it out and um,</v>

1957
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.633
<v Speaker 6>a stone knife,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mastodon bones and a fossilized dung </v>

1958
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.190
<v Speaker 6>found in an underwater case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Scroll that down please.</v>

1959
01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:09.024
<v Speaker 6>Young Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A underwater sinkhole shows that humans </v>

1960
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 6>lived in north Florida about 14,500</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

1961
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:15.924
<v Speaker 6>According to new research suggests the </v>
<v Speaker 6>colonization of the Americas was far </v>

1962
01:29:18.871 --> 01:29:19.704
<v Speaker 6>more complex than originally believed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love stuff like this cool learning </v>

1963
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:24.583
<v Speaker 6>about mystery culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just unbelievably fascinated by the </v>

1964
01:29:28.411 --> 01:29:31.440
<v Speaker 6>idea that people lived like us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were,</v>

1965
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:32.363
<v Speaker 6>they were like us 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago and they lived is crazy </v>

1966
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:39.810
<v Speaker 6>existences where they were just hanging </v>
<v Speaker 6>together in these little tribes and they</v>

1967
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:40.703
<v Speaker 6>relied on each other deeply and right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was the only way you could </v>

1968
01:29:43.621 --> 01:29:44.040
<v Speaker 6>survive.</v>

1969
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.873
<v Speaker 6>You had to get in these small groups of </v>
<v Speaker 6>like 50 people and everybody stuck </v>

1970
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:48.234
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had to gather food and everybody had a </v>

1971
01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 6>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1972
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.633
<v Speaker 6>there's a direct connection between </v>
<v Speaker 6>social behaviors today and a hunter </v>

1973
01:29:57.181 --> 01:29:58.650
<v Speaker 6>gatherer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1974
01:29:58.651 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 6>needs thousands and thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>excuse me,</v>

1975
01:30:01.321 --> 01:30:02.154
<v Speaker 6>thousands and thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the reason why women are so </v>

1976
01:30:03.991 --> 01:30:04.824
<v Speaker 6>talkative and social and men prefer like</v>
<v Speaker 6>people being more stoic and men don't </v>

1977
01:30:09.391 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 6>like when men talk too much because </v>
<v Speaker 6>those men would fuck up hunting trips.</v>

1978
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:14.040
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:14.874
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you were out there hunting in </v>
<v Speaker 6>those and the women would get together </v>

1980
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:18.384
<v Speaker 6>and when women were gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>women's jobs were equally as hard as </v>

1981
01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:22.014
<v Speaker 6>men,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if not harder because they were in </v>

1982
01:30:22.831 --> 01:30:23.664
<v Speaker 6>charge of farming like the men would </v>
<v Speaker 6>wear or gathering at least vegetables </v>

1983
01:30:27.481 --> 01:30:30.240
<v Speaker 6>and foods that you could find.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then we'd go out and hunt hunt.</v>

1984
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:31.103
<v Speaker 6>So the hunters learned how to prize </v>
<v Speaker 6>being stealthy and quiet and keeping </v>

1985
01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:38.850
<v Speaker 6>your shit together under pressure called</v>
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

1986
01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keeping your sh they're cool together.</v>

1987
01:30:40.711 --> 01:30:41.544
<v Speaker 6>When you're sneaking up on an animal and</v>
<v Speaker 6>all your nerves are firing in your </v>

1988
01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:45.714
<v Speaker 6>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to execute a shot or throw a </v>

1989
01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 6>spear and you have to get the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas women,</v>

1990
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:54.480
<v Speaker 6>they get together and they start talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about this one and that one and she says</v>

1991
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 6>this and I'm not picking the vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting there by the river,</v>

1992
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.250
<v Speaker 6>avoiding crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>washing underwear going,</v>

1993
01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.093
<v Speaker 6>that's fucking bitch thinks that she's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to take mom or does your husband </v>

1994
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:05.154
<v Speaker 6>come back from a Heinz and not talk?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean how can you be out for a whole </v>

1995
01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:08.690
<v Speaker 6>hunt and have nothing to say when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>come up.</v>

1996
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.900
<v Speaker 6>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I come home and I'm just Yap,</v>

1997
01:31:09.901 --> 01:31:10.171
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>

1998
01:31:10.171 --> 01:31:10.441
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>

1999
01:31:10.441 --> 01:31:10.711
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>

2000
01:31:10.711 --> 01:31:11.041
<v Speaker 6>Yap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yap.</v>

2001
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:11.970
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will you shut the fuck up?</v>

2002
01:31:11.971 --> 01:31:14.440
<v Speaker 6>I think I heard a stink snap stick.</v>

2003
01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.293
<v Speaker 6>Snap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

2004
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:18.780
<v Speaker 6>there's a line in the bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>honey.</v>

2005
01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:20.790
<v Speaker 6>I just got home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been out hunting all day.</v>

2006
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:22.710
<v Speaker 6>Just give me a minute before we start </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking.</v>

2007
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:24.650
<v Speaker 6>I was watching this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2008
01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:29.490
<v Speaker 6>the other night about the Mussai,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Mussai warriors and I'm there mostly</v>

2009
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:30.211
<v Speaker 6>herders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2010
01:31:30.211 --> 01:31:31.044
<v Speaker 6>they have all these cattle and it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>really crazy because they had like 10 </v>

2011
01:31:33.301 --> 01:31:38.220
<v Speaker 6>year old kids helping out like these 10 </v>
<v Speaker 6>year old kids are herding cattle and uh,</v>

2012
01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:40.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just doing jobs to work,</v>

2013
01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:41.413
<v Speaker 6>get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2014
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:42.383
<v Speaker 6>10 and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things they had this village </v>

2015
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 6>that is in the middle of this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 6>wild area.</v>

2016
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:49.853
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are surrounded by buffaloes and </v>

2017
01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:56.670
<v Speaker 6>lions and all around their village.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a very small little village,</v>

2018
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 6>which is really an extended family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the,</v>

2019
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.903
<v Speaker 4>and the fathers and their families and </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers and sisters and their families </v>

2020
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:05.104
<v Speaker 4>and everyone lives together in this one </v>
<v Speaker 4>little extended village with all their </v>

2021
01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 4>livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all around they're tiny village.</v>

2022
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 4>They had thorn bushes placed to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>lions out.</v>

2023
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.633
<v Speaker 4>That's their fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fence is just making it </v>

2024
01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:21.880
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable for lions to move in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed them with cheese.</v>

2025
01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.920
<v Speaker 4>So fucked man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was watching it.</v>

2026
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 4>And apparently that's not their biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger.</v>

2027
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Their biggest dangers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo.</v>

2028
01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the air man.</v>

2029
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those fucking Cape Buffalo,</v>

2030
01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I guess it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know which buffalo there's,</v>

2031
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.570
<v Speaker 4>that's what they look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:39.370
<v Speaker 4>On the buffalo now that's a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a little tiny person.</v>

2033
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Little tiny Mussai person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their buffalo are so weird there.</v>

2034
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:48.030
<v Speaker 4>They look like they were close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a row walking around naked.</v>

2035
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.013
<v Speaker 4>It's cute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cute little [inaudible] and they're </v>

2036
01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:52.570
<v Speaker 4>still survived today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's still assign.</v>

2037
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:53.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:54.484
<v Speaker 4>So see those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those bushes that they have set up like </v>

2039
01:32:55.781 --> 01:32:56.614
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they keep the lines out and </v>

2040
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.870
<v Speaker 4>they just make it uncomfortable for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2041
01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 4>They set up these smart parameters or </v>
<v Speaker 4>perimeters rather around their house.</v>

2042
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.533
<v Speaker 4>But the Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's a Cape Buffalo or water </v>

2043
01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:12.871
<v Speaker 4>buffalo or one of the buffaloes wa </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tanzania look up dangerous buffets.</v>

2044
01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:15.933
<v Speaker 4>Tanzania.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When are you going to Tanzania and the </v>

2045
01:33:17.441 --> 01:33:19.450
<v Speaker 4>August dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about going in August.</v>

2046
01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.313
<v Speaker 4>Are you really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about going on the safari </v>

2047
01:33:21.461 --> 01:33:24.610
<v Speaker 4>with the family log on fifth through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>16th what are you doing?</v>

2048
01:33:24.970 --> 01:33:25.803
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy that runs these resorts </v>

2049
01:33:27.161 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 4>there and you're going to go safari,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the family.</v>

01:33:30.490 --> 01:33:32.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Papa.</v>

2051
01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.650
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll be there at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll ignore each other though.</v>

2052
01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.750
<v Speaker 4>We can pretend we can meet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can meet in.</v>

2053
01:33:38.751 --> 01:33:39.584
<v Speaker 4>Pretend we're hunting for like a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta go back to my woman stuff for </v>

2054
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 4>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if they don't have bread?</v>

2055
01:33:46.670 --> 01:33:48.130
<v Speaker 4>Do you it right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:33:48.131 --> 01:33:49.540
<v Speaker 4>You gotta tell me where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:50.374
<v Speaker 4>We haven't decided yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were deciding on a family trip to </v>

2058
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:55.630
<v Speaker 4>summer and then delete it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Europe or Africa.</v>

2059
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Those are the two potential destinations</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and I haven't really,</v>

2060
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't it be cool?</v>

2061
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:01.954
<v Speaker 4>This is mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking I never really had a real </v>

2062
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:03.874
<v Speaker 4>draw to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that I could get my </v>

2063
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:08.380
<v Speaker 4>children to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like a good thing.</v>

2064
01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I think those are willdabeast Jamie,</v>

2065
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:14.400
<v Speaker 4>son of a bitch on those right down </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2066
01:34:14.401 --> 01:34:15.990
<v Speaker 4>That one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that one right down there?</v>

2067
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.480
<v Speaker 4>That guy is right in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's a dead one,</v>

2068
01:34:18.481 --> 01:34:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

2069
01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.130
<v Speaker 4>That's some sort of a buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2070
01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2071
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:26.760
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant ass buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2072
01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:29.010
<v Speaker 4>that's an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well those things,</v>

2073
01:34:29.011 --> 01:34:31.500
<v Speaker 4>apparently those buffaloes that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have in,</v>

2074
01:34:31.501 --> 01:34:33.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just find out what kind of buffalo,</v>

2075
01:34:33.331 --> 01:34:37.270
<v Speaker 4>because I keep saying buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

2076
01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:39.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2077
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.433
<v Speaker 4>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things apparently are the most </v>

2078
01:34:41.701 --> 01:34:42.970
<v Speaker 4>dangerous thing in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2079
01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:43.920
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next to hippos.</v>

2080
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:47.130
<v Speaker 4>Hippos are the most dangerous hippos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cape Buffalo or African Buffalo.</v>

2081
01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was kind of right.</v>

2082
01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:50.063
<v Speaker 4>But those fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was watching the show on the </v>

2083
01:34:52.201 --> 01:34:53.034
<v Speaker 4>Mussai one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ladies had gone to get water </v>

2084
01:34:56.221 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 4>and she got jacked by Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2085
01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:59.420
<v Speaker 6>They just do to close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

2086
01:34:59.421 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 6>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they just run out here.</v>

2087
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think of a bowl.</v>

2088
01:35:02.811 --> 01:35:05.090
<v Speaker 6>Like how mean bowls are fast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean bull riders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2090
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:09.880
<v Speaker 6>those bowls or just a fuck you kicking </v>
<v Speaker 6>them off the gray.</v>

2091
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.450
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what these God damn things are.</v>

2092
01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 6>But Times 10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh man,</v>

2093
01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 6>they're enormous about the hyenas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm worried about.</v>

2094
01:35:15.861 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 6>Dairy too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those things are evil.</v>

2095
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.130
<v Speaker 6>They're all scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're mean.</v>

2096
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:21.403
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hyenas are one of the few animals where </v>

2097
01:35:24.321 --> 01:35:25.154
<v Speaker 6>the female is larger than the male to </v>
<v Speaker 6>keep the mail from eating the babies </v>

2098
01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.430
<v Speaker 6>railing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2099
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.033
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't give a shit to so main and </v>

2100
01:35:32.971 --> 01:35:34.640
<v Speaker 6>their jaws are super strong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2101
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:36.980
<v Speaker 6>like some of the strongest bites in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

2102
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:40.180
<v Speaker 6>I think only thing stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like crocodiles on the safari.</v>

2103
01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:42.800
<v Speaker 6>Things you can't go out like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>go to the bathroom at night.</v>

2104
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 6>Is this the buffaloes?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unless you have an arm,</v>

2105
01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:45.860
<v Speaker 6>you can read that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does it say,</v>

2106
01:35:45.861 --> 01:35:48.260
<v Speaker 6>buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2107
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Other than the big five,</v>

2108
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:52.063
<v Speaker 6>it is known as the black death or widow </v>
<v Speaker 6>maker and is widely regarded as a very </v>

2109
01:35:56.001 --> 01:35:58.370
<v Speaker 6>dangerous animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It whoa.</v>

2110
01:35:58.371 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 6>It Gores and kills over 200 people every</v>
<v Speaker 6>year.</v>

2111
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.360
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ buffaloes are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>reported to kill people in Africa.</v>

2112
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Kill more people in Africa than any </v>
<v Speaker 6>other animal.</v>

2113
01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 6>You have a look at that picture of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hemingway?</v>

2114
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.193
<v Speaker 6>He just killed that fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of the kink claims are made by </v>

2115
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 6>hippos and crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

2116
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you mean you can definitely kill them.</v>

2117
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm totally killing it.</v>

2118
01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.860
<v Speaker 6>They don't taste good though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

2119
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:24.470
<v Speaker 6>my problem would be with one of those </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

2120
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.960
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can absolutely eat buffalo.</v>

2121
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:29.450
<v Speaker 6>Like a buddy of mine shot one with a bow</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Arrow,</v>

2122
01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:30.284
<v Speaker 6>but he said he was practicing with his </v>
<v Speaker 6>bone out for a half an hour while </v>

2123
01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:36.020
<v Speaker 6>chewing one piece of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

2124
01:36:36.021 --> 01:36:37.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like literally.</v>

2125
01:36:37.011 --> 01:36:40.760
<v Speaker 6>It's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had buffalo this winter from,</v>

2126
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:42.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yet bios don't area.</v>

2127
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:43.880
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that bison.</v>

2128
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:44.773
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was good.</v>

2129
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:45.740
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's delicious.</v>

2130
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:46.603
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2131
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:48.050
<v Speaker 6>that's a different kind of buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2132
01:36:48.051 --> 01:36:50.160
<v Speaker 6>there's a real controversy and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't a good quote.</v>

2133
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 6>Good thing to bring up now because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>found out something yesterday.</v>

2134
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.863
<v Speaker 6>There's a big controversy that's going </v>
<v Speaker 6>on in yellowstone because they're </v>

2135
01:36:56.691 --> 01:36:57.524
<v Speaker 6>calling a large number of bison from </v>
<v Speaker 6>yellowstone and these people are </v>

2136
01:37:02.871 --> 01:37:03.704
<v Speaker 6>freaking out about it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>freaking out about it from a couple </v>

2137
01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.213
<v Speaker 6>different sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But one of the reasons why they say </v>

2138
01:37:09.601 --> 01:37:12.290
<v Speaker 6>they're killing them is because there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>a large population of them.</v>

2139
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:13.123
<v Speaker 6>There's no hunting and yellowstone and </v>
<v Speaker 6>these animals are traveling to outside </v>

2140
01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:22.001
<v Speaker 6>of yellowstone and they're using the </v>
<v Speaker 6>land that ranchers used for cattle.</v>

2141
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:23.443
<v Speaker 6>So like there's public land that </v>
<v Speaker 6>ranchers have rights to have their </v>

2142
01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:27.674
<v Speaker 6>cattle graze on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then these bison are intruding into </v>

2143
01:37:30.591 --> 01:37:34.940
<v Speaker 6>these land and they're saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bison carry Brucellosis,</v>

2144
01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:35.953
<v Speaker 6>which is apparently a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 6>disease for cattle because it makes </v>

2145
01:37:38.361 --> 01:37:39.194
<v Speaker 6>their babies stillborn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's no evidence apparently that </v>

2146
01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:49.541
<v Speaker 6>brucellosis is transferred from bison to</v>
<v Speaker 6>cattle.</v>

2147
01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:50.773
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the guys that was on the twitter </v>

2148
01:37:52.041 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 6>exchange that I was having last night </v>
<v Speaker 6>was explaining that and a,</v>

2149
01:37:56.041 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>

2150
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:57.271
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2151
01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:58.104
<v Speaker 6>why are they killing these animals the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same that they have brucellosis and </v>

2152
01:38:00.361 --> 01:38:02.160
<v Speaker 6>they're worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm transferring it to cattle,</v>

2153
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:03.203
<v Speaker 6>no evidence that they've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I go and look at it and apparently </v>

2154
01:38:05.221 --> 01:38:06.054
<v Speaker 6>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently elk or more likely to </v>

2155
01:38:07.951 --> 01:38:08.784
<v Speaker 6>transfer brucellosis to cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but elk don't use the same grazing </v>

2156
01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 6>ground.</v>

2157
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:13.373
<v Speaker 6>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't graze the same way that </v>

2158
01:38:14.611 --> 01:38:17.400
<v Speaker 6>cattle do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So with these buffalo do is they just,</v>

2159
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.473
<v Speaker 6>they're competing for grazing ground and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're using the brucellosis as an </v>

2160
01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:22.854
<v Speaker 6>excuse to slaughter them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they're just going in there and </v>

2161
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:26.304
<v Speaker 6>shooting them and they use all the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're bringing all the meat </v>

2162
01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:29.520
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2163
01:38:29.521 --> 01:38:30.354
<v Speaker 6>it all becomes either gets donated to </v>
<v Speaker 6>native Americans or they butcher it and </v>

2164
01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:36.800
<v Speaker 6>sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you're allowed to shoot them.</v>

2165
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:38.243
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're allowing a call of a certain </v>

2166
01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:43.260
<v Speaker 6>amount of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but apparently it's hundreds of them and</v>

2167
01:38:43.261 --> 01:38:44.094
<v Speaker 6>you know people that love seeing those </v>
<v Speaker 6>things at yellowstone or kind of </v>

2168
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:50.670
<v Speaker 6>freaking out because they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of cattle operations.</v>

2169
01:38:50.671 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really,</v>

2170
01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.960
<v Speaker 6>it's really a thinly disguised like </v>
<v Speaker 6>protection of cattle land.</v>

2171
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.313
<v Speaker 6>It's a strange thing because you bring </v>
<v Speaker 6>them back and they get to a certain </v>

2172
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:05.640
<v Speaker 6>number and then that number becomes too </v>
<v Speaker 6>large,</v>

2173
01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:06.923
<v Speaker 6>but too large for what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two large in large for a very small </v>

2174
01:39:09.601 --> 01:39:10.740
<v Speaker 6>area,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2175
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For the way that the humans are living.</v>

2176
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 6>Like you know in New Jersey they have </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2177
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:18.510
<v Speaker 6>there's so many deer you want to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 6>more deer,</v>

2178
01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 6>but it's because it's the most densely </v>
<v Speaker 6>populated state in the union.</v>

2179
01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 6>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2180
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 6>they don't have a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the real problem in deer.</v>

2181
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>With dear,</v>

2182
01:39:27.721 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 6>dear require a prey Predator balance </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we have in California.</v>

2183
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.510
<v Speaker 6>Like California has a weird thing going </v>
<v Speaker 6>on and it's,</v>

2184
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:36.690
<v Speaker 6>I like it in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In other ways I don't like it.</v>

2185
01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.553
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that I do like it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what California has done is allowed </v>

2186
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:42.710
<v Speaker 6>mountain lions to kill the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2187
01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:45.330
<v Speaker 6>And you can't kill mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's no,</v>

2188
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:47.520
<v Speaker 6>there's no hunting of mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the few states,</v>

2189
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:50.780
<v Speaker 6>one of the few states that has a large </v>
<v Speaker 6>healthy mountain lion population.</v>

2190
01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Hunting's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not regulated.</v>

2191
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:57.090
<v Speaker 6>So the problem is wildlife biologists </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't agree with that.</v>

2192
01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:58.073
<v Speaker 6>Wildlife biologist thinks that you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>to manage the numbers of mountain lions </v>

2193
01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:02.210
<v Speaker 6>just like you manage all the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>

2194
01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 6>But on the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you don't hunt mountain lions,</v>

2195
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:07.613
<v Speaker 6>you see very little deer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very hard to find like deer </v>

2196
01:40:09.511 --> 01:40:10.344
<v Speaker 6>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And California is diminished radically </v>

2197
01:40:11.611 --> 01:40:13.950
<v Speaker 6>since the 1990s when they instituted </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

2198
01:40:13.951 --> 01:40:14.784
<v Speaker 6>No mountain lion hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the mountain lions are just eating </v>

2199
01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:17.910
<v Speaker 6>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going like crazy.</v>

2200
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:20.100
<v Speaker 6>And there's a lot of mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot.</v>

2201
01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:22.400
<v Speaker 6>There's a friend of mine who is a um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2202
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:27.200
<v Speaker 6>he works on a ranch called to hone ranch</v>
<v Speaker 6>and to hone ranch has this one waterhole</v>

2203
01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.700
<v Speaker 6>where they have a camera set up to </v>
<v Speaker 6>photograph whatever animals in there.</v>

2204
01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:33.540
<v Speaker 6>They found 16 different mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 6>on one waterhole.</v>

2205
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:37.590
<v Speaker 6>Choose Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really create those breezeways like over</v>

2206
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:39.930
<v Speaker 6>the freeways and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well they're trying to do that.</v>

2207
01:40:39.931 --> 01:40:41.340
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they have actually done </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2208
01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:43.740
<v Speaker 6>We actually built it where I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

2209
01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:44.603
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think on the way back from palm </v>

2210
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:48.000
<v Speaker 6>springs I didn't go on help jog and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those things.</v>

2211
01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:48.923
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever seen that video of the </v>

01:43:59.571 --> 01:44:01.910
<v Speaker 3>bigger that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like four times,</v>

2292
01:44:01.911 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 3>five times bigger than him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2293
01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes me freak out.</v>

2294
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:08.570
<v Speaker 3>If he had turned and Ronnie would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been eating.</v>

2295
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2296
01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing ran at him like it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinnertime.</v>

2297
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I was that close to a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where in Alaska and Denali.</v>

2298
01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.050
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bar.</v>

2299

<v Speaker 3>We woke up in the morning and,</v>

2301
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:24.674
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in back country for a couple of </v>

2302
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:29.180
<v Speaker 3>weeks just hiking and walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2303
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:30.763
<v Speaker 3>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we woke up and we were making our </v>

2304
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and we look up on a ridge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this big ass bear.</v>

2305
01:44:37.281 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 3>This is September,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like late,</v>

2306
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:39.853
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they were getting ready to </v>

2307
01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:45.581
<v Speaker 3>hibernate and he's walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridge and as we're packing up and uh,</v>

2308
01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:48.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're up to the ridge is actually where</v>

2309
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:49.424
<v Speaker 3>we were cleaning our dishes and doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff and now we're back at </v>

2310
01:44:51.981 --> 01:44:52.814
<v Speaker 3>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were breaking down to hike out and we </v>

2311
01:44:55.071 --> 01:44:57.990
<v Speaker 3>see this thing go walking down and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb asses.</v>

2312
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:00.140
<v Speaker 3>We're so lucky we didn't get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>

2313
01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.073
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2314
01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:01.993
<v Speaker 3>we pack up and we just start walking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same direction that the bear was </v>

2315
01:45:06.201 --> 01:45:06.711
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where like,</v>

2316
01:45:06.711 --> 01:45:09.620
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to be going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably has beaten us there.</v>

2317
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 3>So we're walking through these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these reads,</v>

2318
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:14.083
<v Speaker 3>these like bamboo kind of little reads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were only like six feet high </v>

2319
01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.540
<v Speaker 3>and there's like eight of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe six of us.</v>

2320
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:22.123
<v Speaker 3>And we're walking with our packs on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just hear and you see the reeds </v>

2321
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.080
<v Speaker 3>separating you slowly though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not coming fast.</v>

2322
01:45:33.081 --> 01:45:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Just I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

2323
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:36.643
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see that it's the bear and you know </v>

2324
01:45:40.581 --> 01:45:41.414
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to do what that guy did </v>
<v Speaker 3>and put your arms up or at least freeze </v>

2325
01:45:44.031 --> 01:45:47.240
<v Speaker 3>and don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in the group took off.</v>

2326
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:48.163
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that ran and all frozen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the pose and me and my one friend </v>

2327
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:58.790
<v Speaker 3>like you're not supposed to do the run </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're in our,</v>

2328
01:45:59.050 --> 01:46:01.910
<v Speaker 3>and then they take off with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>backpack.</v>

2329
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the bear,</v>

2330
01:46:03.441 --> 01:46:04.274
<v Speaker 3>thankfully just by a stroke of luck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing was so fat and tired and the </v>

2331
01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:11.540
<v Speaker 3>end of September he just wanted to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down low,</v>

2332
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:16.541
<v Speaker 3>get some more berries and just take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>snooze was not interested in us at all.</v>

2333
01:46:16.761 --> 01:46:18.920
<v Speaker 3>He was just so lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so lucky.</v>

2334
01:46:18.921 --> 01:46:22.340
<v Speaker 3>But I swear to God it was from me to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end of this table.</v>

2335
01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're gathering up berries,</v>

2336
01:46:24.951 --> 01:46:25.784
<v Speaker 3>that's when your safest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get in their head that that's what </v>

2337
01:46:27.621 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 3>they want to eat and eat a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>berries,</v>

2338
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:30.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2339
01:46:30.151 --> 01:46:30.984

<v Speaker 3>He was not interested to fuck all of </v>

<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So close animals.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're hanging out by this river and </v>

<v Speaker 1>and they just had a talk to them.</v>

2350
01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:02.191

<v Speaker 2>I'm so scared.</v>

2406
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more.</v>

2407
01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Look at those other two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2408
01:49:05.101 --> 01:49:05.671
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

2409
01:49:05.671 --> 01:49:06.211
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

2410
01:49:06.211 --> 01:49:06.841
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2411
01:49:06.841 --> 01:49:07.441
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

2412
01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:08.274
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

2413
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.390
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how funny.</v>

2414
01:49:09.391 --> 01:49:12.030
<v Speaker 1>If you hold back in the guy with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera as a bear.</v>

2415
01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2416
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2417
01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the coolest animal.</v>

2418
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

2419
01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until they're eating you.</v>

2420
01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not so cool.</v>

2421
01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:26.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2422
01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:28.280
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so at.</v>

2423
01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:31.880
<v Speaker 1>They are so cool to look at it when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get up and they're just,</v>

2424
01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:33.440
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever eaten bear?</v>

2425
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:34.820
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

2426
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:36.103
<v Speaker 1>Brown bear is not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those are not so good because they </v>

2427
01:49:38.710 --> 01:49:40.430
<v Speaker 1>mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mostly predators,</v>

2428
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:41.700
<v Speaker 1>but black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2429
01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:45.090
<v Speaker 1>they eat a lot of berries and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>little strat.</v>

2430
01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:47.920
<v Speaker 1>It's traditional like hunters have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear forever.</v>

2431
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I thought like when people want to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear I,</v>

2432
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:52.270
<v Speaker 1>before I became a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2433
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:54.250
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to shoot a bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of stupid.</v>

2434
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:55.690
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gross.</v>

2435
01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:56.121
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2436
01:49:56.121 --> 01:49:56.954
<v Speaker 1>I thought of it like trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone who goes out and kills a </v>

2437
01:50:00.071 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>rhino or something like that.</v>

2438
01:50:01.090 --> 01:50:01.511
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2439
01:50:01.511 --> 01:50:04.000
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing that man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just doing that to stuff,</v>

2440
01:50:04.001 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that thing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:06.213
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat them and who turns trying to </v>

2442
01:50:08.441 --> 01:50:12.290
<v Speaker 1>trying to bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Cameron Hanes is a bow hunter.</v>

2443
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2444
01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they taste good,</v>

2445
01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.270
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

2446
01:50:16.271 --> 01:50:18.340
<v Speaker 1>everybody has this idea in their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't eat them.</v>

2447
01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

2448
01:50:19.241 --> 01:50:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Up in Canada in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where we hunt.</v>

2449
01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.473
<v Speaker 1>It's traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year people go out hunting bear </v>

2450
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.520
<v Speaker 1>and a Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're delicious man.</v>

2451
01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 1>The way I described it as like a deer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pig,</v>

2452
01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:30.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like a combination of deer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs.</v>

2453
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Deer and pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2454
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost kind of like kind of a beefy</v>

2455
01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:36.094
<v Speaker 1>flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make roasts out of foam and all </v>

2456
01:50:37.211 --> 01:50:38.044
<v Speaker 1>these different things and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the population down because they </v>

2457
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:41.884
<v Speaker 1>don't have any predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's massive numbers of them and </v>

2458
01:50:44.411 --> 01:50:48.970
<v Speaker 1>they slaughtered the moose and the deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so well up there who pries moose and</v>

2459
01:50:48.971 --> 01:50:51.370
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like really important for their</v>

2460
01:50:51.371 --> 01:50:51.850
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2461
01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:53.350
<v Speaker 1>That's most of what they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2462
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of people having Mousse.</v>

2463
01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I never heard of people having bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2464
01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of a spring and fall.</v>

2465
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Bear hunting apparently falls the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when they eat berries,</v>

2466
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.110
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially blueberries,</v>

2467
01:51:05.111 --> 01:51:10.111
<v Speaker 1>they actually get a blueberry tint to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fat and their meat smells sweet.</v>

2468
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2469
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Well that's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your body,</v>

2470
01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:19.000
<v Speaker 1>like those grizzlies are bad to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their eating raw fish and rotten</v>

2471
01:51:19.001 --> 01:51:21.160
<v Speaker 1>fish all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The carcasses.</v>

2472
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Like if you need a bear that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating like a dead Moose,</v>

2473
01:51:23.771 --> 01:51:27.100
<v Speaker 1>like of a moose gets killed and just eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carcass there.</v>

2474
01:51:27.101 --> 01:51:28.860
<v Speaker 1>That's tastes terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you,</v>

2475
01:51:28.861 --> 01:51:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you are what you eat and you can apply </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to yourself.</v>

2476
01:51:31.541 --> 01:51:32.374
<v Speaker 1>Like your body literally is built up as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about earlier of the </v>

2477
01:51:35.801 --> 01:51:38.560
<v Speaker 1>nutrients that you put in at the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you put it in your dietary choices.</v>

2478
01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:39.723
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing with bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these black bears that are living up </v>

2479
01:51:42.281 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mostly eating.</v>

2480
01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get a chance,</v>

2481
01:51:45.731 --> 01:51:48.950
<v Speaker 1>they eat a lot of fawns like deer fawns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

2482
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:50.500
<v Speaker 1>calves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose calves.</v>

2483
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally that can eat an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>dear like of a deer,</v>

2484
01:51:53.681 --> 01:51:55.560
<v Speaker 1>breaks its leg or fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>

2485
01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:57.130
<v Speaker 1>deer can get away when they're full </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown,</v>

2486
01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that need the berries,</v>

2487
01:51:59.501 --> 01:52:02.870
<v Speaker 1>they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is like a Jesus Christ set.</v>

2488
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.350
<v Speaker 1>The same guy that's a picture from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place I looked it up.</v>

2489
01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Mcneil's state thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>she wearing and Alaska.</v>

2490
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is apparently ever died there,</v>

2491
01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but all these bears come in for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

2492
01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 1>They gather and just gorge on Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not even looking for that.</v>

2493
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:16.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2494
01:52:16.811 --> 01:52:17.644
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the cool things about </v>

2495
01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:20.500
<v Speaker 1>those bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:22.630
<v Speaker 1>They're in those situations like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have it in their head like,</v>

2497
01:52:22.631 --> 01:52:23.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just eating fish now.</v>

2498
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get how many of them there are.</v>

2499
01:52:26.051 --> 01:52:28.870
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a photograph and Jamie,</v>

2500
01:52:28.871 --> 01:52:32.230
<v Speaker 1>where'd you find this photo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just googled mcneil animals are,</v>

2501
01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:33.670
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this image,</v>

2502
01:52:33.671 --> 01:52:34.451
<v Speaker 1>there's three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2503
01:52:34.451 --> 01:52:35.261
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

2504
01:52:35.261 --> 01:52:40.261
<v Speaker 1>78910111213 1415 61718192212 I shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>2124 25 bears just in this one photo.</v>

2505
01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're giant.</v>

2506
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:51.020
<v Speaker 4>That is giant grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kodiak is the weirdest place man,</v>

2507
01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:52.063
<v Speaker 4>because Kodiak is an island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has the biggest brown bears in </v>

2508
01:52:55.371 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does the brown bears,</v>

2509
01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:01.630
<v Speaker 4>brown bears and grizzlies are the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing was Kodiak?</v>

2510
01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:03.380
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he bought it in Alaska.</v>

2511
01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.290
<v Speaker 4>He bought in a place called the grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 4>maze,</v>

2512
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.740
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2513
01:53:07.741 --> 01:53:09.140
<v Speaker 4>a place where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does he eat?</v>

2514
01:53:09.141 --> 01:53:11.000
<v Speaker 4>And they're dumb place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a fish?</v>

2515
01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fish like crab,</v>

2516
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.540
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>google the giant bears of Kodiak because</v>

2517
01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:18.374
<v Speaker 4>they're the most enormous grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 4>or brown bears rather in the world when </v>

2518
01:53:22.671 --> 01:53:23.504
<v Speaker 4>they're on the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call them brown bears when they're </v>

2519
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:27.170
<v Speaker 4>interior that calm grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the difference.</v>

2520
01:53:27.171 --> 01:53:30.020
<v Speaker 4>It's the same exact animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a dead one.</v>

2521
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Look at the size of that thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>mad.</v>

2522
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck band does that affect?</v>

2523
01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:38.810
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a trained bear actually.</v>

2524
01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:40.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

2525
01:53:40.511 --> 01:53:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I see the guy and I think that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trained bear.</v>

2526
01:53:42.771 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 4>I think that's like a movie bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that one down there.</v>

2527
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:46.363
<v Speaker 4>Look at that one right where I pulled </v>
<v Speaker 4>out with the guy standing there with a </v>

2528
01:53:47.931 --> 01:53:50.880
<v Speaker 4>rifle above and to the right above and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the right.</v>

2529
01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:52.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>

2530
01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

2531
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:55.063
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have feet with the size </v>

2532
01:53:57.771 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 4>of the biggest feeder and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's crazy?</v>

2533
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.233
<v Speaker 4>There was a bear that was way bigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>than that called the short face bear </v>

2534
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:05.984
<v Speaker 4>that we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we brought up the other day that was </v>

2535
01:54:07.611 --> 01:54:12.611
<v Speaker 4>apparently the most fearsome Predator in</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America up until like 11,000</v>

2536
01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:14.390
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

2537
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:19.450
<v Speaker 4>the thing running that is so wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy that this being exists.</v>

2538
01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:22.730
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2539
01:54:22.731 --> 01:54:25.340
<v Speaker 4>because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't have bears,</v>

2540
01:54:25.341 --> 01:54:28.070
<v Speaker 4>if they weren't real and then it was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie,</v>

2541
01:54:28.071 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if those things were running around,</v>

2542
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:33.710
<v Speaker 4>but they really are running around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we just get so used to them.</v>

2543
01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 4>When you hike in the back country like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2544
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:38.360
<v Speaker 4>you have to put all your food in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>containers,</v>

2545
01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:40.730
<v Speaker 4>these black container and hang on first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:54:40.731 --> 01:54:44.780
<v Speaker 4>The first time I did it I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had all this food.</v>

2547
01:54:44.781 --> 01:54:45.860
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2548
01:54:45.861 --> 01:54:47.660
<v Speaker 4>so you just put it in a bag and you hang</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up there.</v>

2549
01:54:47.661 --> 01:54:48.261
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2550
01:54:48.261 --> 01:54:52.130
<v Speaker 4>you put it in these cylinders sealed off</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you put them,</v>

2551
01:54:52.131 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 4>you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have to hang them.</v>

2552
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:55.760
<v Speaker 4>You can just get them out of the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause they're just completely sealed.</v>

2553
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:56.743
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the amount of food you can fit in </v>

2554
01:54:58.041 --> 01:55:01.160
<v Speaker 4>that is like you'd have to bring all </v>
<v Speaker 4>packs of stuff.</v>

2555
01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:02.433
<v Speaker 4>It's like has to be so small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to live so small because they </v>

2556
01:55:05.631 --> 01:55:06.464
<v Speaker 4>just come and sometimes you're in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>tent and you just hear Oh oh well they </v>

2557
01:55:13.071 --> 01:55:13.904
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm dehydrated food and freeze dried </v>

2558
01:55:16.101 --> 01:55:16.934
<v Speaker 4>food and freeze dried food is you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>add hot water to but dehydrated gets </v>

2559
01:55:21.021 --> 01:55:21.854
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really small so you can pack a lot of </v>

2560
01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:25.910
<v Speaker 4>food into a very small area.</v>

2561
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:27.680
<v Speaker 4>You just have to figure out how to add </v>
<v Speaker 4>water to it.</v>

2562
01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.360
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be me like I haven't done </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2563
01:55:29.361 --> 01:55:34.040
<v Speaker 4>And probably 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of improvement that must have</v>

2564
01:55:34.041 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 4>gone on in those 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be my on the food.</v>

2565
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just going into the camping section must</v>

2566
01:55:38.661 --> 01:55:39.494
<v Speaker 4>be like a whole futuristic thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the big improvement is </v>

2567
01:55:42.261 --> 01:55:43.920
<v Speaker 4>dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2568
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 4>versus freeze drying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that as far as like space,</v>

2569
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:48.293
<v Speaker 4>how much space that you save.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see a bear and you're there </v>

2570
01:55:50.941 --> 01:55:52.590
<v Speaker 4>with your little bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2571
01:55:52.591 --> 01:55:55.530
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you a not good?</v>

2572
01:55:55.650 --> 01:55:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Are you scared?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2573
01:55:57.001 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 4>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2574
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:59.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you see bears,</v>

2575
01:55:59.491 --> 01:56:02.610
<v Speaker 4>you should be fucking nervous as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2576
01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.680
<v Speaker 4>most likely they're not going to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>get you,</v>

2577
01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:08.700
<v Speaker 4>but they might if you miss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you hit it and it's knee,</v>

2578
01:56:08.850 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 4>will he be pissed and come get you?</v>

2579
01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps most likely they were going </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

2580
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely.</v>

2581
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy who knows a guy who's </v>

2582
01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 4>friend was attack as were many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>several steps removed.</v>

2583
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.600
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's a good story.</v>

2584
01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:27.780
<v Speaker 4>The first hunting trip ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they were hunting for deer.</v>

2585
01:56:27.781 --> 01:56:28.614
<v Speaker 4>He's in his tent and he gets mauled in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his tent by a 500 pound predatory black </v>

2586
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:35.360
<v Speaker 4>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>500 pounds,</v>

2587
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:36.840
<v Speaker 4>500 gum that black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2588
01:56:36.841 --> 01:56:38.460
<v Speaker 4>they get bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they really?</v>

2589
01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2590
01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:42.310
<v Speaker 4>I thought black bear where like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>small bear into the know,</v>

2591
01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:45.090
<v Speaker 4>sometimes small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's when they're juvenile.</v>

2592
01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Like they have a hard scrabble life man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of them get eaten as cubs rather.</v>

2593
01:56:48.930 --> 01:56:50.970
<v Speaker 4>Bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bears are cannibals.</v>

2594
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 4>Especially Blackburn's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2596
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brown bears too,</v>

2597
01:56:54.451 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but black bears get enormous.</v>

2598
01:56:56.430 --> 01:57:00.660
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine just killed one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was eight and a half feet tall.</v>

2599
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:01.980
<v Speaker 4>Cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2600
01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:02.814
<v Speaker 4>Look at this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna show you a picture and you're </v>

2601
01:57:04.111 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 4>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2602
01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Lydia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Size that.</v>

2603
01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:10.230
<v Speaker 4>That's black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2604
01:57:10.231 --> 01:57:12.790
<v Speaker 4>it's big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight and a half feet wide.</v>

2605
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Eight foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three inches.</v>

2606
01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:16.230
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're deep in the woods.</v>

2607
01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:18.150
<v Speaker 4>You kill this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2608
01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.200
<v Speaker 4>get it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2609
01:57:19.201 --> 01:57:21.960
<v Speaker 4>you got to cut it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut it up and pack it out.</v>

2610
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to.</v>

2611
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.240
<v Speaker 4>There's no other way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you have a large suv or something</v>

2612
01:57:27.241 --> 01:57:29.580
<v Speaker 4>that you can drag it into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're walking in.</v>

2613
01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're walking in,</v>

2614
01:57:30.991 --> 01:57:34.350
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to pack that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's didn't take his head.</v>

2615
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.420
<v Speaker 4>They take you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take everything.</v>

2616
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Take it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2617
01:57:37.321 --> 01:57:40.470
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to kill an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should take everything.</v>

2618
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:43.590
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should take all the meat for sure.</v>

2619
01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:47.310
<v Speaker 4>And like these skulls that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that deer,</v>

2620
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:49.080
<v Speaker 4>the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moose,</v>

2621
01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:51.390
<v Speaker 4>and the deer over there and the elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's out there,</v>

2622
01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:54.450
<v Speaker 4>those are all a mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2623
01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2624
01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:00.050
<v Speaker 4>it becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say a decoration because</v>

2625
01:58:00.051 --> 01:58:03.660
<v Speaker 4>it's way more powerful than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I had to choose like anything to</v>

2626
01:58:03.661 --> 01:58:05.460
<v Speaker 4>keep in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be the skulls.</v>

2627
01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:06.373
<v Speaker 4>Like regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you could take a couple of things </v>

2628
01:58:07.351 --> 01:58:08.550
<v Speaker 4>in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything else has to go.</v>

2629
01:58:08.551 --> 01:58:09.384
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not letting these skulls go to </v>

2630
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:11.441
<v Speaker 4>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2631
01:58:11.441 --> 01:58:13.620
<v Speaker 4>they mean it means too much as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2632
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.740
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a spiritual level too.</v>

2633
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:20.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a connection.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's especially wild ones.</v>

2864
02:08:15.161 --> 02:08:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they really argue with that?</v>

2865
02:08:20.730 --> 02:08:22.680
<v Speaker 3>So we keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't pictured,</v>

2866
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:26.220
<v Speaker 6>we were at the San Diego Zoo recently or</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Santa Barbara Zoo and I'm,</v>

2867
02:08:26.250 --> 02:08:28.740
<v Speaker 6>it's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They drafts are one of the few animals.</v>

2868
02:08:28.741 --> 02:08:30.410
<v Speaker 6>I actually had a bit about this in my </v>
<v Speaker 6>act.</v>

2869
02:08:30.690 --> 02:08:33.900
<v Speaker 6>The one of the few animals that I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>are better off in captivity because they</v>

2870
02:08:33.901 --> 02:08:34.734
<v Speaker 6>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't give a fuck like other </v>

2871
02:08:35.911 --> 02:08:37.440
<v Speaker 6>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like so sad,</v>

2872
02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:38.513
<v Speaker 6>but giraffes another day with no lions </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they just wander around like they </v>

2873
02:08:42.391 --> 02:08:44.790
<v Speaker 6>don't seem to mind at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like their behavior,</v>

2874
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.863
<v Speaker 6>their behavior is so predictable that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they let babies feed them or hold up a </v>

2875
02:08:50.401 --> 02:08:51.234
<v Speaker 6>piece of leaf and a baby will come over </v>
<v Speaker 6>and take it from the draft will come </v>

2876
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:56.420
<v Speaker 6>over and take it from the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2877
02:08:56.450 --> 02:08:59.220
<v Speaker 6>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just really chilled out animals.</v>

2878
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:03.090
<v Speaker 6>But here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they,</v>

2879
02:09:03.091 --> 02:09:06.630
<v Speaker 6>they're fucking mean to other drafts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They fight to the death.</v>

2880
02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:07.553
<v Speaker 6>They beat the shit out of each other </v>
<v Speaker 6>with those lumps on the top of their </v>

2881
02:09:09.151 --> 02:09:10.170
<v Speaker 6>heads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>swing it.</v>

2882
02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:11.573
<v Speaker 6>And one of the other things they do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they keep food away from younger </v>

2883
02:09:14.281 --> 02:09:15.114
<v Speaker 6>giraffes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the way they do it as they eat all </v>

2884
02:09:16.891 --> 02:09:17.724
<v Speaker 6>the low hanging leaves and they do it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to purposely starve out other </v>

2885
02:09:22.411 --> 02:09:23.580
<v Speaker 6>giraffes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2886
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:25.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of fucked up,</v>

2887
02:09:25.171 --> 02:09:26.250
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're arrogant.</v>

2888
02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:27.563
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll eat lower leaves even though </v>

2889
02:09:28.741 --> 02:09:29.574
<v Speaker 6>they can reach the higher ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They eat lower leaves and it's </v>

2890
02:09:31.741 --> 02:09:32.574
<v Speaker 6>speculated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they do it because of competition for </v>

2891
02:09:33.901 --> 02:09:34.734
<v Speaker 6>food that they want to like literally </v>
<v Speaker 6>box out these giraffes and let them </v>

2892
02:09:37.081 --> 02:09:37.860
<v Speaker 6>starve to death.</v>

2893
02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:38.870
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2894
02:09:38.871 --> 02:09:40.970
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that everything's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine went,</v>

2895
02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.430
<v Speaker 3>everything's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine went and,</v>

2896
02:09:43.431 --> 02:09:45.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a similar problem that I have,</v>

2897
02:09:45.861 --> 02:09:48.050
<v Speaker 3>which I have a cat that's just a killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

2898
02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Just kills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not every day just birds.</v>

2899
02:09:51.711 --> 02:09:52.880
<v Speaker 3>You let it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Birds,</v>

2900
02:09:52.881 --> 02:09:55.220
<v Speaker 3>lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't keep it in.</v>

2901
02:09:55.221 --> 02:09:59.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a while now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just wants nonstop.</v>

2902
02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:01.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going outside,</v>

2903
02:10:01.011 --> 02:10:02.930
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2904
02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.850
<v Speaker 3>so we're kind of freaked out and were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to stop it and putting bells</v>

2905
02:10:07.851 --> 02:10:08.684
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

2906
02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.240
<v Speaker 3>my friend had the same thing with it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat.</v>

2907
02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:13.940
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to Africa,</v>

2908
02:10:13.941 --> 02:10:16.070
<v Speaker 3>came back and said everything needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2909
02:10:16.071 --> 02:10:16.904
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like it put everything in </v>

2910
02:10:18.261 --> 02:10:19.094
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like this is how the world </v>

2911
02:10:20.391 --> 02:10:21.070
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

2912
02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:21.903
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is how certainly how nature got to </v>

2913
02:10:23.051 --> 02:10:27.760
<v Speaker 6>2016 to 2016 by everybody just waiting </v>
<v Speaker 6>in line for food.</v>

2914
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:28.900
<v Speaker 6>Being polite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:32.050
<v Speaker 6>There's a number that they put at house </v>
<v Speaker 6>cats.</v>

2916
02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:36.090
<v Speaker 6>How many animals they kill every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And just in North America it's billions.</v>

2917
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.780
<v Speaker 6>Billions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>billions in birds and in mammals.</v>

2918
02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:39.633
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Billions of birds and billions of </v>

2919
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:42.690
<v Speaker 6>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are just ruthless little fucker ar</v>

2920
02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.673
<v Speaker 6>and people are complaining now because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they've heard the stats and they're </v>

2921
02:10:45.741 --> 02:10:47.150
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you shouldn't let your cats out.</v>

2922
02:10:47.151 --> 02:10:47.984
<v Speaker 6>And you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just nature's cleanups the way it </v>

2923
02:10:49.671 --> 02:10:51.710
<v Speaker 6>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how nature works.</v>

2924
02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:52.120
<v Speaker 6>Loved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'd,</v>

2925
02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.380
<v Speaker 6>they didn't do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they didn't have those instincts,</v>

2926
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:56.930
<v Speaker 6>honestly like coyotes have coyotes were </v>
<v Speaker 6>now out there doing that.</v>

2927
02:10:56.931 --> 02:10:58.700
<v Speaker 6>If all these animals were now not there </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing that,</v>

2928
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.950
<v Speaker 6>we would be overrun with rodents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

2929
02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:02.113
<v Speaker 6>it'd be mice everywhere cause it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing to eat them if it weren't for </v>

2930
02:11:04.821 --> 02:11:06.110
<v Speaker 6>birds and hawks.</v>

2931
02:11:06.110 --> 02:11:06.943
<v Speaker 6>And it'd be like living in the bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have this issue at our house where </v>

2932
02:11:09.801 --> 02:11:10.640
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2933
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:15.830
<v Speaker 6>we just recently installed this fence </v>
<v Speaker 6>and our backyard that's glass.</v>

2934
02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:19.430
<v Speaker 6>And we used to have a metal fence there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now it's a glass fence and the hawks</v>

2935
02:11:19.431 --> 02:11:20.264
<v Speaker 6>haven't figured it out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So every now and then you hear it and </v>

2936
02:11:23.961 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 6>we'll go out and sign in for what do you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have?</v>

2937
02:11:25.581 --> 02:11:27.630
<v Speaker 6>They're swooping down to kill Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you got?</v>

2938
02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.510
<v Speaker 6>Chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they're not killing the chickens,</v>

2939
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 6>but one did disappear that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>totally put a finger on what happened to</v>

2940
02:11:33.021 --> 02:11:33.854
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2941
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:35.240
<v Speaker 6>It could have been a coyote though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2942
02:11:35.241 --> 02:11:37.790
<v Speaker 6>that'd be bird and bird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've seen the bird and bird.</v>

2943
02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:39.020
<v Speaker 6>Super Common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2944
02:11:39.230 --> 02:11:40.063
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like black on black crime and no </v>

2945
02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.500
<v Speaker 6>one wants to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It happens.</v>

2946
02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:48.470
<v Speaker 6>But a friend of mine was sitting in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>backyard and he watched a,</v>

2947
02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.900
<v Speaker 6>a a hawk come down scuba dove.</v>

2948
02:11:51.210 --> 02:11:52.043
<v Speaker 6>He said a dove was just sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 6>just chill and all of a sudden really </v>

2949
02:11:55.071 --> 02:11:56.510
<v Speaker 6>said it happened like 20 feet from his </v>
<v Speaker 6>face.</v>

2950
02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck man,</v>

2951
02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:04.250
<v Speaker 6>this wrapped or just came down from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>sky and they take pets,</v>

2952
02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 6>but so he's hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they swooped down,</v>

2953
02:12:06.610 --> 02:12:07.443
<v Speaker 6>you know when they're looking for things</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they're looking to make their </v>

2954
02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:11.540
<v Speaker 6>approach and they just get k the fuck </v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2956
02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.300

<v Speaker 6>Like we've had,</v>

2957
02:12:14.301 --> 02:12:17.660
<v Speaker 6>one of them died on us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one of them we had to take two,</v>

<v Speaker 6>And then another one recently got </v>

<v Speaker 6>like it was nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>If people let a little bunny go.</v>

2992
02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that.</v>

2993
02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Five seconds later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2994
02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.033
<v Speaker 4>little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little cute girl with a little bunny </v>

2995
02:13:58.111 --> 02:13:59.790
<v Speaker 4>rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

2996
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:12.390
<v Speaker 4>Ah God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instantly that thing just flew in.</v>

2997
02:14:14.721 --> 02:14:17.470
<v Speaker 4>She's asking where it's mommy is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then a raptor.</v>

2998
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's in some ways it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some ways I think that's beautiful,</v>

2999
02:14:23.141 --> 02:14:25.150
<v Speaker 4>but in other ways like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the baby's cute,</v>

3000
02:14:25.151 --> 02:14:25.984
<v Speaker 4>but what is it about us where when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at like very small versions of </v>

3001
02:14:30.401 --> 02:14:31.234
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had a picture of the other day </v>

3002
02:14:31.991 --> 02:14:32.824
<v Speaker 4>that I put up on my instagram of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant grizzly bear with her three cubs </v>

3003
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:37.690
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

3004
02:14:37.691 --> 02:14:39.680
<v Speaker 4>look how adorable those little cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>others,</v>

3005
02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:40.953
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what is going on with us where we </v>

3006
02:14:43.301 --> 02:14:44.960
<v Speaker 4>see these little things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3007
02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:47.110
<v Speaker 4>what is cute?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in quotes,</v>

3008
02:14:47.111 --> 02:14:50.140
<v Speaker 4>like look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a genetic thing.</v>

3009
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:52.810
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it keeps us from wanting to kill them.</v>

3010
02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.970
<v Speaker 4>It's our genes and also to protect our </v>
<v Speaker 4>own.</v>

3011
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:56.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just let them thrive.</v>

3012
02:14:56.670 --> 02:14:59.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean you see a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to protect it,</v>

3013
02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:03.760
<v Speaker 4>but like when you lose like that's why </v>
<v Speaker 4>like whenever the,</v>

3014
02:15:04.150 --> 02:15:04.983
<v Speaker 4>when that Connecticut school shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like these tiny kids like </v>

3015
02:15:07.211 --> 02:15:08.050
<v Speaker 4>kindergarten,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3016
02:15:08.110 --> 02:15:08.943
<v Speaker 4>That was such a mind blowing thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because those are the faces we want to </v>

3017
02:15:12.161 --> 02:15:13.930
<v Speaker 4>protect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3018
02:15:14.650 --> 02:15:16.750
<v Speaker 4>It's just the instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3019
02:15:16.751 --> 02:15:20.740
<v Speaker 4>and there's your instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many crazy fuckers that don't</v>

3020
02:15:20.741 --> 02:15:24.040
<v Speaker 4>believe that that really happened play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen any of that?</v>

3021
02:15:24.041 --> 02:15:26.920
<v Speaker 4>The like people that like thing to deny </v>
<v Speaker 4>or is that these,</v>

3022
02:15:26.921 --> 02:15:30.460
<v Speaker 4>all these school shootings are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>false flags.</v>

3023
02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:31.753
<v Speaker 4>Like do you really think that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>get all those families to lie about </v>

3024
02:15:34.391 --> 02:15:35.800
<v Speaker 4>losing their kids?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3025
02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.900
<v Speaker 4>These families are all operatives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3026
02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:39.880
<v Speaker 4>They're all so CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

3027
02:15:39.881 --> 02:15:42.970
<v Speaker 4>People are so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People always talk always.</v>

3028
02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:45.570
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can organize them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's me,</v>

3029
02:15:45.930 --> 02:15:46.763
<v Speaker 4>but to keep a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just amazing that people </v>

3030
02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:52.780
<v Speaker 4>actually would believe that that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be something they would entertain there.</v>

3031
02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Mutans that's against nature to see this</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and not like,</v>

3032
02:15:57.521 --> 02:15:59.920
<v Speaker 4>how do we make sure this doesn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>again?</v>

3033
02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:02.110
<v Speaker 4>When your head goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lie.</v>

3034
02:16:02.111 --> 02:16:04.060
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go to fleet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

3035
02:16:04.100 --> 02:16:04.933
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird thing with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to believe that a lot of </v>

3036
02:16:06.911 --> 02:16:08.980
<v Speaker 4>things are lies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of things.</v>

3037
02:16:09.110 --> 02:16:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the eye,</v>

3038
02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:14.710
<v Speaker 4>the admitting that it happens is </v>
<v Speaker 4>admitting it's chaos.</v>

3039
02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:17.860
<v Speaker 4>But this weird shit going on today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like because of the Internet,</v>

3040
02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:19.203
<v Speaker 4>people have these forums and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube pages where they make up this </v>

3041
02:16:22.031 --> 02:16:25.720
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a guy the other day was who was a,</v>

3042
02:16:25.930 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 4>he's a flat earth guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a video about how are a hoax?</v>

3043
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:32.660
<v Speaker 6>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3044
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:34.540
<v Speaker 6>Video about dinosaurs being a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm like,</v>

3045
02:16:34.541 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>

3046
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:36.010
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait in,</v>

3047
02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:36.843
<v Speaker 6>wait and wait and wait and went away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So all these paleontologists for like </v>

3048
02:16:39.941 --> 02:16:42.480
<v Speaker 6>what 150 years have all been foolish.</v>

3049
02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All in on it.</v>

3050
02:16:43.610 --> 02:16:44.670
<v Speaker 3>All in all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my name's Darren,</v>

3051
02:16:44.810 --> 02:16:45.820
<v Speaker 3>generation to generation</v>

3052
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:48.190
<v Speaker 6>also doesn't believe that satellites are</v>
<v Speaker 6>real,</v>

3053
02:16:48.270 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Satellites are not real.</v>

3054
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 6>They're really what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have planes and the planes are flying</v>

3055
02:16:53.201 --> 02:16:55.300
<v Speaker 6>very high and they stay in orbit and </v>
<v Speaker 6>those are,</v>

3056
02:16:55.301 --> 02:16:56.740
<v Speaker 6>they're transmitting the signal</v>

3057
02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:01.790
<v Speaker 3>lord and the world's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real problem though.</v>

3058
02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:02.780
<v Speaker 3>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3059
02:17:02.781 --> 02:17:05.960
<v Speaker 3>because that's the extreme part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those people really believe that.</v>

3060
02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:07.190
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of people do,</v>

3061
02:17:07.670 --> 02:17:10.610
<v Speaker 3>but just basic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no truth.</v>

3062
02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:11.473
<v Speaker 3>The Internet is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is devouring truth sort of that there </v>

3063
02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:15.483
<v Speaker 3>that you can literally have real </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent people just talking about </v>

3064
02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:21.050
<v Speaker 3>unemployment rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just talking about the government,</v>

3065
02:17:21.051 --> 02:17:23.270
<v Speaker 3>just talking about how the economy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

3066
02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can have people saying be there,</v>

3067
02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:26.923
<v Speaker 3>it's been lowered to below 5% of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unemployment and other people are </v>

3068
02:17:30.381 --> 02:17:31.640
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3069
02:17:31.641 --> 02:17:35.060
<v Speaker 3>that is completely wrong and flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These numbers are complete and these are</v>

3070
02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:40.180
<v Speaker 3>two groups of intelligent people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees and putting out these facts.</v>

3071
02:17:43.881 --> 02:17:45.440
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing as the official hill</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3072
02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:49.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like I can look up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can any fact you want to bring up,</v>

3073
02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:50.353
<v Speaker 3>you go on the Internet and you'll find </v>
<v Speaker 3>the opposite and not from like what </v>

3074
02:17:53.871 --> 02:17:57.440
<v Speaker 3>looks like crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is,</v>

3075
02:17:57.441 --> 02:17:58.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean what is the truth?</v>

3076
02:17:58.710 --> 02:18:03.710
<v Speaker 6>I think right now what's happening is </v>
<v Speaker 6>virtually anybody can start a website or</v>

3077
02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:06.843
<v Speaker 6>a twitter page or whatever and say </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything they want and they don't have </v>

3078
02:18:09.761 --> 02:18:10.880
<v Speaker 6>to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3079
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:14.980
<v Speaker 6>But if they convince enough people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll get a following and then through</v>

3080
02:18:14.981 --> 02:18:15.814
<v Speaker 6>that following they can get a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that get confirmation bias and </v>

3081
02:18:19.271 --> 02:18:22.540
<v Speaker 6>only look into the information that </v>
<v Speaker 6>supports all this craziness.</v>

3082
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:26.020
<v Speaker 6>No satellites and the earth is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all that nonsense.</v>

3083
02:18:26.290 --> 02:18:27.123
<v Speaker 6>But I think this is almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>temporary blip in our road to absorbing </v>

3084
02:18:30.701 --> 02:18:31.534
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think right now information is coming </v>

3085
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:36.460
<v Speaker 6>from a bunch of different sources.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lots of them legit,</v>

3086
02:18:36.461 --> 02:18:37.294
<v Speaker 6>most of them are legit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then some of them that are just </v>

3087
02:18:38.531 --> 02:18:39.364
<v Speaker 6>really wacky like this where it gets the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sidetrack thing where people just start </v>

3088
02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:43.593
<v Speaker 6>thinking about chem trails are thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>about ufo abductions and getting </v>

3089
02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:47.223
<v Speaker 6>absorbed in it.</v>

3090
02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:48.303
<v Speaker 6>But I think one of the next stages of </v>
<v Speaker 6>disbursement of information is going to </v>

3091
02:18:52.271 --> 02:18:57.271
<v Speaker 6>be direct brain to brain and I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to share information in some</v>

3092
02:18:58.001 --> 02:18:58.834
<v Speaker 6>way that is as alien to us as the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Internet would have been to people that </v>

3093
02:19:01.451 --> 02:19:02.284
<v Speaker 6>live to 150 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you tried to explain google to </v>

3094
02:19:05.451 --> 02:19:07.330
<v Speaker 6>someone who lived to 150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd be like,</v>

3095
02:19:07.331 --> 02:19:10.200
<v Speaker 6>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is never going to happen forever.</v>

3096
02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:11.470
<v Speaker 6>But to us it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3097
02:19:11.471 --> 02:19:13.090
<v Speaker 6>Google at Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3098
02:19:13.091 --> 02:19:14.820
<v Speaker 6>it's like it becomes normal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3099
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:18.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the next stage of that is you're</v>

3100
02:19:18.671 --> 02:19:19.504
<v Speaker 6>going to be able to access information </v>
<v Speaker 6>that directly comes from someone's mind </v>

3101
02:19:23.470 --> 02:19:27.500
<v Speaker 6>and meaning that you're going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 6>to share thoughts.</v>

3102
02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.513
<v Speaker 6>I think thoughts are going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to figure out a way to </v>

3103
02:19:31.641 --> 02:19:32.474
<v Speaker 6>take whatever frequency and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>signal that a thought is and you're </v>

3104
02:19:37.281 --> 02:19:38.114
<v Speaker 6>going to be able to condense it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>project it and send it to people and </v>

3105
02:19:41.810 --> 02:19:44.870
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be able to access other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people's thoughts and you're going to be</v>

3106
02:19:44.871 --> 02:19:47.810
<v Speaker 6>able to know what's truthful and what's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>

3107
02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:49.190
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to be a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

3108
02:19:49.191 --> 02:19:50.900
<v Speaker 6>I hope this guy's telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to,</v>

3109
02:19:50.901 --> 02:19:55.220
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be able to know like </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty pretty much instantaneously.</v>

3110
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:59.180
<v Speaker 6>I think that's whether it's a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 6>years from now or 200 years from now,</v>

3111
02:19:59.270 --> 02:20:00.103
<v Speaker 6>but all in all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you look at like the Roman empire or </v>

3112
02:20:02.890 --> 02:20:03.723
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at like long periods of time where </v>

3113
02:20:06.261 --> 02:20:09.080
<v Speaker 6>one group dominated one aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization,</v>

3114
02:20:09.350 --> 02:20:12.680
<v Speaker 6>a hundred years ain't shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to us a hundred years ago,</v>

3115
02:20:12.681 --> 02:20:15.500
<v Speaker 6>1916 it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>might as well be Mars.</v>

3116
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:17.660
<v Speaker 6>They might as well be from another </v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

3117
02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:18.853
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that go back to your marriage thing </v>

3118
02:20:20.991 --> 02:20:24.170
<v Speaker 6>of what your wife is thinking when she's</v>
<v Speaker 6>having sex with you.</v>

3119
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:25.140
<v Speaker 6>You're going to no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3120
02:20:25.141 --> 02:20:27.170
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to see the crazy people can send</v>

3121
02:20:27.171 --> 02:20:28.004
<v Speaker 6>their thoughts just as easily is a no </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you don't necessarily have to </v>

3122
02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:35.330
<v Speaker 6>share in those thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just think that you'll,</v>

3123
02:20:35.331 --> 02:20:36.164
<v Speaker 6>you'll be able to look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these are obviously science fiction </v>

3124
02:20:37.911 --> 02:20:38.744
<v Speaker 6>notions right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think that when you send a text </v>

3125
02:20:43.221 --> 02:20:46.760
<v Speaker 6>message to someone or put out a tweet or</v>
<v Speaker 6>a facebook message,</v>

3126
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.983
<v Speaker 6>you're essentially condensing a thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>into some sort of a digital </v>

3127
02:20:50.631 --> 02:20:52.130
<v Speaker 6>representation of that thought.</v>

3128
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:54.040
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you use the right language,</v>

3129
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.903
<v Speaker 6>then you send it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that what's going to happen is </v>

3130
02:20:57.201 --> 02:20:58.034
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be direct thought to </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought we're going to be able to </v>

3131
02:20:59.901 --> 02:21:03.050
<v Speaker 6>interpret thoughts and then we're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

3132
02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:03.973
<v Speaker 6>we're going to be able to know whether </v>
<v Speaker 6>or not someone is actually being honest </v>

3133
02:21:06.951 --> 02:21:07.940
<v Speaker 6>or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're bullshitting,</v>

3134
02:21:07.970 --> 02:21:09.710
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3135
02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:11.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think in our careers,</v>

3136
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.420
<v Speaker 6>well that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is an extension of your brain.</v>

3137
02:21:14.421 --> 02:21:17.060
<v Speaker 6>This is my brain to this brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to your brain.</v>

3138
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.810
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3139
02:21:17.810 --> 02:21:18.643
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it makes sense that you're going to </v>

3140
02:21:19.641 --> 02:21:21.200
<v Speaker 6>bridge that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a bridge,</v>

3141
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:22.123
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a bridge to minds and information </v>

3142
02:21:24.381 --> 02:21:25.970
<v Speaker 6>and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It really is,</v>

3143
02:21:25.971 --> 02:21:28.550
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think this is just one step.</v>

3144
02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:29.653
<v Speaker 6>As technology exponentially grows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not just gonna accept typing </v>

3145
02:21:33.891 --> 02:21:34.724
<v Speaker 6>things into a glass screen that will </v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually be send and then put it up </v>

3146
02:21:38.031 --> 02:21:38.210
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

3147
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:40.340
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to get better.</v>

3148
02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:41.353
<v Speaker 6>They're going to figure out new ways to </v>
<v Speaker 6>integrate that technology into human </v>

3149
02:21:44.361 --> 02:21:46.490
<v Speaker 6>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be really weird,</v>

3150
02:21:46.491 --> 02:21:49.130
<v Speaker 6>like neural implants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And things along those lines going to be</v>

3151
02:21:49.131 --> 02:21:51.110
<v Speaker 6>really wild because when they figured </v>
<v Speaker 6>out like,</v>

3152
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:52.280
<v Speaker 6>see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you wear glasses,</v>

3153
02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:53.990
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>One day they're going to say,</v>

3154
02:21:53.991 --> 02:21:57.020
<v Speaker 6>listen Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to wear glasses.</v>

3155
02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:01.160
<v Speaker 6>All we have to do is install one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>these new internet neural apps.</v>

3156
02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:04.460
<v Speaker 6>And once we do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll be able to see crystal clear.</v>

3157
02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:08.120
<v Speaker 6>There's a way that this neural APP </v>
<v Speaker 6>reworks the synapses,</v>

3158
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:09.023
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It changes the way your eyeballs </v>

3159
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.863
<v Speaker 6>interpret the cones and rods interpret </v>
<v Speaker 6>the world around you and you gonna be </v>

3160
02:22:15.021 --> 02:22:16.050
<v Speaker 6>able to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3161
02:22:16.051 --> 02:22:18.170
<v Speaker 6>but I think they look good in glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look awesome.</v>

3162
02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:21.080
<v Speaker 6>You look smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

3163
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:22.760
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you look smarter when you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>glasses?</v>

3164
02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:24.380
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3165
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does like chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chicks</v>

3166
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.990
<v Speaker 4>look way smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3167
02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:30.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dante though.</v>

3168
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:32.790
<v Speaker 4>It depends on the glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dudes look,</v>

3169
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:33.990
<v Speaker 4>look you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3170
02:22:34.330 --> 02:22:39.330
<v Speaker 4>when you can't see good crosses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smarter throws a glass.</v>

3171
02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:41.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't assume that they have something </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong with her eyes,</v>

3172
02:22:41.911 --> 02:22:42.750
<v Speaker 4>I assume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3173
02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:45.840
<v Speaker 4>she's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's clever.</v>

3174
02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:47.850
<v Speaker 4>But then Sarah Pailin fucked all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3175
02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She says,</v>

3176
02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:50.910
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check glasses.</v>

3177
02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:52.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's more on,</v>

3178
02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just dumps that bear.</v>

3179
02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:58.150
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't do the,</v>

3180
02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:02.820
<v Speaker 4>she's a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a real trump supporter.</v>

3181
02:23:03.450 --> 02:23:07.110
<v Speaker 4>I fucking trump supporter you liberal </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of shit.</v>

3182
02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he's going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3183
02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3184
02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:15.390
<v Speaker 4>I talked to a lot of people who think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an impossibility,</v>

3185
02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:19.530
<v Speaker 4>but the further we go down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's coming.</v>

3186
02:23:19.531 --> 02:23:21.570
<v Speaker 4>And I think that it's a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>

3187
02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:23.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3188
02:23:23.031 --> 02:23:25.140
<v Speaker 4>and I think if I was a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>theorist,</v>

3189
02:23:25.141 --> 02:23:25.974
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that what Donald Trump is </v>

3190
02:23:27.661 --> 02:23:32.661
<v Speaker 4>doing is making us happy about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton being president because it's the</v>

3191
02:23:33.661 --> 02:23:37.890
<v Speaker 4>only way we're going to be happy about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton being president.</v>

3192
02:23:37.890 --> 02:23:38.723
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Hillary Clinton represents the </v>

3193
02:23:40.171 --> 02:23:45.030
<v Speaker 4>establishment in about as clear a form </v>
<v Speaker 4>as we've ever seen before.</v>

3194
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No question.</v>

3195
02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:47.251
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3196
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:48.084
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's intelligent and when she was </v>

3197
02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:52.110
<v Speaker 4>secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both sides liked her.</v>

3198
02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:52.993
<v Speaker 4>They was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was really positive reviews from </v>

3199
02:23:54.091 --> 02:23:55.560
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're right,</v>

3200
02:23:55.561 --> 02:23:58.380
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly the same old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same old you ever talk about,</v>

3201
02:23:58.381 --> 02:24:01.530
<v Speaker 4>or you ever read the Secret Service?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about guarding her.</v>

3202
02:24:02.370 --> 02:24:04.440
<v Speaker 4>They think she's a sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3203
02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:05.310
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3204
02:24:05.311 --> 02:24:06.270
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3205
02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:10.650
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't thank anyone and she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to them that guard her 24,</v>

3206
02:24:10.651 --> 02:24:13.650
<v Speaker 4>seven and she doesn't talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say there's a guy who,</v>

3207
02:24:13.651 --> 02:24:15.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was one of her secrets.</v>

3208
02:24:15.041 --> 02:24:16.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he bought be a fucking idiot.</v>

3209
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might be in one guy's report.</v>

3210
02:24:19.770 --> 02:24:20.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3211
02:24:20.850 --> 02:24:21.683
<v Speaker 4>I think there's more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reports were that she's just </v>

3212
02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:25.950
<v Speaker 4>some creepy about her.</v>

3213
02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:26.881
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3214
02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:28.950
<v Speaker 4>there's some creepy about everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing.</v>

3215
02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:29.813
<v Speaker 4>Problem with the idea that you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>find one perfect person is so off the </v>

3216
02:24:34.201 --> 02:24:35.034
<v Speaker 4>charts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3217
02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:36.690
<v Speaker 4>everybody's flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's,</v>

3218
02:24:36.691 --> 02:24:38.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially if you play that game for</v>

3219
02:24:38.671 --> 02:24:40.380
<v Speaker 4>that long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be dirty.</v>

3220
02:24:40.381 --> 02:24:41.214
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be duplicitous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's part of what you've got to </v>

3221
02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:44.120
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3222
02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:45.870
<v Speaker 4>That game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a dark game.</v>

3223
02:24:45.871 --> 02:24:46.704
<v Speaker 4>It's a dark game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the video of her </v>

3224
02:24:48.151 --> 02:24:51.150

<v Speaker 4>before they interview or they're rolling</v>

<v Speaker 4>and she's laughing about Kadafi dying </v>

<v Speaker 4>Who is the person that we see that's all</v>

3233

<v Speaker 4>measured and calm?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not you for real cause that </v>

<v Speaker 4>Cause she was like throwing her head </v>
<v Speaker 4>back laughing.</v>

3236
02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is really weird way.</v>

3237
02:25:19.591 --> 02:25:20.640
<v Speaker 4>Like watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch this.</v>

3238
02:25:21.330 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go all the way from the beginning.</v>

3239
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3240
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.620
<v Speaker 8>I mean that is the land of unconfirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

3241
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:29.410
<v Speaker 8>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we saw he died.</v>

3242
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:32.680
<v Speaker 8>Did it have anything to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 8>visit?</v>

3243
02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:34.080
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure it yet.</v>

3244
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a little weird.</v>

3245
02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:39.013
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not jazz or weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's strange what the Hillary Clinton </v>

3246
02:25:41.581 --> 02:25:46.470
<v Speaker 4>lying for 13 minutes straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're sad about play that real quick.</v>

3247
02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:48.473
<v Speaker 4>But I think what you said so far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super important that no one's </v>

3248
02:25:51.511 --> 02:25:52.500
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3249
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:53.940
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not only that,</v>

3250
02:25:53.941 --> 02:25:56.010
<v Speaker 4>this business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.970
<v Speaker 9>Mama's the immigration policies.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now you say they're too harsh.</v>

3252
02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:01.310
<v Speaker 9>You supported his trade deal dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 9>times.</v>

3253
02:26:01.311 --> 02:26:04.190
<v Speaker 9>You even called it the gold standard.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now suddenly last week,</v>

3254
02:26:04.191 --> 02:26:06.470
<v Speaker 9>you're against it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Will you say anything to get elected?</v>

3255
02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:07.553
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>actually I have been very consistent </v>

3256
02:26:08.611 --> 02:26:12.630
<v Speaker 8>over the course of my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have always fought for the same values</v>

3257
02:26:12.631 --> 02:26:14.010
<v Speaker 8>and principles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Looking at him.</v>

3258
02:26:15.170 --> 02:26:17.430
<v Speaker 8>Do you think New York state should </v>
<v Speaker 8>recognize gay?</v>

3259
02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:20.070
<v Speaker 8>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3260
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:28.070
<v Speaker 8>I believe that marriage is not just a </v>
<v Speaker 8>bond,</v>

3261
02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.740
<v Speaker 8>but a sacred bond between a man and a </v>
<v Speaker 8>woman.</v>

3262
02:26:31.741 --> 02:26:33.760
<v Speaker 8>2004.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have uh,</v>

3263
02:26:33.810 --> 02:26:38.460
<v Speaker 8>not to support it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Same sex marriage and civil partnerships</v>

3264
02:26:38.490 --> 02:26:39.323
<v Speaker 8>and a contractual relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I support marriage for lesbian and gay </v>

3265
02:26:43.891 --> 02:26:44.724
<v Speaker 8>couples,</v>
<v Speaker 8>2013 Ford it personally and as a matter </v>

3266
02:26:47.941 --> 02:26:48.774
<v Speaker 8>of policy and law.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you're saying your opinion on gay </v>

3267
02:26:50.881 --> 02:26:54.780
<v Speaker 8>marriage changed or you changed your </v>
<v Speaker 8>mind because you know,</v>

3268
02:26:54.781 --> 02:26:57.060
<v Speaker 8>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have to say I think you are,</v>

3269
02:26:57.090 --> 02:26:58.860
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was very persistent,</v>

3270
02:26:58.890 --> 02:26:59.723
<v Speaker 8>but you are playing with my words and </v>
<v Speaker 8>playing with what is such and I'm just </v>

3271
02:27:03.271 --> 02:27:05.010
<v Speaker 8>trying to clarify so I can understand.</v>

3272
02:27:05.010 --> 02:27:06.840
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think you are trying to clarify.</v>

3273
02:27:06.841 --> 02:27:08.310
<v Speaker 8>I think you're trying to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3274
02:27:08.311 --> 02:27:13.230
<v Speaker 8>I used to be a opposed and now I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 8>favor and I did it for political reasons</v>

3275
02:27:13.231 --> 02:27:14.064
<v Speaker 8>and that's just flat wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So let me just state what I feel like </v>

3276
02:27:15.841 --> 02:27:20.700
<v Speaker 8>you are implying and repudiate it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have a strong record.</v>

3277
02:27:20.730 --> 02:27:25.730
<v Speaker 8>I have a great commitment to this issue </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I am proud of what I've done and the</v>

3278
02:27:26.641 --> 02:27:27.990
<v Speaker 8>progress we're making.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3279
02:27:27.991 --> 02:27:28.824
<v Speaker 8>I'm just saying I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just want to clarify what I was </v>

3280
02:27:30.451 --> 02:27:31.060
<v Speaker 8>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3281
02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:33.750
<v Speaker 8>I was saying that you maybe really </v>
<v Speaker 8>believe this all along,</v>

3282
02:27:33.751 --> 02:27:35.460
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>believed in gay marriage all along,</v>

3283
02:27:35.461 --> 02:27:36.294
<v Speaker 8>but fault for political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 8>America wasn't ready yet and you </v>

3284
02:27:38.521 --> 02:27:39.980
<v Speaker 8>couldn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I was saying.</v>

3285
02:27:39.981 --> 02:27:41.130
<v Speaker 8>No that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3286
02:27:41.250 --> 02:27:42.110
<v Speaker 8>that is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3287
02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:43.193
<v Speaker 8>It really is great.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How long you've supported great gay </v>

3288
02:27:44.971 --> 02:27:46.020
<v Speaker 8>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

3289
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:48.330
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could have supported it sooner.</v>

3290
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:52.380
<v Speaker 8>Well you did it pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It could have been sooner.</v>

3291
02:27:52.930 --> 02:27:53.763
<v Speaker 8>Fair point.</v>

3292
02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we've seen enough,</v>

3293
02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:00.290
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's just a liar.</v>

3294
02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:02.430
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

3295
02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:05.000
<v Speaker 4>that's a liar for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're alive.</v>

3296
02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:06.680
<v Speaker 4>But who is mine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terry Gross.</v>

3297
02:28:06.681 --> 02:28:09.620
<v Speaker 4>She was lying like in that interview was</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was saying that she always,</v>

3298
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:10.543
<v Speaker 4>always supported that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think old people forget that </v>

3299
02:28:13.041 --> 02:28:15.890
<v Speaker 4>there's the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They forget.</v>

3300
02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:19.010
<v Speaker 4>They forget that when they said </v>
<v Speaker 4>something in 2003 there's a videotape of</v>

3301
02:28:19.011 --> 02:28:20.540
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd much rather hear,</v>

3302
02:28:20.541 --> 02:28:21.800
<v Speaker 4>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3303
02:28:21.801 --> 02:28:22.340
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3304
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:23.173
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always,</v>

3305
02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:26.180
<v Speaker 3>I was against it because I didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>America was ready for it.</v>

3306
02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:26.600
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3307
02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:28.560
<v Speaker 6>or that she changed her own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3308
02:28:28.561 --> 02:28:31.040
<v Speaker 6>Changed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just say you changed your mind.</v>

3309
02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:34.010
<v Speaker 6>I hate the term flip flopper right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you can't evolve.</v>

3310
02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:35.870
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's a flip flopper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3311
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.823
<v Speaker 6>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you're the same person you were </v>

3312
02:28:37.551 --> 02:28:38.750
<v Speaker 6>when you were five.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3313
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:41.023
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me tell you where I stand on the </v>

3314
02:28:43.791 --> 02:28:48.240
<v Speaker 6>Santa thing.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3316
02:28:49.521 --> 02:28:51.320
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's the end of the day like,</v>

3317
02:28:51.321 --> 02:28:51.790

<v Speaker 3>So now look what we're faced with.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're faced with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big thing on her is that </v>

3320

<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

3323
02:29:06.491 --> 02:29:08.860
<v Speaker 3>but he at least says he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he admits he's a liar.</v>

3324
02:29:10.510 --> 02:29:11.343
<v Speaker 6>What does he lied about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what's been proven that he's lied </v>

3325
02:29:12.621 --> 02:29:13.700

<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's been something,</v>

3326
02:29:13.701 --> 02:29:16.070
<v Speaker 6>but what has been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes back and forth on everything and</v>

3327

<v Speaker 6>Is Pretty strong in that,</v>

3329
02:29:19.731 --> 02:29:21.500

<v Speaker 6>Maybe that was just an idea.</v>

3331
02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:26.030
<v Speaker 6>So when he says recently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3332
02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:27.650
<v Speaker 6>maybe it was just an idea to put up the </v>
<v Speaker 6>wall.</v>

3333
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:30.690
<v Speaker 6>That was the thing that he sent in a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well now he's in the home.</v>

3334
02:29:30.691 --> 02:29:31.640
<v Speaker 6>These tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3335
02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:33.430
<v Speaker 6>Or at least he's rounding third.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3336
02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 6>he's rounding third.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3337
02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:37.250
<v Speaker 6>And more approved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Donald Trump is a serial liar.</v>

3338
02:29:37.770 --> 02:29:39.200
<v Speaker 6>It's how you what though?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got a hot wife,</v>

3339
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:44.770
<v Speaker 6>so I don't know what to say because I am</v>
<v Speaker 6>a piece of shit.</v>

3340
02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:48.770
<v Speaker 6>Like all man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a piece of shit.</v>

3341
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:54.000
<v Speaker 6>Who's that broad you're with?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They keep one because his wife is hot.</v>

3342
02:29:54.700 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't mind that dame in the White </v>
<v Speaker 6>House.</v>

3343
02:29:56.361 --> 02:29:57.350
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then right now,</v>

3344
02:29:57.370 --> 02:29:59.840
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Laurie Clinton's built like a box.</v>

3345
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:05.960
<v Speaker 3>There are of course look lying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lying politician in linings.</v>

3346
02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:10.340
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a baby are you that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that these people don't lie?</v>

3347
02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Tell me one president other than Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carter,</v>

3348
02:30:13.311 --> 02:30:17.300
<v Speaker 3>perhaps that isn't a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Obama is a lie.</v>

3349
02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:20.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't think Obama is a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do not think he's a liar.</v>

3350
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:21.623
<v Speaker 6>I think that he has changed his position</v>
<v Speaker 6>on some things and I think that he said </v>

3351
02:30:23.941 --> 02:30:24.774
<v Speaker 6>some things before he got into office </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he wasn't really supporting or he </v>

3352
02:30:28.201 --> 02:30:29.820
<v Speaker 6>didn't really support once he got in </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

3353
02:30:29.821 --> 02:30:33.270
<v Speaker 6>But I think he is a remarkable person in</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3354
02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:37.650
<v Speaker 6>As far as guys that have ever run for </v>
<v Speaker 6>president or been present,</v>

3355
02:30:38.130 --> 02:30:38.963
<v Speaker 6>I like listening to him talk and I like </v>
<v Speaker 6>his personality mall more than I think </v>

3356
02:30:42.271 --> 02:30:44.340
<v Speaker 6>anybody that's ever run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been president.</v>

3357
02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:45.193
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And people get mad at me for saying </v>

<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom was,</v>

3359
02:30:46.770 --> 02:30:47.880
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>About what he's talking about?</v>

3360
02:30:47.881 --> 02:30:49.210
<v Speaker 6>Free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ooh Mama,</v>

3361
02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:52.180

<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3364
02:30:55.291 --> 02:30:56.610
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Perfect.</v>

3365
02:30:56.611 --> 02:30:57.444
<v Speaker 6>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

3366
02:30:57.930 --> 02:31:00.270
<v Speaker 6>not even what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not what I'm looking for.</v>

3367
02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:02.490
<v Speaker 6>But right out of all the other people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that have done it,</v>

3368
02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:03.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Remarkably thoughtful and measured,</v>

3370

<v Speaker 6>thoughtful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His speech,</v>

<v Speaker 6>he just gave it a Howard University.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>

3372
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:12.180
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't really listen to it.</v>

3373
02:31:12.310 --> 02:31:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody speaks with such clarity.</v>

3374
02:31:17.860 --> 02:31:18.693
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the rage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't understand the anger and </v>

3375
02:31:21.871 --> 02:31:22.830
<v Speaker 3>the rage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3376
02:31:22.831 --> 02:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>we don't rely on blunt man run this fair</v>
<v Speaker 3>nation,</v>

3377
02:31:25.130 --> 02:31:27.480
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's a Muslim was born </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Kenya.</v>

3378
02:31:27.930 --> 02:31:28.763
<v Speaker 3>Can you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're about to go against those people </v>

3379
02:31:30.961 --> 02:31:33.600
<v Speaker 3>are just going to go to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you go look where he's born.</v>

3380
02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:36.390
<v Speaker 3>You'll know once you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the spot,</v>

3381
02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:39.720
<v Speaker 3>here's a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to miss him.</v>

3382
02:31:39.810 --> 02:31:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he drifts off shore,</v>

3383
02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:44.730
<v Speaker 3>left with one of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be like,</v>

3384
02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:45.593
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when someone was at the helm </v>

3385
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:51.210
<v Speaker 3>who was just at least calm and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

3386
02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:52.413
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing about trump that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>me the most nervous is just knee jerk </v>

3387
02:31:54.901 --> 02:31:57.990
<v Speaker 3>reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just knee jerk reactions,</v>

3388
02:31:57.991 --> 02:32:01.270
<v Speaker 3>which can have real consequences that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw not too long ago with.</v>

3389
02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3390
02:32:03.051 --> 02:32:04.780
<v Speaker 3>The presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3391
02:32:05.160 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 3>trump was a birther,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember he was the birther.</v>

3392
02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another lie.</v>

3393
02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Another calculated lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't tell me he believed that.</v>

3394
02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:16.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't think he believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now why was he saying it?</v>

3395
02:32:16.501 --> 02:32:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was taking him down.</v>

3396
02:32:19.021 --> 02:32:20.940
<v Speaker 3>He was using it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He caught it.</v>

3397
02:32:20.941 --> 02:32:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Caught fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why was he like,</v>

3398
02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:27.060
<v Speaker 3>what was the whole point behind that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he is now?</v>

3399
02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:29.490
<v Speaker 3>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was thinking even back then when</v>

3400
02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:30.720
<v Speaker 3>he was being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a birther,</v>

3401
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:32.250
<v Speaker 3>he was thinking that he was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

3402
02:32:32.251 --> 02:32:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ran before this.</v>

3403
02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:35.760
<v Speaker 3>He did never caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3404
02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he?</v>

3405
02:32:37.261 --> 02:32:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he declared that he was going to,</v>

3406
02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:41.250
<v Speaker 3>that he was going to go and it never </v>
<v Speaker 3>really caught,</v>

3407
02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:44.490
<v Speaker 3>he would always come out at least a </v>
<v Speaker 3>flirt with the idea.</v>

3408
02:32:44.730 --> 02:32:45.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3409
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:47.190
<v Speaker 3>what kind of puzzled me with this one.</v>

3410
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.731
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3411
02:32:47.731 --> 02:32:49.710
<v Speaker 3>he's just doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting some Pr.</v>

3412
02:32:50.010 --> 02:32:50.843
<v Speaker 3>Here's the presidential campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's attaching himself to it and then </v>

3413
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.060
<v Speaker 3>this time it went further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3414
02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try pretty hard in 2000,</v>

3415
02:32:58.501 --> 02:32:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3416
02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so weird.</v>

3417
02:33:00.751 --> 02:33:02.400
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blocked it out.</v>

3418
02:33:02.401 --> 02:33:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Implicit bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say whatever you can.</v>

3419
02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:07.593
<v Speaker 3>The thing about him that really scares </v>
<v Speaker 3>me is that he's the kind of guy that </v>

3420
02:33:10.861 --> 02:33:14.040
<v Speaker 3>takes the bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is very sensitive and takes the bait.</v>

3421
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:16.340
<v Speaker 3>And whenever you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorism,</v>

3422
02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the thing that bushes I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3423
02:33:18.481 --> 02:33:19.314
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama is doing more correctly is he's </v>

3424
02:33:22.771 --> 02:33:23.604
<v Speaker 3>not anything that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't just freak out and say we've </v>

3425
02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:29.790
<v Speaker 3>got to act right because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>

3426
02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:30.653
<v Speaker 3>These are small entities and they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to draw this big power in and </v>

3427
02:33:35.641 --> 02:33:37.020
<v Speaker 3>that's how they diminish your power.</v>

3428
02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:40.230
<v Speaker 3>And Obama's be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3429
02:33:40.290 --> 02:33:41.190
<v Speaker 3>there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3430
02:33:41.191 --> 02:33:44.130
<v Speaker 3>he caught shit for saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of ways that we can die.</v>

3431
02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Terrorism is only one of them and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>small one of them.</v>

3432
02:33:47.610 --> 02:33:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Small way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take the bait,</v>

3433
02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:51.173
<v Speaker 3>diminish their power by not reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump is a guy in every aspect of life </v>

3434
02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:56.753
<v Speaker 3>that he's reacts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's sensitive and freaks out and </v>

3435
02:33:59.491 --> 02:34:01.970
<v Speaker 3>reacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want that kind of,</v>

3436
02:34:01.971 --> 02:34:04.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsettled energy,</v>

3437
02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:09.270
<v Speaker 3>that unsettled person to be in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to,</v>

3438
02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:11.730
<v Speaker 3>that's going to create a frenetic way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

3439
02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:12.803
<v Speaker 3>of being for the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what bothers me the most about </v>

3440
02:34:15.601 --> 02:34:16.860
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good point.</v>

3441
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:23.040
<v Speaker 4>And I think also that the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he represents a standard of behavior.</v>

3442
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did we lose that?</v>

3443
02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:26.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3444
02:34:27.450 --> 02:34:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Say what you will about Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bush.</v>

3445
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Lbj.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They carried themselves like adults.</v>

3446
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They carried themselves.</v>

3447
02:34:35.641 --> 02:34:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Where you they demanded your respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3448
02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:40.073
<v Speaker 4>Obama talks shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm trump rather talk shit about </v>

3449
02:34:42.541 --> 02:34:45.390
<v Speaker 4>people that don't support him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for no reason.</v>

3450
02:34:45.391 --> 02:34:48.360
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things that he did when </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronda Rousey got knocked out,</v>

3451
02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:50.070
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm happy she lost.</v>

3453
02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he tweeted that,</v>

3454
02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.480
<v Speaker 4>that's like a teenage girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3455
02:34:57.540 --> 02:35:01.590
<v Speaker 4>You want a teenage girl to be in control</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the country girl who's like 70.</v>

3456
02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3461
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:19.783
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way he talks to 46 is when he was </v>

<v Speaker 4>born.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like a exciting douche bags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause a lot of Douche bags out there and</v>

<v Speaker 4>they didn't have anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 4>represented them in government.</v>

3520
02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:07.670
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden he's got them </v>

3522
02:38:09.090 --> 02:38:09.923

<v Speaker 4>people who are not purportedly </v>

3523
02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:16.933
<v Speaker 4>douchebags who are intelligent people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government and in the press and </v>

3524
02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:25.250
<v Speaker 4>business leaders who are coming over and</v>

3527
02:38:31.251 --> 02:38:32.960
<v Speaker 4>start rationalizing it and say,</v>

02:39:20.541 --> 02:39:23.000
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing that trump is supporting.</v>

3547
02:39:23.001 --> 02:39:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

3548
02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:26.090
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just bravado.</v>

3549
02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just weird.</v>

3550
02:39:27.261 --> 02:39:28.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this culture that we're,</v>

3551
02:39:28.911 --> 02:39:33.260
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're consuming nonsense all the time.</v>

3552
02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:34.313
<v Speaker 4>We're consuming nonsense in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformers and sitcoms and TV shows </v>

3553
02:39:39.081 --> 02:39:40.020
<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

3554
02:39:40.030 --> 02:39:43.220
<v Speaker 4>we're constantly eating nonsense with </v>
<v Speaker 4>very little substance.</v>

3555
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:48.050
<v Speaker 4>And then this guy comes along who </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents for the first time,</v>

3556
02:39:48.051 --> 02:39:50.880
<v Speaker 4>like a guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did I make America great again?</v>

3557
02:39:50.881 --> 02:39:51.714
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw your fists up in the air and that </v>

3558
02:39:52.881 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 4>kind of rhetoric and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3559
02:39:54.350 --> 02:39:58.310
<v Speaker 4>these guys just hop onto it and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>familiar face from the nonsense.</v>

3560
02:39:58.311 --> 02:39:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3561
02:39:59.870 --> 02:40:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Reality TV's guy that you've listened to</v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

3562
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:04.040
<v Speaker 4>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3563
02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really,</v>

3564
02:40:05.991 --> 02:40:06.824
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real telling thing of where we </v>

3565
02:40:08.001 --> 02:40:08.834
<v Speaker 4>are with the media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how much power does the president </v>

3566
02:40:11.571 --> 02:40:12.404
<v Speaker 4>actually have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little will highlight it once he gets </v>

3567
02:40:14.461 --> 02:40:15.570
<v Speaker 4>into office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

3568
02:40:15.571 --> 02:40:16.980
<v Speaker 4>what would congress and</v>

3569
02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:20.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because look,</v>

3570
02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:21.133
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is arguably one of the greatest </v>

3571
02:40:23.211 --> 02:40:24.044
<v Speaker 3>mistakes in centuries of just all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence of what's happening over there </v>

3572
02:40:28.851 --> 02:40:30.920
<v Speaker 3>to those poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3573
02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:33.980
<v Speaker 3>that happens because that guy is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge.</v>

3574
02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:35.593
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are real global consequences to </v>

3575
02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:40.460
<v Speaker 3>who's ever in that office.</v>

3576
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:41.383
<v Speaker 4>And he's bringing in like real political</v>
<v Speaker 4>masterminds to try to organize his </v>

3577
02:40:44.901 --> 02:40:46.470
<v Speaker 4>campaign from here on out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3578
02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:49.160
<v Speaker 4>So I feel like he got to the dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's essentially,</v>

3579
02:40:49.161 --> 02:40:50.990
<v Speaker 4>they haven't made him the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 4>nominee,</v>

3580
02:40:50.991 --> 02:40:52.340
<v Speaker 4>but there's no one else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3581
02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.380
<v Speaker 4>No one's stepping up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would that happen?</v>

3582
02:40:54.381 --> 02:40:56.930
<v Speaker 4>Like is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a possibility that he could not</v>

3583
02:40:56.931 --> 02:40:58.430
<v Speaker 4>be the nominee?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any way?</v>

3584
02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Not any longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3585
02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:01.580
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3586
02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:05.590
<v Speaker 3>The only car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only curve ball could be that.</v>

3587
02:41:05.591 --> 02:41:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

3588
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:07.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of curve balls.</v>

3589
02:41:07.690 --> 02:41:09.010
<v Speaker 3>There's many curve balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3590
02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:09.963
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a third party candidate could arise and </v>

3591
02:41:12.851 --> 02:41:13.684
<v Speaker 3>say that they're going to go for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was another scary curve ball is that </v>

3592
02:41:17.561 --> 02:41:21.940
<v Speaker 3>it stays the way that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Hillary gets past Bernie and it's,</v>

3593
02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:24.820
<v Speaker 3>it's Hillary and trump and they start </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to battle.</v>

3594
02:41:25.450 --> 02:41:27.340
<v Speaker 3>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3595
02:41:27.610 --> 02:41:28.443
<v Speaker 3>the Bengazi reports and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's being investigated for their </v>

3596
02:41:33.011 --> 02:41:35.470
<v Speaker 3>sailing in the New York Times today that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're holding,</v>

3597
02:41:35.710 --> 02:41:36.543
<v Speaker 3>they're slowing down that process so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she shit comes out about her like </v>

3598
02:41:40.631 --> 02:41:42.580
<v Speaker 3>on the eve of the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3599
02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:43.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3600
02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:45.073
<v Speaker 4>You like that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Republican House who's </v>

3601
02:41:48.111 --> 02:41:48.944
<v Speaker 4>investigating?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're virtually guaranteeing that </v>

3602
02:41:52.101 --> 02:41:52.920
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3603
02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:55.110
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like they have a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3604
02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:56.660
<v Speaker 4>They're going to drop it at the proper </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3605
02:41:56.690 --> 02:41:59.060
<v Speaker 4>It's their one shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just Ben Gazi.</v>

3606
02:41:59.061 --> 02:41:59.894
<v Speaker 4>It's also the email server,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the email and cloud sending classified </v>

3607
02:42:02.931 --> 02:42:04.550
<v Speaker 4>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had Mike Baker on,</v>

3608
02:42:04.551 --> 02:42:08.030
<v Speaker 4>he's a former CIA operative and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty blake blunt about it.</v>

3609
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.990
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3610
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:11.150
<v Speaker 4>if I did what she did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in jail.</v>

3611
02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

3612
02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:15.050
<v Speaker 4>we have top secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>secret clearances,</v>

3613
02:42:15.051 --> 02:42:17.150
<v Speaker 4>all those different levels for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3614
02:42:17.151 --> 02:42:17.984
<v Speaker 4>You're responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take information from those emails that </v>

3615
02:42:20.751 --> 02:42:21.584
<v Speaker 4>are top secret and then just cut and </v>
<v Speaker 4>paste and put them in emails that are </v>

3616
02:42:24.321 --> 02:42:26.210
<v Speaker 4>going through a regular server.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it.</v>

3617
02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:27.103
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that this guy in Romania </v>

3618
02:42:28.971 --> 02:42:29.804
<v Speaker 4>who some hacker character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like reading all her emails like </v>

3619
02:42:32.841 --> 02:42:33.890
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

3620
02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

3621
02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:39.860
<v Speaker 3>so back to your original question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3622
02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:41.240
<v Speaker 3>he could be your president.</v>

3623
02:42:41.350 --> 02:42:42.820
<v Speaker 4>I think he might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on.</v>

3624
02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:45.070
<v Speaker 4>Did you see this got announced </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday?</v>

3625
02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:49.120
<v Speaker 4>What does it take the power back power </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to all over La.</v>

3626
02:42:49.121 --> 02:42:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Yesterday there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3627
02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>posters were posted all around with this</v>

3628
02:42:53.771 --> 02:42:54.604
<v Speaker 4>Hashtag and profits of rage.com</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the website to go to and there's </v>

3629
02:42:57.941 --> 02:43:02.050
<v Speaker 4>just a countdown on this website that </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes to June 1st which I'm not 100% sure</v>

3630
02:43:02.051 --> 02:43:05.190
<v Speaker 4>of is that if that's the date of the RNC</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Cleveland I think.</v>

3631
02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it's pretty close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either way.</v>

3632
02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:08.073
<v Speaker 4>What has been announced I think has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out of the last 24 hours is that </v>

3633
02:43:10.301 --> 02:43:11.680
<v Speaker 4>members of rage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the machine,</v>

02:43:15.521 --> 02:43:16.354
<v Speaker 6>doing some political concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like and concert with the RNC </v>

3637
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:21.970
<v Speaker 6>against the RNC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3638
02:43:21.971 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 6>that's what Reggie gets machine was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing a long time ago.</v>

3639
02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:26.750
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's not the Republicans,</v>

3640
02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:30.190
<v Speaker 6>then it's the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And is Hillary Clinton much better?</v>

3641
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:32.290
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is she much better than him?</v>

3642
02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because of stability.</v>

3643
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not perfect.</v>

3644
02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:39.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a democrat or a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>

3645
02:43:40.100 --> 02:43:45.100

<v Speaker 3>You don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not perfect.</v>

3648
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:55.130
<v Speaker 3>But there's stability and is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want calm uptime.</v>

3649

<v Speaker 3>Gimme calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me people who have been there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>thugs from Atlantic city to be his </v>

3651
02:44:01.191 --> 02:44:02.024

3652
02:44:04.281 --> 02:44:07.040
<v Speaker 3>a 12 year old girl and starts getting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>fights with people.</v>

3653
02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Not the president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Entertaining.</v>

3654

3655
02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:16.780
<v Speaker 6>Well now that he's sort of achieved the </v>
<v Speaker 6>helm of the Republican Party,</v>

3656

<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3660

<v Speaker 6>That's by all means by all accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She kissed his ass and they made it </v>

3661
02:44:29.781 --> 02:44:31.480
<v Speaker 6>about the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3662
02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:33.830
<v Speaker 6>Made it about there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The little relationship together,</v>

3663
02:44:33.831 --> 02:44:35.150
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their interactions together.</v>

3664
02:44:35.151 --> 02:44:37.460
<v Speaker 6>But he's been shitting on our culinary a</v>
<v Speaker 6>hack forever.</v>

3665
02:44:37.461 --> 02:44:39.430
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's what he does believe for who?</v>

3666
02:44:39.431 --> 02:44:41.630
<v Speaker 6>Megan Kelly interview of Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 6>made it clear.</v>

3667
02:44:41.631 --> 02:44:44.140
<v Speaker 6>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the definition of bullying has extended,</v>

3668
02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:47.000
<v Speaker 6>expanded almost to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 6>meaninglessness.</v>

3669
02:44:47.060 --> 02:44:47.893
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It kind of has like whenever someone </v>

3670
02:44:49.581 --> 02:44:51.410
<v Speaker 6>like gets upset at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're a bully.</v>

3671
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:53.120
<v Speaker 6>Now it's a bully,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3672
02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:55.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have power,</v>

3673
02:44:55.850 --> 02:44:58.340
<v Speaker 6>you're a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the most scary to me.</v>

3674
02:44:58.341 --> 02:44:59.210
<v Speaker 6>When he gets calm.</v>

3675
02:44:59.210 --> 02:45:02.580
<v Speaker 6>Like that just starts talking like </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretending to be a grownup.</v>

3676
02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:04.940
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The liquid is saying here,</v>

3677
02:45:04.990 --> 02:45:06.380
<v Speaker 6>all my exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>

3678
02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:09.860
<v Speaker 6>They didn't use the occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Talk about politics or policy.</v>

3679
02:45:09.861 --> 02:45:10.694
<v Speaker 6>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they talked almost exclusively in the </v>

3680
02:45:11.961 --> 02:45:14.480
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] version of the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 6>about bullying.</v>

3681
02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:18.710
<v Speaker 6>What most kids between the age of six </v>
<v Speaker 6>and 16 had been bullied at some point in</v>

3682
02:45:18.711 --> 02:45:19.830
<v Speaker 6>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3683
02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:22.160
<v Speaker 6>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kelly's told trump she paused.</v>

3684
02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:23.660
<v Speaker 6>Were you ever bullied?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3685
02:45:23.661 --> 02:45:27.800
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't trump reply.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I have seen bullying and bullying.</v>

3686
02:45:27.801 --> 02:45:30.500
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't have to be as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just have to be as a child.</v>

3687
02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:31.573
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know people were bullied when they're </v>

3688
02:45:32.241 --> 02:45:36.200
<v Speaker 6>55 it can have when you're 45 Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 6>replied,</v>

3689
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:37.460
<v Speaker 6>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what about 44</v>

3690
02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:40.950
<v Speaker 3>what about talking about opioids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killing Americans.</v>

3691
02:45:40.951 --> 02:45:42.570
<v Speaker 3>How about talking about about </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>

3692
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:44.970
<v Speaker 3>How about talking about how you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take millions,</v>

3693
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.100
<v Speaker 3>11 million people and try and push them </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to Mexico on Day One?</v>

3694
02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:50.560
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was insinuating,</v>

3695
02:45:50.561 --> 02:45:55.420
<v Speaker 6>I guess that she had 45 was being </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullied by trump because of tweets.</v>

3696
02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:00.550
<v Speaker 6>But when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said he continued simply it happens,</v>

3697
02:46:00.551 --> 02:46:02.200
<v Speaker 6>we've got to get over it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fight back,</v>

3698
02:46:02.201 --> 02:46:03.034
<v Speaker 6>do whatever you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it when someone criticizes you and </v>

3699
02:46:05.801 --> 02:46:06.634
<v Speaker 6>then you criticize them and they are a </v>
<v Speaker 6>national newscaster and near a national </v>

3700
02:46:11.901 --> 02:46:13.580
<v Speaker 6>figure too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's bullying?</v>

3701
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:14.660
<v Speaker 6>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where is it?</v>

3702
02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:17.620
<v Speaker 6>Where's that bullying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas that someone who is insulting,</v>

3703
02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:18.573
<v Speaker 6>it's insulting someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bullying is shitting on someone </v>

3704
02:46:20.511 --> 02:46:21.344
<v Speaker 6>bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when does it like that word </v>

3705
02:46:22.701 --> 02:46:27.701
<v Speaker 6>bullying to me is like a bigger person </v>
<v Speaker 6>picking on a smaller person with a small</v>

3706
02:46:27.981 --> 02:46:29.220
<v Speaker 6>person can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3707
02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:30.253
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she clearly has a voice of her own </v>

3708
02:46:32.090 --> 02:46:35.300
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and she clearly is a person of power and</v>

3709
02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:37.100
<v Speaker 6>influence and she's on television.</v>

3710
02:46:37.130 --> 02:46:38.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>

3711
02:46:38.121 --> 02:46:39.920
<v Speaker 4>Even who's bullying who in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario,</v>

3712
02:46:39.921 --> 02:46:41.810
<v Speaker 4>because she is powerful because she has </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3713
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:46.810
<v Speaker 4>she has the media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's powerful because he had the mic.</v>

3714
02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3715
02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:49.430
<v Speaker 6>well she's way more classy about it for </v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

3716
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:50.563
<v Speaker 6>And her criticisms are fairly valid and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all things that she believes need </v>

3717
02:46:54.051 --> 02:46:57.050
<v Speaker 6>to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I don't think she's bullying him,</v>

3718
02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.840
<v Speaker 6>but as he bullying her by insulting her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How's that?</v>

3719
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:02.780
<v Speaker 6>Is that bullying or is it just insult.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3720
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:03.623
<v Speaker 6>Leah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this saying,</v>

3721
02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:07.220
<v Speaker 6>let me ask you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because most American parents are trying</v>

3722
02:47:07.221 --> 02:47:09.650
<v Speaker 6>to raise their kids to not believe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to name,</v>

3723
02:47:09.651 --> 02:47:10.580
<v Speaker 6>call,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not tease,</v>

3724
02:47:10.581 --> 02:47:11.414
<v Speaker 6>not taunt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How can they effectively bring that </v>

3725
02:47:13.641 --> 02:47:15.200
<v Speaker 6>message to the front runner?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3726
02:47:15.201 --> 02:47:18.380
<v Speaker 6>when the front runner for the Republican</v>
<v Speaker 6>nomination does all of those things,</v>

3727
02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:19.641
<v Speaker 6>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3728
02:47:19.641 --> 02:47:20.990
<v Speaker 6>I do it really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3729
02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:24.740
<v Speaker 6>I've been saying during this whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>campaign that I'm a counterpuncher.</v>

3730
02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.760
<v Speaker 6>You understand that I'm responding now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I then respond times may be 10 what?</v>

3731
02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:32.180
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3732
02:47:32.450 --> 02:47:35.360
<v Speaker 6>I respond pretty strongly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in just about all cases,</v>

3733
02:47:35.361 --> 02:47:37.670
<v Speaker 6>I've been responding to what they did to</v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

3734
02:47:37.850 --> 02:47:39.260
<v Speaker 6>So it's not a one way street.</v>

3735
02:47:39.350 --> 02:47:40.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh Huh.</v>

3736
02:47:41.810 --> 02:47:44.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this is brilliance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about all of this instead</v>

3737
02:47:44.871 --> 02:47:46.220
<v Speaker 4>of yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3738
02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:48.840
<v Speaker 4>So crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3739
02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:54.100
<v Speaker 6>So she's essentially painting herself as</v>
<v Speaker 6>a victim and wanting to talk to this guy</v>

3740
02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:55.933
<v Speaker 6>who bullied her and wanting him to </v>
<v Speaker 6>address the idea and concept of </v>

3741
02:47:58.821 --> 02:47:59.654
<v Speaker 6>bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3742
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:01.340
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3743
02:48:01.341 --> 02:48:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a counter puncher.</v>

3744
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fuck you back.</v>

3745
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.581

3747
02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:09.350
<v Speaker 4>He beats the shit out of boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was like,</v>

3748
02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ted Cruz is a nice guy.</v>

3749
02:48:12.830 --> 02:48:13.663
<v Speaker 4>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been acting nice to me for a </v>

3750
02:48:14.601 --> 02:48:16.070
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be his running mate.</v>

3751
02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fat Guy from New Jersey,</v>

3752
02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:20.510
<v Speaker 4>he might go with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:22.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3755
02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:25.393
<v Speaker 4>He told the fat guy from New Jersey that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be the guy in charge of </v>

3756
02:48:28.341 --> 02:48:31.730
<v Speaker 4>his transition team to the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the fat guy in New Jersey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>M's?</v>

3759
02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:36.200
<v Speaker 4>I had two bags of M and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>M's.</v>

3760
02:48:36.201 --> 02:48:38.720
<v Speaker 4>He had a large bag of m and m's in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>small bag of M and.</v>

3761

<v Speaker 4>Like this,</v>

3764
02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:51.240
<v Speaker 4>the way it's packaged and it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>box of m and ms with a small one inside,</v>

02:48:59.031 --> 02:49:01.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the governor of Arizona.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The woman who was yelling at Jan brewer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No fucking way.</v>

3769
02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:07.530

<v Speaker 4>She's way too dumb.</v>

3770
02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 4>She's</v>

3771

<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>

02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:19.650
<v Speaker 3>She just represents scared old people </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in Arizona.</v>

3776
02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:21.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they scooped her up.</v>

3777
02:49:21.481 --> 02:49:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Scare old people is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good group to go for right now.</v>

3778
02:49:26.130 --> 02:49:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Tom Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you worried about the world.</v>

3779
02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:29.720
<v Speaker 3>You're a bright guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thoughtful guy.</v>

3780
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:31.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty optimistic about the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

3781
02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:33.540
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3782
02:49:33.870 --> 02:49:34.703
<v Speaker 3>to the world and with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>election thing with his election to </v>

3783
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:37.854
<v Speaker 3>learn from this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we're going to learn </v>

3784
02:49:39.361 --> 02:49:41.930
<v Speaker 3>from this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we learned from uh,</v>

3785
02:49:42.250 --> 02:49:45.300
<v Speaker 3>the Bush era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we've learned that much.</v>

3786
02:49:45.330 --> 02:49:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going through a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

3787
02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:50.760
<v Speaker 3>a dark time where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that make a lot of noise,</v>

3788
02:49:50.761 --> 02:49:54.770
<v Speaker 3>you have someone thoughtful like Obama </v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants to just have people discussing</v>

3789
02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:55.613
<v Speaker 3>if people embraced and we're able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate with him rather than just block </v>

3790
02:49:58.561 --> 02:49:59.070
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3791
02:49:59.070 --> 02:49:59.903
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't have won all of his things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other side would have been more </v>

3792
02:50:01.621 --> 02:50:04.920
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful as well and we would have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be in the place we are now.</v>

3793
02:50:05.250 --> 02:50:06.083
<v Speaker 3>I think we're in this new media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new way of digesting information </v>

3794
02:50:08.761 --> 02:50:12.210
<v Speaker 3>that's very confusing to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some bad people are taking advantage</v>

3795
02:50:12.211 --> 02:50:13.044
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think ultimately we're going to </v>

3796
02:50:15.601 --> 02:50:19.710
<v Speaker 3>sift through and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and good people and good ideas will come</v>

3797
02:50:19.711 --> 02:50:21.300
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the forefront.</v>

3798
02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:22.223
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty optimistic that that's </v>

3799
02:50:24.001 --> 02:50:24.834
<v Speaker 3>the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heavy evil ways tend to die off and go </v>

3800
02:50:28.951 --> 02:50:30.560
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

3801
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A powerful message from Tom.</v>

3802
02:50:33.661 --> 02:50:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you write more piano.</v>

3803
02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I think people are nicer now than </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've ever been before.</v>

3804
02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:39.713
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the things about it </v>

3805
02:50:40.470 --> 02:50:43.110
<v Speaker 3>is billy discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this discussion is a,</v>

3806
02:50:43.111 --> 02:50:43.944
<v Speaker 3>is an important discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullying is a real problem and it </v>

3807
02:50:46.291 --> 02:50:47.124
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that discussion wouldn't be taken place </v>

3808
02:50:48.930 --> 02:50:50.340
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago.</v>

3809
02:50:50.370 --> 02:50:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Nobody give a fuck about bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like suck it up,</v>

3810
02:50:52.531 --> 02:50:53.760
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all got bullied.</v>

3811
02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:55.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

3812
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean pretty quickly that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3813
02:50:57.330 --> 02:50:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe he said he never </v>
<v Speaker 3>got bullied.</v>

3814
02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:01.920
<v Speaker 3>How'd you never got bullied?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're the bully I guess.</v>

3815
02:51:01.921 --> 02:51:03.870
<v Speaker 3>But he's always been the bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whole light show.</v>

3816
02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:05.333
<v Speaker 3>He needs someone to bully him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet if someone came out and bullied </v>

3817
02:51:07.111 --> 02:51:08.580
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of them Koch brothers,</v>

3818
02:51:09.090 --> 02:51:09.923
<v Speaker 3>that'd be funny.</v>

3819
02:51:10.210 --> 02:51:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to bully him fucking pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Suck my Dick.</v>

3820
02:51:13.941 --> 02:51:17.540
<v Speaker 2>When he owed me a million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we survive up balls on his face in sixth</v>

3821
02:51:17.541 --> 02:51:18.860
<v Speaker 2>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would cry.</v>

3822
02:51:18.861 --> 02:51:19.694
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fuck his hair out and then he starts </v>

3823
02:51:24.801 --> 02:51:28.590
<v Speaker 2>tweeting back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sad exclamation point,</v>

3824
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:31.340
<v Speaker 2>smelling balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit balls.</v>

3825
02:51:31.341 --> 02:51:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Always smelled sad.</v>

3826
02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:35.753
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty optimistic and you know </v>

3827
02:51:36.811 --> 02:51:37.170
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3828
02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:38.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting and I think,</v>

3829
02:51:38.730 --> 02:51:40.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking out of my ass,</v>

3830
02:51:40.681 --> 02:51:41.700
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all are.</v>

3831
02:51:41.850 --> 02:51:43.870
<v Speaker 3>But I do feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3832
02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:46.890
<v Speaker 3>when you travel around and you do your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and stuff,</v>

3833
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:51.000
<v Speaker 3>there's the thing that's lost and all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this discussion is there's,</v>

3834
02:51:51.270 --> 02:51:52.103
<v Speaker 3>there's Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just plain old Americans who </v>

3835
02:51:54.451 --> 02:51:55.284
<v Speaker 3>don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm purely Republican and purely </v>

3836
02:51:57.450 --> 02:51:58.283
<v Speaker 3>Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just screw the other side at all </v>

3837
02:52:00.151 --> 02:52:00.984
<v Speaker 3>costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are just working people that are </v>

3838
02:52:02.701 --> 02:52:04.620
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just Americans.</v>

3839
02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Like what happened to America being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that we're all working towards and</v>

3840
02:52:09.250 --> 02:52:10.083
<v Speaker 3>suss these people out for what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be better for our kids and for the </v>

3841
02:52:12.341 --> 02:52:13.174
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the Internet is going to </v>

3842
02:52:16.090 --> 02:52:16.923
<v Speaker 3>sift through this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what we're seeing really with </v>

3843
02:52:18.731 --> 02:52:23.731
<v Speaker 3>trump in a way is kind of this implosion</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that party because they let the crazy</v>

3844
02:52:24.190 --> 02:52:28.780
<v Speaker 3>tea party right wing part of it devour </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and now they're in chaos.</v>

3845
02:52:29.290 --> 02:52:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's a sign that people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme won't survive.</v>

3846
02:52:34.151 --> 02:52:37.240
<v Speaker 3>They'll kind of devour and devolve into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

3847
02:52:37.270 --> 02:52:38.140
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only that,</v>

3848
02:52:38.170 --> 02:52:39.003
<v Speaker 6>there were people were ganging up to try</v>
<v Speaker 6>to stop trump in the party like Marco </v>

3849
02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:45.723
<v Speaker 6>Rubio and Ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had like this pack they were going </v>

3850
02:52:47.081 --> 02:52:51.700
<v Speaker 6>to like try to figure out a way to stop </v>
<v Speaker 6>trump from moving forward.</v>

3851
02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:52.810
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And trump,</v>

3852
02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:55.150
<v Speaker 6>in my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least if I'm looking at it,</v>

3853
02:52:55.180 --> 02:52:57.730
<v Speaker 6>I think he's looking at this as like an </v>
<v Speaker 6>accomplishment.</v>

3854
02:52:57.910 --> 02:53:00.370
<v Speaker 6>This is Mount Everest to climb to become</v>
<v Speaker 6>the president.</v>

3855
02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.593
<v Speaker 6>Whereas I don't think he's looking at in</v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of really serving the United </v>

3856
02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:07.390
<v Speaker 6>States people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he's that guy.</v>

3857
02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:08.930
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's,</v>

3858
02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:11.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's not why he's so </v>
<v Speaker 6>successful.</v>

3859
02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:14.980
<v Speaker 6>He's so successful because he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he represents his own shit.</v>

3860
02:53:15.250 --> 02:53:17.350
<v Speaker 6>He knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gets it done.</v>

3861
02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:18.213
<v Speaker 3>He's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>egocentric comic who doesn't have much </v>

3862
02:53:20.301 --> 02:53:24.200
<v Speaker 3>of an act but becomes really successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he believes in him so much.</v>

3863
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I know who you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about that guys,</v>

3864
02:53:26.570 --> 02:53:28.760
<v Speaker 3>a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

3865
02:53:28.761 --> 02:53:29.594
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be listening right now when </v>

3866
02:53:30.411 --> 02:53:32.420
<v Speaker 3>there's that narcissistic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3867
02:53:32.450 --> 02:53:37.450
<v Speaker 3>You do become successful because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want it more than anyone wants you to go</v>

3868
02:53:37.821 --> 02:53:38.440
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

3869
02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:39.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We certainly,</v>

3870
02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:41.230
<v Speaker 6>it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3871
02:53:41.231 --> 02:53:44.090
<v Speaker 6>he's showing that he can get so close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3872
02:53:44.290 --> 02:53:46.390
<v Speaker 6>But I don't still know if Hillary can </v>
<v Speaker 6>beat him.</v>

3873
02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:48.033
<v Speaker 6>And Bernie's,</v>

3874
02:53:48.110 --> 02:53:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I know that's kind of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like Bernie?</v>

3875
02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:52.033
<v Speaker 3>I like him as a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I followed him on twitter just because </v>

3876
02:53:54.201 --> 02:53:56.900
<v Speaker 3>he was an independent when he was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>

3877
02:53:57.800 --> 02:53:59.900
<v Speaker 3>He was just like this little rebel from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vermont.</v>

3878
02:53:59.901 --> 02:54:00.734
<v Speaker 3>And he just seemed like a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always loved Vermont and it seemed </v>

3879
02:54:02.691 --> 02:54:03.524
<v Speaker 3>like this free thinking area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked him more of just following him </v>

3880
02:54:06.651 --> 02:54:08.890
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His ideas of,</v>

3881
02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:12.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of socialism and uh,</v>

3882
02:54:12.501 --> 02:54:14.570
<v Speaker 3>and I don't say that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a real,</v>

3883
02:54:14.930 --> 02:54:17.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic socialist is not a scary,</v>

3884
02:54:17.631 --> 02:54:19.940
<v Speaker 3>like mindless thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3885
02:54:19.941 --> 02:54:20.774
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see him being that good of a </v>

3886
02:54:24.231 --> 02:54:26.240
<v Speaker 3>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see him being,</v>

3887
02:54:26.570 --> 02:54:28.640
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is pretty extreme.</v>

3888

3909
02:55:20.661 --> 02:55:23.360
<v Speaker 6>much opposition of the issues.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Just it was not serving me.</v>

3913
02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:31.790
<v Speaker 6>When you want a loss in their boys hair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nails,</v>

3914
02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:33.730
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3915
02:55:33.790 --> 02:55:34.790
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crank it up there.</v>

3916
02:55:34.990 --> 02:55:39.050
<v Speaker 10>Maybe now's the time for me to waive the</v>
<v Speaker 10>voters deck and get rid of the heck,</v>

3917
02:55:39.290 --> 02:55:40.123
<v Speaker 10>but it'll take a lot more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It would take millions of years showing </v>

3918
02:55:42.421 --> 02:55:44.850
<v Speaker 10>up on November the third to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 10>this hex.</v>

3919
02:55:45.570 --> 02:55:48.000
<v Speaker 10>He'd been mind.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The value of the dollar is going down.</v>

3920
02:55:48.030 --> 02:55:50.340
<v Speaker 10>The number of people making less than </v>
<v Speaker 10>$12,000</v>

3921
02:55:50.341 --> 02:55:51.174
<v Speaker 10>is going up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't want to bore you with this </v>

3922
02:55:53.741 --> 02:55:57.840
<v Speaker 10>statement that trickled down,</v>
<v Speaker 10>didn't trickle work.</v>

3923
02:55:58.590 --> 02:56:03.420
<v Speaker 10>We have 19th century century capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 10>and this kind of cree are successful.</v>

3924
02:56:03.421 --> 02:56:07.170
<v Speaker 10>International competitors are practicing</v>
<v Speaker 10>modern day capitalism.</v>

3925
02:56:07.380 --> 02:56:10.620
<v Speaker 10>We need to practice 21st century </v>
<v Speaker 10>capitalism.</v>

3926
02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:11.993
<v Speaker 10>We need an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 10>supportive relationship between </v>

3927
02:56:14.161 --> 02:56:17.430
<v Speaker 10>government and business.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We need longterm thinking.</v>

3928
02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:18.473
<v Speaker 10>We need to target the industries of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>future and make sure they are here and </v>

3929
02:56:23.071 --> 02:56:25.110
<v Speaker 10>the words made in the USA or written </v>
<v Speaker 10>across them.</v>

3930
02:56:25.650 --> 02:56:26.483
<v Speaker 10>We need to have the most rapidly growing</v>
<v Speaker 10>small business society in the world </v>

3931
02:56:30.210 --> 02:56:32.430
<v Speaker 10>because we can create more jobs more </v>
<v Speaker 10>quickly.</v>

3932
02:56:32.431 --> 02:56:34.380
<v Speaker 10>They're all of this can be done.</v>

3933
02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:38.250
<v Speaker 6>Kidnap his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did.</v>

3934
02:56:38.550 --> 02:56:41.580
<v Speaker 6>They threatened to who did some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad people.</v>

3935
02:56:41.930 --> 02:56:43.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those ever here.</v>

3936
02:56:43.141 --> 02:56:43.974
<v Speaker 6>He dropped out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember when he was running for </v>

3937
02:56:45.391 --> 02:56:46.224
<v Speaker 6>president and he dropped out and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>reentered back in late in the race and </v>

3938
02:56:49.591 --> 02:56:50.424
<v Speaker 6>it was too late,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he dropped out based on credible </v>

3939
02:56:53.491 --> 02:56:56.600
<v Speaker 6>threats to the security of his family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3940
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:59.280
<v Speaker 6>those are the days that they could just </v>
<v Speaker 6>scoop your kids up.</v>

3941
02:56:59.310 --> 02:57:00.143
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know back in the 80s they can get </v>

3942
02:57:01.501 --> 02:57:03.720
<v Speaker 6>away with something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get to actually pull it off.</v>

3943
02:57:03.721 --> 02:57:05.730
<v Speaker 6>Was it the eighties or was it the </v>
<v Speaker 6>nineties back then?</v>

3944
02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:07.053
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] 90 I think he ran in </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] 90 but anything pre </v>

3945
02:57:09.510 --> 02:57:11.070
<v Speaker 6>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3946
02:57:11.130 --> 02:57:12.100
<v Speaker 6>let's see what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And He,</v>

3947
02:57:12.210 --> 02:57:13.043
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>1992 campaign Dol Perot says he quit in </v>

3948
02:57:16.171 --> 02:57:21.171
<v Speaker 6>July to thwart g gop dirty tricks </v>
<v Speaker 6>decision July in a matter of a campaign.</v>

3949
02:57:21.271 --> 02:57:22.020
<v Speaker 6>But bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

3950
02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:22.853
<v Speaker 6>had withdrawn hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>President Bush's campaign was scheming </v>

3951
02:57:24.601 --> 02:57:25.434
<v Speaker 6>to smear his daughter with a computer </v>
<v Speaker 6>altered photograph and to disrupt her </v>

3952
02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:29.783
<v Speaker 6>wedding.</v>

3953
02:57:30.030 --> 02:57:30.863
<v Speaker 6>Mr Pro offered no evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I thought it was also worried about </v>

3954
02:57:33.361 --> 02:57:35.880
<v Speaker 6>kidnapping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can't prove any of it today.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I said on tonight's CBS news program,</v>
<v Speaker 6>60 minutes,</v>

3956
02:57:39.540 --> 02:57:40.373

<v Speaker 6>I did not have to take my daughter's </v>

3957
02:57:44.430 --> 02:57:47.460
<v Speaker 6>concerned and a risk I would not take </v>
<v Speaker 6>where my daughter's concerned.</v>

3958
02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:49.470
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows,</v>

<v Speaker 6>it scared him and he's a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was a tough guy.</v>

3961
02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:54.320
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's still alive with,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trump has a little of that,</v>

3966
02:58:00.810 --> 02:58:02.100

<v Speaker 6>Trump is saying,</v>

<v Speaker 6>with a camera pointing at you while </v>

4086
03:02:37.121 --> 03:02:39.670
<v Speaker 6>you're on stage doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're working on some new shit,</v>

4087
03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:43.140
<v Speaker 3>it weirds me out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't care.</v>

4088
03:02:43.230 --> 03:02:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's the regular foot massages?</v>

4091
03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:51.720
<v Speaker 3>What do you do that keeps you so calm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

4092
03:02:51.721 --> 03:02:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I kind of stopped worrying about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

4093
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:54.840
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean,</v>

4094
03:02:54.841 --> 03:02:56.790
<v Speaker 3>everything's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's everywhere.</v>

4095
03:02:56.820 --> 03:02:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to put this special out.</v>

4096
03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:01.200
<v Speaker 3>The day it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids are going to rip it,</v>

4097
03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:02.850
<v Speaker 3>put it around for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>

4098
03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully.</v>

4099
03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:05.033
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you actually want people to steal </v>

4100
03:03:06.511 --> 03:03:07.344
<v Speaker 3>your stuff in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you had a show at the ice </v>

4101
03:03:10.591 --> 03:03:13.650
<v Speaker 3>house and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to record it.</v>

4102
03:03:14.010 --> 03:03:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I would just shift my thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

4103
03:03:15.571 --> 03:03:17.280
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not going to do that one bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

4104
03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll do this other bid or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4105
03:03:21.060 --> 03:03:23.340
<v Speaker 3>The point is that people can see it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

4106
03:03:23.341 --> 03:03:26.550
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who cares if it's on a podcast,</v>

4107
03:03:27.710 --> 03:03:30.280
<v Speaker 6>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess you can look at it that way.</v>

4108
03:03:30.310 --> 03:03:32.710
<v Speaker 6>I always look at it like when you see it</v>
<v Speaker 6>live,</v>

4109
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:35.560
<v Speaker 6>leading up to the filming was special.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a work in progress.</v>

4110
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:36.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

4111
03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:37.613
<v Speaker 6>if you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you could read spoiler alerts </v>

4112
03:03:39.221 --> 03:03:41.140
<v Speaker 6>about game of thrones online if you want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>

4113
03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:42.033
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it'll kind of fuck up the story for </v>

4114
03:03:43.301 --> 03:03:43.790
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4115
03:03:43.790 --> 03:03:48.250
<v Speaker 6>So if you see like bits that are a work </v>
