WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.010
We used to do commercials,
but now we just add them in later.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.820
So we'll just go live and just start talking or we live.
Yeah.
Jeez.

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.120
What was that fucking chaos?
Set some music playing in the background.

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.350
Peter Mcgraw,
sorry.
How are you?
A scholar,
author,

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.600
comedy expert.
Humor code is two out of three.
Two out of three.

6
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.070
Well I'll just let you folks out there.
Um,
figured out which one of the two,

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.430
so you were a,
your book Kuma Code is just a,

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.800
it's all about analyzing comedy and the art of comedy,
where comedy comes from,

9
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:43.770
where humor comes from.
Yes.
No,
it's totally

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.450
good.
Pause guys.
Got Time.
And that's it.
You can get it on Amazon.

11
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.590
Audible book available there is to read it.
No nother one.

12
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.730
God Damn it.
There's a,
there's a fucking,

13
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.720
there's some sort of a trend out there where these publishers won't let authors

14
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.660
read their own book.
I think that's a huge disservice to the authors.
Yeah.

15
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.170
Except for Stephen King.
So we,
so you know,

16
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.560
I co wrote this book and the joke was that we were going to read every other

17
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:16.420
word.
I didn't know her to,
to like make it even.
Right.
Um,
so actually the book,

18
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.810
yeah,
the book's about what makes things funny and it's a,

19
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.790
it's a global expedition.
So I teamed up with a writer,

20
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:26.680
Joel Warner and the books actually told him his voice.
So it's a co written book,

21
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:31.630
but it's Joel sort of narrating what it is that we're going through,

22
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.860
like through his eyes.
Right.

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.100
And then it allows him to make fun of me for like doing dumb things and stuff

24
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:41.020
like that.
But you know who,
um,
who,
uh,
uh,
narrated the book?

25
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.920
Uh,

26
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.920
his name's Peter Brett Golf Burke off he was on animal house.

27
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.250
Really?

28
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.250
There's a scene with Bill Murray where he like a cost one of the caddies and

29
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:57.520
he's like holding a pitchfork up next to his throat and he's telling some story

30
00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.940
and the guy's like looking really scared and awkward.
Bill Murray,
now bill,

31
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.540
Bill Murray was in the scene with the guy who,
who narrated in the book.

32
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.220
I wish Bill Bill Murray wasn't an animal house.
Oh,
what did I say?
I mean,

33
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.820
Caddyshack.
Caddyshack.
Okay.
Yeah,

34
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.230
he did animal house right then you guy.
Okay.
Okay.

35
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.660
Can we use fucking room?
We get that out.
No,
Mr Cosby,

36
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:23.690
we can't ever get anything from this.
Uh,

37
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.170
we studied too soon.
We definitely,
that's,
I think you golf light.

38
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.740
It's good.
Leave this fucking disaster alone.
Oh my God.
It's terrible.

39
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.970
It's terrible.
People are looking at it from a lot of ways,

40
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.730
but the real way to look at it is that how did this happen?

41
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:44.731
How did this guy trick everybody into thinking he was America's wholesome father

42
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.180
and all the while he was drugging rapist.
It's unbelievable.

43
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.170
It's terrifying.

44
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.040
It's terrifying that a guy like that can make it to like 70 whatever the hell he

45
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:57.970
was by doing it.
I mean 70 72 minutes since the 60s apparently.

46
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.250
Well yeah,
I don't,
I have,
I can get in trouble very easily.

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.950
10 years.

48
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.500
So although lately I've got tenure so I can go down some of these paths.

49
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.130
Right.

50
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.110
But here's the thing that is striking to me is like why does he need to do

51
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.370
something like,
like it's not like the man probably didn't have admirers.

52
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.530
Like there's something,
it's scary.
It's very,
you're very right,
you're very right.

53
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.720
That sort of supports a lot of the arguments that women always want to,

54
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.140
uh,
bring up when they talk about rape,
that rape is not about sex,

55
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.450
it's about violence.
It's about control.
That's right.

56
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.140
And when you have a guy like this,
I mean,
what clear.
First of all,

57
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.460
he is so wealthy.

58
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.570
If he wanted to just older prostitutes and have them wait in the hall,

59
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.910
like by the hundreds,
he could do that.
I mean,

60
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.760
he doesn't have to drug people like white.

61
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.810
And I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy having sex with bill Cosby.

62
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.580
They'd be like,
Oh boy,
I got to have sex and bill cosmetic.

63
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.060
Maybe it's just that he has such disdain for people that he just doesn't,

64
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.970
doesn't mind treating them like objects.
Who the fuck knows?

65
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.120
We're just speculating.
Awful.
I think what it does though,
it highlight,

66
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.210
I mean it's the tits,
it's just a terrible,
terrible thing.
But what it highlights,

67
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.463
I think is that the,

68
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.590
the person on stage and the person in the green room can often be different

69
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:17.410
people.

70
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.410
And sometimes the person on stage is a lot nicer and friendlier and warmer and

71
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.310
sometimes the person in the green room is a lot,
um,
a lot nicer,
warmer,

72
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.390
you know what I mean?
Like,
so the idea essentially is that,
that um,

73
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.270
when you see someone you see their public persona,

74
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.410
standup comedian and actor and so on,
that's,

75
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.530
that's a character who may or may not be sort of closely related to the person

76
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.111
who they are like,

77
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:48.130
so I like to take a Gallagher is not at the local neighborhood block party

78
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.010
smashing watermelons and running around.
So you know,

79
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.020
he's like a really nutty conservative.
You ever heard him talk about member?

80
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.230
He's been on radio shows like he's very like fiscally conservative and angry and

81
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:06.190
you know,
that's,
I mean,
there you go.
Right?
And so,
so you see,

82
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.850
you see this happen,
you know,

83
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.090
people sort of talked about comedians having a dark side.
And some of it is,

84
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:15.820
is that the act of being a funny person,
you often go down dark,

85
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.030
dark places and talk about the things that are wrong in the world.

86
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.450
But it's hard to know how dark that person is in the same way that,

87
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.740
that it seems like Cosby flipped it.
Right.
He seemed like the Nice Guy.

88
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:31.741
He would chastise Chris Rock and Richard Pryor for using curse words and yet,

89
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.680
you know,

90
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.120
that's so famous that any Murphy is one of the greatest of all time people
laugh.

91
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.110
Did you get paid?
Tell bill to have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up.

92
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.690
I can just imagine that conversation taking place and she and Eddie Murphy and

93
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.840
Richard Pryor over bill Cosby.
Even that,
it just wouldn't it be great.

94
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:53.170
Kind of fly on the wall for those two hanging out.
Amazing.

95
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.070
I got to open or not open.
I actually get to go on after Richard Pryor

96
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.400
<v 2>for the last shows of his life.
Really?
Yeah.</v>

97
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.020
I mean he might've done a couple more after that that I didn't know about.

98
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.830
But as far as I know,
I,
I work with them the last shows of his life at the,
uh,

99
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.840
at the comedy store.
That's crazy.

100
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.250
And how is it that you had to go after him?

101
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.370
Because the comedy store,
um,

102
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.530
was run by Mitzi shore in Mitzi shore had a really a do or die philosophy.

103
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.710
She had like a gladiator philosophy when it came to comedy.

104
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.920
She would take comics and if she thought that any potential whatsoever,

105
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:34.940
she would shove them against the most damning odds.

106
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.690
Like I used to have to go on after Martin Lawrence when Martin Lawrence was on

107
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.380
Martin and he would do like 45 minutes in the main room and disturb

108
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.720
people have like slept on Martin Lawrence and I don't know how it happened,

109
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.280
but Martin Lawrence for Wa at one point in time he had some issues.

110
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.660
You've got a little crazy and you know,

111
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.510
remember it was like we're in a rubber suit and he got pulled over by the cops

112
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.950
and he had a gun or something.
And remember that when you guys more often

113
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.340
give me the real insight on stand up comedy.
But uh,
yeah,
he had,

114
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.920
he had some sort of a breakdown.
Um,
but uh,
before that,

115
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.070
I mean I think a lot of that is probably stress related just from being such a

116
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:15.260
fucking mega star.
But before that,

117
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.250
he would come to the comedy store and fuck and a straw.

118
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.840
And I used to go on after I eat just giant platters of shit.

119
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.680
I would bomb every time I'd go on after dice clay.

120
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:30.950
I'd go on after anybody who was like,
if there was a big name,

121
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.280
Mitzi would shoved me on right after she,
she likes you.

122
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.200
I mean she believes in you.
Yeah.
It's like sink or swim bitch does it,
you know,

123
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:41.900
you can't get those eight o'clock cushy spots after August Hamilton when

124
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.340
everybody's nice and warmed up and friendly and no one's drunk yet.
No,
no.

125
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:50.090
You're going to go on at 10 45 after,
you know,

126
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:54.740
a guy like Damon Waynes does 45 minutes and destroys.
Um,
anyway,

127
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.420
so I started weight training.
Yeah.
I got scared.
Fight off the audience.
Um,
I,

128
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.380
so I uh,

129
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.860
would go on after prior and they would bring prior to the stage and it would

130
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:04.940
take literally,

131
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.690
I'm not exaggerating at least four or five minutes to get him to the stage.
Okay.

132
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.840
Cause the RS or small room,
the original room.

133
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.170
But you have to start in the back and two guys would have to carry them so

134
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:16.090
they'd have to walk with them.

135
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:20.060
They had a clear of the path and make the path towards the stage larger so that

136
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.440
you can get them through.
And then they would slowly walk him down the aisle.

137
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.530
They'd literally like picking him up,
stepping,
picking him up,

138
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:31.310
stepping in and his body was just gone.
He was severely deteriorated.

139
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.640
Then they would put them on this chair and he would drink and he was on

140
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:37.520
medication.
He was still drinking and they would crank the mica.

141
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.170
<v 3>Sure.
Like</v>

142
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.020
<v 2>Papi,
cause he,</v>

143
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.020
he couldn't talk so you had to make it really loud so he could talk and,

144
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.730
and then you know,

145
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.330
people get really bummed out and then I'd have to go on after him.

146
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.560
It depended on how much time he would do.
Sometimes he'd do like a half an hour,

147
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.980
sometimes he'd only do like 20 minutes.
But you know,

148
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.490
<v 0>you're watching arguably the most influential,</v>

149
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.240
greatest standup comedian of all time.
And this is his,
his last days.

150
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.800
And it was just,
it was hard back.
And watch some of his stuff.

151
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.790
It's,
I,
I was really interested to go back and watch classic.
Yeah.
Stand up.

152
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.990
And the thing about Richard stuff is as opposed to Eddie Murphy stuff,

153
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.240
it holds up really strongly.
Yeah.

154
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.300
In a way that it topically even it,

155
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.000
it would he wonder like what would happen with a guy like that today and the

156
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:32.001
machinery like where would he have gone in terms of television film?

157
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.680
It's a good question along because he's just so,
I mean he's so funny.
Yeah.

158
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.720
And he's so likable in ways that you know,

159
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.280
he was the best,

160
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.880
I think Kinison was probably the best for like a year but overall priors the

161
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:54.150
best cause like I think Lenny Bruce is the most important bill bill already.

162
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.910
They just took himself out of consideration.
Who did bill God,
he's out.

163
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.090
So it's funny,

164
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.830
a just not even like a few months ago bill burr and I were planning on taking a

165
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:08.400
trip to Vegas just to see bill Cosby.
We were,

166
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:10.140
we were plotting it out and we're like,

167
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:13.590
let's just take a weekend off because everybody always raved about how good he

168
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.120
is.
Like I've heard a bunch of comics,
like Chris Rock was raving about it.

169
00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:21.150
Chris Rock was saying that he felt like an amateur after he saw bill Cosby and I

170
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:22.830
watched his special and I was like,
man,

171
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:27.831
I don't know like this seems like fucking like some really like conversational

172
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.710
middle of the road stuff,
not,
you know by any means offensive.

173
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.490
It wasn't that good to me.
I know he was brilliant back in the day.

174
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:39.210
Like you go listen to like that Noah's Ark bit and all that stuff from like way

175
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.940
back when.
But the stuff that I was watching and he was doing recently,

176
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:42.870
I was like,
all right,

177
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.680
we should just go just just because a historical thing and then all this shit

178
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.440
comes out.
Anyway.
Hannibal thinks about all this.

179
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.150
He's probably just fucking hide flaws.
Handball,

180
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:56.550
I'd fucking high because that guy might get you killed.

181
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.570
I mean think about it like how much money does bill Cosby have and how much time

182
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:01.830
does he have left on this planet?

183
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.380
And he's got to connect the fact that this one like really respected standup

184
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.850
comic started calling him a racist or a rapist rather,
and I said racist,

185
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.040
a rapist on stage and then it hit,
I forget where it,

186
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.310
I mean like the next day it showed up online.
Yeah,

187
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.170
but it's taken a little while to pick up.

188
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.960
Well everybody knew about it before then.
This is what,
it's really weird.

189
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:25.950
It's like almost like a volcano that gave you a bunch of warning or options and

190
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:30.870
then spewed because there was stories from way back in the early two thousands

191
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.510
of you know,
improprieties as well.

192
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.790
<v 4>And it was mildly in the news when Hannibal's started talking about it.</v>

193
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.710
That's how he started talking about it in his act.

194
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:42.550
He had done it for a few weeks,
a couple of times here and there.
But yeah,

195
00:11:42.551 --> 00:11:44.980
he just said like,
go Google it.
It's all over the news.

196
00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:47.020
Just no one's paying attention until this happened.

197
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.760
So maybe you could explain this to me as someone who I'd visit La,

198
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.340
I sort of pay attention a little bit to going on here.
Obviously

199
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.310
<v 0>have gotten connected into the comedy scene.
How is it that there are these,
uh,</v>

200
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.740
what is it like dark stories that everybody sort of knows and in Hollywood,

201
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.840
but no one ever talks about outside of that?

202
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.440
I don't think there's that many anymore.
Okay.
You know,
I think things like this,

203
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.850
like this is as dark as it gets.
And this is,

204
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.640
this is an evil crime of the epic proportion.

205
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.640
I mean,
and one that there's going to be no justice,
right?

206
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.190
That's the thing that makes it very,
how can that be?
I mean,

207
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:27.010
even if you put them in jail,
how much time does he have left in his life?

208
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.090
And he lived this like fantastic existence for 70 plus years.

209
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.710
I'm sure right now,
none of that matters to him.
I'm sure right now he is in hell.

210
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.310
And that's one of the weird things about the,
the concept of Karma.
You know,

211
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:41.650
like when you,
you,
you do evil shit to people.

212
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.020
And even if you've got away with it for a long time,

213
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.440
it's probably still creeping away in his insides constantly.

214
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.180
And then when it finally does overtake him like right now and he's just swarmed

215
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:55.630
by allegations,
it must just feel like hell.

216
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.720
It's got to feel like hell.
Speaking of hell,

217
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.800
if someone had told me when we set this up that we were going to be spend the

218
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:07.801
first half of this podcast talking about bill Cosby and the rape allegations,

219
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.840
I never would have believed it.
I never would've believed that either.

220
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.500
I never would have been somebody on Twitter wrote that like for the first time

221
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:16.330
in 40 years Charles Manson is,

222
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:19.930
has having a better week cause me cause Mansik got married.

223
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.810
Yeah it's fucked man.
The the dark side thing.
Yeah.

224
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.780
I want to hear what you have to smile might take on that.
Um,

225
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.350
a lot of comedy comes from people being scared or bullied or making light of

226
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:39.050
situations and that's where they sort of develop their sense of humor,

227
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.400
including mine.
Mine was like sort of a deal.

228
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.280
It came about through a different angle.
But as all sort of the same thing.

229
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.900
And I think a lot of comics were ignored and we're not loved and they developed

230
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.100
this exorbitant need for attention.
It's so powerful.

231
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.010
It makes them want to stand on a stage.
Like they're trying to get it all back.

232
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.610
It's almost like they're trying to seek balance from what they didn't get in

233
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:04.960
their childhood.
That's almost everyone I know.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I,

234
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:08.230
so I buy that.
Like that makes a lot of intuitive sense.

235
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.680
The challenge with that is that that's the same story that people put forth for

236
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:14.650
other artists,

237
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.730
for musicians and for painters and like that they,

238
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.630
that their art arose from this dark sort of place.

239
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:27.170
And it's a way to kind of try to fix things,
try to cope or you know,
kind of be,

240
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.840
um,
to feel positive again.
Um,
and then the other thing is though,

241
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:35.440
there's lots of people who've been bullied and scared and had terrible

242
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:40.210
childhoods who don't become funny.
Right?
So,
so,
I mean,

243
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:44.550
I think that there is something to this notion.
Um,
but I wonder how,

244
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:49.030
how specific it is to comedy and what is it the differentiate someone like you

245
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.070
versus someone who never became funny,

246
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.820
<v 5>like,
you know,
so,
so what,
where's that mechanism?
Cause I,</v>

247
00:14:54.821 --> 00:14:56.300
I that I don't have a good answer too.

248
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:00.710
I have an answer to why people seem messed up who,

249
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.360
who do comedy because most people don't get on stage and tell the world about

250
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:07.180
their problems.
Um,

251
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.730
but there's plenty of people in the audience who were abused as kids and they're

252
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:14.690
alcoholics and are divorced and all these kinds of things.
So it,
so it's an,

253
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.980
it's a really interesting puzzle and it's certainly one that,

254
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.300
that there's a lot of evidence for because you really notice when a seemingly

255
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:29.720
happy comic commit suicide like Robin Williams or you know,
someone Odis,

256
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.690
et Cetera.
And so,

257
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.630
so what is it though that you can point to

258
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.720
that,
that made you go down the path of comedy versus some other path?

259
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.833
<v 2>I can,</v>

260
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.040
I can comment on this in a unique way because there was a lot of other points of

261
00:15:47.041 --> 00:15:50.150
focus that I use to try to distract myself from [inaudible],

262
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.800
from my unhappy childhood that weren't funny at all.
Okay.

263
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.580
I was an artist and I was really heavily in Dilek drawing comic books

264
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.050
and then I became a martial artist and I started fighting from the time I was

265
00:16:01.051 --> 00:16:04.230
like 15 till I was like 21 that's,
that was my entire focus in my life.

266
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.440
So during that time I wasn't funny at all.

267
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.860
And the only people that I would make laugh was like guys in the locker room and

268
00:16:10.861 --> 00:16:15.630
it came out of a,
a fear like we would spar and sparring.

269
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:18.900
Scary cause you know,
you're practicing fighting and a lot of times you're like,

270
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.330
the way to get good is you got to hit each other really hard.

271
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.680
You've got to do it.
Like it's a real fight.

272
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.770
You kind of pull back a little bit sometimes,
but it's just scary as shit.

273
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.870
And oftentimes you're sparring with people you don't know.

274
00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:31.170
And that turns into like an actual fight.
So every sparring session we would do,

275
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.440
especially on Saturdays where this big thing called team training that we do on

276
00:16:34.441 --> 00:16:36.480
Saturday morning.
And I would make everybody laugh.

277
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.560
I would be the guy who'd be like cracking jokes or doing impressions of people,

278
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.370
but I was only doing it because I was scared and I was doing it for them cause I

279
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:45.840
wanted them to pay attention to me.

280
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.240
I think that all the other energy that I put forth into art and into,

281
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.980
um,
into,
um,

282
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:58.010
martial arts was just trying to calm down whatever fucking ridiculous storm was

283
00:16:59.131 --> 00:17:03.300
inside my head because I didn't get enough attention or my life was fucked up
or,

284
00:17:03.301 --> 00:17:04.630
you know,
fill in the blank for whatever it is.

285
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.040
And I think the path of comedy is just a unique path in and of itself because

286
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:16.490
there's so much criticism and analysis and self analysis and judgment by the

287
00:17:16.831 --> 00:17:19.950
audience and then this pressure to produce comedy.

288
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.570
There's so much going on on top of the initial motivation that got you into it.

289
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.520
But I think that path can go to guitar playing that path can go to,

290
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.610
it's just trying to find something that makes you feel special.

291
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.010
And if you,

292
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.400
I mean there's a bunch of people that have that issue in their head and they

293
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:42.660
never figured it out and they've bounced around in normal jobs and never can

294
00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:46.170
keep it together and become drug addicts or alcoholics or you know,

295
00:17:46.171 --> 00:17:50.400
fill in the blank.
But I think it all comes a very similar place

296
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.980
<v 0>and it's really weird that our society that,</v>

297
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.980
that human beings rather are like that.

298
00:17:55.981 --> 00:18:00.090
But if you don't get enough attention at certain ports in your developmental

299
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:04.950
process,
he developed this exorbitant need for an unbalanced need for attention.

300
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.460
And you either learn how to deal with that and learn how to channel it or you

301
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:12.120
don't.
But if you do learn how to channel it,
it's like a massive advantage.

302
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.950
It's like being a crazy attention to whore if you can keep a handle on it.

303
00:18:15.951 --> 00:18:19.710
It's like what an like an engine for motivation.
You have,

304
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.750
I think in some ways you,
you really need that to make it in this business,
right?

305
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.520
It's such,
you know,
standup comedy.
So I,
I gave it a shot.

306
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.280
I actually,
that's what started the humor code project was this journalist,
uh,

307
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.041
said to me,
you know,

308
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:39.480
I want you to come to this open mic night and critique the comedians.

309
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:43.890
Tell me why they're funny or not using your theory.
And in a moment of Hubris,

310
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.160
I said,
well,
I want to get on stage and tell some jokes.

311
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.520
And you can imagine how that went.

312
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.550
It did not go well.
How long did you prepare a,
this is embarrassing.

313
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:58.980
It's embarrassing to say now because I know about the business.

314
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.570
I prepared like 24 hours.
That's better than not at all.

315
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.900
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
I mean,
I understand.
I get it now,
but you know,
when you're,

316
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.020
when you're outside the business,
you don't really understand what goes,

317
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.740
what goes into it.
And then at the end of the book,
at the end of our travels,

318
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:24.330
I got on stage again this time at just for laughs and a real comedy club in

319
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:28.020
Montreal,
in Montreal.
Oh,
okay.
At the comedy nest.
Oh,
okay.

320
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.940
And then to sort of prove,
but I've learned something along the way.
Get laughs.

321
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.810
I did.
Oh,
that's awesome.
I did.
Yeah,
it was good fun.
Yeah,
it was fun.
But uh,

322
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.650
but uh,
where was it going?
Oh,

323
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.170
the idea is that fit to want the attention to want to succeed so badly.

324
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.630
It is necessary.
It's not sufficient,

325
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:50.250
but it's necessary because you face challenges,

326
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.450
you face failure,
the risk of failure all the time,
failure regularly.

327
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.710
And then you just have to do it constantly to be able to get those sort of

328
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:02.450
shining moments that I think helped propel you even further along.
Well,

329
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.480
it's also,
um,
in order to get good,

330
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.570
you have to accept that failure and you have to absorb the pain.

331
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.830
It's a very weird thing,

332
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:14.970
but I find that the more satisfied I am with what I do,

333
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:16.500
the shitty or my product is.

334
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.100
And the more I'm disgusted by everything I do,

335
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:22.800
the better everything is this.
I like,

336
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:27.801
I could have a murderous set where I'm killing for an hour and I'll fuck one set

337
00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:32.490
up of one thing.
And that's all I think about for like days.

338
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.820
So like there's like this intense never satisfied sort of narrative that keeps

339
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:43.220
going on when I'm really working on something and I really get into it.

340
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.200
I'm never satisfied.
Well there's a,
so there's this,

341
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.870
if I could be a professor for a moment,
so there's what's called,

342
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:54.220
we called the negativity bias or negativity dominance and it's essentially the

343
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:58.990
idea that the negative things in the world hold much more sway over our

344
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:03.690
decisions,
our emotions,
our reasoning than positive things.
And it's,

345
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.920
it's part of the reason that that one little element can out shine outweigh and

346
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:14.450
it,
you know,
59 minutes of other good stuff.
And,
um,

347
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.160
I mean,
that makes,
it makes sense from sort of an evolutionary standpoint.

348
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.110
But then when you think about the stakes associated with wanting to become a

349
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:24.850
standup comic,
it,

350
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.390
it actually becomes really rational to pay attention to the,

351
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.070
to those failures because you have to eliminate them or fix them if you want to

352
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:37.150
get that hour special,
that just shines.
Yeah.
You also,

353
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.100
you don't do yourself any good by being happy with your work.
It's fucked up,

354
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:46.120
but it's true.
It's like you,
you,
I mean I'm happy with the results.

355
00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:48.820
Like I know like objectively that was really good,

356
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:51.550
but I there I could go look at my last special,

357
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:54.700
which I think the ones coming out,
it's coming out tonight.
Oh,

358
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.370
why a on comedy central at midnight is a time.
It's the first night,

359
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.830
but I think it's my best one,
but I always think that,

360
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.010
but this one I really do like objectively think it's my best one.

361
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:05.710
I put in way more work into it then my last one,

362
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.950
but I could go back and watch a bit like five times and get crazy and go,

363
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:13.680
what the fuck did I do it like that for like if I just did this or like you

364
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.290
can't,
they can never find like a peaceful moment.

365
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:21.730
And it's because the stakes are so high first of all.
And the,

366
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.290
the impact of it,
like when it's,
when you,
when you get it good,

367
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.600
when you really get it and nail it and,

368
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.780
and the audience is dying laughing and then people go,

369
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.760
that's my all time favorite bit like that.
That is so fun.

370
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.130
Like that is such an important thing to be able to accomplish.
It's so,

371
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.390
and there's only one way to do it.

372
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.920
You got a fucking crawl through glass if you don't crawl to glass,

373
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:48.850
if you don't really look at it for what it is,
it'll never get to that point.

374
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.720
And the only way to,

375
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.230
to look at it like that is you gotta be like super hyper critical.

376
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.020
And if you're hypercritical,
you're going to fucking hate everything.

377
00:22:56.021 --> 00:23:00.110
You're going to everything until you know,
I,
um,
I,

378
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.550
so I did my postdoc with Danny economen,

379
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.630
so he won the Nobel prize in economics for psychological insights into decision

380
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:10.990
making.
And I've worked with him before.

381
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:12.850
I did the post doc when I was a graduate student.

382
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.010
He was in his late sixties at the time.

383
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:19.330
I was in my late twenties and I helped him edit a couple of chapters.

384
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.490
And that guy,
what you just described is him,
he,

385
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.330
he would write a paragraph and I'd be like,
oh,
it was great.
And he goes,
no,
no,
no,

386
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.940
no.
And then he would rewrite it in front of me and we'd taken my 45 minutes and

387
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:35.830
then I like,
oh yeah,
that's better.
I go,
no.

388
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.130
And then he would just write it over again and we would,

389
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.660
so we work on a paragraph for like three hours that I already thought was good

390
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.010
and at the end of it it was great

391
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.090
<v 2>and then we'd just move onto the next paragraph.
And it,
it's just like,</v>

392
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.240
I think that,
that,
that idea of being so obsessed,

393
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.330
obsessed with getting it perfect is what you need to get something near perfect.

394
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.460
Yes.
The only way you really achieve what we want to call greatness.

395
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.500
Ernest Hemingway has this great quote that my friend Ari Shaffir has taped on

396
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:09.740
the front of his laptop,
the first draft on everything.

397
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:13.250
It's shit that's shitty.
First round.
He just,

398
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.970
he puts it right on his laptop,
like right where the,
uh,

399
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:18.650
the thing above the keyboard.

400
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:22.310
So he looks at that every time he writes and it's just,
that's what you gotta do.

401
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:24.920
You gotta write and then you gotta rewrite and then you got to analyze and you

402
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:27.560
got to listen.
Like Brian and I were actually just talking about this last night.

403
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.040
It's fucking hard to listen to yourself.
He's like,
I hate my voice.

404
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:35.120
I fucking hate what I sound like.
I figured it out.
If you put it on double speed,

405
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.070
it sounds a little different.
Like it doesn't sound like that voice.

406
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.750
You tried to hack it,
trying to hack,
listen as long faster.

407
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.220
And you know what you're talking about already said if you listen to double

408
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:47.020
speed,
it's the way to go.

409
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.190
Because that's the problem I have is my voice is so gross.
You know,

410
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.150
you should listen to your voice and fix that shit.

411
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.140
That's what you're supposed to do.

412
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:57.770
You're supposed to do something that doesn't seem gross to you,
but you're like,

413
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.630
oh fuck you.
Reality Changing.
Your voices messed up though.
No,

414
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.670
you just have to or you don't have to change your voice.

415
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.630
You just have to calm down.
Just calm down.
You silly goose.
So,
uh,

416
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:12.440
what's the name of your special?
Uh,
rocky mountain high.
Okay.

417
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.440
So Denver Song John Denver had to I to use it.

418
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.400
Plus I,
I did it in Denver.
Uh,
it was right after the comedy works in Denver.

419
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.750
I decided,
yeah,
it's the best.
I decided to do it at a comedy club,
first of all,

420
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.650
because I wanted to,
because I think that I've been doing in these theaters.

421
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.560
So I had a lot,
a lot of decision making after my last special,

422
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.960
the live of the Tabernacle one I did,
wasn't that happy with it.

423
00:25:35.961 --> 00:25:38.870
I was happy with some bits,
but otherwise I was like,
man,

424
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.050
if I had like more time to work on that,
I could've made that whole thing better.

425
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:43.640
And then I thought about it,
I'm like,
you know,

426
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:48.080
another thing is I don't think that that's the right environment for doing a

427
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:50.090
special,
like on a giant stage.

428
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.330
I'm like when you watch someone in a comedy club and you're in your living room,

429
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:58.280
like you're right there,
you know,
like you feel like panic wide shot.
Exactly.

430
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:02.060
Yeah.
So I didn't want any of that very little shots to the audience.

431
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.670
I just wanted to just focus on the thing like you or someone in the audience,

432
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.620
you're just watching in the audience.
And I'm a Denver is just,

433
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.220
you know,

434
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.510
right now it's just changing so radically because of the marijuana being legal.

435
00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:15.650
It's just bizarre.

436
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.890
The culture is expanding and it's really strange way that every buddy idealized.

437
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:22.880
Like this would be the ideal scenario.

438
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.620
You get $100 million a year in taxes and you know the,
the violent crime drops,

439
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.120
drunk driving drops,
murder rate drops.
But that's actually what's happening.

440
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.570
And it,
you know,
um,
sort of like tons of young people moving there.

441
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:38.400
The tech scene is booming.
Yeah.
It's,

442
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.500
the city's doing very well blowing up and it's going to continue.

443
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.590
It's an amazing,
amazing place.
Colorado's my favorite spot.

444
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.270
I'm stuck here for a little bit.
I'll fucking get back to those mountains.

445
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.250
You just can't beat that view.
That view is insane.
Yeah.

446
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.980
It's a nice place to live.
God Damn.

447
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.720
I don't want to bring everybody to move into your neighborhood.

448
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.460
<v 5>Well,
I,
I own,
so that's okay.
Help.
Uh,</v>

449
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.320
you know what it is.

450
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.400
So here's the thing that I like about Colorado was the thing that I also don't

451
00:27:07.401 --> 00:27:11.060
like about Colorado is that,
so I live in boulder,
so,
you know,

452
00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:15.890
I'm 30 miles north of,
of Denver is it,
it's just such an easy place to live.

453
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.020
It's just things functioned very easily and everybody is very nice and they're

454
00:27:21.021 --> 00:27:25.430
fit and you know,
things run well and so on.
So you could be productive.

455
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.370
You can be creative there,
you can get stuff done,

456
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.350
then you can be healthy doing it.
But I like coming to La.
Um,

457
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.040
although La is a lot harder as you as you know,
but it's also,

458
00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:41.450
there's like this is also a hub in ways that a place like boulder or Denver

459
00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:46.350
can't be,
you know,
there's just,
it's just so the scale is so much bigger and the,

460
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.960
the people that you meet are just doing big things

461
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.330
<v 2>like Adderall.
Yeah.</v>

462
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:55.730
This is a crazy place cause it's supposed to have this many people.

463
00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:59.690
You know what I went to recently?
What really cemented it?
I went to Mexico City.

464
00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.810
Oh yeah.
I was in Mexico City for the UFC.
First of all,

465
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.190
it's like a robot farting in your face 24 hours a day.

466
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.630
That's what Mexico City smells like.
Like it is so polluted.
I have,

467
00:28:11.631 --> 00:28:14.540
I put a photo on my Instagram and people were like,
Holy Shit.

468
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.070
Like when you're flying into Mexico City,
you like,
Whoa,
that's dark.

469
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.560
And it's perpetual gridlock.

470
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.790
So you know how like sometimes in La you get to a greenlight in some assholes,

471
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.270
they drove into the intersection and the light changes and they're stuck there

472
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.010
and everybody honks and you know,

473
00:28:31.011 --> 00:28:33.740
everybody tries to be more courteous and they go around the guy and he goes,

474
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.200
and then you behind them,
she makes sure that you don't do that.

475
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.150
You give yourself a little gap room,
you know,

476
00:28:38.151 --> 00:28:39.500
so like this is why it's about to change.

477
00:28:39.501 --> 00:28:41.560
Let me hover back here so I don't fucking bother them.

478
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.560
They don't ever do that in Mexico.
That shit doesn't happen.

479
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:49.940
So when you're driving at five o'clock there's just jammed up this way and

480
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:54.620
jammed up that way.
There's red,
green,
it doesn't matter.
The light turns green,

481
00:28:54.621 --> 00:28:57.710
you move forward,
little light turns red where they go on,
they're fucking,

482
00:28:57.711 --> 00:28:59.780
they're right there and you're parked in the middle of the intersection.

483
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.200
It's perpetual gridlock with the nicest people.

484
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.700
That's the other thing that was trained.

485
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:08.150
Honking cars are honking and makes very little,
very little.
It's very friendly,

486
00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:11.630
very nice people like there's way more people than the Ryan la,

487
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.810
but everybody's really chill.
Like they're super friendly,

488
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.470
like Mexican people in Mexico City or some of the nicest people I've ever met

489
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.910
and any foreign city.
Like when I first went to,
it's like consistently nice.

490
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.820
That's great.
Yeah.
You know,
and they didn't know me.
There's just,

491
00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:28.550
they were just normal,
nice folks.
But that,

492
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.030
that monster of traffic and gridlock and people is what we're going to expect in

493
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:36.470
La.
It's is going to happen if it,

494
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.640
if it doesn't happen in 20 it'll happen in 50 or a hundred years,
whatever it is.

495
00:29:40.641 --> 00:29:41.980
Like that's inevitable

496
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.540
<v 0>and that's fucking chaos.
Unbelievable chaos.</v>

497
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.980
There's too many people.

498
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.080
I read this thing that La county has more people than all,

499
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.960
like I think 13th it's like if it was a state,

500
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:59.680
it'd be like the 13th largest state or something like that.
Just La County.

501
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:02.770
Just La County.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
Thing like that.
That's,

502
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.070
that's really obscene.
It's enormous.
It's an enormous,

503
00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:08.420
enormous amount of people and it's very strange.
It's like,
um,

504
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.800
he got a wonder like what does everybody here for?
Like how many,

505
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.590
how many of these people are here because of show business?

506
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.530
Like what is the actual number?
Because there's a lot of people that go,

507
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:19.690
well you know,
I'm gonna give it a shot,
go California.

508
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.730
And they have like sort of this like very non committed idea of trying to make

509
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:25.361
it in show business,

510
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:27.670
hoping they make some connections and along the way they quit.

511
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.100
Like I've been a lot of people like that.
Right?

512
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.250
There's a lot of people like that do you mean?
Yeah,
I think a lot of them are in,

513
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.550
in,
in the show business,
but there's so many different kinds of like,

514
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:40.490
I think porn exteriors.
I mean there's so many just people.
Is it very quick?

515
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.060
People in Porn,
extras.

516
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:46.480
That is just the worst example ever born extras.
Hey,

517
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:47.930
we're looking for porn extras.

518
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.310
Yoshi keeps on contacting me to be a coronet actually bro.
Yo,

519
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:55.510
she's fucking crazy.
Why are you pretending like Yoshi is normal?
Like,
oh,

520
00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:58.130
it's normal.
He,
I an example for you.
He's like,

521
00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.920
he says he thinks they want to do it.
He's like,

522
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:02.920
it's $100 and you get to watch porn and you just have to stand in the background

523
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:07.270
whether people will fucking do it.
I'm glad I'll release them to this.

524
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.940
The double speed.
This is,
yeah,

525
00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:14.650
this is the time to fast forward porn extras wouldn't fucking terrible example.

526
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.130
There were,
so there's a,
there's a bit in there though,
right?

527
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.900
Probably porn extra bit.
It's probably a bit in there.
Yeah.
Yeah.

528
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:26.990
My friend was a porn extra,
he was be had to be behind a blow job scene.
We're,

529
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.430
Spiderman was hanging upside down and she was giving him a blowjob upside down

530
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:32.060
and he just was like inches away.

531
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:37.230
Having to just sit there and go wider man against the wall or a web to school.

532
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.080
Yeah.
Okay.
That doesn't,

533
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.840
that doesn't get central casting.
Doesn't send people out for that stuff.
No.

534
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.000
They probably have Zillow,
craigslist things,
probably all nonunion,
you know,

535
00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:51.730
the whole deal.
But,
um,
anyway,

536
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:56.040
back to motivations and standup comedy in this.
Now,
did you,

537
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.370
how did you,
um,

538
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.400
like come to conclusions or extract data when it comes to like know,

539
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:04.783
so I have a,

540
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.890
I have a lab at the University of Colorado called the humor research lab,

541
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.780
the actual lab.
But you wear coats.
We don't,
people always want us to,

542
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.330
you know,
the media.
It was like,
where do you have any lab coats?

543
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:19.530
Any rubber chickens.
Like whenever rappers referred to like their little,

544
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.080
where they write as the lab,
like kid Cuddy,
I want them to wear a lab coat.

545
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.080
You were in the lab,
fucking take this shit to the next level.

546
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:30.340
We thought about it for like,
when we bring in,
um,
participants for subjects,

547
00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:33.720
we thought about wearing lab coats just to make it like for the,

548
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.240
for the subjects to take it more seriously because it's like lab coats say

549
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:39.950
science,
we should get some beakers,
you know,
things like that.
But

550
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.760
<v 5>now we don't do any of that stuff.
Okay.
But,
uh,
but so the,
by the way,
the,</v>

551
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.970
the acronym is hurdle.
So we,

552
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.380
we refer to the human research lab has hurled.
Oh,
okay.
Her role with laughter.

553
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.920
Yes.
And uh,
we,
uh,
so,
so we,

554
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.220
so what we did was sometimes we would run experiments out in the field,

555
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.640
sometimes we'd run experiments back in the laboratory so we'd have an idea,

556
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:05.570
we'd go out and investigate it and then oftentimes with supplement that,

557
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.100
that work in the laboratory or elsewhere.
So.
So you,

558
00:33:09.101 --> 00:33:12.400
you mentioned comedy works as being such a great room.
Uh,

559
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.460
one of the things that we,

560
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.660
that we do in the humor code is investigate what makes a great comedy room.

561
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.270
And we actually tried to construct a,

562
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.140
a comedy club at this art museum that was doing a special event.

563
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:27.890
So we showed comedy clips and we,
we changed aspects of the,

564
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.970
of the room to see if it would actually have an effect in the way that you would

565
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:35.030
expect based on your experience as a comedian.

566
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.440
And sometimes,
you know,
the,
the studies work,
sometimes they don't work,

567
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:43.970
but it served as a nice,
um,
scene by which to talk about.

568
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:45.071
Like,
we don't,

569
00:33:45.071 --> 00:33:49.940
why is it the comedians are especially funny in a comedy club?

570
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.900
Like why,
what helps make a joke land?
What did you come?

571
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:55.880
What were the conclusions?
So,
um,

572
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.970
so one of the things that people always talk about is like having the low

573
00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:02.750
ceiling and how beneficial a low ceiling is.
And so like,
okay,

574
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:05.390
well why is that the case,
you know,
so that they'll say is that,

575
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:10.070
that the laughter will kind of bounce back down onto the audience.

576
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.210
And if you think about it,
what,
what laughter really is,

577
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.130
is a communication tool,
right?
It's a primitive communication tool.
So babies law,

578
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.450
you don't need language to laugh,
right?
Babies laugh monkeys,
chimps,

579
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.650
bonobos receiving even evidence that rats engaged in something akin to laughter.

580
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:32.300
And,
uh,
and what it does is it,
it communicates that this situation,

581
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.520
and this is getting into the theory that we test,
um,

582
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:40.250
the situation that seems wrong is actually okay.
Or what we say is it says,
oh,

583
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:41.750
this is a benign violation.

584
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.370
And when other people are laughing at something that you just said,

585
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:49.790
that might be a little bit off color.
What they're essentially saying is,

586
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.400
oh this is okay to me.
This is positive to me.
Right.

587
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:54.390
And you get these contagious effects.
Right.

588
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:58.130
It's like when some people will laugh after a statement.
That's not funny.

589
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.160
I guess I left the keys in home.
Yeah.

590
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:04.940
So they're trying to let you know I call no.
Yeah,
sorry.

591
00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:08.990
And everyone's saying it's okay.
It's okay.
Yeah,
they're doing right.
Yeah.

592
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:10.280
So there's some lol.

593
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.660
What's interesting about about laughter is that it doesn't necessarily

594
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.890
communicate that,

595
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.580
that something's funny that it's been cooptive by language in a way that like,

596
00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:24.110
so when people punctuate a sentence with laughter,

597
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.160
it's something they often don't even know they're doing and it's just a way to

598
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:32.260
kind of smooth the interaction versus the kind of what,

599
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.850
so that's what's called non dushane laughter,

600
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.890
Non Douchey Dushane Dushane 40 words.

601
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.000
Couldn't you come up with another type of design work?

602
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.570
Is that how it's pronounced?
Yeah.
He has no idea.

603
00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:51.080
You were asking me do not answer Kim questions.
Trust me.
Keep the on.

604
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.890
So
you got sucked in.

605
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.570
I did a lot.
I was like,
I've said that word like 150 times.

606
00:36:03.571 --> 00:36:06.700
Just got red band.
I hadn't fed him Red Van.
So the idea is,

607
00:36:06.701 --> 00:36:08.430
is that you have like friends,
instance smiles,

608
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.880
a smile can be an indication of positive emotion or it could be like a sorority

609
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:16.200
girl,
girl smile.
That's like a fake smile.
The same could happen with laughter.

610
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:16.471
Right?

611
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:20.220
So I could politely laugh at a joke that you have that you've said just because

612
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:25.170
I exactly.
Trying to be nice.
So that doesn't indicate amusement.
Right?

613
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.070
Um,
but when it does like,

614
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.820
so like Ken obviously like most of the laughter that we have is that we've

615
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:35.910
actually enjoying something about a moment in time and,

616
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.150
but when other people are laughing,
it has that contagious effect.

617
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:43.920
So if you think about about laughter's a signaling tool,
it's useful if you want,

618
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.450
if you want to spread that signal out.
And so a low ceiling helps.

619
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.040
It helps get someone laughing who might not necessarily be laughing cause

620
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:56.660
they're just surrounded in laughter.
Right.
That makes sense.
Um,

621
00:36:56.661 --> 00:36:59.800
so one of the things is having a dark room is really important,

622
00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:03.110
is why the comedy store?
I think people really like the dark,
you know,

623
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.590
it's such a dark room.
Yeah.
It,
it disinhibit the audience.

624
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.480
So when you're in darkness,
you feel anonymous.
And,

625
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.850
and again,
if,
cause I believe that that comedy plays on,
on violations,

626
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.010
I'm talking about things that are wrong,
that are threatening,

627
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:24.540
that are amiss in some way.
Well,
most of the time those things aren't funny.

628
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.340
They make us laugh.
They make us,
excuse me.
They make us cry.
The anger us,
they,

629
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.910
they confuse us.
They discussed us and,

630
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.320
and they embarrass us.
And so when you're in,
but when you're in darkness,

631
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:42.090
you can let loose,
you won't hold back a laugh.
Laughter because you're like,
oh,

632
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:45.270
I can't,
I don't want to be the person who laughs at that kind of a joke.

633
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.830
And so it has this disinhibiting effect.
Uh,
some of the other things are like,

634
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:54.600
you know,
chairs having a chair that's,
that's kind of uncomfortable.

635
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.910
You know,
that in you're cramming people in,
it helps increase arousal.
Hmm.

636
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.430
So,
um,
because comedy plays on Arousal,

637
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.690
taking things that are kind of negatively arousing and making them positive.

638
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:09.180
And the,
the more arousing the situation is,

639
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:13.360
the bigger the emotional experience jamming people up together makes them

640
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.540
slightly uncomfortable because they're invading each other's space.
Yeah.

641
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.800
And you're just like more awake and more like uncomfortable.

642
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.150
And then another thing about jamming all these people together is you almost

643
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:28.980
create this bonding among them.
Yeah.
So I've had,

644
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.330
I've had comics talk about this idea of comedy as a conspiracy.
It's like,

645
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.830
it's like us versus them.

646
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.870
<v 0>Like everybody in the room here,
we all get it.
And those fools out there,</v>

647
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:43.870
they don't get it.
And when you're jammed in there with all these people,

648
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:48.760
you feel connected to them in a way that,
that I think often helps.

649
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.190
When you think,
you know what a lot of comics are doing,

650
00:38:51.191 --> 00:38:54.970
he's just pointing out what's wrong with the world.
Um,
and,

651
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.300
and so now we have this bond.
We feel,
um,
we've,
we're highly aroused,

652
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.660
no one falling asleep during a comedy show.

653
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.500
You've got the laughter bouncing back down on people.
You've got the darkness.

654
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:10.501
And then the last thing is you've got the red brick wall behind the comic and

655
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:13.420
this,
I'm not sure how much of an effect this has,

656
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:18.250
but certain colors have that kind of more arousing like a red brick as it like

657
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:21.930
the behind me.
Yeah,
that,
that's a good arousal.

658
00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:26.400
So the red is a more arousing color than blue fruit.
It's like flat red.

659
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.460
Why the brick?
No,
let's just make it like homey.
Is that what the idea is?

660
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.890
I don't know.
I think it's just,
there's just no,
it's not brick per se.

661
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.170
I don't know if there's anything about the bridge.

662
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.650
There's so many comedy clubs bring now.
Every improv has bricks.

663
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.560
They all have bricks.
Even if they don't have bricks,
they bring bricks in.

664
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.530
I think it's the red more than the brick,
although that's an interesting,

665
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:48.910
I could run that study.
Yeah,
I'm thinking about it.
I actually,

666
00:39:48.911 --> 00:39:52.840
I paid to have these bricks put in.
These aren't even real bricks,
is that right?

667
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.560
Yeah.
The knee,
like that thing.
It's a veneer.
There's like,
why are they put down?

668
00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:57.760
They,
they,
they do it.

669
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:02.140
But it makes me feel better while you're doing something real bricks,

670
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.760
but it's not all brick construction.

671
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.740
Like it's not going to stop the hulk from running through the wall.

672
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.780
I don't know why I said the hallway.
He's not real my point.

673
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:14.020
Don't think real brick stopped the whole no.
My point being,
I was wondering why,

674
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.690
um,
I think everything you said makes a lot of sense.

675
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:20.200
And one thing that I didn't even consider as the uncomfortable factor because is

676
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.500
a place called the Haha cafe that I love.
It's in north Hollywood,
great spot.

677
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.230
But they have couches in the front.
Uh,

678
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.840
people just like just lounge on the couch.

679
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.140
Now I'm thinking about it and I need them to listen to this podcast.

680
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:34.960
Like ditch the couches,
Kim,
some shitty fucking folding chairs,

681
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.960
slide them in there.
So the other one is that,
and this,

682
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:41.590
I haven't done the research on it,
but I believe it's the case.

683
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.290
It doesn't happen to comedy clubs that much,

684
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:46.120
but it happens like late night television.

685
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.340
You get those like freezing cold rooms.

686
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:53.490
Like Letterman is famous for like a 54 degree room or something like that.

687
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.400
And what you hear is people say,
oh,

688
00:40:56.401 --> 00:40:58.210
it's because of the lights and the people are,
you know,

689
00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:01.540
they're in these suits and they want to just keep it cold.
But I think it's also,

690
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:04.300
again,
it keeps the audience away because you're not gonna,

691
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:09.340
you're not going to nap when it's like 54 degrees,
you're,
you know,

692
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:12.190
you're uncomfortable in your,
you're awake.
Yeah.

693
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:15.160
I think he's dead right about that.
That totally makes sense as well.

694
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:18.700
I think another thing to take into consideration,
I don't know if you did,
um,

695
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.980
is that part of comedy?

696
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:25.540
Part of what's going on is it's like some sort of a mass hypnosis sort of a

697
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:29.620
thing when a guy's on stage and you really in the zone,
like he just,

698
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:32.770
he got your material like laid out and it's just,

699
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.610
you're just riding this fucking thing and the crowd is roaring and laughing

700
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:40.640
along with you.
There's,
they're letting you think for them almost.

701
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.990
It's like they're allowing you to have access to the wheel of their mind and you

702
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:48.290
take them on this crazy comedic journey.
And in that sense,

703
00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:51.020
it's kind of like a mass hypnosis in a way.

704
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.190
And the smaller the area that you're doing this,

705
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:59.180
the more comfortable people are gonna feel allowing themselves to be taken away

706
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:01.040
like this.
Like when you have low ceilings,

707
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:03.920
the parameters are like very clearly defined.
Like there's a ceiling,

708
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.530
there's the floor,
here's the wall,
this is a small place.

709
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.970
But when you get a big place,

710
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:11.120
like when you're doing like our Madison Square Garden or an arena or someplace

711
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:13.390
with a giant ceiling,
people would say,
well,
I've got,

712
00:42:13.391 --> 00:42:15.720
it's not a good place for comedy.
The laughs die,
wait,

713
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:20.720
this is a little bit of that.
But it's also like,
you know,
there's a lot above us.

714
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.260
There's a lot,
there's a lot of space here.
It's less comforting.
It's like,

715
00:42:24.261 --> 00:42:25.880
it's less,
uh,

716
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.940
less contained than like say a place like the helium in Philadelphia where Joey

717
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.050
Diaz is this weekend.
Uh,
helium is one of the great comedy clubs in this country.

718
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:38.840
So it really low ceiling tight.
It's in,
you know,

719
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:42.710
this great neighborhood and it's just perfect.
Like you couldn't get any better.

720
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:45.950
It's like you're right on top of those people.
Like everything's the,

721
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:50.480
the entire dimension.
The dimension of the room are clearly defined.
Yeah.
I think,

722
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:51.314
um,
I,

723
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.320
I've called Madison Square Garden to have him let me run a study there and uh,

724
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.030
I haven't heard back from him yet,
so we'll see.
And I'll get right back to you.

725
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.190
I'm sure they're not busy on one free night this fall,
I think.
Um,

726
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.280
but it's very rare to see a comedian performed there though.
Oh,
I think it's,

727
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:14.930
yeah.
I mean these are,
cs is doing it.
They're,
Aziz has a gig there and I think,

728
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:19.160
um,
it actually might already had it.
Dane's done it.
Dice has done it.

729
00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.020
I think there's only a small handful and it helps to have a lot of fans.
Right.

730
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:26.120
I think that those arena kinds of things,

731
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.430
these are people who already love that comedian and they're going to see them

732
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.600
help.
So it's also an event.
Yeah.
You know,
like,
uh,

733
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.450
if I give Kevin Hart showing up somewhere,
he's hot right now.
So that's an event.

734
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.000
We're going to go see Kevin Hart,
people at work,
even if they're not fans.

735
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.550
You guys get tickets for Kevin Hart herders.
Hilarious.
You know what I mean?

736
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:47.390
It's like such a big name thereof becomes an event.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

737
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.051
I think.
Well,

738
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:51.800
so the takeaway of all of this is I think you made a great choice for,

739
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.520
for rocky mountain high.
Oh,
Denver comedy works.
Yeah.
It's,
I mean,

740
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.480
every comedian I speak to talks about how that's in the top five.
Yeah.

741
00:43:59.481 --> 00:44:01.880
Well Wendy,
who the woman who owns it and runs it,

742
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:06.410
he's like one of my favorite people ever and she's responsible essentially for

743
00:44:06.411 --> 00:44:10.250
the entire comedy scene in Denver.
And she's,
she's,
she fosters it.

744
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:14.360
She developed this open mic program,
which brings people into,
into the club,

745
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:15.290
gives them time,

746
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:17.750
then make some like their middles and then they eventually she liked,

747
00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:19.220
develops local headliners.

748
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:23.090
It's one of the few places left that has local headliners.
Oh,
that's nice.
Yeah.

749
00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:26.300
I know the,
you know the graphics guys there,
they have a,

750
00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:29.540
there's like a three man crew.
They do what?
They do their own show.

751
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:33.150
But they always are showing up at comedy.
No,
I don't know them.
Ben,
Roy,
Adam,

752
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:37.650
Kate and Holland.
Andrew orbital.
No,
no,
no.
You know like that.
Those are,

753
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.120
those are sort of,
yeah.
Now they're,
you know,
they're on the cusp.

754
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.920
This is a real scene there.
You know,

755
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.320
Denver is one of the few places that has a real scene.
That's what it takes.

756
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:47.460
It takes like a club.

757
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.240
And we've often talked about Houston because Houston is where Bill Hicks
started.

758
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:53.190
Where Sam Kinison started,
excuse me.

759
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:56.220
Houston in the early eighties was a motherfucker.

760
00:44:56.221 --> 00:44:59.070
I mean it was a hotbed of talent but it was because of one club.

761
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.130
It's cause of the laptop,
laptop and river oaks.
And when that,

762
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:07.020
that's where I recorded my first ever CD in 1999 it was the first place I ever

763
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.050
like did well like on the road,
not did well.
It got laughs,

764
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:11.460
but like it would sell out every show.

765
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.460
And it was because they were like looking for that kind of comedy.

766
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:19.340
Like they had had,
you know,
Kinison started there and Carl Lebow,
the outlaws,

767
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.650
a comedy,
all those guys came out of Houston.
But when that club went away,

768
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.270
the scene went away.
Yeah.
You did any of those things.
So we,
for the humor code,

769
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:32.210
we,
we came to La to look at standup and Improv.
Um,

770
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.280
and we actually went to,

771
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.190
we went to New York and looked at the New Yorker cartoons.
Um,
so we,

772
00:45:38.191 --> 00:45:42.600
and we,
um,
and also like humor and Madison Avenue and all that kind of stuff.

773
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.190
And then,
um,
we,
we actually went to Tanzania,

774
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.360
we went to Japan,
we went to the West Bank,
we went to Palestine,
Scandinavia,

775
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:54.510
the Amazon.
And what's interesting is,

776
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.050
I don't want to say standup is uniquely American cars.
Like in Japan,

777
00:45:58.051 --> 00:46:03.000
they have like a vibrant comedy scene,
but it's,
it's different.

778
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.500
And so in Japan for instance,

779
00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:09.501
they have two man comedy is called [inaudible] and it's like Dean and Martin

780
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.140
style stuff like an Abbott and Costello kind of a thing.

781
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.970
And they don't really have the comedy club,

782
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:19.410
like the independent comedy club scene.
It's all corporate in Japan for instance.

783
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.850
And uh,
you know,
it can in a lot of places,
like obviously in the Amazon,

784
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:27.160
there's like comedy clubs,
you know,
it's like,
it's such an interesting,
I mean is,

785
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.800
is it really does have,
have,
has had its start in the United States.

786
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:32.731
You know,

787
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:37.470
Wendy had this great conversation with a large chain that was trying to set up

788
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.990
in Denver.
Um,
and uh,

789
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.570
they wanted to talk to her about getting involved and she said,

790
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.680
what's your strategy as far as open Miker hers an open mic nights.
She was,

791
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:50.130
we're not going to have open Mike Nights.
She's like,
okay,
let me get this train.

792
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.030
You want to sell widgets,
but you don't want to make your own widgets,

793
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.510
but you're selling widgets but you don't develop widgets at all.

794
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.430
You know what I mean?
Any resources and developing,

795
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:03.030
which see other people have to bring you the widgets and they're like,
oh,

796
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:07.500
we didn't see it that way.
Right.
Know these,
like places like the Improv,

797
00:47:07.501 --> 00:47:10.020
I do a lot of the Improv's,
but they don't do open mic nights.

798
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.340
And I think that's a huge disservice to the art form.
And to them it's just,

799
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:14.850
they don't,

800
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.320
they see it shortsightedly they see that as being a detriment to their business

801
00:47:19.321 --> 00:47:22.830
because they're going to have to pay the wait staff and they might even lose

802
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:25.890
money on that night.
But I think that's how you develop talent.

803
00:47:25.891 --> 00:47:26.820
And if you don't do that,

804
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.550
you don't develop talent and a scene and you get more people invested in the

805
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:33.850
idea standup comedy,
especially if you have like a local headliner guy,

806
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.050
it's really good people like really get involved in like someone who's like a

807
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:42.970
local person who's like really good [inaudible] who they think has potential to,

808
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.960
you know,
to break free or break it when it with a comb,
break in,

809
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:51.790
break out.
Yeah.
You know what I,
I,
I say how every,

810
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.210
every city has a rap star.
Hmm.
Right?

811
00:47:55.211 --> 00:48:00.211
So should you go off to la or New York and try to create your fame and fortune

812
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.710
or do you become the best person in that city?
And so,
and I think of like,

813
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.820
I think of rap in that way.
Like you know,
so if you think about every major city,

814
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:11.290
not every but a lot of major cities,

815
00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:16.291
you can identify who is the best and then they use that city as a leaping off

816
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:19.750
point for a more national scene and international scene.
And so on.

817
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.150
Wrap is very different than comedy though.
No,
no,
no.
But I mean,

818
00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:26.350
but just as an analogy,
right?
The idea that you,

819
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.590
where is it that you should develop your craft?

820
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.920
When is it that you're ready to go to one of the coasts?

821
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:37.950
Like it sounds to me that if you have a good club of reasonable goal would be to

822
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:42.550
become the headliner,
lo local headliner,

823
00:48:42.551 --> 00:48:47.440
add that club and then try to break into the business more broadly.

824
00:48:47.441 --> 00:48:52.330
Like you know,
whether it be television or film or,
or go out on the road.
Yeah,

825
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.770
no,
you're just,
you,
you seem to be around other comics that kick ass.

826
00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.250
It's a super important,
it's important every step of the way.

827
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.420
It needed to be around them hanging out and he'd be around them going onstage.

828
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.810
We feed off of each other.

829
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.590
We feed off of each other in a way that I don't think wrappers,
I mean,

830
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:09.251
I might be wrong,

831
00:49:09.251 --> 00:49:13.330
but I don't think they have to as much because they can kind of judge themselves

832
00:49:13.331 --> 00:49:18.150
on the little long history of rap nation wide and all of these places.
Well,
I,

833
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.160
yeah,
I mean I'm sure the development of the craft,
but the idea,

834
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.840
I guess the question is this is if you were a good comic and you wanted to get

835
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:30.720
great and you were going to prescribe a route for,
for one,
would you say,

836
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.390
looks,
you know,
stay in Denver and,

837
00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.480
and be the best the Denver can offer and then do it.

838
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:41.020
Or when you think you're ready to head off to New York,

839
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.110
this is my advice and this is very general.

840
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.540
It could vary depending upon circumstances,

841
00:49:46.541 --> 00:49:50.710
but I think you should get a general proficiency in a place where can get some

842
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:55.630
stage time.
Okay.
Like a Denver or Portland or a place.
It's a smaller place.

843
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.440
Yeah.
Get a general proficiency where you,
you know,
you're a general,

844
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.290
you're essentially a professional.
You can do a half an hour.
Okay.

845
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.250
Then get the fuck out of there.
Okay.
Well I get out of,

846
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:08.150
I've got to go to la or New York because you gotta be around beasts.
You got to,

847
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.680
you got to see bill Byrd drop in to the comedy store in a Tuesday night and do

848
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:12.461
15 minutes.

849
00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:16.300
You've got to see Joey Diaz go up in the original room at 11 o'clock and murder

850
00:50:16.301 --> 00:50:20.370
the place.
You got to see those guys.
You gotta be around them,
you gotta,

851
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.520
you gotta.
There's a,

852
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:25.190
there's a certain inspirational heat that you get from being around a,

853
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.780
a crew of Comedians that takes your act to the next level almost universally.

854
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:34.640
So I,
I can,
I can see that.
It's hard to argue against that,
but if you're,

855
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.860
but you need to get the stage time right.

856
00:50:36.861 --> 00:50:40.670
So it's this balance and if you're in Austin or Portland or Denver,

857
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:43.190
you do have great comics coming through all the time.

858
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.140
So you can get that sort of,
you know,

859
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:48.410
you can watch them do weekend sets that definitely,
and they do drop it,

860
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.760
but you won't see them working on material.
Yeah,
I see.

861
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.040
Seeing them working on material and when you know something's absolutely new,

862
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:58.870
there's like this spark of excitement that everybody has in the room,
like safe.

863
00:50:58.871 --> 00:51:02.630
An event goes on,
like something happens in the news and then you know,

864
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:05.540
someone like Chris Rock will show up and start talking about that event.

865
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.000
It's like a certain crackle to that.

866
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.590
It's not the only thing that's necessary for success as a comedian.
Me,

867
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.810
you could absolutely be a guy who lives in Boise and goes on the road and does

868
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:15.620
great,

869
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.060
but there's something about being around a lot of really funny comedians that

870
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.860
has,
uh,
this undeniably inspirational effect.
Yeah,

871
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.740
I understand.
I mean,
I'm,
I,
I'm interested,

872
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:30.680
we were sort of were talking a little bit about this idea of like achievement,

873
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:35.240
right?
So what is it that predicts success in this very difficult business?

874
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.590
I'm certainly not,
I don't,
there's no hard,
fast answer.
There's no black or white,

875
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.800
you know,
I'm just saying from my point of view,
what I would advise,

876
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.880
and it's maybe my style and strategy is incorrect for some people.

877
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:49.250
I mean it would depend.
I would have to really know the person,

878
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.650
but some guys are fine.
Like living in Austin,

879
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:56.651
they develop a good little following and now because of the Internet you can get

880
00:51:56.691 --> 00:52:00.650
a following just from a youtube video and then start touring nationally.

881
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.790
I think that's his,
that's essential as well.
I think touring is a,

882
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:09.350
another essential,
um,
developmental developmental tool for a comic.

883
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.100
Because I think one of the things about being a comic is you want to get the

884
00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:14.810
most varied input possible.

885
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.030
If you're doing the same club all the time at the same kind of audience

886
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:23.030
preaching to the choir and you know the people that happened a lot in Boston,

887
00:52:23.031 --> 00:52:27.830
in Boston,
a lot of the local guys,
they became really proficient and really good.

888
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:32.030
Boston people laugh.
Yes,
yes.

889
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.070
It was a huge trap.

890
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:37.100
And then they would go to other places and it would be like they were hamstrung.

891
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.340
Like someone had just like hit him in the kneecaps,
the baseball bat,

892
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:43.400
like they couldn't run anymore.
It was crazy to watch.
I see.

893
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.420
And that's exactly what it is.
It's not doing the road enough.

894
00:52:47.421 --> 00:52:52.421
You have to develop an act that that is yours and then it's uniquely your,

895
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.230
you know,
your take on things.

896
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:59.360
But it also has your take on things is like a conglomeration of all the

897
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:02.510
experiences that you've had in your life and the more experiences that you have,

898
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:05.120
especially as a comic on stage in different places.

899
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.810
The more it flavors your performance and how you do it.
Yeah,
I think that's,

900
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:12.890
you know,
so people talk about this sort of 10 year rule,
you know,

901
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:16.600
that it takes 10 years to get your voice.
And um,
there,
you know,

902
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.790
obviously there's exceptions,
but you know,

903
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.010
I think some of it is just like you need the practice,

904
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:26.160
but some of that 10 years is you just come to better understand

905
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.600
<v 5>the world.
Yeah.
Right.
And so,
so when you're 22 years old,</v>

906
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.130
you,
you can be a funny person,
but it's,
but you haven't,
you know,

907
00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.260
having to learn all the mechanics and all that kind of stuff.

908
00:53:37.261 --> 00:53:39.090
You don't have enough material,

909
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.360
but some of it is you just don't really understand the world in the way that you

910
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:45.750
do when you're 32 or 42.
And,
um,

911
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.440
and what you're suggesting there was the more experience you have out on the

912
00:53:49.441 --> 00:53:52.950
road understanding what people in Oklahoma find funny,

913
00:53:52.951 --> 00:53:54.720
what people in Minnesota find funny,

914
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.900
what their lives are like and in Texas and Alabama and Atlanta ends up being

915
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:02.340
very useful because,
you know,

916
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:06.210
I mean I've been to the clubs in New York and La with the kind of like hipster,

917
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:11.760
you know,
audiences,
the all crowds.
Yeah.
And it's,
you know,
you know,

918
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:16.590
it's fun comedy but it's not going to go very far if you're interested in going

919
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:17.160
far.

920
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.910
<v 0>Well it's,
it's a very specialized form of comedy.</v>

921
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:24.270
Like you're the cool guy in the room,
you know,

922
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:27.750
and the cool guy in the back of the room recognizes the cool guy in the room and

923
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.610
you know,
you're pushing a lot of progressive issues that,
you know,

924
00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:36.010
are very debate,
debatable in other parts of the country.
But you know,

925
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:40.080
you're just getting like a raucous round of applause and appreciation for what

926
00:54:40.081 --> 00:54:40.890
you're saying.

927
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:43.680
And then you feed off of that and then you become like super captain,

928
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:48.390
lefty and you going on stage with the Fedora on talking about being a feminist

929
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:51.090
and you know it's a lot of what they're doing is just,
you know,

930
00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:53.460
that's their spot.
They're doing Boston comedy,

931
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:56.610
they're just doing it in Brooklyn and some hipster spot.
You know what I mean?

932
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:58.310
Like by saying Boston comedy,
I mean,

933
00:54:58.311 --> 00:55:03.311
I mean they're doing like a specific style of comedy that maybe they like or

934
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:07.860
maybe works well and their area.
And then there's nothing wrong with doing that.

935
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:09.810
I mean,
you could do that.
That could be your thing.

936
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:11.010
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

937
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.280
But I think that one of the great things about being a comic is going to all

938
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:20.070
these weird places and you know,
doing standup in Alaska,

939
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.540
doing stand up in Florida,

940
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.840
doing stand up all over the place and experiencing all these weird things and

941
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:29.010
weird crowds and weird situations.
If you just did comedy only in Brooklyn,

942
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:32.730
I think you're going to get a very limited perspective.

943
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.210
You're going to get a very,
your,

944
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.990
your art's not going to reach its full potential,
if that makes any sense.

945
00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.520
Pretentious calling it art.

946
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:43.580
<v 5>No,
no,
no.
I actually,
well I think,
I think it can be art.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,</v>

947
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:47.030
um,
you know,
fart jokes aren't artistic though.

948
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:51.290
They might get laughs cause you can make laughs and change the way people see

949
00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:56.291
the world or if the fart jokes is so fucking good that it literally transcends

950
00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:01.540
the fart joke genre and it becomes art that's possible right now.

951
00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.670
Send me an email when that happens.
I'd like to,
but I'm going to put,

952
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.100
I'll start paying attention.
But um,
so you know,
actually,

953
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:14.390
but for the humor code,
that's exactly the perspective that we took.

954
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.320
So one of the things that we did was say,
and this is no offense to you,
we said,

955
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.100
well,
um,
humorous,
not just stand up.
Stand up is a,

956
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:27.040
is a bizarre art form.
You know,
that,
that it,

957
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.830
it seems like the quintessential thing that you should look at.

958
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:35.250
But most of our laughs don't come from a guy on a stage with a mic.

959
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:37.600
And a fedora.
It's from,
you know,
our,

960
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:42.660
our own interactions with our friends and our family and strangers and watching

961
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:45.790
television,
watching film and,
you know,
like seeing,

962
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.530
seeing the world more broadly.
And,
and then also,
um,

963
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.070
it's such a complex topic.
We were like,
oh,

964
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:56.320
we can't just look at it in the United States.
We can't be.

965
00:56:56.321 --> 00:57:01.321
So I'm so focused on the u s and that's what pushed us to go out and look at

966
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:02.884
this.
Like,
so we,

967
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.900
we went to the West Bank and hung out with this comedy satire troop.
Whoa.

968
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.490
Who has a television show that it's,
it's once a week,

969
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:15.880
but during Ramadan it's every single night for 30 nights.

970
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:21.940
And so,
whoa.
Um,
yeah.
And so like,
we hung out with these folks.
Like,

971
00:57:21.941 --> 00:57:25.690
so these are people who are there living in the West Bank and they're

972
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:29.770
criticizing everyone.
So they're criticizing the Palestinians,
Israel,

973
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.270
the Israelis,
the Americans,
Barack.
Um,

974
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:39.520
wow.
Uh,
you know,
like Osama and Obama in the same sketch,
right?

975
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:39.971
Like the,
you know,

976
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:44.800
these guys are doing really cutting edge stuff in this place that there,

977
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.300
there aren't comedy clubs like your,

978
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.960
the way that you get professional comedy,

979
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:55.530
there's like two shows on Palestinian national television or you need to find it

980
00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:00.430
broadcast from Egypt or from Jordan or,
I'm not sure Jordan,

981
00:58:00.431 --> 00:58:03.400
because evidently the Jordans aren't terribly funny.
Jordanians are very funny.

982
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:05.380
But the Egyptians are like rule areas.

983
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:10.180
Jordanians are funny guy right now listening.
It's fucking pissed.
There's a no,

984
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.730
we talked to these guys and they're like,
oh yeah,
there's a,

985
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.330
there's like a hierarchy of comedy in the Middle East.

986
00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:20.620
And according to them,
the Palestinians are about the middle.

987
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.590
The Egyptians are hilarious.
Really.

988
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:28.270
And the Jordanians evidently are like the most serious.

989
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.570
They're very funny.
Yes.

990
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.620
I can't remember.
I don't know.
Uh,
it was,
Joel was here.
He remembers everything,

991
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:43.210
you know,
cause he writes it all down.
But uh,
yeah,
there's like a long history of,

992
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:47.470
uh,
of Egyptian comedy.
Ha.

993
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:52.600
Very funny people.
What about,
uh,
the Israelis do they factor in there?
Yeah.

994
00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:57.400
So,
so what was really fascinating was that,
um,
so we,
you know,

995
00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:02.340
you have kind of the stereotype of the,
of the,
the funny Jewish person,
right?

996
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:05.020
Very self deprecating.
Um,

997
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.100
but you don't find that style of comedy in Israel as much.

998
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:14.110
The Israeli,
um,
comedies a lot more aggressive.
Like it's the,

999
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.670
it's the comedy of the victor not of the,
of the victim.

1000
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:20.020
Oh,
how's chance?

1001
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:24.410
So we found this weird reversal where the Palestinians were much more sort of

1002
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:29.411
self deprecating and their comedy was much more Jewish in the American sense

1003
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:35.630
then you would have necessarily expected.
So it was real.

1004
00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:36.620
I was really fascinating.

1005
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:40.130
That's so strange that it is weird when you think about,

1006
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:43.490
I've met a bunch of Israelis and they're very different from a lot of the

1007
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:47.210
American Jews.
And I think that that's a big generalization.
American Jews,

1008
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.930
sorry folks.
But the,
the idea being that they're at war all the time.
I mean,

1009
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.890
they're constantly surrounded by people who hate them.

1010
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:58.180
They all have mandatory military service.
How did,

1011
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:03.140
did you study how like the American Jew came to be like the separate subspecies

1012
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:06.770
of the Jew?
You know,
like sort of like the Sitka blacktail deer.

1013
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.420
It's a smaller deal lives in Alaska.

1014
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:13.450
One thing that we've looked at was how overrepresented Jewish Americans are in

1015
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:19.850
comedy.
And so like back in the day it was like 70% like it was,

1016
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.350
it was an incredible number.
Now it was less so now.
But um,

1017
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.660
those folks have been replaced by,
by other minorities.

1018
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.840
So African Americans even like the rise of the Muslim American comedian post

1019
01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:34.760
nine 11,
you're seeing this and what,

1020
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.650
what I think it is is that to be a minority is advantageous when it comes to

1021
01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:44.120
creating jokes because,
um,
what,
you know,

1022
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:47.570
what you're doing as I like to say is you're trying to create benign violations.

1023
01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:50.090
You're trying to make things that are wrong.
Okay.

1024
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Well being a minority helps identify what's wrong in the world because when you

1025
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:58.760
have one foot in the majority culture and one foot outside of it,

1026
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:04.250
you can see the things that seem off right.
Strange.

1027
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:05.630
Like it's sort of like by Chris Rock.

1028
01:01:05.631 --> 01:01:07.910
I think one of the brilliant things about Chris rock is the,

1029
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:12.710
has crossover appeal.
And,
and some of it was that he went to a white high school,

1030
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.910
so he was sort of too black for a white high school,

1031
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.280
but then back in his neighborhood,
he was sort of too much of a nerd,

1032
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:25.250
right?
Like he was,
he never fit in either of those places.

1033
01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:28.970
And so he could see what was wrong at home and he could see what was wrong with

1034
01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:33.971
white culture in a way that when you just buy in totally,

1035
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:36.260
you don't see those things that are wrong.

1036
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:40.100
And here's the things that are wrong is what's the right source of comedy.

1037
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.580
And so,
so if you think about Jewish Americans,

1038
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:49.010
while they fit that model very nicely in a number of different dimensions,
right?

1039
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:53.100
So like culturally,
religiously,
and you know,
and so on,
um,

1040
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:57.770
ethnically and so on.
And so,
and then,
and now you also have mentors,

1041
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.580
right?
So,
um,
so if you,

1042
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.970
if you're like looking for someone to look up to,

1043
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.320
you can find someone who's like you,
right?
You've got Mel Brooks making,
you know,

1044
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:14.800
making his way in,
um,
in comedy in a way that,
uh,

1045
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.100
uh,
is inspirational.
And you see it as like,
oh,
I can do cause smells done

1046
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.090
<v 0>it or right.
Right.
And so on.
So,
but we haven't gone,</v>

1047
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:28.190
that's about as deep as we went with it.
But it's a really fascinating idea.
This,

1048
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:32.370
this notion of um,
WB Dubois caught it Tunis,
right?

1049
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:36.060
So you have like kind of two identities.
That's,
that's a useful thing.

1050
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.171
It's why like,

1051
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:41.310
it's like you're talking like we were talking about Mexico City in Mexico City.

1052
01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:43.050
That's just the way the traffic is.

1053
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.150
But you come there as an outsider and it just seems so bizarre.
Um,

1054
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.230
Mexican person comes to La and they make,
they make jokes about la traffic,

1055
01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:55.940
about how well behaved people seem to be,
at least relative to home.
You know,

1056
01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.780
you can see how that stuff can,
yeah.

1057
01:02:57.781 --> 01:03:00.960
I talked to my friend who's from Mexico and she was laughing and she was like,

1058
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:03.450
they always say,
if you could drive in Mexico City,
you can drive anywhere.

1059
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.430
You know?
She's like I was saying,

1060
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.470
I can't believe what the traffic is like down there.
She's like,

1061
01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:12.420
I know I came to America,
I could drive easy.
No problem.
You should go to,

1062
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:17.421
we went to Denmark and it's the easiest driving in the world.

1063
01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:21.300
Like we rented a car,
drove all over the place in Denmark.
They just so polite.

1064
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.360
It's polite rule abiding everything.

1065
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:29.310
And also there's like nobody there like,
you know,

1066
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:33.690
like we're in Copenhagen and just like where is everybody?
Well in that place,

1067
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.630
that's how boulder is.
Boulders,
very polite.

1068
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:41.660
Like the driving there is very calm and I know and I want to start honking.

1069
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.690
It's like don't do it.
People peep.
Here's the problem is,

1070
01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.700
is people are too polite at times and as a result people misbehave because they,

1071
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:52.643
they don't,

1072
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.000
they feel like they're operating in like with anonymity because they've come

1073
01:03:57.001 --> 01:04:00.700
from probably a place where people like are a little bit more aggressive and,

1074
01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:04.170
and so I'm like,
I need to start using it.
I'm from New Jersey originally.

1075
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:07.350
I don't do it.
Don't bring Jersey to fucking bolden.
Don't do it dude.

1076
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.760
God Damn you.
Damn.
You beat him across.
Um,

1077
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:15.600
what you're saying about the outsider,
it makes a ton of sense.

1078
01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:17.640
Especially being outside or on both sides.

1079
01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.700
It'll be an or inside the black community and of course being black,

1080
01:04:20.701 --> 01:04:23.400
being outside or in the white communities for Chris Rock.
Yeah,

1081
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:27.130
that totally makes sense.
Being in an outsider,
having some,
you know,

1082
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.530
having a lack of comfort,
you know,

1083
01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.200
I mean it's almost like what we were talking about,

1084
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.940
about being squished in together and being cold and like there's something about

1085
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.590
a lack of comfort that can create comedy.

1086
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:43.070
The Jew thing is fascinating to me because Europeans like it's complimentary.

1087
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.780
P and Jews are so intelligent,

1088
01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:53.430
like they have a completely disproportionate number of Nobel prize winners that

1089
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.130
are European Jews.
Um,
they,

1090
01:04:56.131 --> 01:05:00.260
they're responsible for a great deal of like inventions and,

1091
01:05:00.261 --> 01:05:02.820
and innovation.
It's incredible.

1092
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:06.200
Like just as far as like European Jews,
you look at the,

1093
01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:10.260
the intellectual talent pool,
it's come out of Europe,

1094
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.360
Jewish folks from Europe.
It's amazing.

1095
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.290
And a lot of those who immigrated to America became fantastic.

1096
01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:21.291
Standup comedians were known like pretty much across the board as being like

1097
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:24.430
really intelligent.
Yeah.
Like you think about like,

1098
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.910
I mean woody Allen before all of his troubles was known as a very intelligent

1099
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:30.940
guy.
And a very introspective and fascinating guy.

1100
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.940
Jerry Seinfeld is of course known as being very intelligent.

1101
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:37.480
That means is there's a slew of them.
You can just start there.
And Larry David,

1102
01:05:37.481 --> 01:05:38.650
he can go on to the end of time.

1103
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:44.150
So the best predictor of a good sense of humor is intelligence.

1104
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:46.750
And so,
um,

1105
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.890
so some like in the professional ranks that that clearly makes sense because you

1106
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:54.660
have to be writing,
you know what I mean?
Like,
so you're,
so you have to,
um,

1107
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:57.670
to be good at,
at writing and putting these things together.

1108
01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.010
But even outside of the professional ranks,

1109
01:06:00.011 --> 01:06:04.480
just to be quick witted it helps to be smart because really what you're doing is

1110
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:08.230
creating a situation where you take this thing that seems wrong and find a way

1111
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.830
to make it okay.
And,

1112
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:14.050
and smart people tend to be more creative and smart people tend to be better at

1113
01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:16.930
that kind of thing.
It's like,
it's really is the best.
I mean,

1114
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:20.350
you don't have to be,
cause you know,
you can still make fart jokes and so on,

1115
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.390
but you've got a problem with fuck fart jokes.
Did I see what you're doing.

1116
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.820
You get caught in a trap and you get caught in a trap.
Here's that trap.

1117
01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:31.990
The trap is you eliminate a subject matter because he believe it's low brow.

1118
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.430
Okay.
But the reality is there are certain times but that is the correct thing to

1119
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:37.540
discuss.
Sure.

1120
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.550
And you know Ari Shaffir has this joke about having diarrhea and he had to go

1121
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:46.690
across this bridge in Sydney.
We were in Australia.
I'm already laughing.

1122
01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:51.430
It's true story.
And his manager actually told him,
look Ari,

1123
01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:55.510
it's a shit joke and it's all fucking hilarious pit.
His marriage is like,

1124
01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.950
look man,
you got to drop that.
It's a shit joke.

1125
01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:59.830
So he dropped his manager said fuck off dummy.
Like you don't know.

1126
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:02.620
You're talking about like there's certain times where that is the right thing to

1127
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:04.780
talk about.
I agree.
I mean,
you know,

1128
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:09.780
if you give a comic a choice between saying something smart and things,

1129
01:07:09.781 --> 01:07:13.210
something that gets laughs,
they go with the labs they and they ought to.

1130
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.970
That's the currency they trade in.
But now see that,

1131
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.390
I discussed this on reddit yesterday.
Now that comics have podcasts,

1132
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:22.180
if they have like something that they really want to discuss is not funny at
all.

1133
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:23.620
They can do it on a podcast,

1134
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:27.400
but there was like a real trap that some comics would get into.

1135
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:28.990
Like when they started getting a little bit of relevance,

1136
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:32.980
especially when they would start preaching onstage and it's gross.

1137
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.330
Like they would say things on stage that aren't funny at all to get applause

1138
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:42.130
breaks to get people to agree with Doug a tedtalk almost.
Or like,

1139
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:44.290
you know,
you're essentially preaching to the choir.

1140
01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:46.340
I mean that's what you're doing.
You're near you.

1141
01:07:46.341 --> 01:07:51.341
You're doing it on purpose to like to set yourself up on a moral high ground or

1142
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:55.300
to establish a premise.
You know,
and then you're going to expand from there.

1143
01:07:55.301 --> 01:07:55.661
But it's,

1144
01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:59.860
the preaching thing gets really fucking gross when you're an audience member,

1145
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:01.900
especially if it's like Duh,

1146
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.780
like a really obvious stuff that you know someone's doing just to get.
Like,

1147
01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:07.690
of course,
we all think that women shouldn't be slaves.
You know what I mean?

1148
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.480
Women shouldn't be slaves.
You know,
everybody starts clapping like,

1149
01:08:10.481 --> 01:08:13.960
what are you doing?
If you don't have a punchline,
don't say that.

1150
01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:17.390
Of course women shouldn't be,
nobody should be a fucking slave.
You know?

1151
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:22.190
It's like that kind of thing is avoided by podcasts because in podcasts you can

1152
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:26.060
explore an idea and not having to worry about like the very rigid parameters of

1153
01:08:26.061 --> 01:08:30.020
like getting a joke or getting a laugh every x amount of seconds.
I see.

1154
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.820
And then you can have people like me on getting,

1155
01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:34.670
we didn't have people that are way less funny.

1156
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.150
You actually got laughs on stage at a comedy club.
You know,

1157
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:41.180
I've had like theoretical physicists on where you have to ask them to repeat

1158
01:08:41.181 --> 01:08:44.450
themselves because you don't know what the fuck they just said or you know,

1159
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:49.430
really intellectual people with very varied interests.

1160
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.220
That's where it's not funny at all and you don't have to be,

1161
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.820
there's other you're providing other,
it's not even that you're providing,

1162
01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:58.430
it's a conversation.
That's all it is.
Like when you have a conversation,

1163
01:08:58.431 --> 01:09:02.180
if you're the type of guy that is trying to get laughs all the time,

1164
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:03.020
when you have any conversation,

1165
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:06.260
you're going to fucking really boring conversations cause you're going to limit

1166
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:10.970
your interaction to only like that little narrow gap of humor.

1167
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.400
You can't go deep on stuff.
You can't go deep on stuff.
You can't mean look,

1168
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.670
even when you go deep,
that's the other thing.
Sometimes you're going deep,

1169
01:09:19.671 --> 01:09:22.830
but there's still some ridiculously funny shit in the deepness,
you know,

1170
01:09:22.831 --> 01:09:25.580
and you can,
we're human.
We're pliable.

1171
01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:27.260
We can go back and forth between all of them.

1172
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:31.430
The idea that you can only be one or the other is like a marketing issue or

1173
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:34.790
something.
I see.
All right.
All right.
I'll,
I'm brace the Fart joke.

1174
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.630
That's why don't you write though for the most part,

1175
01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:40.190
most of the time when someone tells a Fart joke,

1176
01:09:40.191 --> 01:09:41.840
they're only telling a fart joke because they,

1177
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:44.840
they're just scared and they're trying to get a laugh and it's almost insulting

1178
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:48.860
as an audience member.
It's a cheap laugh.
Yeah.
Although it's still a laugh.
Right.

1179
01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:51.560
And he said,
if you have the choice between no laughing a cheap laugh.

1180
01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:55.880
I don't know.
I saw Joey Diaz fart until microphone once the comedy store.

1181
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:58.790
It was one of the funniest things ever saw my life cause he was,

1182
01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:02.440
he was totally non related and he's like,
I'm sorry I got to Fart knee.

1183
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.580
He just farted right into the microphone.

1184
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:07.940
I would live to see his face during a Tiffany Haddish.
Queef yeah.

1185
01:10:07.941 --> 01:10:12.660
You don't want to see that it was a girl.
She always do this.
Yeah.

1186
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:18.250
There's um,
there's this girl who,
uh,

1187
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:23.290
does stand up and one of her big is she makes a air come out of her vaginal

1188
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:27.950
cavity and makes noises with it and puts the microphone up to her crotch.

1189
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:31.130
Unique skill.
It's so funny.
I don't know if it's unique,

1190
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:35.620
but it's unique that she's willing to do it on stage with a microphone.
You know,

1191
01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.670
and it's great because he did it at the end of her set,

1192
01:10:38.671 --> 01:10:41.810
so she's all sweaty and said it's more of a wet one.
It says like,

1193
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:46.670
oh my goodness.
Yeah,
he's 40

1194
01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.940
grown man.
Um,
yeah.

1195
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:56.420
Would follow her on Twitter or on the road.
Oh,
your friends.

1196
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.400
I have to follow her and using the microphone right after.

1197
01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:03.680
And you told joke about that.
No,
I,
that's how that's you open.

1198
01:11:03.681 --> 01:11:08.630
It still smells a little one quickie.
That's not funny.

1199
01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:13.160
You should come up with a better joke.
Um,

1200
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:18.000
yeah,
that was a show stopper.
Yeah,
that's him.

1201
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.000
That's what he does.
Sometimes it's not good like right there.

1202
01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.530
Um,
but the point being,
it's like funny.

1203
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.740
It's funny and sometimes someone will say something that you would say,
oh,

1204
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:29.670
you shouldn't do jokes on that.

1205
01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:32.760
Like Ari's joke about shitting his pants while he's going over the bridge.
Yeah.

1206
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:35.640
But yeah,
he should.
I mean it's,
it was,
it was a clever bit.
It's a funny,

1207
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:39.630
honest bit and it's,
it is what it is.
And I think that,
um,

1208
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.800
there's been a lot of like bad comedy on almost every subject.
You know,

1209
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:47.730
there's been a lot of bad comedy on Fart jokes are a lot of bad comedy on,

1210
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:51.870
you know,
fill in the blank,
like airplane jokes.
Like if you have an airplane,
Joe.

1211
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:52.704
Yeah,
that's right.

1212
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.850
I always hear comics talk about that like enough with the travel jokes,

1213
01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:01.740
you know,
cause it's just every comic has a travel job.

1214
01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:06.300
But if someone comes along with a travel joke that just knocks your socks off,

1215
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.490
that is what it is.
You know,

1216
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:13.130
someone can have a point or a point of view or a take on some aspect that we

1217
01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:18.620
hit.
You haven't considered some unique aspect,
you know?

1218
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:23.990
<v 5>Uh,
yes.
But I mean,
well so it's like it's yes,
but isn't it,</v>

1219
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:28.280
I mean it's really is the thing where you,
you are trying to be unique,

1220
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:29.030
right?

1221
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:34.030
The ideal situation is you say stuff that no one saying that they're not

1222
01:12:34.311 --> 01:12:36.290
thinking about the way you're thinking about it,

1223
01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:39.980
that you're giving people a perspective that doesn't quite seem familiar.

1224
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.940
That's the,
that's the holy grail I think.
Um,

1225
01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:48.710
and especially in a world where it's so hard to stand out.
I mean,

1226
01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:53.300
I constantly have people say,
Oh,
do you know this particular comic?
And I'm like,

1227
01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.440
no,
I don't.
And that person is very good.
It's just,
there's so many of them.

1228
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:03.210
And so how is it that you can,
you know,
get people's attention and,

1229
01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.380
and,
and I mean,
I hate to use the marketing term,

1230
01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:09.750
but like cut through the clutter,
but isn't that the sort of the,

1231
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:13.850
the case with any art form?
Like with music?
I mean there's so many small bands,

1232
01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:17.480
I know bands that are trying to make it and yeah,

1233
01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:22.250
I mean any of the entertainment world of entertainment,
I think that's,

1234
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.400
that's probably the case.
But I think that today,

1235
01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:29.000
at least it's the best time to be one of those people.
They'd be like,

1236
01:13:29.001 --> 01:13:32.990
especially like bands because of Youtube.
Cause now,
yeah.
Yeah.

1237
01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:34.850
Now you don't have to rely on the machinery.

1238
01:13:34.851 --> 01:13:39.240
I mean that's the thing that I think is really exciting about comedy,
um,

1239
01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:44.260
specifically and in entertainment in general is that now you have the long tail,

1240
01:13:44.481 --> 01:13:45.920
right?
Like,
because it's a big world.

1241
01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:50.360
There's 300 million people in the United States and now there's like some kid in

1242
01:13:50.361 --> 01:13:54.770
Kansas City who never would have found your,

1243
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:58.990
found you or you know,
and then he stumbles upon you and he hears about it and,

1244
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:04.040
and then you can actually create a following through technology because you're

1245
01:14:04.041 --> 01:14:08.330
just cutting out the middleman.
You don't need,
you know,
you,
you just don't,

1246
01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.100
you don't need the,
um,
the,
and you don't need

1247
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.800
<v 0>the clubs and you don't need all these things as much because you can reach</v>

1248
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:18.430
people directly and so then you can be,
you can,

1249
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:22.180
you can be really narrow,
um,

1250
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:26.920
because there's enough people out there who might be able to support that.
Yeah,

1251
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.140
sure.
That's really exciting.
Yeah.
Well there's,

1252
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:32.950
especially like when you talk about like specific genres,
like all comedy,

1253
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.460
all comedy scenes,
all over the country now where you could,
you know,

1254
01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:38.740
you could fit in,
in these areas because there's a lot of people that like,

1255
01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:40.450
like a different style of comedy,

1256
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:42.900
just like there's a lot of people that like a different style of music.

1257
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:46.990
That's the weird thing about comedy is that the genre itself is not really

1258
01:14:46.991 --> 01:14:50.410
defining of what it is.
It's like you don't go to see live music.

1259
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.040
You go to see live rock and roll.
You go to see live blues,
live country.

1260
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.480
Even if you don't know the artists,

1261
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.870
you essentially go to a club where you know what they're,
what they're selling.

1262
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:00.670
Yeah,
that's a good point.
But comedy,
man,

1263
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:04.120
you can get guns and roses or you get Barry Manilow and back to back,

1264
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:06.220
back to back.
Well,
the comedy store,

1265
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.350
you'll deal with like 10 comics in a night and they're all totally different.

1266
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:14.260
I mean,
there's all sorts of different takes,
you know,

1267
01:15:14.261 --> 01:15:19.210
I'm really impressed by is these,
uh,
sort of blue collar comedy guys,

1268
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:24.810
because what they've done is found a space that's,

1269
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.860
there's a huge demand for,
and there's not enough people filling it.
Right,
right.

1270
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:31.000
You know,
so if you think about it,

1271
01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:33.970
like you've got all these alt comics and they're all,

1272
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.130
they all look like they came from Mumford and sons.

1273
01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.020
They're all the sort of the same dude.
Yeah.
And you're just like,
and now they're,

1274
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.160
they're just competing so much and then like these blue collar guys just must be

1275
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:50.140
killing it because there's a whole world out there that's not producing enough

1276
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:52.450
comics for the demand.
Well,

1277
01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:56.170
I have a friend who's really into country music and I was over his house and

1278
01:15:56.171 --> 01:15:59.890
they were watching the country music channel.
It's fucking ridiculous.

1279
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.800
It was all country music videos and it's like,

1280
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.640
it was so some the worst music you'll ever hear in your life.

1281
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:10.270
But it's like this culture that they're ingrained in and there's not a lot of

1282
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:13.870
comedians that connect to that culture now.
But it's like,

1283
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:16.960
have you ever seen the compilation Brion pull up this compilation,

1284
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:20.050
why country music sucked in 2013?

1285
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.940
It's fucking hilarious cause it's,
it's,
it's about what we're talking about.

1286
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:30.160
We're talking about like hack premises and obvious scenarios and there's formula

1287
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:33.860
to success that's insulting to people that like,
uh,

1288
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.420
if you enjoy like Merle haggard and enjoy like some really good countries,

1289
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:41.290
Hank Williams,
Hank Williams,
you know,
uh,
uh,
Waylon Jennings,

1290
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:45.280
you know that the real shit man and that Johnny Cash and you listened to some of

1291
01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:47.260
this like really obvious,

1292
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:51.340
obvious formulaic sort of created shit and it's,
it's,

1293
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:52.810
it's annoying.

1294
01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:58.050
I could drive you crazy so that somebody's concocted this video of all,

1295
01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:03.130
all of the premises in country music and how much they're repeated and how often

1296
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:07.450
they're repeated.
Did you find it?
Yeah,
I think so.
I do a youtube video.
Okay.

1297
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:10.100
Do you think it's going to get his boat?
Uh,
yeah.

1298
01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:13.910
Play it on that thing and then just we'll walk.
We'll watch it.
You can do that,

1299
01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:18.620
right?
What's the worry?
We get pulled from youtube all the time.
Youtube,
uh,

1300
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:21.650
someone would make a claim against you.
Say like,
if we,
if we just do the show,

1301
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:25.490
we're fine.
You do the show and we show a video and the video is like,

1302
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.700
like a snake eating a crocodile or something like that.

1303
01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:31.430
Somebody owns that video and then we get pulled from youtube.

1304
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.950
If you get a certain amount of strikes,

1305
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:37.040
if you get pulled for copyright violation a certain amount of times,

1306
01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.960
we always take down the video and then edit it out and put it back out.

1307
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.310
It happens a certain time.
You can get in trouble like this.

1308
01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:48.311
Why country music was awful in 2013 and this is particularly awesome for me

1309
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:53.480
because this is going to be cliches.
It's just cliche,
aspirin,
glorious,

1310
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:57.680
glorious series of cliches,
but it just shows you how,

1311
01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:01.520
how hard people are not trying or how hard they're trying to do the same.

1312
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.460
You don't have to try as hard like that's,

1313
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:07.010
that ends up being an open question though.
No.
Okay.

1314
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:08.960
Here's how country music worked.

1315
01:18:08.961 --> 01:18:12.860
In 2013 a bunch of dudes sang about trucks.

1316
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.240
This is good comedy.

1317
01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:28.853
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1318
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.200
<v 0>they drove down old dirt roads.
Here's the quote.</v>

1319
01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.920
<v 1>We're rolling</v>

1320
01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.800
<v 0>and they begged girls getting their trucks too.</v>

1321
01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:02.980
<v 1>You're a little hot
in here.</v>

1322
01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:22.150
<v 0>The only one at girls wearing tight jeans,</v>

1323
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.550
<v 1>those
genes,</v>

1324
01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.160
those genes just,

1325
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:43.150
<v 0>it's so crazy.</v>

1326
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.280
And they drove the girls to the nearest river bank,

1327
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.110
<v 1>river hooker.</v>

1328
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:10.140
<v 0>The moonlight made it all.
So Romance,</v>

1329
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.033
<v 1>tick</v>

1330
01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:28.310
<v 0>and there was always alcohol,
Aka good stuff to loosen things up.</v>

1331
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:43.000
Yeah.
Good stuff is moonshine.

1332
01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.053
<v 1>Oh</v>

1333
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.650
stone and chill in the drain.

1334
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.950
<v 0>But if every borough tactic failed,</v>

1335
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.940
they would just call their girl girl.

1336
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.630
<v 1>Hey,
good
girl.</v>

1337
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.990
Quiet listening to country music.

1338
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:30.520
<v 0>Well not that,
that's not the whole genre.
It's most of it though,
right?</v>

1339
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:34.370
There's an appetite dot.
Well it's like,
just like saying music is like that.

1340
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.520
I mean there's a lot of God damn pop music cause most music pop music,

1341
01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.350
honey honey is obviously not pop music.

1342
01:21:39.351 --> 01:21:41.030
There's a lot of music does not pop music.

1343
01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:45.350
It's just sees it as a joke about this.
Right?

1344
01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:49.940
Think about these sort of Cla like these sort of club songs about partying and

1345
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:53.090
yeah,
he has a,
I haven't seen it all this stuff,
but it's,

1346
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.680
I mean he's just doing it now with like club music,
new stuff.
Yeah,
no it's not.

1347
01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.690
It's a few years old.
Oh,
is it?
But you know,

1348
01:21:59.691 --> 01:22:02.510
the idea is that you're finding these things that resonate.

1349
01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.810
People like it and so people keep doing it.

1350
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:08.870
It's just different versions of it all.
What does a market,
you know,

1351
01:22:08.871 --> 01:22:12.680
especially when you're talking about like going out to like clubs and drinking,

1352
01:22:12.681 --> 01:22:16.280
like drinking in clubs and playing music while people are drinking,
like shot,

1353
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:20.960
shot,
shot,
shot,
people love that kind of stuff.
They love to,
to be included.

1354
01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.480
But you know,
this is just like,
you could clear that off man,

1355
01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:27.440
clear all that and go back to the blank screen.
It's all a hack premises,

1356
01:22:27.441 --> 01:22:30.710
you know?
It's like that's a,
that's one of the things like,
you know,

1357
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.830
don't do fart jokes,
don't do,
you don't do anything low brow.

1358
01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:37.100
Don't do anything so obvious unless you want to get paid.
Right.

1359
01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:41.090
I mean that's like there's a bit of that.
No,
it was a little bit of that,

1360
01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.460
especially in the beginning.
I think with comedy,

1361
01:22:43.461 --> 01:22:46.460
one of the things in the beginning is just becoming at least reasonably

1362
01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:51.410
proficient.
And the way I was describing that,
there's like three steps.
The first,

1363
01:22:51.411 --> 01:22:54.380
and sometimes they're not all necessary.
The second step is fine,

1364
01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:57.140
but the first step is you just figure out what works.

1365
01:22:57.141 --> 01:22:58.220
It's like you have a toolbox.

1366
01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.470
It's like you're just hammering nails and sawn wood.

1367
01:23:00.471 --> 01:23:02.870
You're just trying to figure out what works.
So your jokes,

1368
01:23:02.871 --> 01:23:04.850
you might not even think they're funny at all,
but they get a,

1369
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.960
so you stick with them.
Okay.
And then once you get good enough,

1370
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.330
you start doing stuff that you actually think is funny.

1371
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.560
And then the third step is you start trying to make your ideas funny.

1372
01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:16.750
Like make points.
Some people don't ever get there.

1373
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:18.850
That is the end of some of the best ones.

1374
01:23:18.851 --> 01:23:20.950
Don't ever get like Mitch Hedberg is my perfect example.

1375
01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:23.180
If a guy who was like one of my all time favorite Comedians,
okay.

1376
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:27.520
But he never had,
like there was no philosophy behind his comedy.

1377
01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:30.340
It was just a,
it was just really hilarious.

1378
01:23:30.341 --> 01:23:34.330
One liners non-related one liners to an hours of them.

1379
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:39.430
You know,
he was a really unique and unusual comic in that sense.

1380
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:43.840
Did he,
did he recreate himself at one point in his career?

1381
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.570
Like the Mitch Hedberg that everybody knows about is not,

1382
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.510
he didn't start doing that style.

1383
01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:53.890
Like even like the kind of cadence and the way he,
I think he changed his voice.

1384
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:57.720
Am I know that I'm not true three now.
He pretty much always start that.
Yeah,

1385
01:23:57.750 --> 01:24:02.050
I've known,
I knew him for a long time.
Miss uh,
miss miss read something.
Well,

1386
01:24:02.051 --> 01:24:06.520
one thing that did happen is he got development deals and they started doing

1387
01:24:06.521 --> 01:24:10.540
like the whole sitcoms shuffle thing with them trying to develop a sitcom form.

1388
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:15.390
And then once they stopped developing the Sitcom,
then he like didn't work out.

1389
01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:19.960
The acting thing didn't work out and he really started just touring more and

1390
01:24:19.961 --> 01:24:21.730
getting more into a standup in a standup.

1391
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:25.720
She's kept getting stronger and stronger and stronger and it led to the Mitch

1392
01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.790
Hedberg that everybody knows now.
Okay,
I see.
Alright.

1393
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:31.090
But there's also substance abuse involved in there.

1394
01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:32.640
Like a lot of it and that there's,

1395
01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:37.030
there's some of his style that you could probably attribute to drugs,
you know,

1396
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:40.000
because he had this heroin issue,
you know,

1397
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:44.530
and he had this sort of almost they bag heroin style.

1398
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:50.010
I took a piece of carefree gum and hour later I was still worried it never

1399
01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:54.400
kicked in.
You know,
he had this weird like slick,

1400
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.760
bizarre style of comedy that I mean huge loss back.

1401
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:04.120
I wonder like where would he,
where could he have gone?

1402
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:05.740
Cause he's still been using the same thing.

1403
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:07.300
He would have been doing the same thing and we've been just,

1404
01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.790
he had no like dull spots.

1405
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.960
Like if you go and look at through his body of work was no like bad stuff.

1406
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.770
I think it's like it started off great.
It stayed great to the,
to the very end.

1407
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:22.270
He would create new great stuff.
And in my opinion,
the hardest way to do it.

1408
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.690
Like the one liners like unrelated one liners over and over again.
It's,

1409
01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.990
and especially like bizarre absurdist sort of one liners.
Yeah.

1410
01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:34.600
Yeah.
But you know,
more people would have known about them for sure.
I mean,

1411
01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:39.340
he died I think in 2000 and I want to say three somewhere around them before
the,

1412
01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:43.450
I mean,
because his stuff,
it's perfect youtube material.
Yes.
Yeah.

1413
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:48.100
It's like so shareable.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Like in,
and you can you,

1414
01:25:48.330 --> 01:25:49.270
because it's one liners,

1415
01:25:49.271 --> 01:25:52.960
you can break it down and have like 15 seconds or 15 minutes.

1416
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:57.190
People eat it up.
He's an interesting guy too because there's a lot of,
um,

1417
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:01.930
stories about him in the early days where club owners didn't quite get it.

1418
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.250
Like when you go on the road,
a lot of times

1419
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.170
<v 2>the club owner just cares about putting a,
an,
you know,</v>

1420
01:26:09.171 --> 01:26:09.951
an act on stage.

1421
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:13.550
It's going to get labs and sometimes the act that they'll book for the

1422
01:26:13.551 --> 01:26:15.480
headliner's not compatible.
Okay.

1423
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:20.420
Like he worked with some guy and the guy was like singing and doing impressions

1424
01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:24.010
of musicians doing fucking flips and cartwheels and shit.
And then,
you know,

1425
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:27.620
he had this crazy big closer that he would do.
Thank you.
Good night.

1426
01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:28.520
Everybody would go crazy.

1427
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:31.700
And then Mitch Hedberg would go onstage with his sunglasses on and people would

1428
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:34.790
get angry.
And it,
it didn't just happen in one club.

1429
01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:35.960
It happened in a bunch of clubs.

1430
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.890
And obviously you're talking about the guy who I think is like one of the best

1431
01:26:39.891 --> 01:26:40.580
ever.

1432
01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:44.300
But he would eat shit because he would go on after these guys and no one knew

1433
01:26:44.301 --> 01:26:46.140
who he was.
So they didn't know.

1434
01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:49.130
They didn't know that they were going to expect the Mitch Hedberg style.

1435
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:53.780
So they saw this guy go on after this guy who was flipping around and sweating

1436
01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:58.640
and putting out all this effort and they just never look like he's mailing it
in.

1437
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.300
Maybe they just couldn't switch gears.
You know,

1438
01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.260
<v 5>you know,
this is,
this is a really interesting idea.
Like,</v>

1439
01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:09.340
so this is the kind of stuff that I,
I test for a living.
Right?
So,

1440
01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:13.750
so what we've been sort of talking about is like,
whether someone's funny or not,

1441
01:27:13.751 --> 01:27:16.990
or how they develop,
you know,
a sense of humor,

1442
01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.940
the ability to produce lasts than others.

1443
01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.630
But from the comedy club conversation that we had earlier,

1444
01:27:22.631 --> 01:27:27.220
and in this conversation you realize that there's a lot of moving parts,
right?

1445
01:27:27.221 --> 01:27:30.790
There's a lot of things that are outside of your control as someone trying to be

1446
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:35.090
funny.
And so the idea that you could have someone who was very,

1447
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:35.950
I mean,

1448
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:39.730
ideally you do have someone who is funny before you because it warms the crowd

1449
01:27:39.731 --> 01:27:43.660
up and they're already in a good mood and they're just more likely to laugh now

1450
01:27:43.661 --> 01:27:46.020
than they were before because they're,
they're,
you know,

1451
01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:50.110
their mood state has changed,
you know,
it's positive and so on.
But the fact is,

1452
01:27:50.111 --> 01:27:51.420
is that that,
that,

1453
01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.480
that can have such a profound effect shows that there's a lot of like contextual

1454
01:27:57.311 --> 01:28:01.780
factors that are at play that you can't necessarily control.

1455
01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.380
You know?
And so that's,
I've never,
uh,
yeah.
So what I,

1456
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.510
I tried to put my finger on what would be the contrast there?

1457
01:28:10.511 --> 01:28:15.511
Like why is it that the audience would sort of rebel against him given how good,

1458
01:28:17.951 --> 01:28:19.030
I mean,
you know,
he's good.

1459
01:28:19.090 --> 01:28:21.610
<v 2>So Scott algae to music.
I mean if,</v>

1460
01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.120
if Metallica went onstage and did you know a,

1461
01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.740
a concert in front of a bunch of metal fans and went fucking crazy,

1462
01:28:29.741 --> 01:28:33.480
did enter Sandman and then brought up Christina Aguilera.
Yeah.

1463
01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:37.810
How well do you think that would go
mad?

1464
01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:43.150
A bitch?
No.
No.
But
you know,
if you would,

1465
01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.450
if you go to any sort of a,

1466
01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.890
a music show,

1467
01:28:50.891 --> 01:28:55.200
it's very rare that you have like a completely contrasting styles like that they

1468
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.510
share the same stage.
The difference.
So

1469
01:28:57.510 --> 01:29:02.040
<v 5>is that this is presumably like just a regular like it's not is</v>

1470
01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.240
<v 0>it wasn't an audience to came there for this jumping around guy.
Right,
right,</v>

1471
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:09.900
right.
No,
it was just a comedy club.
Yeah,
that's right.
That's the thing.

1472
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:14.400
And that's the difficult part of the developing as a comedian.

1473
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:17.790
I think for a lot of comics it's like you have to find your audience and if you

1474
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.920
compromise yourself,
you don't ever find your audience.

1475
01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:23.430
You become this sort of middle of the road guy with a blazer on.

1476
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:25.350
Like when I first tried to go on stage,

1477
01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.200
the first thing I did is try to dress like comedian.

1478
01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:32.070
So I wore a blazer and I rolled my sleeves up and I wore like a wacky tee shirt

1479
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.290
and it had like a pin on my jacket.

1480
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:39.030
Like I was trying to like fit into the mold of what I thought of a comedian.

1481
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:43.440
And I think that if you're a comic it's very hard to become a Mitch Hedberg

1482
01:29:43.441 --> 01:29:47.700
because of that.
It's very hard to like do something that no ones,

1483
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.700
they haven't seen the why is he wearing sunglasses?
Like why is he,

1484
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:54.000
he would turn his back to the crowd,
do like his,
his act to the wall.

1485
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.980
Sometimes we'd hide behind curtains.

1486
01:29:55.981 --> 01:29:57.480
He would do his whole act behind the curtain.

1487
01:29:57.690 --> 01:29:59.460
I'm just going to hang out back here for a little bit.

1488
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.730
And he would do his act like that creates around,
yes,

1489
01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.630
it's unusual destination.

1490
01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.320
We look at it to browse and creating arousal and the key is just to make sure

1491
01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:15.321
that the Arrow is pointed to the positive side cause cause that makes,

1492
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:18.510
it would make it even worse.
Like if he was bombing,
yeah,

1493
01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:22.500
that would make it even worse because now he's creating negative around.
Exactly.

1494
01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:25.650
Exactly.
Yeah.
I mean he was doing well and doing that,

1495
01:30:25.651 --> 01:30:30.270
but like I,
I've told this story before but it's a bears repeating a hicks.

1496
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:34.330
I saw Hicks in Boston and I saw him bomb and uh,

1497
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:38.370
he went on after a guy who's a like really hacky,

1498
01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:41.090
like the guy was doing like cartoon characters smoking.

1499
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:44.520
We like doing impressions of like things that we all knew,
you know,

1500
01:30:44.521 --> 01:30:49.521
like just standard really like down the middle hacky shit.

1501
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:54.270
And he did well Hicks went off from,
no one knew who fuck Hicks was in.

1502
01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:59.271
Hicks just ate shit for like 45 minutes except for like 50 people in the room.

1503
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.970
So it was like a 300 seat room,
250 people leave.

1504
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:05.550
The fifth 50 people that are remaining are howling laughing.

1505
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.640
It's like the comics in the back of the room and like a few people in the

1506
01:31:08.641 --> 01:31:09.474
audience.

1507
01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.100
But Hicks never like left that style.

1508
01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.450
Like he keys and he knew this wasn't as crowd and he just plowed through it

1509
01:31:18.451 --> 01:31:19.050
anyway.

1510
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:23.420
And found his crowd in the people that stayed because he never stopped like

1511
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:26.240
delivering the material the way he wanted to do it.
And it was,

1512
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:29.610
it was very unusual because I'd never seen a guy be so confident bombing.

1513
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.440
So this idea,
um,

1514
01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.600
so the theory that we use is benign violation theory.

1515
01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:39.990
One of the Nice things about the theory is that explains the two ways that a

1516
01:31:39.991 --> 01:31:43.680
humor attempt can fail.
So you are trying to find that sweet spot,

1517
01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:45.870
the situation being wrong yet.
Okay.

1518
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:50.400
Sometimes you create a situation that's just wrong and people are outraged and

1519
01:31:50.401 --> 01:31:54.940
sometimes you create a situation that's just okay.
And people were bored.
And so,

1520
01:31:54.970 --> 01:31:59.740
so when I,
when I bombed,
when I tried to stand up,
I bombed on the benign side.

1521
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.920
<v 5>My jokes,
they didn't go far enough.</v>

1522
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:07.150
I had an audience of like dirt bag hipsters and want to be comedians.

1523
01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:11.080
And so the jokes I was telling where they were just too boring and benign cause

1524
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:14.920
that night people were talking about smoking crack and about abortions and all

1525
01:32:14.921 --> 01:32:19.720
these kinds of things that were like,
you know,
just much more savory.
Unsavory.

1526
01:32:19.721 --> 01:32:22.930
Thank you.
Risque.
But um,

1527
01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:28.290
but what you can find is that three people can have three different reactions to

1528
01:32:28.361 --> 01:32:32.410
the same joke.
So one person is howling with laughter,

1529
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:37.030
one person is totally outraged and the other person is like,
come on,

1530
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.170
tell me something funny.

1531
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.080
And so what that shows you is that in any one audience and the more

1532
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:47.560
heterogeneous the audiences,
the more diverse the audience is,

1533
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:51.400
the more likely you're going to get all three of those reactions.

1534
01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:53.110
And ideally what you do,

1535
01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.140
what Hicks did was find the people who he hits the sweet spot with.

1536
01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:04.140
And then,
you know,
nowadays imagine what you know,
uh,
what,

1537
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:05.081
see what happens.

1538
01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:08.320
Is it like now you can identify who your audience is and they can find out where

1539
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:10.720
you are that you don't just stumble into a club anymore.

1540
01:33:10.721 --> 01:33:13.420
They people go to see Joe Rogan cause they know that,

1541
01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:18.160
that he's going to be funny to them even though you know you're not,
no offense,

1542
01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.050
you're not for everyone.

1543
01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:21.540
<v 2>No what he is,
that's the key.
If you,
you know,</v>

1544
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.360
if you try to be funny for everybody,

1545
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:27.660
you're never going to figure out what the fuck is unique about what you do,

1546
01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:32.490
your sense of humor,
your style of,
of looking at the world.

1547
01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:37.410
And I think that's a big part of what comedy is a big pop part of a comedy has

1548
01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:40.290
is here's the world through my eyes.
But if it's not really,

1549
01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:41.400
here's the rest of my eyes,

1550
01:33:41.401 --> 01:33:46.230
here's the world through the vision that I think you would laugh at.

1551
01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:49.680
That's not,
that's not like really your take on things.

1552
01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:52.410
And would hicks had figured out,

1553
01:33:52.411 --> 01:33:56.160
I guess long before a lot of people was just a stick to your guns and they'll

1554
01:33:56.161 --> 01:33:59.790
find you,
you know,
the,
the fucking field of dreams build it and they'll come.

1555
01:33:59.870 --> 01:34:01.080
And it's your funny though,

1556
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:04.510
like a fun thing because there are plenty of people stick to their guns,
right?

1557
01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.220
They just don't have an audience.
That's a true,
that's the true statement,
right?

1558
01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:10.470
There's,
there's so many variables involved.

1559
01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.460
And like some people would listen to that country music thing and they would

1560
01:34:14.461 --> 01:34:17.820
love each one of those songs individually and can't wait until they come on the

1561
01:34:17.821 --> 01:34:22.140
radio again.
And they're not wrong.
They're not wrong.
It's a taste issue.

1562
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:24.690
It's like what you were saying about the blue collar guys,

1563
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.060
it's like they figured out how to tap into that,

1564
01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:30.360
that sort of unrepresented aspect of America,

1565
01:34:30.361 --> 01:34:33.000
which is monstrously huge,
huge.

1566
01:34:33.090 --> 01:34:37.050
I mean it's like you find out how many albums are being sold of country music

1567
01:34:37.051 --> 01:34:39.870
albums,
how many people know that music and it's,
it's incredible.

1568
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:42.300
It's like you're dealing with a whole different world that you didn't know

1569
01:34:42.301 --> 01:34:47.100
existed.
Yes.
And Larry,
the Cable Bot,
Larry the cable guy rather owns that world.

1570
01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.820
Like that guy does football arenas.
You know,
I,
um,

1571
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:55.290
<v 5>I've got serious on my,
in my car and I,</v>

1572
01:34:55.291 --> 01:34:59.690
and there's like six stations you can,
you know,
you can choose from comedy,

1573
01:34:59.790 --> 01:35:01.900
comedy stations.
Thank you.
Yeah.
And uh,

1574
01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:07.270
I regularly try to listen to the blue collar station because it's,

1575
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:10.370
while it's different and it's like,
it's good comedy.
Larry.

1576
01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:14.300
The cable guy's a funny,
very smart guy.
Yeah.
He's a very good comic.

1577
01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:18.380
That's why I was,
I'm shocked when a lot of people were like,

1578
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.650
a lot of people were like super jealous I guess,

1579
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:26.830
<v 2>or they felt like he represented racism or homophobia or whatever it was his</v>

1580
01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:31.490
character did.
And so like a lot of people,
like we're really derogatory about it.

1581
01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:34.020
I'm like,
are you ever like read his jokes are listened to his jokes?
Yeah.

1582
01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:37.940
They're well written jokes.
It's a character.
His name's Dan Whitney.
Yeah.
Okay.

1583
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:39.770
I mean it's,
he's doing an act.

1584
01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.260
<v 5>I mean,
I think about that like with dice clay,
you know,
like,
you know,
you just,</v>

1585
01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:43.860
you,

1586
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:47.850
you have a character and you create a character that can work when you're really

1587
01:35:47.851 --> 01:35:50.970
funny though.
If he said he got to a certain point,
it was like,
okay,

1588
01:35:50.971 --> 01:35:55.250
I got enough money.
It's time to start turning on these mother fuckers.
He's

1589
01:35:57.030 --> 01:36:02.030
using his character to expose like the worst aspects of southern life and

1590
01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.780
religious ignorance.
And you know,
it could be fascinating.

1591
01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:11.100
You know who the other person who I think of is,
is a Russell Peters.
In what way?

1592
01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:15.930
That he,
um,
that he's found a niche.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1593
01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.990
and like a space like there,
you know,

1594
01:36:17.991 --> 01:36:22.710
it was like Indian people want to laugh and so like,
uh,

1595
01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.300
and he's very good.
I mean,
you know,

1596
01:36:24.301 --> 01:36:27.150
all this stuff is all contingent on being very good.
Yes.

1597
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:30.320
<v 2>By very much so.
But the opportunities there are just huge.
Well,</v>

1598
01:36:30.321 --> 01:36:32.640
Russell transcends,
I mean,
he doesn't,
I'm,

1599
01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.830
a lot of people know him from Youtube has youtube clips or giant,

1600
01:36:36.831 --> 01:36:40.610
like he has youtube clips with millions of hits and that's really what made him

1601
01:36:40.611 --> 01:36:45.050
big.
And he like,
if you go to one of his shows,
it's not just Indian folks here.

1602
01:36:45.051 --> 01:36:49.760
Like you'll find people of all ethnicities because he does so much on race and

1603
01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:54.200
he's so likable,
you know,
he's so likable and he has good points and you know,

1604
01:36:54.201 --> 01:36:57.780
he's just a friendly,
smiley guy up there.
You like,
you want to,

1605
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:59.690
you want to enjoy him.
Yes,
that's true.
Yeah.

1606
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.710
He's the fucking nicest guy ever to like real life.
He's a sweetheart.

1607
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:05.510
Like you'll never hear any,

1608
01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:08.070
I've never heard anybody say anything bad about Russell,
you know,

1609
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:11.590
but so when Russell tells you someone's a Douche bag and you go,
hmm,

1610
01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.310
I bet that person's really a Duisburg.
Oh Wow.
But I mean,

1611
01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:17.900
he sold out the o two arena in London twice.

1612
01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.380
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
He's giant.</v>

1613
01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.030
<v 2>Been a lot of that.
I'm sure a lot of his Asian folks,
you know,</v>

1614
01:37:23.031 --> 01:37:27.530
folks from India and all sorts of people,
all sorts of different ethnicities.

1615
01:37:27.531 --> 01:37:29.340
But he definitely found a mark market

1616
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.511
<v 5>in the humor code.</v>

1617
01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:34.590
One of the things that that stands out is that no matter where you go,

1618
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.270
people value laughs.
Like they,
you know,
they value it in their,

1619
01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:43.980
in their personal lives.
They valued in their leisure time.
They're there,

1620
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:49.340
you know,
it's an escape.
It's a way to help cope with a difficult life.
Um,

1621
01:37:49.450 --> 01:37:51.810
that's like,
that's fundamental.
I mean,
you know,

1622
01:37:51.811 --> 01:37:55.260
it's so fundamental as you find it in,
in animals.

1623
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.830
So I have this clip,
uh,

1624
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.770
I have this clip that I show when I give public talks about these researchers

1625
01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:03.090
tickling rats.

1626
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:07.080
They actually like put their hand into the cage and kind of rough house these

1627
01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:12.081
rats and the rats emit this sort of chirping sound that signals that they're

1628
01:38:13.651 --> 01:38:18.630
enjoying this activity.
So these,
um,
and then what happens is,
and this is,

1629
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:23.310
this blows my mind,
is that after they've done this for a little while,

1630
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:28.170
then the researcher will move their hands away and the rats will chase the hand.

1631
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.700
So move his hand around the cage and the rats will chase after the hand seeking

1632
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:35.460
out that experience.
So they want to get that stimulation,

1633
01:38:35.461 --> 01:38:37.890
they want to get that stimulation again.
And that,

1634
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.180
that chasing is no different than the people who are going to go to see your

1635
01:38:42.181 --> 01:38:44.100
show tonight or watch your special.

1636
01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:49.200
You're just a rat tickling hand as a comic,

1637
01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.290
you know,
like it's so fundamental to,

1638
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:56.760
to us as organisms define this kind of,
um,

1639
01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.660
this sort of like ambivalent arousing experience where they're like right on the

1640
01:39:02.791 --> 01:39:07.230
edge.
You know,
you're right on the edge of going too far and um,

1641
01:39:07.231 --> 01:39:09.690
and you're bonding with other people over it.
It's,

1642
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:11.820
it's really fast by all that about comedy.

1643
01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:14.310
But I don't know how exactly it relates to rats.

1644
01:39:14.311 --> 01:39:16.110
How do they know that the rats are laughing?

1645
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:18.510
Like when you're tickling a rat had to do,

1646
01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:23.430
we really understand what they're feeling means to them.
Um,
so,

1647
01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:27.270
so what they do,
they have these bat detectors.
So these are ultra sonic,

1648
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:31.590
so we can't hear him with the human ear.
And what they find they do,
they do.

1649
01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.990
They do a number of things in these with these experiments.

1650
01:39:33.991 --> 01:39:38.910
So one of the things that you can do is you can take that tickling too far.

1651
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.930
You make it too aggressive.
And those chirps,

1652
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:48.050
the laughter is replaced by a different vocalization that,

1653
01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:52.620
that rats make when they fight.
Oh.
So like,
all right,
all right.
Enough enough.

1654
01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:55.830
It's like when it's like if you have kids and they're play fighting and then it

1655
01:39:55.831 --> 01:39:59.800
turns,
oh,
or when you're,
like when you were talking about sparring,
sparring is,

1656
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:04.650
is,
it's scary,
but it's also fun.
But then when it turns into a real fight,

1657
01:40:04.651 --> 01:40:08.560
it's just get scary.
Right,
right,
right.
And so,
and then they also measure it,

1658
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:12.090
measure these sorts of physiological changes in the rats,
right?

1659
01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:14.820
So their brain chemistry and,
and so on.
So there's these,

1660
01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.500
these guys at Northwestern,

1661
01:40:16.530 --> 01:40:21.010
they're trying to create essentially happy pills.
So they're,

1662
01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:25.350
they have to understand how do you create positive emotion and rats because they

1663
01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:30.180
want to create chemicals that can create positive emotion in rats.
So,

1664
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:35.280
so the goal of understanding this is because they,
like,

1665
01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:39.660
most drugs are designed to like,
um,
stop negative emotion.

1666
01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:42.520
The,
but the new like,
you know,

1667
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:46.440
the frontiers to create drugs that create positive emotions safely.
You know,

1668
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:48.900
and so,
so they've been for years,

1669
01:40:48.901 --> 01:40:52.560
been studying rats and they've been creating and they basically,

1670
01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:55.840
I don't know exactly how they do all these studies,
but they,

1671
01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.900
they essentially find that this physical experience in rats creates a positive

1672
01:41:01.811 --> 01:41:05.110
emotional state akin to other pods.
You can,
you know,

1673
01:41:05.111 --> 01:41:07.930
you can feed rats and you can do other things to create positive emotional

1674
01:41:07.931 --> 01:41:08.201
states.

1675
01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:11.890
And they basically find that the brain chemistry following this experience is

1676
01:41:11.891 --> 01:41:14.920
the same as the brain chemistry following other positive experiences.

1677
01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:16.650
And is unlike the brain chemistry

1678
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:18.960
<v 0>following negative experiences.
So they're,</v>

1679
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:23.050
they're completely monitoring this animal state.
Exactly.
This is all going on.

1680
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:25.300
So they're pretty aware of what exactly what's going on.
Yeah.

1681
01:41:25.301 --> 01:41:26.920
These guys have been doing this stuff for 20 years.

1682
01:41:26.921 --> 01:41:30.460
But is it possible that it's just looking for affection and,
uh,
like,
uh,
I mean,

1683
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:34.120
how complex is the recognition of this,
this state,
this rat?

1684
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:39.640
It's very simple.
Like,
it's just,
it's just,
I like this.
Can we be like my cat?

1685
01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:43.300
Like when I pet my cat,
she,
you know,
she rubs up against me and she gets excited.

1686
01:41:43.301 --> 01:41:47.260
It's not tickling her at all.
Well,
but when you pet the rats,
you don't get the,

1687
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:50.470
you don't get the laughter.
It's really the rough housing that's,

1688
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:54.580
that's president by the way.
I think.
Do with play.
Yeah.
It's total play.

1689
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:57.700
But if it's play,
how do you continue?
I mean,
I wouldn't consider that.

1690
01:41:57.701 --> 01:41:58.930
Like I'm tickling.

1691
01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:03.890
<v 5>Yeah.
So,
um,
so the way I think about this is that,
so you have,</v>

1692
01:42:03.891 --> 01:42:05.180
um,
uh,

1693
01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:10.370
so if you think about about humor from an evolutionary standpoint is that,

1694
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:14.450
um,
you know,
if you,
if you look at nonhuman primates,

1695
01:42:14.451 --> 01:42:18.680
the things that that monkeys and apes and bonobos laugh at,
they,
it's,

1696
01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.010
it's actually called play panting.
So it's physical forms,

1697
01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.600
physical acts,
so rough and tumble,
play in and tickling and so on.

1698
01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:28.880
The situations that,

1699
01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:33.140
that induce laughter have this sort of harmless nature to them.

1700
01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:37.520
So not all tickling,
for instance,
induces laughter.
You can't tickle yourself.

1701
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:41.960
There's no threat there.
There's no violation.
And if on your way home tonight,

1702
01:42:41.961 --> 01:42:45.890
some creepy guy in a trench coat tried to tickle you,
that wouldn't,

1703
01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:48.350
that wouldn't be funny either.
Right?
So it's

1704
01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.070
not,
so the idea is this,
is that you have this sort of sweet spot with tickling.

1705
01:42:55.130 --> 01:42:58.150
You have the sweet spot with play fighting.
And,

1706
01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:03.220
and then as humans evolved and started to acquire language systems of logic,

1707
01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:09.110
um,
cultural norms,
social norms and so on.

1708
01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:14.380
Now the world of things that could go wrong started to expand beyond the

1709
01:43:14.661 --> 01:43:17.960
physical.
Now it could be a misuse of language.

1710
01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:22.970
It could be an absurdity.
It could be farting,
right?

1711
01:43:22.971 --> 01:43:25.610
Like cause whether farting is okay or not okay.

1712
01:43:25.611 --> 01:43:30.410
It's just a social norm and so the things that could go wrong and the things,

1713
01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.500
the way those things that could be wrong could also be okay.

1714
01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.560
Also expanded and it's why I think humor is such a complex thing to study

1715
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:43.280
because there's so many ways to create this positive emotional experiences.

1716
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:46.610
There's only one way or in rats or a few tiny,

1717
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:52.100
a few different ways in rats,
but in humans it could be,
you know,
slap stick.

1718
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:56.750
It could be knock,
knock jokes that have a taboo thing to them.
It could be,

1719
01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.690
you know what I mean?
There's any number and so it could be a parody,

1720
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:00.800
it could be satire,

1721
01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:06.200
but all of them across all these different forms of comedy have the same

1722
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:10.220
element,
this sort of thing that's wrong yet.
Okay.

1723
01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.350
<v 2>That's a fascinating way of looking at that.</v>

1724
01:44:14.351 --> 01:44:18.520
I don't think most comedians ever sort of conceptualize,

1725
01:44:18.521 --> 01:44:21.880
I think we just try to figure out what's funny about something and we don't look

1726
01:44:21.881 --> 01:44:23.950
at it what's wrong but okay.

1727
01:44:23.951 --> 01:44:28.810
And then how everybody sort of agrees that it's okay.
And that's sort of what,

1728
01:44:28.811 --> 01:44:31.780
like this sort of group recognition laughter is.

1729
01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.820
<v 5>Yes.
And I think that there's,</v>

1730
01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:37.570
I think comedians have been doing this successfully for,
you know,

1731
01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.160
for a long time.

1732
01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:45.240
I what I believe science can provide comedy is it can cut the learning curve.

1733
01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:50.440
So imagine you don't need a theory,
but imagine you had a theory.

1734
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:52.720
So imagine you said,
Pete,
I believe you,

1735
01:44:52.721 --> 01:44:56.470
I'm going to use the benign violation theory.
Well,
it has certain insights.

1736
01:44:56.471 --> 01:45:01.420
So for instance,
um,
one,
one strategy,
we call it the Seinfeld strategy.

1737
01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.950
So you think about what Jerry Seinfeld does is he takes situations that seem

1738
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.320
okay and he points out what's wrong with them,
right?
And,

1739
01:45:11.410 --> 01:45:15.850
um,
and when,
when Jerry fails of that,
he,
he rarely offends anyone.

1740
01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.810
The other strategy is the Silverman strategy.

1741
01:45:20.710 --> 01:45:22.600
She takes a situation,

1742
01:45:22.601 --> 01:45:26.230
Sarah Silverman takes situation that's wrong and finds a clever way to make it

1743
01:45:26.231 --> 01:45:29.620
okay.
You know,
sometimes she puts it to a song and so on and she's,

1744
01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:33.010
she's really very nonthreatening and the way that she does this stuff.

1745
01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:38.980
So you say,
okay,
so just that insight alone could be useful to a comic,

1746
01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:40.271
right?
Like,
okay,

1747
01:45:40.271 --> 01:45:43.600
well where am I starting my starting with something that's very clearly wrong to

1748
01:45:43.601 --> 01:45:47.830
everybody in the room.
Let me figure out the way I can make it okay.
You know,

1749
01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:52.780
a double entendre or misuse of language or find the right victim,

1750
01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:57.820
etc. Or am I taking a situation that everybody sees is okay and I have to find a

1751
01:45:58.721 --> 01:46:02.920
way to,
to show them how it's also wrong.
Right.
And so that's like,

1752
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:07.950
that's not a bad strategy to start from a writing standpoint versus just like,

1753
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.890
oh,
that right.
Like,
you know,
earlier I said,
oh,
that could be a bit,
well,
you know,

1754
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:15.310
and it's like,
okay,
you're just taking this situation.

1755
01:46:15.311 --> 01:46:19.990
You see that there's something amiss there and that it could serve as like a a

1756
01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.580
foundation for a funny joke.

1757
01:46:23.790 --> 01:46:28.100
<v 2>Take very many comedians look at it.
That systematic.</v>

1758
01:46:28.690 --> 01:46:29.411
<v 5>I don't think they do,</v>

1759
01:46:29.411 --> 01:46:33.640
but my point is I think that they could write and I think it could help.

1760
01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:35.680
<v 2>Yeah,
I bet you're right.
Makes Sense.</v>

1761
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:39.760
I mean being aware of the mechanisms behind any sort of decision making.

1762
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:42.670
I mean a lot of times that's one of the things that like counseling and therapy

1763
01:46:42.671 --> 01:46:46.270
helps the people is to be aware of the mechanisms that lead you to go off the

1764
01:46:46.271 --> 01:46:48.710
rails and go on a gambling binge or a drinking binge.

1765
01:46:48.730 --> 01:46:52.560
Like recognize the steps are taking place instead of just being caught up in the

1766
01:46:52.561 --> 01:46:57.561
wave of momentum and in a constructive side like understanding what is or isn't

1767
01:46:57.571 --> 01:47:02.550
funny about something.
It's like almost all writers understand story structure,

1768
01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:06.660
but very few people that enjoy a good book do.
Yes.
You know,

1769
01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:09.790
they just sort of like enjoy it and go on with it.
But most writers there,

1770
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.360
especially when you're writing like something like a novel,

1771
01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:16.530
it sort of makes you do that.
You can kind of have to,

1772
01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:19.000
<v 5>it's like the heroes.
If you understand the hero's journey,</v>

1773
01:47:19.001 --> 01:47:21.980
then you can write a screenplay,
right?
Yeah.
And,
and,

1774
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.960
but people have seen hundreds of heroes journeys,
but they don't,

1775
01:47:26.110 --> 01:47:29.110
they don't recognize plot 0.1.
They don't recognize plot 0.2,

1776
01:47:29.111 --> 01:47:32.830
even though it happens over and over again.
But what was shocking,

1777
01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:36.460
if anything about like the process of creating humor when you're writing your

1778
01:47:36.461 --> 01:47:40.950
book?
Um,
surprising.
Maybe a better word.
Yeah.
So,

1779
01:47:40.951 --> 01:47:42.420
so one was this idea of,

1780
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:47.260
of how the Palestinians were sort of more Jewish and there are comedy that,

1781
01:47:47.261 --> 01:47:51.070
that was very clearly one of them.
So one of the things that stood out to us was,

1782
01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:51.993
um,

1783
01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.870
so we went to the Amazon with patch Adams and a hundred hospital clowns,

1784
01:47:57.910 --> 01:48:01.390
<v 2>patch Adams,
the clown friends,
a movie,
the real patch.</v>

1785
01:48:01.391 --> 01:48:05.170
I'm real patch Adams even know he existed.
I thought that was just a construct.

1786
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.990
<v 5>I know he's a real man.
Yeah.
And he's like a big man.
He's like six,</v>

1787
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:14.220
six.
He's,
he's an enormous man.
And so he's not,
he's not Robin.

1788
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:16.020
You think of him looking like Robin Robins,

1789
01:48:16.021 --> 01:48:18.120
but it doesn't look at all anything like Robin Williams.

1790
01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:21.660
But we wanted to look at whether laughter's the best medicine.

1791
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.310
And you know,
the answer to that obviously is no,
you know,

1792
01:48:26.311 --> 01:48:29.730
there's other better medicines.
Croaks yes.

1793
01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:36.660
But there's good reason to believe that it is useful.
Right.
So,
so,
um,

1794
01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.620
experiencing positive emotion is,
um,
uh,
experience.

1795
01:48:40.621 --> 01:48:45.120
Positive emotion is beneficial in terms of,
of like coping.
That's patch Adams.

1796
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:49.440
That's patch Adams.
The actual patch Adams.
Yep.
Yeah.
He's like,
yeah,

1797
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:53.980
I've seen him wear that chicken on his head.
Exactly.
Anyway,
go ahead.
Oh,
so,
um,

1798
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:58.230
yeah,
don't pull up the pictures of me dressed as a clown.
Please.

1799
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:04.410
It's really bad.
She has made no request in that arena.
Whatever you do,

1800
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:07.170
don't sound like somebody wants pictures of him dressed like a clown.

1801
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:10.690
I was a terrible clown.
Pull them up.
But,
but anyway,

1802
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:15.330
my coauthor was a much better clown then than I am.

1803
01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:17.790
And I mean that in a positive way.
Actually.

1804
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:22.120
I'll never say anything bad about a clown ever again.
After spending a hunt,
uh,

1805
01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:24.740
like a couple of weeks with a hundred hospital clowns in,

1806
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:29.370
in like this destitute area of,
of the Amazon.

1807
01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.530
Okay.
So positive emotions help.

1808
01:49:31.890 --> 01:49:36.450
Having a good sense of humor is beneficial for coping because we'd like people

1809
01:49:36.451 --> 01:49:38.730
who are funny and we like people who can be,

1810
01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:43.560
can make jokes in the face of tragedy.
And so it helps muster social support.

1811
01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.850
So if when the chips are down more than ever,
you need your friends and family.

1812
01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:53.230
And if you're,
if you're able to be a little bit light about it all,

1813
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:57.460
it helps those people kind of stick with you versus you just turning into this

1814
01:49:57.461 --> 01:50:00.700
horrible,
angry,
sad person who no one wants to be around.

1815
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.300
And then the last one,
and I think this is the most important one,

1816
01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:09.460
and certainly the one that's most as most understudied is the act of making a

1817
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:11.560
joke about a tragedy.

1818
01:50:12.250 --> 01:50:15.160
Not only creates positive emotion leads people to like you,

1819
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:20.190
but it can fundamentally change the way you see that situation.

1820
01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.090
You can reappraise it in a way that,
um,
that can be beneficial.

1821
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.910
So the example I like is when we're in New York,

1822
01:50:27.911 --> 01:50:32.911
we met with Todd Hansen who was the head writer at the onion when they publish

1823
01:50:33.321 --> 01:50:38.321
their most famous issue two weeks after the nine 11 attacks and what,

1824
01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:43.600
what the onion did w which was so brilliant was it instead of doing this sort of

1825
01:50:43.601 --> 01:50:47.800
too soon comedy fail and making fun of the victims and making fun of the
tragedy,

1826
01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:52.270
they turned it on to the terrorist.
They made fun of the terrorists.

1827
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:56.080
They had like headlines like terrorists surprise to find selves in Hell.

1828
01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:02.350
And if you think about it like what if you're laughing at these terrorists,

1829
01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.630
you've undermined the terror that they're trying to create cause you,
you know,

1830
01:51:07.631 --> 01:51:12.510
it's impossible to be scared and amused at the same time.
Right?
So,

1831
01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:15.040
so what the onion did was like a great,

1832
01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:19.960
it was great for the American people cause it reintroduced comedy into the,

1833
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.340
into the culture.
Again,

1834
01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.920
it brought them some joy and it also made the terrorists a lot less scary.

1835
01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:28.810
And so in that way,

1836
01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:33.811
like laughter is good medicine because it can serve all these kinds of purposes.

1837
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:38.710
Isn't that why when people are mock to get furious,
because you're sort of,

1838
01:51:38.770 --> 01:51:42.430
you're defusing the,
what's,

1839
01:51:42.431 --> 01:51:47.080
what's significant about them?
You're mocking it.
Yeah.
You're,
yes.
You're making,

1840
01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.440
you're making them seem less serious.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1841
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:52.060
That's the classic scene from Goodfellas.
When my a fucking clown,

1842
01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:52.840
I'm a clown for you.

1843
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.470
Like it's like people get angry if you think something they do is funny,

1844
01:51:56.471 --> 01:52:01.150
it becomes a diminishing aspect like you and they almost want to fight you to

1845
01:52:01.151 --> 01:52:05.440
get their energy back.
Yeah.
I mean,
well,
so there's a,
so humor,

1846
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:10.470
so we think of comedy as like a very positive thing in the present world,

1847
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:14.320
but it doesn't have its roots actually a rather negative.

1848
01:52:14.321 --> 01:52:17.140
So Plato and Aristotle wrote about about humor,

1849
01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.450
but they saw it as a subversive thing,

1850
01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:24.550
so they saw it as a negative kind of thing.
And how so?
Well,

1851
01:52:24.551 --> 01:52:28.060
so if you think about it,
what,
um,
uh,

1852
01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:32.860
it's sort of like the sneering the laughing at versus the laughing with.

1853
01:52:32.861 --> 01:52:35.790
So there's a long history of ridicule,
for instance.
Um,

1854
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:41.020
is that because we were putting down people?
And so in that way you're,
uh,

1855
01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:46.130
you know,
and,
and if you think about satire and,

1856
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:47.630
<v 0>um,
is that,</v>

1857
01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:51.560
and this was a time where government was seen as a more positive thing than it

1858
01:52:51.561 --> 01:52:56.100
is nowadays.
And so when you,
when you take,
when you're,

1859
01:52:56.330 --> 01:53:01.070
when you're using comedy to critique people,
it can be seen as a negative thing.

1860
01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:06.020
Right?
And so I'm sorry,
go ahead.
Oh,
so,
so yeah,
so like over and over again,

1861
01:53:06.021 --> 01:53:09.170
you sort of find this,
you find this idea of like,

1862
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:14.171
so I'm Thomas Hobbes and Leviathan talked about laughter arising from sudden

1863
01:53:14.961 --> 01:53:19.940
glory from,
from the sudden defeat of your enemies.
And you are,

1864
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:24.610
you're laughing as in this sort of superior position.
Hmm.
And,

1865
01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.560
and I mean,
you can see these things kind of today,
right?

1866
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:30.650
So people telling racist jokes,
people telling sexist jokes,

1867
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:35.180
people going too far with their bill Cosby jokes and making people upset they,

1868
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:38.180
um,
that it's not always used for good,

1869
01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:41.240
even if some people are laughing other people or not.

1870
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:45.950
So it can be a really divisive exclusive thing or it could be the kinds of

1871
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:48.500
things that we were talking about earlier where you're bringing everyone

1872
01:53:48.501 --> 01:53:52.940
together and celebrating some idea to you know,
together.

1873
01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:57.320
That's,
that's fascinating that it used to be thought of as a negative thing.

1874
01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:00.650
They used to be thought of like humor was only for mocking purposes.

1875
01:54:00.651 --> 01:54:03.430
That wasn't like a community gathering.

1876
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.630
One of the things about a standup comic you,

1877
01:54:06.631 --> 01:54:10.820
you sort of think of someone standing in front of a group of friends and you

1878
01:54:10.821 --> 01:54:11.654
know,

1879
01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:15.440
making a speech and everyone laugh and I've always imagined that that was sort

1880
01:54:15.441 --> 01:54:17.120
of the,
the origin of it.

1881
01:54:17.121 --> 01:54:20.840
Like someone being forced to make a speech somewhere and it's often been

1882
01:54:20.841 --> 01:54:22.400
attributed to mark twain.

1883
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:27.170
The Mark Twain did like book readings and he did speeches and he was notoriously

1884
01:54:27.171 --> 01:54:29.830
funny in these.
Yes.
And that he was kind of the,

1885
01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:32.960
the original standup comedians,

1886
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:36.260
social commentator slash political satirist.

1887
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:41.510
I think he's one of the funniest people ever to this day.

1888
01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:44.720
To this day,
he has got lines that could be written by a monitor comedian,

1889
01:54:44.721 --> 01:54:47.640
like his line about religion.
Like a religion was,
uh,

1890
01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:51.830
was created the first time a con man men,
a sucker or some,

1891
01:54:51.831 --> 01:54:55.130
something along those lines.
I'm paraphrasing it when the,
Oh,
it was,

1892
01:54:55.131 --> 01:54:58.310
the religion was created the first time a con man mate,
the for the,

1893
01:54:58.370 --> 01:55:01.730
for the first con men made the first fool.
So if you,

1894
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.220
if you doubt the benign violation theory,

1895
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:09.470
one of the best pieces of evidence for it is a quote that Mark Twain wrote.

1896
01:55:09.471 --> 01:55:13.640
He said that the secret source of humor is not joy,

1897
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:17.510
but sorrow.
There is no laughter in heaven.

1898
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.780
And like that,
to me,
that line is really profound because,

1899
01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:27.830
because what he's essentially saying is you need something wrong.

1900
01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:32.570
I'm sorry to repeat myself a lot.
I apologize.
But,
but because heaven's perfect,

1901
01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.960
because it's blissful.
It's a wonderful place to be,

1902
01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:40.100
but there's not jokes,
right.
You know,

1903
01:55:40.101 --> 01:55:44.280
because it's because with perfection you,
you do not get comedy.

1904
01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:45.870
<v 5>You need imperfection.</v>

1905
01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:49.700
<v 2>Well,
we're always struggling to try to achieve this ultimate state of bliss.</v>

1906
01:55:49.730 --> 01:55:53.570
We're always struggling to try to achieve this state of enlightenment and just

1907
01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.020
emptiness and being free of all of our negativity.

1908
01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:02.270
But what we appreciate and life is the triumphs over the hardships.

1909
01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:05.870
What we appreciate is,
you know,
the beer after the long hard day,

1910
01:56:06.110 --> 01:56:08.120
you don't want to just wake up and drink a beer.

1911
01:56:08.121 --> 01:56:10.010
You're missing the whole fucking point.
You know,

1912
01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:13.220
it's like the lottery winner is a classic example.

1913
01:56:13.221 --> 01:56:14.660
Someone's just handed some money.

1914
01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.990
They always wind up losing it and then I'd appreciate it.

1915
01:56:16.991 --> 01:56:19.130
It just all falls apart,
slips through their fingers.

1916
01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:20.990
Partially because they didn't earn it,

1917
01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:25.190
they didn't experience all the difficulty involved in getting to this incredible

1918
01:56:25.191 --> 01:56:29.690
state.
We have all these zeros in your bank account.
I think we need adversity.

1919
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:31.400
It's important for us.

1920
01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:36.180
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean well and you're going to have it as humans,
right?
Cause you know,</v>

1921
01:56:36.181 --> 01:56:39.760
there's this sort of like the,
the anthropologists of the world talk about how,

1922
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:44.980
um,
social,
like social interactions are about conflict,

1923
01:56:45.010 --> 01:56:48.210
right?
Fundamentally about conflict and um,

1924
01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:52.440
and you take away the conflict and then you take away that this,
you know,

1925
01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:56.430
the sorts of jokes.
Right?
Right.
And so in Twain,
you know,

1926
01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.560
identified that in a way that has really had a big effect on me because it is

1927
01:57:02.891 --> 01:57:04.510
counterintuitive.
Like you're sort of,

1928
01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:08.320
you're sort of furrowing your brow over this idea that that humor is this

1929
01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:13.300
negative thing like from a historical perspective.
But even,
you know,

1930
01:57:13.301 --> 01:57:13.901
even today,

1931
01:57:13.901 --> 01:57:18.310
even the conversations we have highlight how it's just a tool and you could use

1932
01:57:18.311 --> 01:57:21.010
it for good or you could use it for evil.
You know,

1933
01:57:21.011 --> 01:57:22.870
some people could be laughing and others not.

1934
01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.520
But I think we all agree that the best comedy does one of two things.

1935
01:57:27.521 --> 01:57:28.900
It either unites people,

1936
01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:33.730
it's very inclusive or it speaks truth to power,
you know,

1937
01:57:33.731 --> 01:57:38.170
so you're not putting down,
you're not putting down the PR,
the low status person,

1938
01:57:38.171 --> 01:57:40.180
but if you are going to put someone down and you put down the highest

1939
01:57:40.190 --> 01:57:43.070
<v 2>status person,
here's the problem with that,</v>

1940
01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.610
Sam kinisons bit about feeding starving people in Africa.

1941
01:57:47.150 --> 01:57:48.710
So one of the best bits ever,

1942
01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:51.920
and it's basically mocking starving people for being stupid enough to live in

1943
01:57:51.921 --> 01:57:54.260
the desert.
It's one of the greatest bits of all time.

1944
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:58.250
It's like you're sitting at home trying to enjoy some food you made from scratch

1945
01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.670
and this guy on TV,
well,
can you help?
Why don't you,
it's like,

1946
01:58:01.671 --> 01:58:04.690
why don't you help your right there?
He goes,
what do you do?
What you need to do?

1947
01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:05.870
Stop sending the money sound.

1948
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.990
People like me sending people that are going to go all the way over there and
go,

1949
01:58:08.991 --> 01:58:09.410
hey,

1950
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:12.950
we just drove five hours with your food and it occurred to us they wouldn't be

1951
01:58:12.951 --> 01:58:14.090
world hunger,
have you?

1952
01:58:14.091 --> 01:58:18.110
People will live with a phone and he goes to this whole crazy bid,

1953
01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:22.270
which is so wrong and so fucked up where he's taking starving people come here,

1954
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:23.720
come on mother fucker.
You know what that is,

1955
01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.900
that sand and it's to be a hundred years from now fucking sand.

1956
01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:29.840
We got deserts in America too.
We just don't live it.

1957
01:58:29.841 --> 01:58:33.300
I'm as hall and it's so oh wrong,

1958
01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:35.460
but so fucking hilarious.

1959
01:58:35.461 --> 01:58:40.110
It's one of the best bits ever and it's not punching up and punching up by any

1960
01:58:40.111 --> 01:58:44.050
stretch of the imagination,
so I don't buy that.
I think that that's,
that's,

1961
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:46.840
that is the problem with that.

1962
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:51.100
It's like a social justice standpoint and that it's not always applicable.

1963
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:51.671
There's a,

1964
01:58:51.671 --> 01:58:56.410
there's a sort of a contract that the audience has the comedian that we know

1965
01:58:56.411 --> 01:58:57.700
you're fucking around,
right?

1966
01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:00.850
We know Sam Kinison was in Africa and so kids were starving.

1967
01:59:00.851 --> 01:59:03.340
He wouldn't be grabbing them and making them eat dirt.
Yes.
Okay.

1968
01:59:03.341 --> 01:59:07.300
This is a joke and it's wrong and it's awful,
but it's amazing.

1969
01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:09.760
It's amazing because it's wrong and awful.
And the,

1970
01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:12.610
the African kids don't need to see it.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

1971
01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:14.920
We're just all together in this room and we're going to laugh at it.

1972
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:19.740
<v 5>So,
um,
I agree with you.
That funny is funny.
And,
and that's you and you know,</v>

1973
01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:23.040
my comedian buddies basically say it's not too soon if it's funny.
Right.

1974
01:59:23.050 --> 01:59:26.770
You know,
like that's the standard.
So that Joe,

1975
01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.860
so here's the challenge,
I think of,

1976
01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:33.940
of that joke today is because of social media that a joke that wasn't intended

1977
01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:41.680
to be broadly consumed,
but of course it was,
it was on HBO,

1978
01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:44.140
but,
well,
okay,
so,

1979
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:48.260
<v 2>so one of his best bits that he did on a young comedian special,
I mean it was a</v>

1980
01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:52.170
<v 5>all right.
Oh,
okay.
I mean,
but so,
so we went to,</v>

1981
01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:55.940
we actually went to Scandinavia to,
to,
um,

1982
01:59:56.170 --> 01:59:58.210
to look at the Mohammed cartoon controversy.

1983
01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:03.760
And that's an example though of now that the world is flat,

1984
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:09.060
that it causes problems because this group of fairly unfunny political cartoons

1985
02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:15.180
that were designed to punch down,
we're designed to,
to,
um,

1986
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:19.900
to make Muslims in Denmark feel not welcome,

1987
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:24.820
uh,
and created,
you know,
peaceful demonstrations there and so on.

1988
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:29.230
Somehow made their way to the Middle East and became part of a political,

1989
02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.930
may basically became a political tool.
And then,
you know,
like literally set,

1990
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:37.900
you know,
the Middle East on fire,
like riots,

1991
02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:41.680
hundreds of people dead and all that kind of stuff.
I'm cartoons from cartoons.

1992
02:00:41.710 --> 02:00:46.500
Well,
these were cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad drawn by,
you know,

1993
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:49.300
Danish people.

1994
02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:52.160
<v 2>Your perspective is the first time I ever heard it put that way,</v>

1995
02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:56.420
that part of the issue was the fact that the cartoons weren't good and that they

1996
02:00:56.421 --> 02:00:57.650
were punching down.

1997
02:00:58.420 --> 02:00:59.253
<v 5>Yes.</v>

1998
02:00:59.690 --> 02:01:01.480
<v 2>I'm not,
I haven't heard that before.
I,
I don't,</v>

1999
02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:04.100
I'm not familiar with the actual cartoons,

2000
02:01:04.130 --> 02:01:08.300
but what I've heard was just that they were cartoons and that religious

2001
02:01:08.301 --> 02:01:10.390
fundamentalists went fucking crazy and killed,

2002
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:14.540
<v 5>blow with them.
Well,
yeah,
that's true.
But um,
but that's not you,</v>

2003
02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.590
that's not the full story.
That's not the full,

2004
02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:22.660
so what happened was this sort of right wing newspaper invited cartoonists,

2005
02:01:23.151 --> 02:01:27.320
political cartoonist to submit cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.
Huh.

2006
02:01:27.590 --> 02:01:31.880
So there's nothing in the Qur'an that says you can't draw the Prophet Muhammad,

2007
02:01:31.881 --> 02:01:36.560
but part of Islamic culture,
it's sort of a no,
no.
Right.

2008
02:01:36.561 --> 02:01:40.370
There are some famous depictions of the Muhammad.
There's one in,

2009
02:01:40.730 --> 02:01:42.590
in the Supreme Court,
for instance,

2010
02:01:42.591 --> 02:01:46.940
that is Supreme Court of the United States.
Really?
Yes.

2011
02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:49.340
Do you think that's by design?
I don't know why it's there.

2012
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:51.740
It seems like an anti Islam sentiment.

2013
02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:56.630
Like maybe if they knew that that was a no,
no.
And they just said,
you know,

2014
02:01:56.631 --> 02:01:58.880
just put it up there to fuck with them.
I have no idea.

2015
02:01:58.881 --> 02:02:03.030
I shouldn't do not pull that up.
Okay.
So,

2016
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:06.380
so what they did was they invited these cartoonists to draw these cartoons and

2017
02:02:06.381 --> 02:02:08.650
the idea was it was,
it was sort of a,
uh,

2018
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:13.870
kind of like freedom of speech editorial draw Mohamad Day or something like

2019
02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:17.610
that.
They got like a dozen people who actually,
you know,

2020
02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:20.960
drew these things and some of them were,
were jokes on the newspaper.

2021
02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:25.460
So this Guy Lars reffing that we met,
he drew a picture of,

2022
02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:30.620
of this kid named Mohammed and he wrote on a chalkboard in Danish,

2023
02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:34.460
you know,
this newspapers,
a bunch of like,
you know,
right wing fascists.
Right.

2024
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:38.170
So he,
because he,
they said they would publish anything that they receive.

2025
02:02:39.650 --> 02:02:41.300
Another guy,
um,
who,

2026
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:46.100
who drew actually a picture of the prophet with a turban turned bomb.

2027
02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:49.880
So it had like the old cannon ball bomb coming out of one kind of thing.

2028
02:02:50.230 --> 02:02:51.590
That's the really the one that,

2029
02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.470
that is like the most upsetting of all of these kinds of things.

2030
02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.480
What in initially in Denmark,
uh,

2031
02:02:59.510 --> 02:03:01.290
there were protests,
so they'll,

2032
02:03:01.291 --> 02:03:04.520
5% of the population is Muslim in Denmark.

2033
02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.300
It's a very small part of the population and it's,
you know,

2034
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:11.050
those folks have their struggles there.
It's,
you know,

2035
02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:15.260
it's otherwise a really homogenous place.
They engaged in,
in demonstration,

2036
02:03:15.261 --> 02:03:19.280
a peaceful demonstration over all of this.
They weren't happy about it,

2037
02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:23.840
kind of liberal folks in,
in Denmark weren't happy about it,

2038
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:25.520
but you know,

2039
02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:29.120
it's freedom of speech and you've got to kind of deal with this kind of stuff on

2040
02:03:29.121 --> 02:03:31.010
occasion.
And then it sort of went away.

2041
02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:35.090
And it wasn't until later someone essentially brought the,

2042
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.390
the drawings to the mid,
well actually that's not true.

2043
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:43.430
There was some conversation between countries in the Middle East and the

2044
02:03:43.971 --> 02:03:45.230
government and,

2045
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:50.290
and the government stonewalled because we know that we know that this didn't

2046
02:03:50.451 --> 02:03:52.220
have to happen because Sweden,

2047
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:57.170
what happen when you say didn't have was that,
um,

2048
02:03:57.230 --> 02:04:02.060
so then what ended up happening basically was that folks took these cartoons,

2049
02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.770
you know,
to Syria and so on.

2050
02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:08.800
And the Syrian government use this as a way to get people really fired up.

2051
02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:14.150
And then to turn this into is kind of an international,
um,
conflict.

2052
02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:18.770
And,
but we know that this was largely political,

2053
02:04:19.570 --> 02:04:22.820
um,
because I,
like a year later,

2054
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:26.810
the same kind of thing could have happened in Sweden.

2055
02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:31.840
So this artist drew even more inciting cartoons,

2056
02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:36.380
whether they were actually drawings of Mohammed's head on the body of a dog.

2057
02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:42.000
He do like three panels of this stuff and it,
it showed up in an art gallery.

2058
02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:47.610
And that's even more insulting culturally,
you know,
and so,

2059
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:49.170
but what happened very,

2060
02:04:49.171 --> 02:04:53.940
very quickly was the Swedish government apologized.

2061
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:57.360
They just basically said,
we don't think this is right.

2062
02:04:57.390 --> 02:05:00.480
We're very sorry that this happened.
Um,

2063
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:02.460
they didn't get to a place where they were just like,
oh,

2064
02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:04.980
well this is freedom of speech.
He can do whatever he wants.

2065
02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.480
And that's sort of what happened with the,

2066
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:08.850
with the Danish government at that time.

2067
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:14.310
And so it ended up becoming this like really crazy like political tool.
Um,

2068
02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:15.301
you know,

2069
02:05:15.301 --> 02:05:18.000
and I ended up getting spread because of the Internet and a lot of people saw

2070
02:05:18.001 --> 02:05:21.360
this stuff who would never normally have seen it and,
and so on.

2071
02:05:21.361 --> 02:05:23.700
And so in that way,
I mean,
I,
you know,

2072
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:26.490
like whether the cartoonists were being insensitive or not,
it depends.

2073
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:28.790
<v 2>But what is insensitive?
I mean,
you're,</v>

2074
02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:33.970
you're mocking an ideology that's based on animal skins are based on some shit

2075
02:05:34.761 --> 02:05:36.620
that was passed on for generation and generation.

2076
02:05:36.621 --> 02:05:39.320
If you're talking about Christianity,
you're talking about Scientology.

2077
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:41.150
What I mean when you're mocking things,

2078
02:05:41.151 --> 02:05:44.540
if you find something to mock about something and it rings true enough that

2079
02:05:44.541 --> 02:05:47.210
people laugh at it,
what is insulting?

2080
02:05:47.211 --> 02:05:51.260
He's insulting that they found something ridiculous about your ideology or is

2081
02:05:51.261 --> 02:05:55.850
it's insulting that they're bothering to critique your ideology at all or mock

2082
02:05:55.851 --> 02:05:59.690
your ideology?
At all and aren't ideologies open targets?

2083
02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:03.720
<v 5>Well,
so I think so according to,
um,
to uh,</v>

2084
02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:07.390
political cartoonists.
Absolutely right.
I mean,
I think that's the,

2085
02:06:07.391 --> 02:06:11.690
that that's what does it,
who's it not according to who?
Well,

2086
02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:13.270
so I think the idea is this,

2087
02:06:13.271 --> 02:06:18.190
is that what you can have is some people laughing and some people horrified.

2088
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:21.310
Right.
You know,
and so this is the,
the idea.
I mean,

2089
02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:24.640
I mean it really depends on what is your goal.

2090
02:06:24.641 --> 02:06:27.010
Like what is your level of sensitivity?
What is your goal?

2091
02:06:27.011 --> 02:06:30.340
If your goal is to point out what's wrong with the world and to critique the

2092
02:06:30.341 --> 02:06:32.350
world,
then you,
then you're just like,
well,
you know,

2093
02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:35.200
if you want to make an Omelet,
you've got to break some eggs,
you know,

2094
02:06:35.201 --> 02:06:40.120
and so that's fine.
Um,
but if you do,
if you don't want to put,

2095
02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.130
if you don't want to punch down,

2096
02:06:42.910 --> 02:06:44.440
<v 2>is that punching down though?
I mean,</v>

2097
02:06:44.441 --> 02:06:48.790
is it punching down when you're mocking a controlling ideology that's

2098
02:06:48.791 --> 02:06:51.670
responsible for some really regressive ideas?

2099
02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.640
I mean like the way they treat women,

2100
02:06:54.641 --> 02:06:57.550
that women's rights to vote and drive the,
the,

2101
02:06:57.551 --> 02:07:00.820
just the wearing of the stoning for adultery,

2102
02:07:00.970 --> 02:07:05.290
all the across the board,
things that are a part of Islam.
That's a,

2103
02:07:05.291 --> 02:07:09.430
that seems to me at least to be a divisive and damaging sort of ideology.

2104
02:07:09.431 --> 02:07:12.070
I don't think it's punching down to mock something.

2105
02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:15.070
<v 5>Well in the,
I think in the case of the Mohammed cartoons,</v>

2106
02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:20.100
it was in part because what this newspaper essentially was doing was saying,

2107
02:07:21.730 --> 02:07:23.540
if you want to be part of our culture,
you,

2108
02:07:23.650 --> 02:07:27.940
you need to be able to laugh about these kinds of things.
And so it was,

2109
02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:32.930
it was being used to sort of set these folks apart.
I mean,
you know,
and so,
um,

2110
02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.990
regardless of what you might think of Islam in,

2111
02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:39.160
I think the intentions of the newspaper in that case,

2112
02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:41.670
it's hard to see how

2113
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.360
<v 2>that,
it was terribly like righteous.
What,
so I'm confused.
It was just,</v>

2114
02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:49.920
that was the most offensive one was Muhammad with his turban was a bomb.
Yes.

2115
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:53.580
That was the most offensive it was.
And in relation to

2116
02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:56.910
an ideology that has,
you know,

2117
02:07:56.911 --> 02:08:01.050
obviously the most radical aspects of it and not supported by a vast majority of

2118
02:08:01.051 --> 02:08:05.100
the Muslim population,
but it has been a large amount of suicide bombings.

2119
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:07.210
It not in Denmark,
not in Denver.

2120
02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:11.820
Right across the world with that are associated with Islam,
radical Islam,

2121
02:08:12.130 --> 02:08:12.963
jihadists.

2122
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:16.960
<v 5>Oh yeah.
I mean,
look,
I mean,
you know,
take any,
um,</v>

2123
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:22.250
take any major religion and you can find a great deal of violence perpetrated in

2124
02:08:22.251 --> 02:08:26.200
the name of that,
right.
Religion,
right?
Like it's just,
it just happens to be,

2125
02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:29.660
nowadays you're finding it in,
in Islam,
but it,

2126
02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:33.350
you've seen it in Catholicism and seen it elsewhere,
right?
I mean,
you know,
so,

2127
02:08:34.130 --> 02:08:37.370
uh,
I look,
I'm all for the idea of,
um,

2128
02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:41.540
of critiquing,
whether it be religion,
whether it be in government.
I mean,

2129
02:08:41.541 --> 02:08:42.374
now we're just getting into my

2130
02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:43.870
<v 2>personal opinions about these things,</v>

2131
02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:46.900
but certainly we're getting into thoughts about what is punching up and what is

2132
02:08:46.901 --> 02:08:47.590
punching down.

2133
02:08:47.590 --> 02:08:52.590
Like Islamophobia is a very strange thing that has like recently joined our

2134
02:08:53.290 --> 02:08:57.370
vernacular.
And when you,
you can mock God like the,

2135
02:08:57.371 --> 02:09:01.100
the angry man in the clouds,
all you want,
you can mock Jesus.
I mean,

2136
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:04.570
Sam Kinison had hilarious jokes about cheeses.
Like people,

2137
02:09:04.571 --> 02:09:06.310
you think Jesus is coming back and here we go.

2138
02:09:06.311 --> 02:09:10.720
I think the last thing that Jesus ever said was,
oh,
not my left hand out.

2139
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:13.060
Like he would go,
I think this is the last thing we ever heard from him.

2140
02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:16.990
And he did this whole thing about Jesus and Jesus being married and all this

2141
02:09:16.991 --> 02:09:19.730
crazy shit.
And nobody,
you know,

2142
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:22.720
I mean he was a Christian for at least started out as a Christian.

2143
02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:27.580
Nobody like accused him of Christian of phobia or it wasn't thought of as an

2144
02:09:27.590 --> 02:09:29.400
affront to a minority

2145
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:30.290
<v 5>group.</v>

2146
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:35.290
But that doesn't mean that that Sam's stuff wasn't terribly offensive to

2147
02:09:35.361 --> 02:09:38.070
Christian to some Christian,
some Christians.
Sure.

2148
02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:43.190
I mean that's essentially what we're,
what we're talking about is like,
so is it,

2149
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:44.233
you know,

2150
02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:49.490
it's one thing to make fun of the pope and versus like,
you know,

2151
02:09:49.491 --> 02:09:51.380
taking something that people hold dear,

2152
02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:54.770
<v 2>but why do they hold it dear there?
There were the whole thing that that comp,</v>

2153
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:59.090
that comedy attacks is what is causing you to believe in this,

2154
02:09:59.330 --> 02:10:02.600
what is called,
if I can mock it and I can find holes in it.

2155
02:10:02.601 --> 02:10:05.280
And you say that that's offensive.
Well then you're saying the comedies offense.

2156
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:05.710
No,
no,

2157
02:10:05.710 --> 02:10:10.300
<v 5>no.
I want it to be very clear.
So the idea of what I,
what I,</v>

2158
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:15.510
the point that I wanted to make is that in a world in modern day is that a joke

2159
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:23.550
that was very funny and intended for this audience that never would have reached

2160
02:10:23.741 --> 02:10:25.000
them 20 years ago.

2161
02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:30.060
Now w w w I never reach another audience that finds that joke terribly offensive

2162
02:10:30.281 --> 02:10:33.860
and,
and,
and,
you know,
some of it is just like,
okay,
well that just happens.

2163
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:36.620
You know what joke you referring to?
Whatever joke it may be,

2164
02:10:36.621 --> 02:10:38.010
like whatever happens in,

2165
02:10:38.090 --> 02:10:41.570
in comedy club x shows up on Youtube and people are like,

2166
02:10:41.571 --> 02:10:45.530
I can't believe that person was making a rape joke or these kinds of things.

2167
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:50.330
The Mohammed cartoon controversy is an extreme version of that,

2168
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:53.610
that,
um,
these cartoons should have had their,
you know,

2169
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:56.390
15 minutes of fame in Denmark.

2170
02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:01.130
They created a bit of conflict,
peaceful protests and so on,

2171
02:11:01.131 --> 02:11:05.720
made people feel a little bit,
you know,
set aside,
um,

2172
02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:07.220
and that could have passed that,

2173
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:12.250
that now is a much more dangerous thing nowadays because information can,

2174
02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:17.360
you can go on Google and pull them up and see these things,
you know,
in that way.

2175
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:19.220
And that,
to me,
that was like a surprising,

2176
02:11:19.221 --> 02:11:23.230
fascinating thing about the world of comedy.
Now I know that,

2177
02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:27.770
that it's impossible to make a something universally funny because people are

2178
02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:32.300
two different.
Um,
and uh,

2179
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:34.970
whether and how you want to go about making your comment.

2180
02:11:34.971 --> 02:11:38.360
I'm not going to tell someone how to go about making their comedy or not who

2181
02:11:38.361 --> 02:11:41.120
they want to make the victim and who they want to make fun of and all that kind

2182
02:11:41.121 --> 02:11:45.500
of stuff.
I mean,
that's,
that's up to the,
to the artist,

2183
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.230
<v 0>right?
But I get confused.</v>

2184
02:11:48.231 --> 02:11:51.920
I mean if you're doing standup comedy or are you doing satire and political

2185
02:11:51.921 --> 02:11:56.150
satire and cartoons,
if that's the most offensive thing?

2186
02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:00.860
I think the issue at all is this cartoon.

2187
02:12:00.861 --> 02:12:05.090
I think the issue is the reaction to satire,
the reaction to comedy.
I mean,

2188
02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:09.920
people are really burning things in the street and over a guy with a bomb in his

2189
02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:10.640
turban.

2190
02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:14.660
I think that the true issue is who are these people and why are they freaking

2191
02:12:14.661 --> 02:12:18.620
the fuck out over a cartoon?
Yeah.
Well that's a complete total overreaction.

2192
02:12:18.621 --> 02:12:22.740
I don't think that's punching down.
Yeah,
I agree with you about this.
No rash.
The,

2193
02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:26.300
the fault lies though in the Syrian government in this,

2194
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:29.000
in this particular situation,
because she has stars,

2195
02:12:29.001 --> 02:12:31.070
they got ahold of the letting it happen.
I mean this is,

2196
02:12:31.071 --> 02:12:35.450
this is a place at the time that,
that,
you know,
everybody was under their thumb,

2197
02:12:35.451 --> 02:12:38.970
so they let these riots happened,
right?
They wanted the riots to happen.

2198
02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.830
You know what I mean?
So that it,

2199
02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:45.470
so that chapter in the book reads a little bit like a mystery novel,
right?

2200
02:12:45.471 --> 02:12:48.620
Because we're sort of uncovering these clues along the way.

2201
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:54.010
Trying to figure out like how did this bizarre situation actually occur?

2202
02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:56.570
Being at a university and you know,

2203
02:12:56.571 --> 02:13:00.350
being an academic and being around like really progressive people all the time.

2204
02:13:00.351 --> 02:13:04.550
Do you think it necessarily flavor is your idea of what is and isn't acceptable

2205
02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:07.340
in terms of comedy?
Cause that that term punching up,

2206
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:10.270
you've used it several times and that's a term that a,

2207
02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:15.020
you see all the time when people are criticizing Comedians for,

2208
02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.350
you know,
a really extreme acts or offensive,

2209
02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:22.310
they would consider be offensive jokes even if it's tongue and cheek or what

2210
02:13:22.311 --> 02:13:26.870
have you.
Like this concept of punching up is like,
it's fairly fairly,

2211
02:13:26.871 --> 02:13:31.740
uh,
current.
Yeah,
I'd say,
um,
I picked that up from the world of comedy,

2212
02:13:31.741 --> 02:13:31.980
not

2213
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.800
<v 5>from right when scholars.
Uh,
but I do,
I do.
Yeah.
I certainly,
you know,</v>

2214
02:13:36.810 --> 02:13:41.800
Ha I certainly ha like spend time in faculty meetings with,
uh,

2215
02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:45.330
my fair share of like super progressive indeed.
Yeah.
I mean,

2216
02:13:45.331 --> 02:13:48.630
I'm in a business school so they're not like totally outrageous.

2217
02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:51.390
Progressive's but,
but I can see you like,

2218
02:13:51.391 --> 02:13:54.860
hey your words and you like tread lightly on,
so you mean you,

2219
02:13:54.861 --> 02:13:58.690
you dance the dance of a man with tenure.
Wait,

2220
02:13:58.710 --> 02:14:01.860
I've got tenure so I could go even further than I probably a couple of drinks in

2221
02:14:01.861 --> 02:14:04.860
you.
You know,
that's really what we need.

2222
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:09.210
I mean I understand,
I get it.

2223
02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.300
<v 2>Tension to me should be everything.
And if it's your,</v>

2224
02:14:12.301 --> 02:14:15.780
your intention to get violent and upset because someone mocks what you think is

2225
02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:18.480
divine,
that's you're a crazy person.

2226
02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:22.110
And if they don't make fun of crazy people that are willing to riot and light

2227
02:14:22.111 --> 02:14:24.540
things on fire,
regardless of the motivation behind it,

2228
02:14:24.541 --> 02:14:26.460
like who started it and who instigated them,

2229
02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:29.940
at the end of the day a guy drew a cartoon and you want to kill him.

2230
02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.500
Like that's the humor.
It's,

2231
02:14:31.501 --> 02:14:35.130
and there's no punching down there that that's is like,
if that created that,

2232
02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.450
that's good.
That's like mocking the ridiculousness of this civilization.

2233
02:14:39.690 --> 02:14:43.650
Mocking the ridiculousness of ideology and how attached people become to them

2234
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:46.260
with all,
that's all it is.
A bomb and a hat.

2235
02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:50.480
<v 5>Yeah.
So,
so I'll tell you,
I agree with you in this,</v>

2236
02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:51.950
I agree with you in this way.

2237
02:14:51.951 --> 02:14:56.310
The I've met the cartoon is he now lives under armed guard God.

2238
02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:59.480
And so I like,
I like peed in his panic room.

2239
02:14:59.481 --> 02:15:01.610
Like his bathroom has been converted into a panic room.

2240
02:15:02.050 --> 02:15:07.050
I'll on all of his walls throughout his house are pictures of,

2241
02:15:08.010 --> 02:15:12.130
um,
of him doing this to any religion more or less.
Right.
So,

2242
02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.670
so for him,
he's,
he's just punching like,
to him it doesn't matter.

2243
02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.110
He's just like,
I'm there to satirize.
Right.
And so for him,

2244
02:15:21.111 --> 02:15:24.770
he's not like,
people might seem as an Islamophobe or whatever it may be,

2245
02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:27.320
but he does this with Christians.
He does this with Jews.

2246
02:15:27.321 --> 02:15:31.880
He does his holes everywhere.
That's what he does for,
for a living.

2247
02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:33.560
Right.
You know,
in that,
in that way.

2248
02:15:33.561 --> 02:15:36.380
And so he doesn't think what he did is wrong and he would,

2249
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:40.100
I suspect probably not do it again.
I don't know.

2250
02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:43.440
It's a good question.
Again,
crazy.
If you did,

2251
02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:47.390
I mean get some guy break into his house with an ax and he had to like hide in

2252
02:15:47.391 --> 02:15:50.660
his panic room until the wow,

2253
02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:53.090
the equivalent of the FBI came and shot the guy.

2254
02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:56.810
<v 2>It's crazy.
Well there was the guy that got stabbed,</v>

2255
02:15:56.811 --> 02:15:58.670
there was a guy in Holland was in it.

2256
02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:03.470
The guy who got murdered for some depiction of Mohammed has been more than one

2257
02:16:03.471 --> 02:16:07.010
attack.
And that's,
look whenever religion says that if you draw,

2258
02:16:07.011 --> 02:16:10.800
our guy will kill you.
Like that is crossing a line.
You know,

2259
02:16:10.801 --> 02:16:15.230
and I think there's this,
there's this trend in this society especially,

2260
02:16:15.610 --> 02:16:16.250
um,

2261
02:16:16.250 --> 02:16:21.250
towards nonviolence and towards recognizing also that the amount of aggression

2262
02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:26.090
that it's directed towards Muslims is possibly racist.

2263
02:16:26.091 --> 02:16:31.091
And most certainly due to the fact that we have been involved in a prolonged war

2264
02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:32.620
with the Middle East.

2265
02:16:32.770 --> 02:16:35.930
And I think people are recognizing that there's a lot of the aspects of this war

2266
02:16:35.931 --> 02:16:37.660
were unjust and they,

2267
02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:42.520
they segment those people off as being marginalized and to be protected with

2268
02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:46.960
extreme prejudice as opposed to maybe some Christians who live in Iowa,

2269
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:49.120
which were to be openly mocked you.

2270
02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:52.510
Now like no one gets in trouble for mocking Christianity,

2271
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:57.050
but if you mock Islam,
yeah,
I mean how many times has it people living in a Clu?

2272
02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:00.880
Islamophobic is a strange thing to say because first of all,
you,
you,
you,

2273
02:17:00.970 --> 02:17:04.660
you think of it as a racism thing,
but it's not a race.
It's a religion.

2274
02:17:04.661 --> 02:17:08.140
It's an ideology and there's a lot of atheists that live in Pakistan.

2275
02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:10.030
There's atheists that live in Syria,

2276
02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:13.690
there's atheists that live in Muslim strongholds.
It's an ideology.
It's not,

2277
02:17:13.691 --> 02:17:16.630
it has nothing to do with,
with a race.

2278
02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:20.800
It's just attached to a race because of a large majority of the people in that

2279
02:17:20.801 --> 02:17:22.990
race have this ideology that they subscribed to,

2280
02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:27.070
but it's just an operating system and this guy's the only mocking an operating

2281
02:17:27.071 --> 02:17:29.860
system.
He's not necessarily mocking everyone.

2282
02:17:29.861 --> 02:17:34.861
That has been unfortunate enough to be indoctrinated into some incredibly

2283
02:17:35.171 --> 02:17:37.480
controlling and archaic ideology.

2284
02:17:38.610 --> 02:17:43.320
<v 5>Okay.
I'm not,
I do,
you know what I'm saying?
I understand your point.
I really do.</v>

2285
02:17:43.590 --> 02:17:45.960
Yeah,
I do.
It's just I the punching down thing,

2286
02:17:45.961 --> 02:17:50.100
I was confusing and you're waiting to find him.
Maybe I missed that.
I,
uh,

2287
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:53.220
yeah.
So I mean I do have,

2288
02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.030
I tend to think about these things in terms of like what are the kind of

2289
02:17:57.031 --> 02:18:00.980
behavioral and social effects,
right?

2290
02:18:01.590 --> 02:18:04.860
And I,
um,
and again,
I'm not,

2291
02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:08.550
I don't think about comedy.
I'm,

2292
02:18:08.551 --> 02:18:10.980
I'm thinking about like humor,
like,
you know,

2293
02:18:10.981 --> 02:18:15.420
imagine humor in the workplace and in couples and among friends and,

2294
02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:16.650
and all these kinds of things.

2295
02:18:16.651 --> 02:18:21.651
And I generally do believe that this idea of the best comedy,

2296
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:25.380
whether it be professional or otherwise,

2297
02:18:27.090 --> 02:18:32.070
unites people and when it doesn't,
when it divides people,

2298
02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:35.190
it's trying to keep an eye out for the week.

2299
02:18:36.210 --> 02:18:40.350
It's trying to keep an eye out for the oppressed.
That's my own personal opinion.

2300
02:18:40.570 --> 02:18:43.980
That's my own personal opinion.
Like if it's just a matter of getting laughs,

2301
02:18:43.981 --> 02:18:44.641
that's something else.

2302
02:18:44.641 --> 02:18:48.760
But if you want to try to take that laughs to the next level,
um,

2303
02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:51.390
that's how,
that's the framework that I,

2304
02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:55.410
I use in terms of trying to measure a goodness,
so to speak,

2305
02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:57.593
but that,

2306
02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:02.660
that idea could evolve as I think more about this kind of stuff because some of

2307
02:19:02.731 --> 02:19:04.260
it is by virtue of,

2308
02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:09.270
I only want to use the start punching up.
You're like,

2309
02:19:09.271 --> 02:19:12.590
so if you are a liberal making fun of,
uh,

2310
02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.550
the new Republican Senate,

2311
02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:18.390
you're going to upset conservatives.
Right?

2312
02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:23.400
And so I think what you're trying to say is what appears to be punching up or

2313
02:19:23.491 --> 02:19:27.950
punching down isn't necessarily the case because there's so many different out

2314
02:19:27.951 --> 02:19:28.220
there.

2315
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:29.001
<v 0>Not only that,</v>

2316
02:19:29.001 --> 02:19:33.590
there's a lot of people that fancy themselves as being very sensitive and very

2317
02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:34.730
kind,
very open,

2318
02:19:34.731 --> 02:19:39.290
but they are absolutely vicious in their attacks on people who don't support

2319
02:19:39.291 --> 02:19:43.810
their ideology.
And they will call it punching up.
You will call it punch.

2320
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.770
But what you're doing is,
you know,

2321
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:49.010
you have a different point of view on fill in the blank,
gun control,

2322
02:19:49.011 --> 02:19:53.210
whatever the fuck it is.
And because they are deemed to be the enemy,

2323
02:19:53.211 --> 02:19:57.530
you have a green light to attack them.
Yes.
And in my opinion,

2324
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:01.310
a lot of it is a lack of a psychedelic perspective and that a lot of these

2325
02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:02.750
people that form groups,

2326
02:20:02.751 --> 02:20:07.400
they formed tribes and they stick within the confines of that tribe.
I mean this,

2327
02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:10.880
this,
this is the enemy of religion and psychedelics.

2328
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:15.050
And when you look at ideologies,
especially really super rigid ideologies,

2329
02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:19.400
they have to be enforced then the Islamophobia idea,

2330
02:20:19.401 --> 02:20:24.401
like the criticizing of Islam being like mocking of a religion that do I do get

2331
02:20:27.351 --> 02:20:31.170
it.
I get it.
Well,
you're W so,
um,

2332
02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:34.400
I understand what you're saying here is basically saying it's like if you,

2333
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:37.880
that is not to say that you can't,
um,

2334
02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:44.380
critique this religion comedically or otherwise because it hurts some people

2335
02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:47.810
within it,
uh,

2336
02:20:47.930 --> 02:20:51.860
ends up being too narrow minded because you should be able to,
of course,

2337
02:20:51.890 --> 02:20:52.940
to critique.

2338
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:54.433
<v 6>MMM.</v>

2339
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:57.730
<v 0>Right.
So if you just say,
oh,
well you can't do that because you're hurting,</v>

2340
02:20:57.731 --> 02:20:59.030
this group of people will now there,

2341
02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:02.500
there is some great benefit of critiquing whatever system of oppression,

2342
02:21:02.501 --> 02:21:05.740
system of power that exists.
If you can make someone laugh,

2343
02:21:05.770 --> 02:21:07.390
like if you have an opinion,
I have an opinion.

2344
02:21:07.391 --> 02:21:10.630
You Go onstage and you state your opinion and I go,
well,
I disagree.

2345
02:21:10.631 --> 02:21:11.440
I have a different opinion.

2346
02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:14.600
But if you make me laugh with your opinion and I'm almost 40

2347
02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:18.460
where we're doing,
right,
right.
But look,

2348
02:21:18.461 --> 02:21:23.110
there's a lot of people that have valid opinions that you might not agree with,

2349
02:21:23.111 --> 02:21:25.360
but if you are a progressive or your liberal,

2350
02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:28.270
it seems that there's an open target to mock them.

2351
02:21:28.271 --> 02:21:32.290
Like here's a perfect example is people who don't believe in abortion,
and I'm,

2352
02:21:32.410 --> 02:21:35.590
I should preface this,
I'm pro choice 100% always have been.

2353
02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:39.910
I think a woman's right to choose is as a very important part of our culture.

2354
02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:45.010
The morning after pill,
you know?
But the reality is what is going on?

2355
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:49.870
There's something in your body that could become a life and you choose to stop

2356
02:21:49.871 --> 02:21:51.450
that from taking place.
Okay.

2357
02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:56.580
Some people have a fundamental problem with that because they think that it's

2358
02:21:56.681 --> 02:22:01.210
killing a life.
Right.
And the to,
to pretend that this isn't a debatable issue,

2359
02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:05.860
I think is completely disingenuous.
It does become a person eventually.

2360
02:22:06.010 --> 02:22:08.860
I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do it.
I'm saying you absolutely should,

2361
02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:11.830
and it's not my fucking business at all.
Okay.
But

2362
02:22:12.850 --> 02:22:14.980
people who don't believe in abortion,

2363
02:22:15.370 --> 02:22:19.090
it will be marked as being stupid,
as being ignorant,

2364
02:22:19.091 --> 02:22:22.500
as being religious anti woman.
You know that they'll fucking,

2365
02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:27.680
I'd say the most venomous vile shit about because it doesn't conform with their

2366
02:22:27.691 --> 02:22:32.580
very rigid tribal ideology.
That tribe of progressive's.
Yeah,

2367
02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:37.080
I agree.
When a tribe of Christians pro pro life,

2368
02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:41.550
they would never consider the possibility that it's just a few cells.
Like if I,

2369
02:22:41.551 --> 02:22:45.240
if I just give you a pill and those three,
it's three cells.
No,
it's still life.

2370
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:49.380
It's fucking three cells.
It's three cells.
We stopped three cells would,

2371
02:22:49.381 --> 02:22:53.610
if it gets to six,
can we stop it at six?
It's a real debate.
Yeah,

2372
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:56.650
I agree with you.
It's a real debate actually.
It's,
uh,
you know,

2373
02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:00.420
if you can take a relative relativist perspective,

2374
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:02.880
you can see how very clearly it's a real debate.

2375
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:07.590
Like you can understand why someone would be yes.
Antiabortion yes,
you can.

2376
02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:11.310
I mean,
I'm not,
but I can understand.
I see it too,
but to pretend that it,

2377
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:14.150
that it's,
that it's ignorant and to,

2378
02:23:14.151 --> 02:23:17.340
to go after it with Vimy vial and,
and the,

2379
02:23:17.341 --> 02:23:21.610
and obviously the opposite happens too,
right?
And it's on both sides.
Yeah.

2380
02:23:21.730 --> 02:23:24.880
And now were so,
but,

2381
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.860
so my question for you is where does this stop?
So let's say,
so,
um,
I,

2382
02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:33.570
I wrote a tweet today that said,
uh,
there's a street in la called climate change,

2383
02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:37.200
right?
Like,
I just,
you know,
can I saw I pass his ozone street?

2384
02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:40.950
I thought that would be a funny tweet.
It clearly didn't work.
Not Great,

2385
02:23:41.430 --> 02:23:45.540
but perspective context.
But like,
you're like,
all right,
well,

2386
02:23:45.541 --> 02:23:50.010
how much should we be debating climate change at this point?
Right.
You know,

2387
02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:53.460
because like in my opinion that's,
it's like the,

2388
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.260
it's not overwhelming but it's pretty damn close,
you know?
Um,

2389
02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:02.190
and so at some point like,
so in this abortion one,

2390
02:24:02.191 --> 02:24:05.580
I think you and I can agree whatever our own personal opinion is,

2391
02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:09.120
I can see how another person would have exactly the opposite and have very good

2392
02:24:09.121 --> 02:24:10.740
reasons to believe that yes.

2393
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:15.010
At what point does it become a situation where you go,
no,
you're wrong.
Well,

2394
02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.890
when it comes to the climate change,

2395
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:20.250
but the real issue is what information do you have at your disposal?

2396
02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:23.940
Like are you a geologist,
are you a,
do you have a degree?

2397
02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:26.400
And understanding the cycles of,

2398
02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:30.810
of whether or you just parroting some shit you read on some wacky right wing

2399
02:24:30.811 --> 02:24:35.040
website.
I mean,
I don't know if you want to talk to someone about climate change.

2400
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:38.550
There's so many variables when it comes to climate change that are absolutely

2401
02:24:38.551 --> 02:24:39.570
incredibly fascinating.

2402
02:24:39.571 --> 02:24:43.680
Like the fact that North America at one point in time was under a mile high

2403
02:24:43.681 --> 02:24:46.770
sheet of ice and that global cooling,

2404
02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:51.300
which has been a part of reality throughout time is much more terrifying than

2405
02:24:51.301 --> 02:24:54.300
global warming.
There's all sorts of things.
Everyone's,
the sky is falling,

2406
02:24:54.301 --> 02:24:57.300
the sky is falling and I think that human beings are disgusting,

2407
02:24:57.301 --> 02:24:59.220
dirty creatures that pollute everywhere we go.

2408
02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:02.970
I've seen eight Prius's of keeping track of it.
Eight Prius's in my life,

2409
02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:04.440
throw cigarettes out the window.

2410
02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:08.700
We're fucking gross were gross and a lot of ways a lot of us are gross.

2411
02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:13.410
So there's no debate that we fucked up the atmosphere that my debate is how much

2412
02:25:13.411 --> 02:25:14.640
does everybody say,

2413
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:18.150
you know that global warming is here in climate change is caused by people.

2414
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:22.770
How much information do they individually have before they start espousing these

2415
02:25:22.771 --> 02:25:23.920
ideas?
And I say very,
yeah.

2416
02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:26.380
<v 5>Oh I agree with that.
I will read,</v>

2417
02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:29.200
<v 2>have you ever read to Chuck Woolery is Twitter,
you remember him from lifting to?</v>

2418
02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:32.330
Of course we went back in two and two.
He's a whack job.

2419
02:25:32.331 --> 02:25:36.320
He's a crazy super right wing.
Obama hater,

2420
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:40.730
non climate change believer,
listen to,
I read his tweets all the time.

2421
02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:42.440
He was going crazy because of the snow

2422
02:25:42.570 --> 02:25:46.980
<v 5>buffalo lake effect stuff.
Evidence that there's no global warming.
I'm like,</v>

2423
02:25:49.130 --> 02:25:52.080
no,
actually it's global warming that's contributing to that because there's like

2424
02:25:52.081 --> 02:25:55.770
climate change.
So yeah.
I mean I'll tell you this,

2425
02:25:55.771 --> 02:26:00.420
one of the things that's been really fun as a scientist is getting to do what

2426
02:26:00.421 --> 02:26:05.421
we're doing because scientists are really terrible about getting their ideas out

2427
02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:11.850
into the public discourse because they're not rewarded for it.
Right?
So,

2428
02:26:12.090 --> 02:26:16.680
so I get rewarded too to write peer reviewed publications that very few people

2429
02:26:16.681 --> 02:26:21.090
read,
even fewer people cite and use for future research.

2430
02:26:21.690 --> 02:26:23.310
Um,
but because I,
you know,

2431
02:26:23.311 --> 02:26:26.490
I wrote this book and I blog and I do all this kind of stuff.

2432
02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:31.760
Now I can enter into a conversation with more than just other scientists.

2433
02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:36.330
If scientists were,
were much better about getting their ideas out there,

2434
02:26:36.331 --> 02:26:40.140
they could actually.
Um,
so cause you know,

2435
02:26:40.141 --> 02:26:42.720
politicians are very good about getting their ideas out.

2436
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:46.620
No matter how good or bad the ideas are.
Scientists are really terrible about it.

2437
02:26:46.621 --> 02:26:49.530
But they worked very hard to get their ideas right.
You know,

2438
02:26:49.531 --> 02:26:52.920
that's their advantage.
Um,
and so you're,

2439
02:26:52.921 --> 02:26:56.430
you see this in the sort of climate change you like now they have to rely on

2440
02:26:56.431 --> 02:26:59.820
journalists to be the sort of conduit.

2441
02:27:00.450 --> 02:27:02.550
They don't do the kind of thing that I'm doing,

2442
02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:04.650
which I have really enjoyed doing.
I think this is,

2443
02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:09.540
I think humor is such an important thing to understand that you need to do the

2444
02:27:09.541 --> 02:27:10.920
peer review publication stuff,

2445
02:27:10.921 --> 02:27:14.910
but you also need to enter into a conversation with,
you know,

2446
02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:19.410
professionals in the public to talk about this kind of stuff.
Yeah,
figure it out.

2447
02:27:19.770 --> 02:27:20.603
Yeah.

2448
02:27:20.770 --> 02:27:25.770
<v 2>I think humor is a weird thing because you could say something and it'd be</v>

2449
02:27:25.991 --> 02:27:29.720
really funny and then I can say the exact same thing and no one would laugh or

2450
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:33.640
probably the opposite.
But you know what I'm saying?
It's like everyone has their,

2451
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:37.060
whatever it is about them that makes them funny.

2452
02:27:37.090 --> 02:27:40.180
Like in that's very intangible.
There's some weird shit.

2453
02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:44.290
Like there's a,
there's some,

2454
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:49.330
some things that would work with some comedians and if you would write them down

2455
02:27:49.631 --> 02:27:52.330
on paper,
you would say like Mitch Hedberg.
Again,
I hate to go back to him,

2456
02:27:52.331 --> 02:27:55.120
but a lot of this stuff,
if you wrote it down on paper and then read it,

2457
02:27:55.121 --> 02:27:57.280
you'd be like,
that's not funny at all.
Don't use that on stage.

2458
02:27:57.610 --> 02:27:59.680
But when he does it,
it's genius.

2459
02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:03.550
If there is something about personality,
charisma,

2460
02:28:03.551 --> 02:28:06.370
all these weird intangible things that are very difficult to measure.

2461
02:28:06.371 --> 02:28:07.450
And as a scientist,

2462
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:11.710
how do you account for that when you try to like quantify what,

2463
02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:15.340
what is funny or analyze the components?

2464
02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:18.980
<v 5>So it depends on the question.
So,
um,</v>

2465
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:23.750
so if the,
so in some cases that's error,
right?

2466
02:28:23.751 --> 02:28:28.580
So in some cases we're not interested in the role that the person plays.

2467
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:33.110
And so what we do is we just randomly assign people to one of two tasks.

2468
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:36.450
And so the,
hopefully you get the same number of,

2469
02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:39.500
of Mitch is on the right is on the left,
right?
You know,

2470
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:40.970
one group as in the other group.

2471
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.000
And that evens itself out when it comes to understanding the sort of individual

2472
02:28:46.401 --> 02:28:49.130
differences he sort of personality differences and so on,

2473
02:28:49.430 --> 02:28:54.430
that's a lot harder because you can't randomly assign someone to be like Mitch

2474
02:28:54.471 --> 02:28:56.120
or like Joe,
you know,

2475
02:28:56.390 --> 02:29:01.390
now you have to measure it and anytime you have to measure some something that

2476
02:29:02.091 --> 02:29:04.010
introduces another level of error,
right?

2477
02:29:04.011 --> 02:29:07.310
Because how is it that you can measure it accurately,
like reliably.

2478
02:29:07.810 --> 02:29:12.060
And so a lack of reliability influences your,
um,
your,

2479
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:16.880
the validity of your conclusions that you can,
um,
that you can draw from.

2480
02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:19.550
So I have a particular,
in my own research,

2481
02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:24.640
I try to avoid individual differences as much as possible because you're now,

2482
02:29:25.731 --> 02:29:26.840
you're not manipulating them.

2483
02:29:26.841 --> 02:29:29.600
You're measuring them in anytime you measure versus manipulate it.

2484
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:33.950
It just makes life a whole lot harder.
Where I'm headed though,

2485
02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:37.850
I have to pay attention to individual differences because what we're doing in

2486
02:29:37.851 --> 02:29:41.780
her role.
So for six years we studied what makes things funny.

2487
02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:44.810
The next six years we're going to try to make people funnier.

2488
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:49.220
That's what we're going to be doing.
Funny of me for it.
Yes.
Can you help me?
Sure.

2489
02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:53.180
I'm writing a new act.
I just released my old act.
I have to write a new act.

2490
02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:57.560
How do I get fun here?
We can,
we can,
that'd be great.
I would love to do that.

2491
02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:02.540
Easily.
Mushrooms within limited success.
Uh,
no,
but that's,

2492
02:30:02.541 --> 02:30:03.380
I mean,
you know what,

2493
02:30:03.430 --> 02:30:07.040
I can't answer that question for sure because no one's ever done that research,

2494
02:30:07.041 --> 02:30:10.940
but right.
That's where we're going though.
But to under,
to be able to do that,

2495
02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:13.700
we're going to have to measure individual differences cause you're going to have

2496
02:30:13.701 --> 02:30:17.690
to figure out how funny if someone is point a and then measure them again at

2497
02:30:17.691 --> 02:30:20.900
point B.
And if you're going to have to understand like what did they're good at,

2498
02:30:20.901 --> 02:30:25.130
what are they not good at it and so on.
And so,
so the answer,
my quick answer is,

2499
02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:29.210
uh,
you got to measure it and it's very hard to do,
but that's where we're headed.

2500
02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:34.620
<v 2>Measuring it and the ability to make someone funny or like,</v>

2501
02:30:34.621 --> 02:30:37.740
what would you do?
Would you like analyze their act and say like,

2502
02:30:37.741 --> 02:30:41.460
if you did it this way,
or maybe you should approach it that way,
like you would,

2503
02:30:41.461 --> 02:30:46.461
would you do it on a like a delivery basis or routine basis?

2504
02:30:46.561 --> 02:30:47.394
Bit by bit.

2505
02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:51.930
<v 5>Right.
So,
um,
so you have to have the proper control,
right?
So,</v>

2506
02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:56.360
so to me,
I think that the best control,
um,

2507
02:30:56.430 --> 02:30:58.710
I have this idea for this project,
I want to do it.

2508
02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:02.430
I want to do a TV special on this thing.
You Do,

2509
02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:04.350
you take one group of people and you,

2510
02:31:04.430 --> 02:31:08.790
you commit them to the kind of typical,
um,

2511
02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:12.060
comedy enhancing tools that exist in the world.
Right?
So they,

2512
02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:15.660
they do an Improv group,
they do a standup thing,

2513
02:31:15.661 --> 02:31:20.280
they read some books about how to do this stuff.
Like you expose

2514
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:23.940
<v 0>them to funny people,
you know,
who do it for a living and get some coaching.</v>

2515
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.730
Right,
right.
That's probably the only things that exist.

2516
02:31:26.731 --> 02:31:29.690
If someone really wanted to become funnier,
the only things in exist.

2517
02:31:29.691 --> 02:31:33.120
But unlike say carpentry,

2518
02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:37.980
there are certain people that just won't be funny.
I,
I,

2519
02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:42.270
I struggle to say that because I've seen guys get much better.
Yes.

2520
02:31:42.450 --> 02:31:47.450
But there's a certain level of cluelessness that some folks possess that's

2521
02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:48.450
inescapable.

2522
02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:53.450
So now if the goal is to create funny standup Comedians,

2523
02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:56.160
I agree with you.

2524
02:31:57.510 --> 02:32:02.510
If the goal is to create someone who is more funny now than they were before

2525
02:32:03.450 --> 02:32:06.990
then I say,
well,
maybe you're right.
Because some people are just,

2526
02:32:06.991 --> 02:32:09.120
they're just terrible in public and they don't think,

2527
02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:13.560
but could I get someone to send funny or emails or be funnier with his kids,

2528
02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:18.180
you know,
or to be a better manager to,
you know,
so.

2529
02:32:18.210 --> 02:32:22.410
So some of it is a matter of identity.
Identifying wears a person's strengths.

2530
02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:25.200
What is the medium,
right?
And so,

2531
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:28.720
so when I say improve someone's sense of humor,
it ha,

2532
02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.840
it can be along many different dimensions.

2533
02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:34.290
I don't think the goal is to make funnier standup comics.

2534
02:32:34.291 --> 02:32:37.920
I think like we have plenty of funny standup comics and the system works pretty

2535
02:32:37.921 --> 02:32:42.690
well.
But when I have like a lot of like really crappy unfunny customer services,

2536
02:32:43.810 --> 02:32:47.370
how are things going?
I think that they would have to be super focused on it,

2537
02:32:47.371 --> 02:32:48.021
but I think there are.

2538
02:32:48.021 --> 02:32:53.021
But I think improving comedy looked even professional chess players and I mean

2539
02:32:53.641 --> 02:32:56.790
think about all the incredible disciplines that are,
that are involved,

2540
02:32:56.791 --> 02:33:00.420
that need coaching.
Even gymnast when they're at a gold metal level,

2541
02:33:00.570 --> 02:33:02.970
they still need constant coaching boxers,

2542
02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:07.650
world championship boxer still have coaches.
Bernard Hopkins is 49 years old.

2543
02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:10.740
He still has professional coaches that work with them that are constantly

2544
02:33:10.741 --> 02:33:14.910
analyzing technique and comics are on their own.
I think what you're doing,

2545
02:33:14.911 --> 02:33:17.860
if a comic would uh,
be open minded,

2546
02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:21.810
like a lot of comics are very protective of the creative process and the

2547
02:33:21.811 --> 02:33:24.540
renegades and like what the fuck do you know when we see your five minutes?

2548
02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:28.710
Could do five minutes and then tell me if you could tell jokes for me or correct

2549
02:33:28.711 --> 02:33:29.790
my jokes.
Joe,

2550
02:33:29.791 --> 02:33:34.050
let's make a show a show what kind of show I can take comics and get them better

2551
02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:37.950
use science to make them funny.
Yeah,
I don't know.
It's,
it's,

2552
02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:41.520
it would work with some folks,
you know,
open minded folks.

2553
02:33:41.521 --> 02:33:46.110
So I'll tell you one of the,
I have an intervention idea,
not for comics,

2554
02:33:46.111 --> 02:33:49.950
but for regular everyday people that I believe will help.
And it's uh,

2555
02:33:49.970 --> 02:33:53.430
it's facilitating what we call a growth mindset.
So there,

2556
02:33:53.610 --> 02:33:58.610
so you can roughly take a person's belief system about their skills and put them

2557
02:33:59.221 --> 02:34:02.910
in one of two categories,
either a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.

2558
02:34:02.911 --> 02:34:07.800
So this is work by Carol Dweck,
a social psychologist,
a fixed mindset,

2559
02:34:07.801 --> 02:34:09.840
believes that you're just sort of born that way.

2560
02:34:10.590 --> 02:34:13.440
And so if you have a fixed mindset about intelligence,
for instance,

2561
02:34:13.890 --> 02:34:18.010
than an intelligence test is just a race to see how,
how

2562
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:21.770
<v 5>smart you are,
right?
It's just a ranking system,
right?
And,</v>

2563
02:34:21.850 --> 02:34:24.850
and if I rank higher than you,
then I think I'm smarter than you.

2564
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:29.140
And I think that that will always be the case.
But a growth mindset,

2565
02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:32.680
a test,
an intelligence test is just a benchmark.

2566
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:37.150
It just tells me how smart I am relative to you right now.

2567
02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:42.760
But it shows me where I can go in terms of getting,
getting smarter.

2568
02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:43.660
Right?

2569
02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:47.290
You can imagine having a fixed or growth mindset about shyness for instance,

2570
02:34:47.291 --> 02:34:49.840
like some people believe you're just shy and other people are like,
well,

2571
02:34:49.841 --> 02:34:52.800
I'm shy now,
but I can overcome the shyness,
et cetera.
Right?

2572
02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:56.110
Humor is,
I think fits.

2573
02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:59.620
I think most people have a fixed mindset about their sense of humor.

2574
02:35:00.010 --> 02:35:02.860
I think that they just like,
well,
this is how funny I am and this is just,

2575
02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:04.590
that's the way it will be.
Right?

2576
02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:08.800
But if you can convince them that they can become funnier,

2577
02:35:08.801 --> 02:35:12.610
if you can transform them from having a fixed mindset to a growth mindset,

2578
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:18.270
all of a sudden that opens up the possibilities that they'll try to do the

2579
02:35:18.611 --> 02:35:20.380
things to actually become funnier.

2580
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:22.880
<v 2>What variables do you think do you have or you have to address to make someone</v>

2581
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:25.100
funnier?
I have my ideas on this,

2582
02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:28.040
but I'm curious as to like what your thoughts are like what variables would you

2583
02:35:28.041 --> 02:35:31.970
have to address to try to make someone funding to get more fun?

2584
02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:36.410
You have to leave soon.
I do.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
Five more minutes.

2585
02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:38.570
Is that cool?
We're almost done anyway.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm sorry,

2586
02:35:38.571 --> 02:35:41.960
I ran out of time at three o'clock.
Oh,
you do?
Yeah.
And it's been three hours.

2587
02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:46.950
<v 5>That's crazy.
Yeah.
Flies by.
I did not,
I did not expect that.</v>

2588
02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:49.830
Um,
what,
okay.
What needs to be joining here?
You,

2589
02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:50.880
I want to hear what you have to say.

2590
02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:54.730
<v 2>Uh,
self awareness.
One of the big things,
especially with men,</v>

2591
02:35:54.731 --> 02:35:57.490
we call that self monitoring in the literature.
Yes.

2592
02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:02.110
Men are very clueless about how other people see them because a lot of men go by

2593
02:36:02.111 --> 02:36:05.170
there like on a,
uh,
an ego momentum.
Right.
You know,

2594
02:36:05.171 --> 02:36:06.730
and especially if they're accomplished in any way,

2595
02:36:06.731 --> 02:36:09.430
like if they're a manager and have people that have to listen to them.

2596
02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:13.750
It's one of the things that you see happen to people that become famous as well.

2597
02:36:13.780 --> 02:36:15.910
It's like when there might have been what happened to,

2598
02:36:15.911 --> 02:36:20.050
cause I'm actually write this down.
Yeah.
I'm,
please do.
Um,
self awareness,

2599
02:36:20.051 --> 02:36:21.760
especially with men is a real issue.

2600
02:36:21.761 --> 02:36:26.761
One of the most annoying things is someone who's a guy who thinks he's funny,

2601
02:36:26.771 --> 02:36:29.830
he's not funny at all and tries to like,
you know,

2602
02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:35.280
crack jokes and they're just like super obnoxious and you don't see like if you

2603
02:36:35.321 --> 02:36:38.740
ever seen a real boarish guy who's not funny at all,

2604
02:36:38.890 --> 02:36:43.120
but who is like maybe a manager or somewhere and he tries cracking jokes around

2605
02:36:43.121 --> 02:36:46.540
a female employee who might be smarter than him but has to listen to this

2606
02:36:46.541 --> 02:36:49.360
fucking idiot because she works for him.
She's like,
Oh God.

2607
02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:52.450
Like that is the complete total opposite of funny.

2608
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:56.050
The only way to get that guy to understand how other people would see him.

2609
02:36:56.051 --> 02:36:57.400
It's like you would have to point out,

2610
02:36:57.730 --> 02:37:00.250
like you'd have to like say you got to look at yourself the way someone else

2611
02:37:00.251 --> 02:37:04.210
would see you.
Do you try to actively work on your flaws?

2612
02:37:04.211 --> 02:37:08.060
Do you try to actively assess how you're being perceived by others?
Right.

2613
02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:10.360
<v 5>I agree with that.</v>

2614
02:37:10.361 --> 02:37:13.780
That's very nice because what it does is it turns someone's attention to their

2615
02:37:13.781 --> 02:37:17.300
audience.
Yeah.
Um,
and,
and if you want to be funny,

2616
02:37:17.301 --> 02:37:20.490
you can't just think about what you find funny,
you know,

2617
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:22.790
I mean especially like in a mixed setting,

2618
02:37:23.250 --> 02:37:23.611
<v 2>Ken,</v>

2619
02:37:23.611 --> 02:37:26.700
but you have to figure out a way to get other people to see your point of view.

2620
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:29.700
So that's nice.
It's like the war though.
D doing standup comedy.

2621
02:37:29.701 --> 02:37:34.440
Like one of the tricky aspects of it is like how do you get someone confident

2622
02:37:34.441 --> 02:37:37.590
enough to let you take them on a ride?

2623
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:41.910
<v 5>So yeah,
we do this,
we've been experimenting with this.
Um,</v>

2624
02:37:41.970 --> 02:37:45.690
it was just started running this study where we're looking at these,

2625
02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:49.920
we use these reflection tasks.
These,
there's like a diary study basically.

2626
02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:53.040
So you have someone for like two weeks every day.

2627
02:37:53.041 --> 02:37:55.470
At the end of the day do one of two things.

2628
02:37:55.471 --> 02:38:00.290
They either talk about what I laughed at and why,
or another one.

2629
02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:02.100
So we call that Wila for short.

2630
02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:05.040
And then we have Wola what others laughed at and why.

2631
02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.520
And what we're doing with this study is to see is one better than the other at

2632
02:38:11.281 --> 02:38:16.281
getting people to better appreciate humor and better produce humor.

2633
02:38:17.370 --> 02:38:22.370
And so what you're suggesting is that Wola what others laughed at and why would

2634
02:38:24.121 --> 02:38:29.100
be a more effective intervention then why law?
What I laughed at at why?

2635
02:38:29.101 --> 02:38:34.101
Because what a Wola diary study does is it gets you to think about what other

2636
02:38:34.591 --> 02:38:37.740
people are finding.
Funny,
not just what you think is funny,

2637
02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:40.230
but so it makes you more aware in a sense.

2638
02:38:40.270 --> 02:38:43.700
<v 2>Sort of,
yeah,
but not even what others laugh at,</v>

2639
02:38:43.701 --> 02:38:47.470
but how others perceive you because it's a,
it's a,
again,

2640
02:38:47.471 --> 02:38:51.220
it's like who's the Messenger is sort of a thing because there are some ideas

2641
02:38:51.221 --> 02:38:53.950
that if you gave them to the hands of a skilled comedian,

2642
02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:57.330
they could portray those ideas and have it be really hilarious.

2643
02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:00.400
Whereas there's other people who would bring up the same joke and they would be

2644
02:39:00.401 --> 02:39:03.850
thought off as an a real asshole or short sided or insensitive.

2645
02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:07.810
It's a matter of how much do I trust this person's intelligence and how they're

2646
02:39:07.811 --> 02:39:12.130
going to tackle a concept.
You know,

2647
02:39:12.131 --> 02:39:15.700
if you're talking,
if someone's on stage,
it's like Patton Oswald,
very measured,

2648
02:39:15.701 --> 02:39:19.360
intelligent guy.
He's curious and he's going to look at something and go,

2649
02:39:19.570 --> 02:39:21.670
why is it that,
and you're going to go,

2650
02:39:21.671 --> 02:39:24.100
I want to know what he thinks about this subject.

2651
02:39:24.101 --> 02:39:26.020
I'm going to allow him to think for me.

2652
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:29.260
But if it's someone who's like a really crude,
open,
Miker talk,

2653
02:39:29.261 --> 02:39:32.800
tackling the same subject,
they might have a good point,

2654
02:39:32.801 --> 02:39:35.050
but they enter into it ham handedly.

2655
02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.900
They don't understand how the audience sees them.
They are too.

2656
02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:42.550
Maybe a they too overenthusiastic they look nervous on the mic,
you know,

2657
02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:47.350
all there's all these variables or boarish like being an account manager and

2658
02:39:47.370 --> 02:39:49.540
have these people have to listen to you.
And you know,

2659
02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:52.450
<v 5>that's uh,
yeah.
So one of the things that I talk about,</v>

2660
02:39:52.451 --> 02:39:55.810
like a good starting point is just make fun of yourself.

2661
02:39:56.470 --> 02:40:01.420
Just sound like a very simple,
this is,
you know,
um,
the self deprecation,
right?

2662
02:40:01.421 --> 02:40:04.810
Because it almost fits the definition of a benign violation.

2663
02:40:04.811 --> 02:40:07.810
Like you're pointing out something that's wrong with yourself,
but because it's,

2664
02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:12.850
it's you,
you can do it right.
It makes it okay.
And that can lead to,

2665
02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:17.280
you know,
like it gets a laugh a lot.
It leads to liking,
you know,

2666
02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:20.970
you're not worried about offending people,
at least typically in this way.

2667
02:40:20.971 --> 02:40:25.100
And so you can imagine sort of three types of interventions.

2668
02:40:25.101 --> 02:40:28.380
So some of them are tactics like that,
you know,
try,

2669
02:40:28.381 --> 02:40:33.210
it develops a little bit of self deprecation.
Another one is,
um,

2670
02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:37.950
is these sort of like changing the way someone thinks about the world and about

2671
02:40:37.951 --> 02:40:42.750
themselves that may lead them to,
um,
to pursue,

2672
02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:48.420
uh,
to pursue improvement.
And then this other one,

2673
02:40:48.421 --> 02:40:51.840
which I think is just like in general,
it's like you give them

2674
02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:57.540
an understanding of the world of humor that they don't under.
They don't get it.

2675
02:40:57.570 --> 02:41:02.220
Like most people haven't thought hard about humor the way comics have,
they have,

2676
02:41:02.250 --> 02:41:05.730
they don't really think about these individual differences.

2677
02:41:05.731 --> 02:41:10.120
They don't think about this punching up,
punching down.
They don't think about,
um,

2678
02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:12.670
how it might have its roots in negative emotion.
I mean,

2679
02:41:12.671 --> 02:41:16.050
it should be a negative experiences that they don't,
right?

2680
02:41:16.051 --> 02:41:18.030
They don't think about the two ways that it can fail,

2681
02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:22.530
etc. And so some of it is like you give them a crash course to understand this

2682
02:41:22.531 --> 02:41:26.040
topic.
You get them to believe that they can come back and get better at it.

2683
02:41:26.041 --> 02:41:27.810
And then you give them a variety of different

2684
02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:32.070
strategies and tactics by which to improve it.

2685
02:41:32.250 --> 02:41:36.390
And then you force them to practice because it's not going to happen overnight.

2686
02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:38.230
It's gonna take a long time.
Again,

2687
02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:42.630
the same way that things like meditation and gratitude and so on could be.

2688
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:45.060
So you can,
you can make people more compassionate.

2689
02:41:45.061 --> 02:41:49.440
You can make them more like a gracious or have more gratitude.

2690
02:41:49.441 --> 02:41:50.820
You can do all these kinds of things,

2691
02:41:50.821 --> 02:41:54.450
but none of these interventions happen quickly.
They take weeks and months to,

2692
02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:55.710
to do,
it's a practice.

2693
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:59.130
<v 2>Yeah.
And I think that the growth of any art form,</v>

2694
02:41:59.131 --> 02:42:01.140
dependent upon what your starting point is,

2695
02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:06.390
is about analyzing the effectiveness of the previous strategies and finding out

2696
02:42:06.391 --> 02:42:08.080
what were the holes in the game are.
Yes.

2697
02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:11.250
The beautiful thing about comedy is you could watch other people do it well,

2698
02:42:11.430 --> 02:42:15.570
and he'd go,
oh,
he's nicer than me.
You know?
Oh,
he smiles.

2699
02:42:15.970 --> 02:42:18.630
She smiles.
Oh,
she,
uh,

2700
02:42:18.690 --> 02:42:22.740
she just starts off making fun of herself and then makes fun of other people

2701
02:42:22.741 --> 02:42:26.650
that are similar to herself.
I see what she's doing,
you know,
when that's,
um,

2702
02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:30.100
that's something that it requires you.
Again,

2703
02:42:30.101 --> 02:42:34.810
it requires you to analyze yourself.
And if you,
if you're not analyzing yourself,

2704
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:38.230
if you're,
if you're going through life with like,
especially at Eagle blinders,

2705
02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:41.950
if you put up ego,
but the worst thing is when a comic bombs and you go,

2706
02:42:41.951 --> 02:42:45.670
how you're set go good.
I did really good.
They're really into fuck you did.

2707
02:42:45.671 --> 02:42:48.070
I was there stupid.
I saw that you can't,

2708
02:42:48.071 --> 02:42:51.070
you're not going to get good if you believe that you did good when you ate shit.

2709
02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:54.050
<v 5>Yeah,
no,
you'll never,
oh yeah.
There's these sort of tongue,
this,</v>

2710
02:42:54.390 --> 02:42:56.890
they call it unskilled and unaware ideas.

2711
02:42:56.910 --> 02:43:01.560
This is that incompetent people are doubly cursed.

2712
02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:03.900
So their curse with their incompetence,

2713
02:43:03.901 --> 02:43:07.320
but there they're also a curse with the inability to recognize their

2714
02:43:07.321 --> 02:43:11.890
incompetence.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
so you never get better

2715
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:16.330
<v 2>as a result of it all.
And so those people make lousy comics.</v>

2716
02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:17.890
I used to do a bit about dumb people out,

2717
02:43:17.891 --> 02:43:20.930
fucking smart people and then explains the pyramids whether around there's

2718
02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:21.790
nobody in them.

2719
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:25.870
But one of the part parts of it was about one of the things about being dumb as

2720
02:43:25.871 --> 02:43:28.450
a,
you don't realize you're dumb.
Like that's part of being done.

2721
02:43:28.451 --> 02:43:31.570
Like there's a lot of like I would say there's a lot of dumb people right now

2722
02:43:31.571 --> 02:43:34.120
that are laughing at this joke because they think I'm talking about somebody

2723
02:43:34.121 --> 02:43:38.370
else cause you don't realize you're dumb because it's a part of being stupid in

2724
02:43:38.371 --> 02:43:42.570
a way to,
I'll send you the paper.
If there's research that they do this,
they do,

2725
02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:43.510
what does the term,
again,

2726
02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:47.290
we just the skilled and none of were unskilled and unaware that it's like a

2727
02:43:47.291 --> 02:43:50.620
double curse.
It is.
Yeah.
That's true.

2728
02:43:50.650 --> 02:43:55.120
Like objectivity and introspection.
Yeah.
They're important for anything.

2729
02:43:55.121 --> 02:43:59.340
It's sports for writing apps like your friend was talking about like your,

2730
02:43:59.370 --> 02:44:03.160
your friend who uh,
wrote the chapter then rewrote it,
not good enough,

2731
02:44:03.161 --> 02:44:06.760
rewrote and rewrote it.
The ability to analyze your work.

2732
02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:11.110
That's super critical for creating something.
Yeah,
I agree.

2733
02:44:11.530 --> 02:44:14.710
But there's also you can overanalyze and you can get to the point where it just

2734
02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:19.270
like you fucking hack this diamond down to like a grain of sand.
You're like,

2735
02:44:19.271 --> 02:44:20.500
it's not ready.
Yeah.

2736
02:44:20.501 --> 02:44:23.590
The question is when do you get to the flat part of the curve?
Most people,

2737
02:44:24.130 --> 02:44:26.710
they're not patient enough to get to the flat part of the curve.

2738
02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:28.720
[inaudible] right.
That's the,
that's the big issue.

2739
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:32.890
There is also an issue with when do you release a piece of material and put it

2740
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:35.350
like on an album or in a CD or whatever.

2741
02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:38.530
Because when you get to a certain point it's perfect,

2742
02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:42.250
but sometimes you're on the way there and you record it then and then you do it

2743
02:44:42.251 --> 02:44:45.490
afterwards.
You're like,
fuck,
I have all these taglines and now it's better.

2744
02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:50.820
Like there's a growth process to performing standup and one of the aspects of

2745
02:44:50.921 --> 02:44:54.640
standup that a lot of people find is that there's only one way to get the jokes

2746
02:44:54.641 --> 02:44:54.911
better.

2747
02:44:54.911 --> 02:44:58.210
You have to do them in front of an audience and they sort of like find their own

2748
02:44:58.211 --> 02:45:01.660
life in front of a crowd.
Like when I'm creating new shit,

2749
02:45:01.690 --> 02:45:06.190
I will do a bunch of different versions of it and sometimes I just,
uh,
just say,

2750
02:45:06.191 --> 02:45:09.160
let me try it backwards.
You know,
maybe we flip it up this way.

2751
02:45:09.161 --> 02:45:10.960
Let me add something ridiculous to it.

2752
02:45:10.961 --> 02:45:13.900
Let me dig a hole in the beginning and see if I could pull myself out of it.

2753
02:45:13.950 --> 02:45:16.980
Right.
Let me take them down at trick road where I,
you know,
I've,
I've,

2754
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:20.760
I fake them out and then sneaking in the back door with all this stuff that's

2755
02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:21.603
like you,

2756
02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:25.840
it only works on stage cause you can only do so much of it in front of a notepad

2757
02:45:25.841 --> 02:45:27.130
or a computer.
Yeah,
I agree.

2758
02:45:27.430 --> 02:45:31.060
It's a weird art form and that it requires other people's points of view.

2759
02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:34.930
Like you could make an awesome song on your own and then go on stage.

2760
02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.770
I just wrote this last night and just play it going and give you some of that

2761
02:45:38.771 --> 02:45:43.420
good,
good,
feel good.
Get in the back of my book.

2762
02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:47.320
You know,
you could,
you know what I'm saying?
I recognize that as a callback.
Yes.

2763
02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:49.490
Yes it is.
When you're at your very,

2764
02:45:49.740 --> 02:45:54.190
it's a weird having a scientist analyze comedy,
you know,
I think,
uh,

2765
02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:56.470
this is a fascinating subject man.
I know you're out of time,

2766
02:45:56.471 --> 02:45:58.180
but thank you very much.
And it's cool just to,

2767
02:45:58.210 --> 02:46:01.730
someone looks at comedy like that cause I think that has really any game be

2768
