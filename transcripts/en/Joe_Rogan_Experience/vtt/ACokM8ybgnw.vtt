<v Speaker 1>So I've never been to woodland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rare land.</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>The land of would it smells like money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it out here really?</v>

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>It smells like like white people where </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people come to breed.</v>

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Hank shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:18.591
<v Speaker 1>we're live D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hank Shaw said woodland hills smells </v>

6
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:18.591
<v Speaker 1>like money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go to Beverly Hills.</v>

7
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:23.271
<v Speaker 1>It smells like diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't let people like me and they </v>

8
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:23.271
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

9
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>You look respectable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>

10
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Are you looking fine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a chef.</v>

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>How do you go from being a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogger?</v>

12
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:34.311
<v Speaker 1>You are political blogger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a political capital bureau </v>

13
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>chief in Sacramento in another places in</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered congress.</v>

14
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>So a bit more than a blogger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you are deep in.</v>

15
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always in the room several times </v>

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>watching this thing go down now this </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocity of justice and voting and chaos</v>

17
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's going around,</v>

18
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>the Russians are attacking all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's going on right now.</v>

19
00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this feel like to you?</v>

20
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It feels so good to not be doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>job anymore.</v>

21
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like anybody that has any sort of</v>

22
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.971
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that is a political blogger</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's involved in it for any length of </v>

23
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>time or not as political blogger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>columnist and author.</v>

24
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>After awhile you got to realize you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking writing about pro </v>

25
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a rig system.</v>

26
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>You're writing about a rigged system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then occasionally something like this </v>

27
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be,</v>

28
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what got me into,</v>

29
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I did for 18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

30
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I got into it because when I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

31
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>the essence of politics with people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of backgrounds and </v>

32
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>persuasions or different regions would </v>
<v Speaker 1>all meet in a room.</v>

33
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I either capital either as a state </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitol Congress and solve a problem </v>

34
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.481
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was all about compromise and </v>

35
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:41.481
<v Speaker 1>debate and wheeling and dealing and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

36
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:45.771
<v Speaker 1>Which is inherently fascinating when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a report like whose ox is going </v>

37
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:45.771
<v Speaker 1>to get cord?</v>

38
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to win this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

39
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe needs this and somebody else needs </v>

40
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to give him this thing.</v>

41
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I'm not going to do is vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Dah,</v>

42
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah.</v>

43
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

44
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you'd have this bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this transportation,</v>

45
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go on about some hilarious </v>

46
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>congressional stories and in state </v>
<v Speaker 1>government stories do.</v>

47
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So there was a transportation bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] bill in Congress in 98.</v>

48
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And one of my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Frank Wolf,</v>

49
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lawmaker from northern Virginia.</v>

50
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>He's not there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used kind of a do gooder,</v>

51
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a reformer Republican guy,</v>

52
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dudley direct kind of guy and he wanted,</v>

53
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>he hated pork and want to get rid of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earmarks in transportation bill.</v>

54
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>But as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transportation bill is what they </v>

55
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>call a Christmas tree.</v>

56
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So everybody gets a little bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ornament on top of the tree so that they</v>

57
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>can go home to their district and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what I got.</v>

58
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>So Bud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schuster of Pennsylvania with the head </v>

59
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>of the transportation committee back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

60
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>So Bud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>would shut the door and anybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation committee with one of </v>

62
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Bud's boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a Republican,</v>

63
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>you want a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you one of Bud's boys.</v>

64
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And so they all play a game like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so except for my guy,</v>

65
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>my guy would come out and hold press </v>
<v Speaker 1>releases saying,</v>

66
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

67
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a terrible,</v>

68
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

69
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>this is corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

70
00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the game is played,</v>

71
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets it.</v>

72
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets a little piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it comes out and the bill passes over</v>

73
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.340
<v Speaker 2>frank's dead body basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he holds a press release or a press </v>

74
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>conference talking about how terrible it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all was.</v>

75
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm coming out of this press </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference and one of Bud Schuster's </v>

76
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 2>aids comes and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

77
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>check out page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

78
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 2>It was a page 123 of the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did.</v>

79
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>And in there was a line item that gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>the residents of Bud Schuster's </v>

80
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:32.461
<v Speaker 2>congressional district a free pass to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive the Pennsylvania turnpike for x </v>

81
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:38.431
<v Speaker 2>number of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically anybody who lived in Bud's </v>

82
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 2>district didn't have to pay tolls for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was two years.</v>

83
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

84
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a reason because,</v>

85
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

86
00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:48.971
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road that most of those people took </v>

87
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.301
<v Speaker 2>to work was being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was going be construction on it </v>

88
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:51.301
<v Speaker 2>for like the next two years.</v>

89
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's fairly reasonable.</v>

90
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Then you could justify it in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>court of law is not completely,</v>

91
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean cases where like,</v>

92
00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:00.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check out into page 423.</v>

93
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:02.790
<v Speaker 3>We stuck something in there that's still</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on too.</v>

94
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's so bizarre that even in </v>

95
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.881
<v Speaker 3>this age of transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still like stacking stuff in </v>

96
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 3>sliding things into bills and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very few people to watch them now.</v>

97
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's too many things to look at </v>

98
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if there is something.</v>

99
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something does get in,</v>

100
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.100
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be some new scandal </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>

101
00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Kanye west going to be visiting trump at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trump tower and that like,</v>

102
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to think about the bill</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

103
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too much to pay attention to </v>

104
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.131
<v Speaker 3>Hank Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I find it fascinating that </v>

105
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.681
<v Speaker 3>you went from that world too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like much more of an artistic pursuit of</v>

106
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 3>being a chef.</v>

107
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.000
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that I've really </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to appreciate over the last,</v>

108
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 3>say 10 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I credit the initial push to,</v>

109
00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:46.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching,</v>

110
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no reservations when Anthony Bourdain </v>

111
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.860
<v Speaker 3>show was on the travel channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

112
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.050
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always loved food,</v>

113
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

114
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I like eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does,</v>

115
00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never really thought of dieticians</v>

116
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.590
<v Speaker 3>don't like eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>

117
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.570
<v Speaker 3>which ones are your dieticians?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

118
00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 3>they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

119
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.570
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the pleasure aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

120
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 3>They want everybody to just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a fucking guy that I know,</v>

121
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 3>there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat for taste.</v>

122
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I eat for performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He eats like a oatmeal with water and he</v>

123
00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:14.480
<v Speaker 3>doesn't heat it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

124
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.430
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You asshole.</v>

125
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're missing the point.</v>

126
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 3>You could do both stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

127
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 3>the point being that I didn't think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of food as being like great.</v>

128
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

129
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 3>this is good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this.</v>

130
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think of it as an art and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I watched Anthony Bourdain show,</v>

131
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:39.110
<v Speaker 3>when he would have these great reverence</v>
<v Speaker 3>for these people that he would visit,</v>

132
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 3>who are these real artists and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>put together these amazing dishes and </v>

133
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 3>the enthusiasm and the passion that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had for describing it made me super </v>

134
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.010
<v Speaker 3>excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started realizing,</v>

135
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about it like this.</v>

136
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Speaker 3>This is an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just an art form.</v>

137
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that you would like to make a </v>

138
00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.260
<v Speaker 3>sand castle know it's not going to last</v>

139
00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making a meal.</v>

140
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 2>You can take a photo of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not unlike standup comedy in a lot</v>

141
00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:04.960
<v Speaker 2>of it's performance art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.230
<v Speaker 2>The last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For as long as you're in the restaurant </v>

143
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.230
<v Speaker 2>or as long as you're in that comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>hall.</v>

144
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

145
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:15.671
<v Speaker 2>if like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't record comedy where you </v>

146
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:15.671
<v Speaker 2>could record</v>

147
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:17.070
<v Speaker 3>a meal and film it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on Anthony Bourdain shot.</v>

148
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.080
<v Speaker 3>I can't appreciate it at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could watch you if you did stand </v>

149
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.050
<v Speaker 3>up and I laughed at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to be there.</v>

150
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.880
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

151
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.090
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it serves more people,</v>

152
00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 3>but in the sense the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

153
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 3>like if there was no</v>

154
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Speaker 2>recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be kind of very similar and a </v>

155
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.390
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways but shared for with larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups of people.</v>

156
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed cooking.</v>

157
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.280
<v Speaker 2>When you bring it up to that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

158
00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 2>and I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

159
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to use the word artists with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cooks and she sounds pretentious.</v>

160
00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were were artisans.</v>

161
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.020
<v Speaker 2>We're craftsman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were artists too.</v>

162
00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

163
00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:55.581
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are some people who will say </v>

164
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 2>that my cooking leaves you with a deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of whatever you know,</v>

165
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.570
<v Speaker 2>on Wifi or happiness or joy or parts or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

166
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

167
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:04.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're cooking good food.</v>

168
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.720
<v Speaker 2>We are buying product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're making product and in a way that </v>

169
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.310
<v Speaker 2>will make you interested in it and will </v>
<v Speaker 2>delight you in some way,</v>

170
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

171
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Spanish chef whose name escapes me at </v>

172
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 2>the end of every Michelin Star meal ends</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the good shit</v>

173
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.010
<v Speaker 3>looking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to take myself that </v>

174
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.010
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

175
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the same thing as comedians.</v>

176
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Like my comedy changes worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes minds.</v>

177
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.460
<v Speaker 3>It influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

178
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.420
<v Speaker 3>the influencer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

179
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to get my message</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there and use my platform.</v>

180
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

181
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:42.490
<v Speaker 3>you're joking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling.</v>

182
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.260
<v Speaker 3>You're making people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ultimately.</v>

183
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what comics are freed from that today?</v>

184
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this very unique form because of the </v>

185
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Internet and because of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of podcasts,</v>

186
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>

187
00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.990
<v Speaker 3>if you have actually something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say that is not necessarily </v>

188
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.381
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do that now because podcasts </v>

189
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:04.381
<v Speaker 3>are so open ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no real structure to it.</v>

190
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if you go on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people did for the longest time,</v>

191
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:12.241
<v Speaker 3>they would go on stage and rant about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government or about abortion or </v>

192
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.781
<v Speaker 3>about crime or whatever and it would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>not funny and they would feel like it </v>

193
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:15.880
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

194
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 3>It was something that was important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it had to be discussed even though it</v>

195
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:24.211
<v Speaker 3>was discussed in this weird forum where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people go to pay to see comedy and </v>

196
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:25.570
<v Speaker 3>you're not giving them comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're ranting.</v>

197
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And it was almost like respected under </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some snobbish sort of sect of </v>

198
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy fans and practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real weird was I blame Bill </v>

199
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Bill Hicks's?</v>

200
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks did it perfectly,</v>

201
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 3>but the way he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fuck every lot of people imitated it </v>

202
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.021
<v Speaker 3>to the point where there's a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comedy club in Georgia called the </v>

203
00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:53.790
<v Speaker 3>punchline that went under and it had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>back room that the green room where the </v>

204
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.751
<v Speaker 3>comics would hang out and they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wrote on the walls and a one </v>

205
00:08:57.751 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 3>section of this wood paneled wall said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit trying to be Hicks.</v>

206
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

207
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 3>the owner says it's going to get me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they tore it down.</v>

208
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.350
<v Speaker 3>They saved that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those pieces.</v>

209
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Put it up in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone by by all means make a statement</v>

210
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 3>but make it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

211
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's hard.</v>

212
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

213
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:18.231
<v Speaker 3>So some people like took the shortcut </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just want it to be self </v>

214
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 3>righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do molecular gastronomy and</v>

215
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:23.361
<v Speaker 3>make it actually soulful molecular </v>
<v Speaker 3>gastronomy is when he's calling cooking </v>

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the graphs eating?</v>

235
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.120
<v Speaker 2>You can tell what was in the product and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

236
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget there was this moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>in um,</v>

237
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 2>we are in North Dakota hunting sharp </v>
<v Speaker 2>tailed grouse and the graphs had all </v>

238
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 2>been eating rose hips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

239
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I've got gotta make a rose hip glaze on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sharpies of rose hip Glenn.</v>

240
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.380
<v Speaker 2>What does rose hips taste like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

241
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.750
<v Speaker 2>they're a little bit like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

242
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 2>they're loaded with vitamin C so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that kind of acidy toying to them,</v>

243
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

244
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.270
<v Speaker 4>there</v>

245
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.630
<v Speaker 2>like imagine a cross between a </v>
<v Speaker 2>watermelon and an orange or something </v>

246
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:48.980
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what rose hips tastes like.</v>

247
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just buy rose hips to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>store and eat them?</v>

248
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the center of a rose hip is what</v>

249
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.340
<v Speaker 2>they used to make itching powder out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like,</v>

250
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at.</v>

251
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a rose hip.</v>

252
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

253
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the end of the rose.</v>

254
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.550
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's what a bit rose </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes really.</v>

255
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a variety called A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

256
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.200
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck do I not know this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have roses.</v>

257
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't all,</v>

258
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.020
<v Speaker 2>they don't always get pollinated.</v>

259
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

260
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.810
<v Speaker 2>So when they get pollinated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best one is called a regresa rose.</v>

261
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.230
<v Speaker 2>And it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a coastal reslizumab beaches and </v>

262
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.920
<v Speaker 2>dunes and the roasted there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the size of a cherry pepper.</v>

263
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

264
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that's solid,</v>

265
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half dollar size.</v>

266
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.190
<v Speaker 2>People remember what half dollar looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

267
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.090
<v Speaker 2>It's that big and it's juicy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

268
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.300
<v Speaker 2>like a sweet pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't eat the center because the</v>

269
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.890
<v Speaker 2>center is what they used to make itching</v>
<v Speaker 2>powder out of</v>

270
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.550
<v Speaker 3>itching powder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

271
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.400
<v Speaker 3>So it's like one of those kind of eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the edge,</v>

272
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.480
<v Speaker 3>low fish that can kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of a deal.</v>

273
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 3>But it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that bad.</v>

274
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the outside's Yummy.</v>

275
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

276
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Fucking how bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put that photo up again.</v>

277
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I literally had no idea that they looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that center part is nasty.</v>

278
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if it dries in you,</v>

279
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what?</v>

280
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 3>I make a roasted puree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So get these,</v>

281
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.940
<v Speaker 3>that kind of rose hip and dry it and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you rehydrate it and then you </v>

282
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 3>boil it just to get it soft and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>run it through a food mill.</v>

283
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.280
<v Speaker 3>And so only the red flesh comes through </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all those seeds stay in the food </v>

284
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.871
<v Speaker 3>mill and you get this incredibly amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking paste that looks exactly like </v>

285
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>tomato paste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like concentrated roset flavor.</v>

286
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's ridiculously good.</v>

287
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what is that back there to </v>

288
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:34.920
<v Speaker 3>back that up one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy?</v>

289
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 3>That's like a puree or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that like how they would make that?</v>

290
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 3>W would grind that up in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

291
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 3>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

292
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the extract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

293
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:43.970
<v Speaker 3>they make jellies out of it a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

294
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:44.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

295
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 3>the Swedes and Norwegians make um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit soup out of it.</v>

296
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.370
<v Speaker 3>How do I not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

297
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.380
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I really thought rose hips were </v>

298
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:54.380
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rose leaf.</v>

299
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 3>I thought you'd take like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know those things must taste </v>

300
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 3>good because deer eat them like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

301
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like.</v>

302
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 3>My friend's wife was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

303
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so cute.</v>

304
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:09.271
<v Speaker 3>We have deers in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started planning the roses,</v>

305
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 3>the deer Cape beat the rose and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

306
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 3>these fucking cuts need to die.</v>

307
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill them off.</v>

308
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw his wife literally wants to murder</v>

309
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 3>these deer because they're killing her </v>
<v Speaker 3>flowers.</v>

310
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like 100.</v>

311
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 3>We need a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

312
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Going to try to get a tag for Malibu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malibu.</v>

313
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Lots of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

314
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just granted a stay.</v>

315
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 3>A pardon on that mountain lion who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been killing all the alpacas up there.</v>

316
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.640
<v Speaker 3>And I heard that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

317
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating story because there </v>

318
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>is a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine's name is p 45.</v>

319
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 3>He's actually been collared and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know who he is,</v>

320
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:53.911
<v Speaker 3>they know he's an active Radio Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they know it's him and he's just </v>

321
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 3>murking these alpacas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He killed was 11 alpacas and stupidest </v>

322
00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>slow as dear I've ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chest cage.</v>

323
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 3>He does opposite fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a slaughter fest.</v>

324
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not even eating them.</v>

325
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 3>He's just fucking them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

326
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Speaker 3>I think he's plenty of food up there.</v>

327
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.470
<v Speaker 3>He's just decided to eat them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were killed them because they were </v>

328
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.310
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they decided that they could pay,</v>

329
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.060
<v Speaker 3>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

330
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 3>pass a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

331
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 3>depredation permit so they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill him.</v>

332
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 3>And so then in this outrage and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who owns the Alpaca farm account,</v>

333
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 3>apparently it was like really scared </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she was like,</v>

334
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't prepared for the vitriol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now she doesn't want it killed.</v>

335
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to use the depredation </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

336
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:38.521
<v Speaker 3>She's instead wants someone to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>or another take it away and put it </v>

337
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:39.840
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably up in nor cal where I live.</v>

338
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.390
<v Speaker 3>I've seen five mountain lions wandering </v>
<v Speaker 3>around in the wild.</v>

339
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean we throw around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thursday attacking a deer to residents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Front porch in Sanford,</v>

353
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

357
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:30.350

360
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:38.920
<v Speaker 3>peninsula where there's a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat for it.</v>

361
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange what they're able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do and how they're able to move around.</v>

362
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 3>They're just so smart of the deer had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been eaten.</v>

<v Speaker 3>pay rent amount.</v>

364
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Mountain Lion inspired by the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>rose owners.</v>

367
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how they can get around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed a giant one in Santa Monica </v>

368
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.930
<v Speaker 3>in someone's backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Santa Monica was just like deeply </v>

369
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:07.930
<v Speaker 3>populated and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

370
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 3>this guy called up the police I guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

371
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking giant mountain lion in</v>

372
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 3>my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they couldn't figure it out.</v>

373
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:15.520
<v Speaker 3>How to get it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

374
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 3>they killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

375
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>150 pound cat in Santa Monica just </v>

376
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 3>wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty big.</v>

377
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.410
<v Speaker 3>They get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they be really 100?</v>

378
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Do they get to go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

379
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant big kitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see them in like Utah.</v>

380
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to this podcast </v>

381
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>yesterday where this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

382
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about spotting Jaguars</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Arizona.</v>

383
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 3>They're spotting and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>lately,</v>

384
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.050
<v Speaker 3>especially the spotted a couple of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and in the south.</v>

385
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 3>And that to in Texas to really very </v>
<v Speaker 3>southern part of Texas.</v>

386
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

387
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like part of you is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

388
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're coming back.</v>

389
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 3>You're part of them was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>

390
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 3>As long as there's only a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

391
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want too many jaguars were </v>

392
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:55.450
<v Speaker 3>running around where the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing.</v>

393
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like sea lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing against the lions,</v>

394
00:16:56.271 --> 00:17:01.271
<v Speaker 3>but there aren't enough great white </v>
<v Speaker 3>sharks to make the sea lion population </v>

395
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:05.141
<v Speaker 3>kind of normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're just blitzed with sea lions up </v>

396
00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:07.871
<v Speaker 3>in northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the video that they </v>

397
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:07.980
<v Speaker 3>took of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right on fisherman's wharf?</v>

398
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.760
<v Speaker 3>He took his Mahi Mahi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

399
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.310
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

400
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:10.680
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

401
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:11.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

402
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:16.070
<v Speaker 3>They're killing seals or sea lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're killing seals and fisherman's </v>

403
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:16.070
<v Speaker 3>wharf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant,</v>

404
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.200
<v Speaker 3>huge sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharks.</v>

405
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Murking these sea lions right next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fisherman's wharf.</v>

406
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.770
<v Speaker 3>So these people were there filming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then see that while they're hanging out </v>

407
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 3>here is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

408
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

409
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.950
<v Speaker 3>These people are hanging out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

410
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

411
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:32.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to.</v>

412
00:17:32.581 --> 00:17:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

413
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I look at all the blood in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

414
00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:41.691
<v Speaker 3>then they all come to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the side of the edge to look over </v>

415
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 3>over the edge of the dock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess this is a security camera </v>

416
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 3>that's on this boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's filming this,</v>

417
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:47.120
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood,</v>

418
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

419
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.100
<v Speaker 1>one's rapidly cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

420
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I've caught all kinds of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see where the,</v>

421
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that power boat is in the background.</v>

422
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Go about 150 yards towards Alcatraz or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 1>or actually as towards Angel Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

424
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are seven guild sharks,</v>

425
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

426
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.580
<v Speaker 1>big seven guild sharks that live in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

427
00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:14.581
<v Speaker 1>What's under d?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven guild sharks at different type of </v>

428
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:14.581
<v Speaker 1>shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

429
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really primitive kind of shark.</v>

430
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:16.810
<v Speaker 1>They're actually quite tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

431
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.950
<v Speaker 1>and you're allowed one a day and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruise the bottom and the deep channels </v>

432
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:26.361
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually one of the best places </v>

433
00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:26.361
<v Speaker 1>to catch them outside of New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

434
00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 1>how deep is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be over a hundred.</v>

435
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So you just trolled the bottom or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just draw a line down a either anchor up</v>

436
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 1>or you already bounced bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

437
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>What a cool looking shark.</v>

438
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy looking.</v>

439
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do look really primitive.</v>

440
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

441
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Sharks because of the whole shark fin </v>
<v Speaker 1>soup controversy.</v>

442
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not good by the way,</v>

443
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have had it once and I'm like,</v>

444
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

445
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 1>It was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

446
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't anything that I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should slaughter sharks.</v>

447
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially not just the fin,</v>

448
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 1>like it's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse.</v>

449
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>There's so much meat on a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The single worst,</v>

450
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I was going to say is that </v>

451
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.741
<v Speaker 1>there's this new sort of liberal knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk reaction to sharks that now you're </v>

452
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to kill sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a,</v>

453
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the mayor of New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>

454
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.230
<v Speaker 1>or was it the governor that caught a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thresher shark and it's not an </v>

455
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.030
<v Speaker 1>endangered species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally legal fish to catch.</v>

456
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:26.031
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see him at fish markets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he caught it and cooked it and people </v>

457
00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:29.511
<v Speaker 1>just jumped on the outrage train and </v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting angry that he was </v>

458
00:19:29.511 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 1>killing endangered sharks.</v>

459
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well blah,</v>

460
00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:30.490
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

461
00:19:30.491 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

462
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:31.890
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>

463
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.970
<v Speaker 1>We're not making shark fin soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not some gigantic Chinese </v>

464
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 1>commercial fishing vehicle right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

465
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 1>New York governor in hot water over </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp photo.</v>

466
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's a little fresher to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally legal.</v>

467
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fish.</v>

468
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a fish,</v>

469
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

470
00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

471
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 1>it's no different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

472
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.720
<v Speaker 1>it's what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that a lot because,</v>

473
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fish for leopard sharks in San </v>

474
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Bay and Tamales Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're delicious.</v>

475
00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:58.910
<v Speaker 1>They're fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone gets.</v>

476
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I get the same reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

477
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.890
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

478
00:20:00.891 --> 00:20:01.150
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

479
00:20:01.151 --> 00:20:02.550
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

480
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.630
<v Speaker 1>they're a species of least concern if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at all the fish monitoring </v>

481
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.580
<v Speaker 1>things or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're keeping like for,</v>

482
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.790
<v Speaker 1>for the whole season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because they can get reasonably big </v>

483
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:16.790
<v Speaker 1>and they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

484
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.501
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the common shark that lives up </v>

485
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:21.501
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

486
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you get down to it as </v>

487
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Americans are not very good at nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

488
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

489
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 1>oh well one sharks endangered so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all must be endangered.</v>

490
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

491
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a very cursory glimpse at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the facts and what it,</v>

492
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:40.490
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to get outraged at </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they decide to pull the outrage </v>

493
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.490
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

494
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it.</v>

495
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.070
<v Speaker 1>He's got a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It eop outrage.</v>

496
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

497
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's not enough time in the </v>

498
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.940
<v Speaker 1>day to really pay attention to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different animals that are being </v>

499
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.261
<v Speaker 1>consumed and how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should be concerned with and </v>

500
00:20:58.261 --> 00:20:58.261
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

501
00:20:58.261 --> 00:21:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I read somewhere that sharks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>endangered and he's got a sharp hey man,</v>

502
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just say filet of fish.</v>

503
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:09.841
<v Speaker 1>And there's namec eating fries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked in beef fat as there were on the </v>

504
00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 1>way over there.</v>

505
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Which are good by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

506
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:14.490
<v Speaker 1>they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these leopard sharks now,</v>

507
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.500
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Makos the only shark I've ever </v>

508
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 1>eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say a leopard would be?</v>

509
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Dramatically different because makers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and treasures are much more like </v>

510
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:26.790
<v Speaker 1>swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I were swordfish,</v>

511
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>sturgeon makers and threshers all kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of on the same culinary bucket,</v>

512
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 1>they're like a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thick mia.</v>

513
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't though,</v>

514
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't know,</v>

515
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no accounting for taste,</v>

516
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but a leopard sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have down here in cal,</v>

517
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leopard shark is super,</v>

518
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 1>super white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

519
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 1>it's very dense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

520
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit more like grouper is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

521
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

522
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:57.751
<v Speaker 1>there's a trick to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to fit for these </v>

523
00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:57.751
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have ice on board,</v>

524
00:21:57.751 --> 00:22:02.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to basically catch the </v>

525
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.040
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

526
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.040
<v Speaker 1>You kill the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

527
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you got the fish right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd get them on ice because </v>

528
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Sharks Skates and rays effectively pee </v>
<v Speaker 1>through their skin.</v>

529
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't get the fish right after</v>

530
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this buildup of uric acid in the</v>

531
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:23.281
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically your fish filets </v>

532
00:22:23.281 --> 00:22:23.281
<v Speaker 1>going to smell like ammonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which nobody likes.</v>

533
00:22:23.281 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

534
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Skates and rays are the same as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all three,</v>

535
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I think if I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a less.</v>

536
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a plasma allows momorphism I forgot</v>

537
00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 1>what the scientific name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the cartilaginous fish now.</v>

538
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 1>The variations and sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very extreme variation.</v>

539
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:43.820
<v Speaker 1>The difference between like a grouper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a swordfish,</v>

540
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.520
<v Speaker 1>which is like a real thick midi wha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

541
00:22:46.521 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 1>what accounts for that diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet.</v>

542
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

543
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 1>leopard sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the crabs,</v>

544
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shellfish,</v>

545
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.210
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

546
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Although they actually really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dig this nasty little fish called</v>

547
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>a midshipman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

548
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 1>which is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a,</v>

549
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>the ugliest catfish you've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's a pro tip for you.</v>

550
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:11.220
<v Speaker 1>The best bait to catch a leopard shark </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what was ever in the previous leopard</v>

551
00:23:11.221 --> 00:23:11.920
<v Speaker 1>sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stomach.</v>

552
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Just Bait your hook up with whatever was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his stomach.</v>

553
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And then you will absolutely catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>another leopard shark.</v>

554
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And this is the mid shipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

555
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.200
<v Speaker 1>midshipman strange looking fish as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other good thing about them is not </v>

556
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 1>only to the sharks love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they stay on the hook forever,</v>

557
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.770
<v Speaker 1>that they like have a thick outer shell </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something and see the luminescent </v>

558
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 1>dots on the bottom and that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

559
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a cool looking thing.</v>

560
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 1>How big those things get well about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

561
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're essentially just tiny bait </v>

562
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 1>fish you can get maybe 10 inches long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

563
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.900
<v Speaker 1>What a cool looking fish though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so prehistoric looking as a </v>

564
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.081
<v Speaker 1>little way I can get to skate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go back to that other thing </v>

565
00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:52.081
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

566
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>

567
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a little bioluminescent dots </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it.</v>

568
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 1>So in deep deep water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that's all visible.</v>

569
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like racing stripes and all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tricked out sports cars,</v>

570
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:05.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maximum.</v>

571
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Like my sneakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you ran either these things like</v>

572
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you see them at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I think when I'm talking about.</v>

573
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they reflect.</v>

574
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's cool.</v>

575
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Well that actually is like luminescent </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

576
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:16.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reflects light.</v>

577
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually exudes light.</v>

578
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

579
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

580
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I am as fascinated by the ocean as any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other part of the world and I just think</v>

581
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:33.401
<v Speaker 1>it's so incredible that we've only </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored like 92 percent or something </v>

582
00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:36.370
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 90 something percent is unknown,</v>

583
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 1>unexplored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so strange.</v>

584
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You go look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny.</v>

585
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm known as the Game Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

586
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.740
<v Speaker 1>But I've spent most of my life dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with fish and shellfish and seafood and </v>

587
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I only started hunting when I was 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

588
00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:55.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adult onset hunting as many people call </v>

589
00:24:55.771 --> 00:24:55.771
<v Speaker 1>it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

590
00:24:55.771 --> 00:24:59.010
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you cook something like a,</v>

591
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:04.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shark or anything that's </v>

592
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.110
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything along those lines?</v>

593
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like you have to preface it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some sort of an explanation that </v>

594
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.491
<v Speaker 1>this is not endangered species and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just a giant misconception and </v>

595
00:25:12.491 --> 00:25:16.511
<v Speaker 1>this is no different than eating a tuna </v>
<v Speaker 1>or I usually put a paragraph or </v>

596
00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>something in there to say when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing something and you'd be like,</v>

597
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 1>hold on people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

598
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.260
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

599
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So the white shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

600
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an endangered species at all.</v>

601
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

602
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll usually put a link to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word says you can,</v>

603
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 1>is the International Union of concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatevers and it's basically,</v>

604
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:42.641
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the marker that shows what's </v>

605
00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:44.651
<v Speaker 1>endangered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's threatened with a species of </v>

606
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:44.651
<v Speaker 1>concern.</v>

607
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:44.651
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even then if you think about it,</v>

608
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:49.571
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bag limit for leopard sharks in the </v>

609
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:52.931
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco Bay is three a day and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically do a self imposed limit of </v>

610
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:56.210
<v Speaker 1>only two a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we almost never keep females.</v>

611
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 1>When you say we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you and your friends now,</v>

612
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 1>most of the commercial fishing fleet in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a like,</v>

613
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.350
<v Speaker 1>so if you could take a charter and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial,</v>

614
00:26:05.351 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 1>like recreational charter charter boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll typically like,</v>

615
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>do you need three fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can have for three fish.</v>

616
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:14.510
<v Speaker 1>But there it's sort of strongly </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged just,</v>

617
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's cool.</v>

618
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Just take the two and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw these,</v>

619
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.970
<v Speaker 1>these big giant females back because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of times,</v>

620
00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:22.910
<v Speaker 1>especially this time of year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

621
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:27.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have pups because they give </v>

622
00:26:27.911 --> 00:26:27.911
<v Speaker 1>birth to live young and nobody wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:26:27.911 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>open up a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got little pups inside.</v>

624
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:32.660
<v Speaker 1>That's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that?</v>

625
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Is it an x ray or a sonogram of sharks </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the baby?</v>

626
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Sharks in their stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now know this,</v>

627
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the sharks do</v>

628
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 3>what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have live young inside of them,</v>

629
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.220
<v Speaker 3>but they're like these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put it up on my instagram because it </v>

630
00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.891
<v Speaker 3>looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy looking that it looks </v>

631
00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:54.891
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they'll little monsters living</v>

632
00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 3>inside this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this other sharks body.</v>

633
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

634
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 3>if you look at a human fetus for days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

635
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 3>It isn't his mouth going open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

636
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but there's images of it that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

637
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.420
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some.</v>

638
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

639
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Can get a look at what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it looks like.</v>

640
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking crazy.</v>

641
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them eat their fellow </v>

642
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 3>brothers and sisters inside the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'll eat the weaker ones.</v>

643
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 3>That's why you shouldn't have more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>five kids,</v>

644
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 3>but what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they eat?</v>

645
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.200
<v Speaker 3>And they're eating inside a womb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of a monster is a shark </v>

646
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 3>that they can eat while they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>womb and they have teeth already.</v>

647
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 3>They have fangs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

648
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our human babies of teeth when they're </v>

649
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 3>born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't they?</v>

650
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

651
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.560
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

652
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.180
<v Speaker 3>You don't have kids do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

653
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 3>not that I know of.</v>

654
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 3>He skated through pass the breeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

655
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that we'll do a 45 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>46.</v>

656
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Did you come close at anytime?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I know of.</v>

657
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

658
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of picking fucking </v>

659
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.321
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing people with kids will </v>

660
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:03.321
<v Speaker 3>try to tell you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody needs kids.</v>

661
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>

662
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Everybody doesn't need kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of people.</v>

663
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:11.020
<v Speaker 3>You can be a wonderful contributing </v>
<v Speaker 3>member to our culture and society </v>

664
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.020
<v Speaker 3>without reproducing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

665
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.930
<v Speaker 3>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not everybody's path.</v>

666
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Speaker 3>But one thing about babies is they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat other babies while they're in the </v>

667
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:18.940
<v Speaker 3>womb that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I have to do absorb them though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't they?</v>

669
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Like some weird twins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

670
00:28:23.981 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

671
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.840
<v Speaker 3>A Siamese twins where one twin will </v>
<v Speaker 3>absorb the other one.</v>

672
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 3>Then they'll find like a tooth in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>

673
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about that dermoid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

674
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 3>what's a good name for it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Good enough for a kid.</v>

675
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.500
<v Speaker 3>What's your name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dermoid.</v>

676
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 3>But there are a lot of meals now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people look up,</v>

677
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 3>look down upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's becoming one of them,</v>

678
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharks,</v>

679
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.230
<v Speaker 3>sharks coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them.</v>

680
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Squirrels and other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Girls mostly.</v>

681
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

682
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:56.330
<v Speaker 3>urban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>urban and people like to make fun of </v>

683
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.330
<v Speaker 3>rural people for eating squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sign of like,</v>

684
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must be a hick.</v>

685
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to,</v>

686
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a park in north Hollywood that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>near where I used to live and you can go</v>

687
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 3>there and feed them peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of cool.</v>

688
00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 3>They come right up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just lay down.</v>

689
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're laying down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this girl's would literally lay down and</v>

690
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:12.471
<v Speaker 3>hold up a peanut and the squirrels will </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally come up to you and take a </v>

691
00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:12.471
<v Speaker 3>peanut.</v>

692
00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:15.800
<v Speaker 3>And people feel bad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have weird rules about what </v>

693
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 3>animals we like and what animals we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

694
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Because if it was a rat that came over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and took your peanut,</v>

695
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:22.940
<v Speaker 3>you'd be freaking out and there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole lot of difference between squirrel</v>

696
00:29:22.941 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 3>and a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tail dude and adorable.</v>

697
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.280
<v Speaker 3>And it sticks up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it's talking to you.</v>

698
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Tree tree rat with a good pr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good pr and something about fuzziness.</v>

699
00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll let them in.</v>

700
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on in as long as you just plants,</v>

701
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not true.</v>

702
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Apparently there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

703
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

704
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.100
<v Speaker 1>video of a squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They caught eating some sort of a </v>

705
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:47.920
<v Speaker 1>mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mouse or something like that.</v>

706
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Eggs all the time to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ground nesting birds as well.</v>

707
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.510
<v Speaker 1>They go into a tree and tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

708
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

709
00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fucking squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then this mouse like python rabbit.</v>

710
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.610
<v Speaker 1>This is so crazy like this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

711
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.790
<v Speaker 1>ground squirrels in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

712
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 1>there are guys.</v>

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

714
00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:16.450
<v Speaker 1>these guys will go out and shoot ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels and then keep that up.</v>

715
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Like when Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you shoot Louie,</v>

716
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Joe comes out of this hole and grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eatsa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Instantaneously.</v>

719

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

721
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ranch that I go to to hone </v>

722
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:33.450
<v Speaker 1>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

723
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 1>to hone ranch.</v>

725
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 1>The guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys was a guide there,</v>

726
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 1>told me that the biomass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a morbid senior,</v>

727
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.460
<v Speaker 1>get his square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting here talking while the </v>

728
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 1>squirrel is eating intestines is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much an entire mouth.</v>

729
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going off to the bio mass of </v>

730
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 1>ground squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is He a ground squirrel?</v>

731
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:57.991
<v Speaker 1>He must be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it was a little squirly </v>

732
00:30:57.991 --> 00:30:57.991
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does look like a ground squirrel.</v>

733
00:30:57.991 --> 00:30:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squirrel.</v>

734
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.740
<v Speaker 1>A little bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the biomass of ground squirrels is </v>

735
00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 1>more than any other animal on the ranch </v>
<v Speaker 1>is 270,000</v>

736
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:09.390
<v Speaker 1>acres with mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>

737
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.570
<v Speaker 1>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk,</v>

738
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>

739
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and there's more weight of ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels and anything else.</v>

740
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to be able to tell you </v>

741
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:21.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

742
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>they're delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they tend to carry bubonic plague,</v>

743
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 1>which does not make them good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eats.</v>

744
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat regular squirrels.</v>

745
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Be Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground squirrels.</v>

746
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Tree squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

747
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Ground squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

748
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.200
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference in the species?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they interchangeable or the hybrids </v>

749
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.200
<v Speaker 1>ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

750
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.740
<v Speaker 1>they're totally different species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

751
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:40.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western gray tree squirrel is </v>

752
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.150
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big.</v>

753
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>He's over two pounds and he's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very cold slate.</v>

754
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:46.351
<v Speaker 1>Gray and it's actually quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good hitting squirrel.</v>

755
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there used to be a very high limit on </v>

756
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.740
<v Speaker 1>him here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when Southeast Asian immigrants,</v>

757
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:58.741
<v Speaker 1>the mom came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the mom are very fond of squirrel </v>

758
00:31:58.741 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 1>hunting and so it was a big thing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did back in Southeast Asia.</v>

759
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And so when they caught here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like Suede or all these </v>

760
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.380
<v Speaker 1>squirrels and I guess they shot them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

761
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limits were 10 in the seventies and </v>

762
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 1>early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're just for a,</v>

763
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:16.800
<v Speaker 1>which is fairly low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

764
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

765
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 1>in some of the Appalachian States is 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>

766
00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:27.241
<v Speaker 1>The moms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that before there a big </v>

767
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:27.241
<v Speaker 1>hunting community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:27.241
<v Speaker 1>The of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

769
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:31.861
<v Speaker 1>the recent immigrants to this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two homos hunting as groups or the </v>

770
00:32:31.861 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Hmong and the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

771
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.930
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say Russians,</v>

772
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainians,</v>

773
00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Moldovans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>do they have a preference for like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

775
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:45.070
<v Speaker 2>go after more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the Russians have been putting a </v>

776
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.160
<v Speaker 2>hurt on our sturgeon up north sturgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

777
00:32:45.161 --> 00:32:50.161
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's mostly poaching and fishing </v>

778
00:32:50.161 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 2>game is having a hard time getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle on it now.</v>

779
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Do they like sturgeon for the caviar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the meat?</v>

780
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the caviar.</v>

781
00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 2>So mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that would have to be a female.</v>

782
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:01.350
<v Speaker 2>So how do you differentiate when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>catching them a.</v>

783
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.390
<v Speaker 2>well you can use and they're pretty slow</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

784
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:05.840
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow fish.</v>

785
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty easy to determine if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a male or a female.</v>

786
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's,</v>

787
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it looks sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it gravity,</v>

788
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks pregnant if it's a big female.</v>

789
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is I'm there almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost always oversized fish so we're </v>

790
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.700
<v Speaker 2>allowed three a year in California </v>
<v Speaker 2>legally and they have to be,</v>

791
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:30.810
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm gonna forget this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 40 to 60 inches from the </v>

792
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:30.810
<v Speaker 2>fork of the tail.</v>

793
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be a slightly off,</v>

794
00:33:31.921 --> 00:33:36.921
<v Speaker 2>but that's basically the legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the lyrics is that legal size is 40 </v>

795
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:37.220
<v Speaker 2>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

796
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to catch something 40 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

797
00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a big ass state records I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight and a half feet long.</v>

798
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In California?</v>

799
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's either eight or 10.</v>

800
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:50.021
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The state record was caught by a dude </v>

801
00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:51.761
<v Speaker 2>and a in Vallejo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He caught it in the Carquinez straits </v>

802
00:33:51.761 --> 00:33:51.761
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

803
00:33:51.761 --> 00:33:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I want to say the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but judging by the haircut now where are</v>

804
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.370
<v Speaker 2>they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you catching them in deep water?</v>

805
00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Like how you can catch them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sacramento.</v>

806
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 2>You can catch the Calusa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can catch them in the delta.</v>

807
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the end?</v>

808
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in rivers there and then they go</v>

809
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 2>out into the bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

810
00:34:07.221 --> 00:34:12.221
<v Speaker 2>But the general place you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish for them is going to be the delta </v>

811
00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>at Antioch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a San Pablo Bay,</v>

812
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.780
<v Speaker 2>that kind of area.</v>

813
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Now these sturgeon are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they biting hooks?</v>

814
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Are you snagging them now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nearby.</v>

815
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 2>They're biting hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they get?</v>

816
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 2>What they feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So depending on who you talk to,</v>

817
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a friend of mine named j Dot </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lopes who runs a guide service or um,</v>

818
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 2>he's a specialist in sturgeon and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>really loves cured Salmon Roe.</v>

819
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

820
00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:35.010
<v Speaker 2>and he's got some special thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does with the Salmon Roe,</v>

821
00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>but some people use ghost shrimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people use cut herring.</v>

822
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat all kinds of stuff.</v>

823
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.510
<v Speaker 2>The largest freshwater fish on record </v>
<v Speaker 2>for California is a white sturgeon </v>

824
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.321
<v Speaker 2>caught by Joey Palato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the huge fish waiting.</v>

825
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four hundred and 68 pounds.</v>

826
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big fucking fish,</v>

827
00:34:57.231 --> 00:34:59.120
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

828
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:04.450
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story of that fish is pretty </v>

829
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:04.450
<v Speaker 2>hilarious too because he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

830
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:05.390
<v Speaker 2>he was working these cutoff work at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:07.040
<v Speaker 2>so I think it was June or July.</v>

832
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was still,</v>

833
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.930
<v Speaker 2>it was still light out late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he caught this fish after work and he</v>

834
00:35:11.931 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get the damn thing in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

835
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>it's dragging them all around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carquinez straits and I guess he gets on</v>

836
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:22.271
<v Speaker 2>another boat like mid catch and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger boat that could actually control </v>

837
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:28.241
<v Speaker 2>it because the sturgeon was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging up and down and it's just the </v>

838
00:35:28.241 --> 00:35:28.241
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you find the story of it,</v>

839
00:35:28.241 --> 00:35:32.291
<v Speaker 2>it's just hilarious and that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll look at the size of it and it </v>

840
00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:35.801
<v Speaker 2>is a story that will end that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fish will never be broken because </v>

841
00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:36.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be an illegal fish right now.</v>

842
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Why is it illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not allowed to land </v>

843
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 2>anything bigger than 60 inches from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fork of the tail.</v>

844
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how the fuck you gonna measure </v>

845
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.120
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

846
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Like what if it's like hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fish close.</v>

847
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get Out of the ruler.</v>

848
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's close,</v>

849
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 2>you just cut the lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now if it's closed you can.</v>

850
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 2>They're really survivable fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't die easy.</v>

851
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 2>So you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you bring them on board.</v>

852
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.680
<v Speaker 2>You bring them on board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure them and then thrown back.</v>

853
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

854
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 2>is that a good fish to eat outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the row?</v>

855
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I love sturgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you eat it?</v>

856
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.870
<v Speaker 2>A sturgeon again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say if you've never eaten </v>

857
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.870
<v Speaker 2>sturgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined swordfish.</v>

858
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot like that.</v>

859
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.500
<v Speaker 2>No kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a signature dish of Sacramento </v>

860
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.941
<v Speaker 2>cuisine actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to restaurants in </v>

861
00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:22.941
<v Speaker 2>Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will see sturgeon.</v>

862
00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:22.941
<v Speaker 2>Oliver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our menus,</v>

863
00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:27.890
<v Speaker 3>people don't know about Sacramento.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sacramento is so different than </v>

864
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 3>California in terms of like how it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>la.</v>

865
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 3>People think or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Diego.</v>

866
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 3>People think Sacramento might as well be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Iowa.</v>

867
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:36.700
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

868
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Not in a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

869
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Iowa.</v>

870
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in terms of like the hunting and </v>

871
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 3>fishing and the outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people know</v>

872
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.760
<v Speaker 2>it's more like the twin cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

873
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.070
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way to put it.</v>

874
00:36:48.071 --> 00:36:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Minnesota.</v>

875
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

876
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.170
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a stat for you that I just,</v>

877
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 2>my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend holly told me as she was </v>

878
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 2>doing some research for a pr piece that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was working on.</v>

879
00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Ninety five percent of Californians are </v>
<v Speaker 2>urban.</v>

880
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Ninety five percent of California is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rural.</v>

881
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that crazy.</v>

882
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.000
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

883
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And over a third of the state is public </v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

884
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

885
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.780
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable.</v>

886
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.060
<v Speaker 2>it's why stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole public land,</v>

888
00:37:22.061 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 2>private land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things of</v>

889
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.370
<v Speaker 3>is something that I had literally no </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of,</v>

890
00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:31.420
<v Speaker 3>no interest in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never discussed until I met Rinella.</v>

891
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:35.320
<v Speaker 3>And when Rinella started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven Alan started explaining to me the</v>

892
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:40.321
<v Speaker 3>difference between public land and </v>
<v Speaker 3>private land and how it was all put in </v>

893
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:42.841
<v Speaker 3>place by Teddy Roosevelt and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation that was done in the 18 </v>

894
00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:43.030
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and how much resistance was </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>

895
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And he actually talked about a pretty in</v>
<v Speaker 3>depth and I podcast,</v>

896
00:37:46.001 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 3>we did hear a couple of weeks ago and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

897
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it took me until I was </v>

898
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 3>like 45 until I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

899
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Steve's got a really good example of why</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not necessarily have to.</v>

901
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:04.821
<v Speaker 2>It was because he was talking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back country hunters and anglers and he </v>

902
00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to live in Brooklyn.</v>

903
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

904
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.900
<v Speaker 2>his wife was working there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know just when I met him,</v>

905
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:11.240
<v Speaker 2>he was still kind of odd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

906
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's about as Michigan as you get.</v>

907
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

908
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>and so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

909
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:21.651
<v Speaker 2>well everybody in New York City knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>can cite you chapter and verse the </v>

910
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 2>subway lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one who's doesn't have reason to,</v>

911
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.770
<v Speaker 2>has any reason to know about the subway </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>

912
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 2>So when somebody who lives in rural </v>
<v Speaker 2>Montana or whatever,</v>

913
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:37.580
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why haven't you ever know this issue </v>

914
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:37.580
<v Speaker 2>with public blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

915
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:37.580
<v Speaker 2>if</v>

916
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I live in New York City there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to know.</v>

917
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just like we got,</v>

918
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:45.110
<v Speaker 3>we were saying at the beginning of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's too many things to </v>

919
00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.270
<v Speaker 3>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many distractions in our </v>

920
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 3>world right now and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it hard to do anything anymore.</v>

921
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 3>There's no quiet at all in our lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

922
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Most people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

923
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

924
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Steve's got a real good way of breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things down like that.</v>

925
00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:04.441
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a good way of providing you </v>

926
00:39:04.441 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 3>with examples that you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

927
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one,</v>

928
00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:07.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because yeah,</v>

929
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:12.001
<v Speaker 3>if you lived in Montana you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>give a shit about the subway lines at </v>

930
00:39:12.001 --> 00:39:14.581
<v Speaker 3>Brooklyn and if you lived in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the infringing on public lands or Paul </v>

931
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Ryan's plan to sell them off to </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations so that they could pay off </v>

932
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.750
<v Speaker 3>the debt.</v>

933
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even register.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

934
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 3>here's a good one for ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So depending on where you live,</v>

935
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 3>like most of us call it public land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people call it government land was</v>

936
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 3>a very different connotation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

937
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 3>because the government land means it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not ours,</v>

938
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's really ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

939
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 3>So if you call it government land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like,</v>

940
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 3>well if they sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not yours anyway,</v>

941
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 3>but it actually is yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>

942
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.580
<v Speaker 3>that is a weird one that takes a while </v>
<v Speaker 3>to absorb.</v>

943
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Like the land is actually the own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've the people of the United States or</v>

944
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 3>the owners of the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

945
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So if you go hunting on public land </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>

946
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the background of your hunch.</v>

947
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Back country hunters and anglers shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>

948
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:06.001
<v Speaker 3>it says public landowner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that shirt because we're all </v>

949
00:40:06.001 --> 00:40:06.001
<v Speaker 3>public land doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you paid taxes,</v>

950
00:40:06.001 --> 00:40:07.460
<v Speaker 3>you live in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you own public land.</v>

951
00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the game on everybody's playing in </v>

952
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 3>public or private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

953
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Belongs to the ease of the people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States or if its migratory,</v>

954
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.500
<v Speaker 3>the people of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States and Mexico,</v>

955
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 3>or if you're in Texas and it's a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>fence,</v>

956
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.140
<v Speaker 3>that's legally livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

957
00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

958
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a strange distinction.</v>

959
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.790
<v Speaker 3>The difference between public land and </v>
<v Speaker 3>private land and the animals being on </v>

960
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's private land,</v>

961
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 3>those animals are owned by people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

962
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 3>By the people reading publishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why we actually have deer.</v>

963
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only reason why.</v>

964
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that large scale agriculture,</v>

965
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 3>the populations are higher than ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>before and all that good stuff.</v>

966
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

967
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:50.521
<v Speaker 3>There's a great book called dear land </v>
<v Speaker 3>that talks about why if you go to the </v>

968
00:40:50.521 --> 00:40:51.070
<v Speaker 3>northeast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're overrun with white tails because</v>

969
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 3>white tails like the edges between field</v>
<v Speaker 3>and forest.</v>

970
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:59.140
<v Speaker 3>It's suburbia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there perfect habitat for it?</v>

971
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

972
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:04.510
<v Speaker 3>and the problem that goes with that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>of course deer ticks and lyme disease,</v>

973
00:41:04.511 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 3>which is run rampant through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>northeast.</v>

974
00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:08.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just stayed as it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

975
00:41:08.111 --> 00:41:13.111
<v Speaker 3>Steve has it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His son has it and they are amongst two </v>

976
00:41:13.111 --> 00:41:13.200
<v Speaker 3>people out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

977
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 3>maybe 10 that I've ever met that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been misdiagnosed.</v>

978
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I had this Guy Steven Kotler on here the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day who was misdiagnosed for a </v>

979
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one fucking year,</v>

980
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:27.331
<v Speaker 3>and because of that it got so deep into </v>
<v Speaker 3>his system that he was in bed for three </v>

981
00:41:27.331 --> 00:41:27.331
<v Speaker 3>years in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

982
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.110
<v Speaker 3>He was hospitalized for three fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>years from lyme disease.</v>

983
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Morale is a horror story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so scary.</v>

984
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to people that have had </v>

985
00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:39.640
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the really fascinating things</v>

986
00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:39.640
<v Speaker 3>about Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really smart.</v>

987
00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Steven Kotler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when he was discussing it,</v>

988
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about the neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of lyme disease,</v>

989
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.620
<v Speaker 3>that it really wreaks havoc on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive function.</v>

990
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 3>To the point where one time when he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>it before he was diagnosed,</v>

991
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:56.531
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know what was wrong with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was at a green light and he couldn't </v>

992
00:41:56.531 --> 00:41:56.531
<v Speaker 3>figure out what green met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

993
00:41:56.531 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Then he couldn't figure out how to drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>his car.</v>

994
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.410
<v Speaker 3>He had a stick shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could not figure out how to do it </v>

995
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:02.410
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know how to drive his car like</v>

996
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:07.090
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He forgot how to drive it and it was </v>

997
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

998
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 3>they're going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something wrong with me.</v>

999
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Like bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's like right before,</v>

1000
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I believe you said it was right before </v>
<v Speaker 3>they checked him into the hospital and I</v>

1001
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:17.890
<v Speaker 3>bet pumped him full of IV antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and figured out exactly what it was when</v>

1002
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I play it ticks on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1003
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 3>knock on wood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had your line,</v>

1004
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1005
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I wish there was a way to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wish there doesn't seem to be </v>

1006
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.551
<v Speaker 3>any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in California in </v>

1007
00:42:30.551 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's misdiagnosed a lot because it's not</v>

1008
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 3>here yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1009
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.190
<v Speaker 3>They found it in Mendocino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not in like math.</v>

1010
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 3>And in the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think something like,</v>

1012
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:45.521
<v Speaker 3>I think they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they were talking about long </v>

1013
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:45.521
<v Speaker 3>island where they were saying some </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd number,</v>

1014
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 3>like 50 percent of the ticks of lyme </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

1015
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.610
<v Speaker 3>There's something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went mushroom hunting to summer ago,</v>

1016
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Sogo with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1017
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 3>a fellowship friend of mine and Anita </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lo.</v>

1018
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were at a meeting and by her place</v>

1019
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:01.070
<v Speaker 3>in eastern end of Long Island and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1020
00:43:01.071 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 3>it took some mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a good time,</v>

1021
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>

1022
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:08.020
<v Speaker 3>So I get back like 48 hours later I find</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tick nymphs right the right the band </v>

1023
00:43:09.711 --> 00:43:13.520
<v Speaker 3>of my boxers and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

1024
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:18.670
<v Speaker 3>And so I immediately rush to the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got that day the basically they </v>

1025
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.060
<v Speaker 3>give you a three pack of Cipro and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>go boom,</v>

1026
00:43:20.061 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

1027
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 3>And try and knock it out and seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work to get it quicker.</v>

1028
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get it really quick.</v>

1029
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Those little fuckers we see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this show for Scifi called Joe </v>

1030
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1031
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.711
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we investigated was this weird disease </v>

1032
00:43:35.711 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 3>called more Jaylen's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of this?</v>

1033
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.430
<v Speaker 3>And not by that name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1034
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:40.880
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think it's a psychosomatic disorder</v>

1035
00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:43.070
<v Speaker 3>where these people believe there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with them,</v>

1036
00:43:43.071 --> 00:43:48.071
<v Speaker 3>but there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have these parts of their body </v>

1037
00:43:48.071 --> 00:43:51.881
<v Speaker 3>where they just itch incessantly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't stop and then they believe </v>

1038
00:43:51.881 --> 00:43:53.500
<v Speaker 3>fibers are growing out of their body and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get like um,</v>

1039
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 3>carpet hairs in there and they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's growing out of their body,</v>

1040
00:43:57.321 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carpet fibers and they're convinced.</v>

1041
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:04.870
<v Speaker 3>But one of the guys that I interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a doctor who also had more jealous </v>

1042
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.820
<v Speaker 3>and what he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a really unique insight to it </v>

1043
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 3>because he said that as a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that he found,</v>

1044
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:16.571
<v Speaker 3>this is a direct correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have this disease and lyme </v>

1045
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:17.450
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They almost all have lyme disease.</v>

1046
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.350
<v Speaker 3>And he thinks it was really going on is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that peep.</v>

1047
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 3>And this is a guy who was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>his own,</v>

1048
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:27.221
<v Speaker 3>like his brain malfunctioning on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that people who have lyme </v>

1049
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is some sort of a neuro toxic</v>

1050
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:34.990
<v Speaker 3>effect of lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which distorts reality to the point </v>

1051
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.571
<v Speaker 3>where these people think these fibers </v>
<v Speaker 3>are growing out of them and he was </v>

1052
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:40.250
<v Speaker 3>talking about himself like he had saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>something moving around in his eye,</v>

1053
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:45.440
<v Speaker 3>like saw something wiggling around on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the surface of his eye and then it </v>

1054
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:45.440
<v Speaker 3>wasn't there anymore and he realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1055
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.680
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not real.</v>

1056
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm seeing something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1057
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:54.110
<v Speaker 3>And then as he got deeper into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he found that all these people that had </v>

1058
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.670
<v Speaker 3>this bizarre morgellons thing also had </v>
<v Speaker 3>lyme disease.</v>

1059
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1060
00:44:58.021 --> 00:44:59.100
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

1061
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:04.101
<v Speaker 3>you know about the symptoms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxoplasmosis where we should make some </v>

1062
00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 3>mice really dig cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Well it makes them sexually attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat urine.</v>

1064
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 3>People don't know what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1065
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Sapolsky from Stanford University</v>

1066
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 3>in Northern California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but try and get that guy on for years.</v>

1067
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 3>He's just so not a publicity whore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

1068
00:45:18.721 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I can't get them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1069
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll fly to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1070
00:45:20.921 --> 00:45:21.600
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm busy.</v>

1071
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1072
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an expert in.</v>

1073
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:30.020
<v Speaker 3>While he does a lot of primate work too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does a lot of work with baboons and </v>

1074
00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.291
<v Speaker 3>stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's the foremost expert in the </v>

1075
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.520
<v Speaker 3>United States of toxoplasmosis and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects of it.</v>

1076
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 3>It gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets them horny for cat urine.</v>

1077
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:44.570
<v Speaker 3>It literally changes the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sexual hard wiring of a rat gets it </v>

1078
00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 3>horny for cat urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally get erections and they go</v>

1079
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 3>running around near Cath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not scared of cats,</v>

1080
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 3>takes away their fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cats eat them,</v>

1081
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:58.730
<v Speaker 3>and because of that it gets into people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cats around it doesn't seem to </v>

1082
00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:02.181
<v Speaker 3>effect the cat's behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cats are just carriers and then it </v>

1083
00:46:02.181 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 3>gets into people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people more aggressive.</v>

1084
00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:06.050
<v Speaker 3>It makes people more prone to get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents.</v>

1085
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Disproportionate amount of motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 3>victims,</v>

1086
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle crash victims have </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxoplasmosis thing.</v>

1087
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what's the polsky pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was doing his residency,</v>

1088
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:19.130
<v Speaker 3>they did some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing some work in emergency </v>

1089
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.381
<v Speaker 3>rooms and one of the surgeons was saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a disproportionate amount of </v>

1090
00:46:21.381 --> 00:46:25.791
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle victims that have Toxoplasma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when a motorcycle victim would come </v>

1091
00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:29.601
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would test them for toxo </v>

1092
00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:31.550
<v Speaker 3>interestingly talks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one of the few diseases you can </v>

1093
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.590
<v Speaker 3>pick up from deer.</v>

1094
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get it from deere?</v>

1095
00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not entirely sure.</v>

1096
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's contact or eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>undercooked venison,</v>

1097
00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>

1098
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I think there's only been like six cases</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last 20 years that the CDC </v>

1099
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 3>reports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But ironically there's a guy who,</v>

1100
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.630
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1101
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 3>is on the facebook forum that I run was </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the sex.</v>

1102
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1103
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1104
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1105
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:59.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of these guys.</v>

1106
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:00.110
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1107
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:05.170
<v Speaker 3>it messed him up pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In what way would you say they're doing </v>

1108
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:05.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the same?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the same symptoms that you were</v>

1109
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:07.100
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1110
00:47:07.101 --> 00:47:08.570
<v Speaker 3>risk taking risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking it,</v>

1111
00:47:08.571 --> 00:47:11.490
<v Speaker 3>any aggressive behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood problems too.</v>

1112
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember for the life of me,</v>

1113
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1114
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.820
<v Speaker 3>like his blood pressure spiked and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1115
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 3>it was significant.</v>

1116
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what people,</v>

1117
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:23.901
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about crazy cat people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that literally is what they're talking </v>

1118
00:47:23.901 --> 00:47:23.901
<v Speaker 3>about probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:47:23.901 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 60 percent of France at one point in</v>

1120
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 3>time had toxoplasma because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>roaming around.</v>

1121
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 3>They think they've gotten it down to as </v>
<v Speaker 3>low as like 35 percent.</v>

1122
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same as Brazil.</v>

1123
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:38.791
<v Speaker 3>Brazil is somewhere around 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 percent plus of people that live </v>

1124
00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:43.111
<v Speaker 3>there have toxo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also a disproportionate </v>

1125
00:47:43.111 --> 00:47:46.021
<v Speaker 3>connection between toxoplasmosis rates </v>
<v Speaker 3>of infection in infestation of infection</v>

1126
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:50.980
<v Speaker 3>and successful soccer teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're risk takers.</v>

1127
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1128
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Risk takers more aggressive.</v>

1129
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.280
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange if you tested them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they also know,</v>

1130
00:47:56.281 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be off the chain,</v>

1131
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.440
<v Speaker 3>your real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm fucking cat crazy,</v>

1132
00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:07.441
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also some sort of a </v>

1133
00:48:07.441 --> 00:48:09.480
<v Speaker 3>connection between sexual promiscuity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and females.</v>

1134
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:15.301
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird stuff they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on to try to figure out what </v>

1136
00:48:15.301 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 3>exactly these fucking Paris it's doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people's brains.</v>

1137
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard of the courthouse steps,</v>

1138
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1139
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make the Zombie ants.</v>

1140
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's good.</v>

1142
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 3>There's good strains of quarter step </v>
<v Speaker 3>stool to climb to the top of that leaf.</v>

1143
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1144
00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 3>This is what people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're trying to talk about is </v>

1145
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 3>there's a mushroom that infects the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spores.</v>

1146
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:37.231
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ant convinced the ant to go some </v>

1147
00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:41.671
<v Speaker 3>linear high so that these cordyceps </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms grow inside the antibody body </v>

1148
00:48:41.671 --> 00:48:44.710
<v Speaker 3>and then it explodes and sprays spores </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air,</v>

1149
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 3>infecting all around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so gnarly nature.</v>

1150
00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 3>So not like if you watched the movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the movie alien.</v>

1151
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.390
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if this is 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

1152
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:57.970
<v Speaker 3>but I've always heard that that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>creature is a.</v>

1153
00:48:57.971 --> 00:49:01.640
<v Speaker 3>is a Mashup of real insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the.</v>

1154
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 3>The bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1155
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 3>so this is this a dead one that has it </v>
<v Speaker 3>already as a timelapse.</v>

1156
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 3>So in the time lapse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mushroom is growing out of the back</v>

1157
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:16.801
<v Speaker 3>of his aunt's head like this aunt has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been killed by this fungus and it's now </v>

1158
00:49:16.801 --> 00:49:21.751
<v Speaker 3>manifesting itself in this growing form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not really a plant.</v>

1159
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>misconstrue about fungus.</v>

1160
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 3>It's actually closer to an animal than </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is to vegetation.</v>

1161
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 3>They they breathe oxygen and breathe out</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon dioxide.</v>

1162
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 3>So this is some fucking freaky ass alien</v>
<v Speaker 3>life form.</v>

1163
00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 3>It was growing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His aunts had look at the size of that </v>

1164
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.040
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>

1165
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 3>It's so gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kills the ant and it grows mushrooms out</v>

1166
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 3>of it and then the spores blow up and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1167
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.240
<v Speaker 3>well that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so bizarre.</v>

1168
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's popping through its exoskeleton.</v>

1169
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.710
<v Speaker 3>That's so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1170
00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 3>you know where Ridley Scott got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1171
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Well do you know about that aquatic worm</v>
<v Speaker 3>that infects grasshoppers?</v>

1172
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.550
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1173
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 3>this is a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This aquatic worms.</v>

1174
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I love how focused and direct our </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation today.</v>

1175
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 3>So every one of them I do as a director </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my life,</v>

1176
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:17.470
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these aquatic worms.</v>

1177
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a.</v>

1178
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.310
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chronic.</v>

1179
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's aquatic warm,</v>

1180
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:23.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets inside of grasshopper and this </v>

1182
00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:31.711
<v Speaker 3>is one infected a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a praying mantis and this one's </v>

1183
00:50:31.711 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 3>going to burst out of the praying </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mantis,</v>

1184
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:35.800
<v Speaker 3>but when this aquatic worm gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1185
00:50:35.801 --> 00:50:37.440
<v Speaker 3>because you get it wet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it'll.</v>

1186
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:42.730
<v Speaker 3>It'll come out and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the aquatic worm that gets inside </v>

1187
00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:44.810
<v Speaker 3>grasshoppers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it reaches gestation,</v>

1188
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 3>when it reaches its,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1189
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's when it's time to be born,</v>

1190
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:53.530
<v Speaker 3>it rewires the grasshoppers brain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>talks the grasshopper into committing </v>

1191
00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:57.350
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the grasshopper jumps into a lake and</v>

1192
00:50:57.351 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 3>drowns and the aquatic worm comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>its body and swims away.</v>

1193
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this thing that's so nasty.</v>

1194
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Look at the size of this fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was living inside this praying </v>

1195
00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.131
<v Speaker 3>mantis while it was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it takes over the mind of these,</v>

1196
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.740
<v Speaker 3>these beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1197
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 3>look at this size of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1198
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:22.060
<v Speaker 3>it is a solid 30 to 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe more of the mass of the body of </v>

1199
00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so gnarly.</v>

1200
00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to believe when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the size of this thing,</v>

1201
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 3>because it's continuing to come out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasshopper.</v>

1202
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we had a scale,</v>

1203
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.320
<v Speaker 3>the grasshoppers maybe two inches long </v>
<v Speaker 3>mantis.</v>

1204
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 3>That's the man that meant this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a solid four inches long.</v>

1205
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1206
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Mantis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whatever length that is,</v>

1207
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.710
<v Speaker 3>the aquatic worms three times that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Which is just nuts and it's living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>its body and still coming out as we're </v>

1209
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:49.090
<v Speaker 3>talking about auto.</v>

1210
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking huge man and he's trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find water that's gravitating towards</v>

1211
00:51:53.661 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 3>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with grass hopping on fire.</v>

1212
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1213
00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.780
<v Speaker 3>That's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're lucky too little if,</v>

1214
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:01.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you find the grasshopper,</v>

1215
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 3>there's one where it talks the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasshopper,</v>

1216
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:09.130
<v Speaker 3>the grasshopper just jumps in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water just starts drowning and then </v>

1217
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 3>it pops out of its body and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

1218
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Such a creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy thing.</v>

1219
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 3>And in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the parasite world in particular,</v>

1220
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 3>like somehow or another predators to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>are less disturbing than parasites.</v>

1221
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's one that's coming out of it was a</v>

1222
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.120
<v Speaker 3>cricket or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be.</v>

1223
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Look at that creepy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1224
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm aquatic worms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1225
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 3>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

1226
00:52:33.231 --> 00:52:38.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to you about more </v>

1227
00:52:38.231 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>bizarrely edible of things that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1228
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.670
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people don't think of sturgeon </v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of them.</v>

1229
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that people eat sturgeon eggs,</v>

1230
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 3>but I really wasn't aware that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sturgeon was that delicious fish.</v>

1231
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I also wasn't aware that it was illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>to catch them.</v>

1232
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Like I for some reason thought that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were in danger.</v>

1233
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of the reasons why poaching</v>

1234
00:52:53.391 --> 00:52:58.391
<v Speaker 3>is such a big issue is because we're one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the last recreational fisheries in </v>

1235
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 3>the country for sturgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1236
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the populations.</v>

1237
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the um,</v>

1238
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:08.921
<v Speaker 3>the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>east coast sturgeon was fished out </v>

1239
00:53:08.921 --> 00:53:11.800
<v Speaker 3>around 100 years ago and they're only </v>
<v Speaker 3>now coming back in the east coast.</v>

1240
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.840
<v Speaker 3>There's still no fishery for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of the sturgeon you've seen </v>

1241
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.020
<v Speaker 3>restaurants in Sacramento is farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1242
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:23.110
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do they farm a sturgeon slowly,</v>

1243
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.560
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to be seven years </v>

1244
00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 3>before they can take it to market size.</v>

1245
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's like making bourbon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1246
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:36.831
<v Speaker 3>because I was reading like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was another commercial fish they </v>

1247
00:53:36.831 --> 00:53:41.121
<v Speaker 3>were talking about the amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it takes to grow a commercial fish </v>

1248
00:53:41.121 --> 00:53:42.720
<v Speaker 3>to the point where you can harvest it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was some insane number,</v>

1249
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:47.721
<v Speaker 3>like two inches a year where it takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever to grow these things to the </v>

1250
00:53:47.721 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was catfish.</v>

1251
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.940
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about like large </v>
<v Speaker 3>catfish.</v>

1252
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about what's going on </v>

1253
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 3>in the Ohio river that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1254
00:53:55.710 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 3>they're putting these catfish in lakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're taking them out of rivers,</v>

1255
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:02.730
<v Speaker 3>are putting large cat fish in lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't survive,</v>

1256
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 3>can only live in these lakes for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1257
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 3>but everybody wants to catch a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>catfish.</v>

1258
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:12.230
<v Speaker 3>So they have these commercial cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing businesses were recreational </v>

1259
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:15.060
<v Speaker 3>catfishing with take these people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll have them fishing in these lakes</v>

1260
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.420
<v Speaker 3>and they used some sort of chemical in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lake that forces the cat fish to </v>

1261
00:54:21.451 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 3>bite.</v>

1262
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

1263
00:54:23.741 --> 00:54:26.760
<v Speaker 3>this chemical fish bordello yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really gross man,</v>

1264
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 3>because it causes these legions on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>catfishes skin.</v>

1265
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 3>So these people catch these catfishes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have catfish rather sorry,</v>

1266
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:40.010
<v Speaker 3>and they have these red sores all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body because some chemicals have </v>

1267
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:44.621
<v Speaker 3>been introduced into the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I guess the irritant causes them </v>

1268
00:54:44.621 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 3>to like they're biting out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustration.</v>

1269
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe the unspeakable in pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the inevitable.</v>

1270
00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:54.700
<v Speaker 3>What's is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what a strange choice that people </v>

1271
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 3>have decided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take this animal out there.</v>

1272
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:58.720
<v Speaker 3>There's one with legions on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1273
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>

1274
00:55:00.511 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Another issue rises on bigger catfishes </v>
<v Speaker 3>are introduced into pay lakes.</v>

1275
00:55:03.721 --> 00:55:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So legs.</v>

1276
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these lakes.</v>

1277
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:10.240
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't even know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know there was a paleo.</v>

1278
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Like look at the all the spots on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1279
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Look at the fucking spots on that day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see you find what it says.</v>

1280
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.530
<v Speaker 3>That chemical is that they dumped into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water.</v>

1281
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Just go to the river in Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll kitchen ice one.</v>

1282
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I've caught 70 pounders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well in a river.</v>

1283
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many of them are out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>

1285
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 3>which fish you catch blue fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A white cat.</v>

1286
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:35.400
<v Speaker 3>A white cat because it's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why cats bluecat's channel cats,</v>

1287
00:55:35.401 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blues and whites are usually biggest.</v>

1288
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta heads get really big too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't live in Virginia.</v>

1289
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's called juicing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1290
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:46.650
<v Speaker 3>The chemicals they put in the water make</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish bite in the pe lake industry.</v>

1291
00:55:46.651 --> 00:55:51.651
<v Speaker 3>It's called juicing weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the fucking lesions on that </v>

1292
00:55:51.651 --> 00:55:51.900
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up a little Jimmy backup.</v>

1293
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poor things body.</v>

1294
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

1295
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

1296
00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't really understand how that ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>got past how people are like accepting </v>

1297
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1298
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a natural one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one below that.</v>

1299
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 3>This seems totally healthy that some got</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught from a river.</v>

1300
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 3>So these pay lakes is a is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's like a private land thing.</v>

1301
00:56:13.951 --> 00:56:18.951
<v Speaker 3>Somebody owns them and it just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumping these fish in there and </v>

1302
00:56:18.951 --> 00:56:18.951
<v Speaker 3>apparently they don't live there very </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

1303
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:21.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't else fishing equivalent of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a.</v>

1304
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 3>those little teeny high fence places you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see in the east.</v>

1305
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 3>You go hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go hunt elk on 40 acres.</v>

1306
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Do they have those in the east coast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so,</v>

1307
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Texas a lot of the high fence places </v>

1308
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.240
<v Speaker 3>are thousands and thousands of acres,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have them in the,</v>

1309
00:56:36.241 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 3>in the Midwest and the east,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes they're painfully small,</v>

1310
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tens of acres where effectively,</v>

1311
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're shooting something in a pen.</v>

1312
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I saw one that was 10 acres,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1313
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 3>It's on Ebay.</v>

1314
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were craigslist where this guy had</v>

1315
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:57.991
<v Speaker 3>put up this hunt in quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing air quotes for this enormous </v>

1316
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 3>buck that they had used for breeding on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this commercial,</v>

1317
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:07.190
<v Speaker 3>dear property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you own a piece of land and pro,</v>

1318
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:12.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Texas or in any place where they </v>

1319
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:15.001
<v Speaker 3>allow this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can buy deer and then have these </v>

1320
00:57:15.001 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 3>deer released onto your land and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can air quotes again,</v>

1321
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:22.770
<v Speaker 3>hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they raised these things to maturity </v>

1322
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 3>and they give them this massive protein </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich diet.</v>

1323
00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 3>And then they also have great genetics </v>
<v Speaker 3>on top of that.</v>

1324
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 3>So these deer have these insane antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Franken buck of all.</v>

1325
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:36.751
<v Speaker 3>They're so strange looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a weird thing when you see </v>

1326
00:57:36.751 --> 00:57:39.901
<v Speaker 3>them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what a regular wild Colorado </v>

1327
00:57:39.901 --> 00:57:42.010
<v Speaker 3>mule deer it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looks normal.</v>

1328
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:43.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what you see.</v>

1329
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Everybody recognizes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like when you see </v>

1330
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.220
<v Speaker 3>one of those bizarre farm raised box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they have bushes grown out</v>

1331
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1332
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 3>It's really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think it's attractive.</v>

1333
00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 3>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

1334
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.040
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1335
00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.030
<v Speaker 3>that classic line of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a regular,</v>

1336
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 3>of a deer that is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is imprinted on our brains.</v>

1337
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1338
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1339
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's some weird thing like double e fake</v>

1340
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 3>boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1341
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1342
00:58:10.661 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you went,</v>

1343
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.480
<v Speaker 3>you went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went too far.</v>

1344
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Like it is something that doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 3>any sense anymore.</v>

1345
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1346
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 3>another fish that I wanted to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is what are you going?</v>

1347
00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:22.690
<v Speaker 3>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out what?</v>

1348
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.950
<v Speaker 3>The juicing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1349
00:58:23.951 --> 00:58:26.550
<v Speaker 3>What's the Chemical Hopper Selfie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1350
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 3>So it says that it forces them to feed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and move excessively.</v>

1351
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 3>And then it also is used to like treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetation.</v>

1352
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:38.731
<v Speaker 3>And algae and other lakes kill an excess</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can kill fish too.</v>

1353
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 3>But it says it's designed to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>unwanted lake vegetation.</v>

1354
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Copper sulfate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also used to be put in canned </v>

1355
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 3>green beans to keep them green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1356
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it made people move around a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot after the eight.</v>

1357
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Fucking strange man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1358
00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:05.551
<v Speaker 3>what kind of monster pours out into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lake to get the fish to eat more?</v>

1359
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to you about Gar.</v>

1360
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had garfish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually haven't.</v>

1361
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I know guys who have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1362
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.550
<v Speaker 3>I know you have to pretty much clean it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a hatchet.</v>

1363
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.950
<v Speaker 3>And I know that everybody I know who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating Gar says is awesome.</v>

1364
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard smoked.</v>

1365
00:59:22.251 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Gar is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

1366
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a little tiny one pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1367
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

1368
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a crazy fish.</v>

1369
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Has been around for what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many millions of years of thing,</v>

1370
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 3>but a lot for like over a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally primitive.</v>

1371
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it literally looks like some kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a fucking dinosaur fish.</v>

1372
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 3>And those are in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Natural Texas.</v>

1373
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas.</v>

1374
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Louisiana.</v>

1375
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 3>And can you catch those on a hooker?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you spear them or you can get them on</v>

1376
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:47.990
<v Speaker 3>a hook?</v>

1377
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.100
<v Speaker 3>What do they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they have?</v>

1378
00:59:49.101 --> 00:59:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Wire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1379
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:51.340
<v Speaker 3>you'd better have a lot of wire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1380
00:59:51.341 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Like those teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember right.</v>

1381
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 3>They like live bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1382
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.700
<v Speaker 3>What an enormous fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird animal.</v>

1383
00:59:59.380 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1384
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a perspective shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's still.</v>

1385
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.300
<v Speaker 3>That's probably an eight foot car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a world record guard?</v>

1386
01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Let's tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess I'm going to say gets to 12 feet.</v>

1387
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Twelve feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going can be my guess.</v>

1388
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with 10.</v>

1389
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.660
<v Speaker 3>You're probably right though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New World record that says quick.</v>

1390
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Twelve feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's find it on the web.</v>

1391
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 3>What is the world record?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred 79 pounds.</v>

1392
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big is that?</v>

1393
01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 3>How long is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>200.</v>

1394
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Seventy nine pounds caught in 1951.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the world record.</v>

1395
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1396
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.890
<v Speaker 3>That's not from 1951.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'll get the size of that thing.</v>

1397
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alligator gar.</v>

1398
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Now is there a difference between an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alligator Gar and a regular garden?</v>

1399
01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a couple of different </v>

1400
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:45.420
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1401
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:45.420
<v Speaker 3>and you can eat them all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1402
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:45.880
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1403
01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:50.881
<v Speaker 3>that's another animal I didn't know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat these fish until I watched </v>

1404
01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:53.801
<v Speaker 3>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crazy reality shows where people live </v>

1405
01:00:53.801 --> 01:00:57.341
<v Speaker 3>in the mountains in other one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsistence shows bleed and we made </v>

1406
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:01.860
<v Speaker 3>people animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick's never made people igar.</v>

1407
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It's an literally as an armor plate on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outside of it.</v>

1408
01:01:05.631 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you need like a hatchet to get</v>

1409
01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:07.510
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1410
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people cutting through them </v>
<v Speaker 3>with what looks like a salsa holds.</v>

1411
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:16.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was what they were using was like </v>

1412
01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:16.330
<v Speaker 3>something you would trim branches off </v>
<v Speaker 3>loppers.</v>

1413
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Just try to cut through that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 seven inches and girth eight foot </v>

1414
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:25.190
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1415
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:26.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1416
01:01:26.811 --> 01:01:28.320
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a world record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1417
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.330
<v Speaker 3>That's just a giant one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1418
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a weird animal.</v>

1419
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:37.630
<v Speaker 3>It's just strange to me also that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals figured out how to stay alive </v>

1420
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.010
<v Speaker 3>like alligators and crocodiles for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1421
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 3>x amount of million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1422
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.240
<v Speaker 3>all these other things like large mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>bass are like so much more recent and </v>

1423
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.920
<v Speaker 3>these things swim amongst them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You strange remnants of a much more </v>

1424
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 3>savage past like the coelacanth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1425
01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:57.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a great one because that one they</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought until they caught one,</v>

1426
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:02.711
<v Speaker 3>it was like the early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it'd been extinct for </v>

1427
01:02:02.711 --> 01:02:02.711
<v Speaker 3>billions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>South Africa.</v>

1428
01:02:02.711 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now apparently like you can catch them </v>

1429
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1430
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a place where you can catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1431
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's legal.</v>

1432
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Well I think it's catch and release,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's uh,</v>

1433
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that,</v>

1434
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was up coelacanth,</v>

1435
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.750
<v Speaker 3>but when you catch them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super common,</v>

1436
01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like a news event when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>catch one anymore.</v>

1437
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one right there.</v>

1438
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a strange looking prehistoric </v>

1439
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>creature to actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think honestly,</v>

1440
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the gars more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre looking.</v>

1441
01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>But the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coelacanth if it's,</v>

1442
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>is it a deep water fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1443
01:02:32.861 --> 01:02:37.861
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep water section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you catch and release at deep </v>

1444
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:37.861
<v Speaker 1>water fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't they fuck though?</v>

1445
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Bringing them up through the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rockfish hard in the Pacific.</v>

1446
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:44.631
<v Speaker 1>They certainly are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the eyeballs pop out of </v>

1447
01:02:44.631 --> 01:02:44.631
<v Speaker 1>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>

1448
01:02:44.631 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>But link cod don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1449
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.160
<v Speaker 1>so if you catch a lean cod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bring them up to the surface and</v>

1450
01:02:48.161 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>there is that a coelacanth and someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught on a hook to you.</v>

1451
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you catch a link caught on a</v>

1452
01:02:53.431 --> 01:02:58.431
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just throw it back in the water </v>

1453
01:02:58.431 --> 01:02:59.330
<v Speaker 1>and even though it goes 500 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen her link card with Ben's real</v>

1454
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>rockfish.</v>

1455
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Always got them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a matter of the frailty of </v>

1456
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1457
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way the fish has built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1458
01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here I'm just guessing,</v>

1459
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but link,</v>

1460
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:15.980
<v Speaker 1>God will come from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom all the way up to the </v>

1461
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.171
<v Speaker 1>top to hunt as a beautiful fish too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas bucket mouth,</v>

1462
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>God was cool looking fresh and delicious</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1463
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Big Old bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that link,</v>

1464
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:30.210
<v Speaker 1>odds are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another one that looks like it's </v>

1465
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to be alive anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so awesome.</v>

1466
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.320
<v Speaker 1>They're so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lead biggest one I ever caught was a,</v>

1467
01:03:33.321 --> 01:03:38.321
<v Speaker 1>was a hitchhiker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had hit a rock fish brought the </v>

1468
01:03:38.321 --> 01:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>rockfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the surface and the link.</v>

1469
01:03:39.451 --> 01:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

1470
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Gaff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The linkcard wow.</v>

1471
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.390
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three pounds.</v>

1472
01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Well he wouldn't let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1473
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Why does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

1474
01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 1>if you let a 10 break the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you keep it's head in the water,</v>

1475
01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it won't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1476
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>So when head comes out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1477
01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>

1478
01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1479
01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's peculiar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So do you like it?</v>

1482
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:05.940

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It would be like tripping and hell </v>

1484
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:11.340
<v Speaker 1>sucked into that vortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1485
01:04:11.341 --> 01:04:12.540

<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1486
01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:17.541
<v Speaker 1>The event horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the demons taking over the </v>

1487
01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:17.541
<v Speaker 1>spaceship like sucked into that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:31.881
<v Speaker 1>You gotta grab that thing around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gills or gaffers and what is all that </v>

1493
01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:31.881
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1497
01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I used to know they turn blue because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they eat and I think it's like </v>

1498
01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:48.950
<v Speaker 1>salmon when you buy commercial salmon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to die the skin because </v>

1499
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.950
<v Speaker 1>they're not eating the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs.</v>

1500
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well farmed farmed Atlantic Salmon.</v>

1501
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1502
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>well they're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The red is from Krill.</v>

1503
01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue caught.</v>

1504
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is hilarious.</v>

1505
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:00.120
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen this article extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare,</v>

1506
01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>blue cod cod in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a.</v>

1507
01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was explained to me that they are </v>

1508
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>extremely rare in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that say Alaska Australia?</v>

1509
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Scroll up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>

1510
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're incredibly common where I </v>

1511
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.510
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1512
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I once I once hooked into 13 lingcod</v>

1513
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.430
<v Speaker 2>and one fishing trip and six of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>were blue.</v>

1514
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1515
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:28.190
<v Speaker 2>and this is all off the northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>California closes off the Marin Sonoma </v>

1516
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.290
<v Speaker 2>coast and that's a great area to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1517
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:32.440
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like not extremely rare.</v>

1518
01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Apparently up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there if they're rare,</v>

1519
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>but it has to do with their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1520
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:40.630
<v Speaker 2>So maybe that it migrate from up there </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way up to Alaska native,</v>

1521
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:45.690
<v Speaker 2>their native all the way up to Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that the really biggest ones or if </v>

1522
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>you catch them in the Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1523
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>50 pounders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1524
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.850
<v Speaker 2>the ones that would eat a toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1525
01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Alaska has those Goddamn halibut that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like our doors giant.</v>

1526
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:59.790
<v Speaker 2>So I was sort of sad because I went up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there because I wanted to catch a giant </v>

1527
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:02.530
<v Speaker 2>and then I was reading about it before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I realize that every,</v>

1528
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:06.070
<v Speaker 2>every halibut over about 125 pounds is </v>
<v Speaker 2>big breeding female.</v>

1529
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:10.640
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bad idea to land it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the halibut stocks and Alaska's</v>

1530
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 2>are not doing that well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So get to the surface,</v>

1531
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:17.800
<v Speaker 2>get a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your ideal halibut,</v>

1532
01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:19.990
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's like an 80 pounder or 85</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounder.</v>

1533
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.080
<v Speaker 2>That's plenty big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is plenty big and it's not </v>

1534
01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.631
<v Speaker 2>necessarily big breeding female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're not really going to hurt </v>

1535
01:06:27.631 --> 01:06:27.631
<v Speaker 2>the species is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1536
01:06:27.631 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 2>like the guys who keep the 400 pounders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1537
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:34.300
<v Speaker 2>And the weird thing about fish breeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior is that it's,</v>

1538
01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's exponential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a buddy of mine,</v>

1539
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.170
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Jay Waldron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1540
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 2>he landed 53 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>striper in the delta.</v>

1541
01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually it was a,</v>

1542
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:51.270
<v Speaker 2>it was a fishing buddy and they tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tried and tried and tried to revive </v>

1543
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.270
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

1544
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>it died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sucked.</v>

1545
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1546
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:59.700
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was that thing there would be </v>

1547
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.670
<v Speaker 2>like the supermom for thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of stripers </v>

1548
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Morales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An 18 inch striper that was a female </v>

1549
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 2>would not be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not linear.</v>

1550
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they get a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1551
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:12.910
<v Speaker 2>they get exponentially better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1552
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>

1553
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:18.810
<v Speaker 2>did have exponentially more breeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>power as they get bigger and bigger and </v>

1554
01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's generally not a good idea to,</v>

1555
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 2>to eat our seed corn even if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>

1556
01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1557
01:07:23.821 --> 01:07:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend of mine of cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous halibut on a boat.</v>

1558
01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:28.680
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a charter boats,</v>

1559
01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:31.560
<v Speaker 3>fishing boats and calmer when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling it up.</v>

1560
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.530
<v Speaker 3>They cut the line on him and he was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed off.</v>

1561
01:07:34.531 --> 01:07:36.360
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to tell them like,</v>

1562
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:37.470
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't keep this one.</v>

1563
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.170
<v Speaker 3>It was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like I go how big,</v>

1564
01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.420
<v Speaker 3>and he's like more than 300 pounds we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1565
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how big it took </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever to bring in,</v>

1566
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:47.550
<v Speaker 3>but once we got it to the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to cut the line.</v>

1567
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:52.610
<v Speaker 3>They let it go and he was so pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just the right thing to do </v>

1568
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:52.610
<v Speaker 3>biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

1569
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:57.260
<v Speaker 3>It totally makes sense and is such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool looking animal to like what a bus </v>

1570
01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:57.260
<v Speaker 3>train.</v>

1571
01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Glad that fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1572
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.070
<v Speaker 2>that one's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred 55 pounds.</v>

1573
01:08:02.071 --> 01:08:03.870
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't have killed that one.</v>

1574
01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know.</v>

1575
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's legal.</v>

1576
01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:10.731
<v Speaker 2>It's not illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's supposed to do it because the </v>

1577
01:08:10.731 --> 01:08:10.731
<v Speaker 2>stocks are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're okay,</v>

1578
01:08:10.731 --> 01:08:15.531
<v Speaker 2>but they're not doing super great </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the chances are the in the next </v>

1579
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>dropdown</v>

1580
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.140
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get to 75 pounder </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

1581
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really there's Jesus.</v>

1582
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.860
<v Speaker 3>You see the ones in the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you should be keeping.</v>

1583
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>The two 87.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd let that go because think about it.</v>

1584
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 3>How much hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are you going to eat really?</v>

1585
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1586
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:35.291
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know most guys are gonna go up to </v>

1587
01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:35.291
<v Speaker 3>Alaska once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1588
01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:35.840
<v Speaker 3>But still those other ones are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>

1589
01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It was easily three or four of those in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 70 pound range.</v>

1590
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 87 pound fish is a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass fucking Fishman.</v>

1591
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flake,</v>

1592
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:49.630
<v Speaker 3>the flake on those big halibut is so big</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>

1593
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 3>it gets so coarse that they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're okay.</v>

1594
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean they taste fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1595
01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:58.130
<v Speaker 3>they're harder to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When my oldest daughter was,</v>

1596
01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I guess she was like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there,</v>

1597
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 3>12 or 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1598
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.020
<v Speaker 3>she's real sensitive.</v>

1599
01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:07.910
<v Speaker 3>She's very sweet person and she wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a vegetarian and uh,</v>

1600
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was a vegetarian for a while.</v>

1601
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Then she started eating meat again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she always loves animals and I said,</v>

1602
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:16.070
<v Speaker 3>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go fishing.</v>

1603
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:18.110
<v Speaker 3>And this is before I ever hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1604
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 3>let's go fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll catch a fish and we'll cook it.</v>

1605
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:25.661
<v Speaker 3>And it's a kind of a cool experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you get to experience catching </v>

1606
01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:25.661
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking it.</v>

1607
01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 3>So we went out on his boat five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the trip.</v>

1608
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:29.980
<v Speaker 3>We catch a fucking Marlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1609
01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 3>And Are you fishing Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1610
01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:35.650
<v Speaker 3>we're in Hawaii and five minutes in we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1611
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:38.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not a big Marlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about a 70 pound Marlin.</v>

1612
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a while to get an onboard.</v>

1613
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 3>We get on board and then the guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>run the boat beat this thing to death in</v>

1614
01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:47.600
<v Speaker 3>front of her with a club because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do.</v>

1615
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 3>You get a Marlin on board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you beat it to death.</v>

1616
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way to stop it from </v>

1617
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.650
<v Speaker 3>flopping around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would they kill it needed?</v>

1618
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat them.</v>

1619
01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1620
01:09:57.351 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Speaker 3>they smoke them apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1621
01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:01.280
<v Speaker 3>But that was another thing I thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marlin's aren't good.</v>

1622
01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you just said that because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most recent trip that I had,</v>

1623
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:09.791
<v Speaker 3>I was in Hawaii just a month ago and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only state I've never been </v>

1624
01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:09.791
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1625
01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:11.630
<v Speaker 3>you got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a magic place.</v>

1626
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Hawaii has an energy that when </v>

1627
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you get off the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1628
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here.</v>

1629
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Like it's got a feel to it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on a fucking volcano.</v>

1630
01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 3>A volcano in the middle of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1631
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:24.610
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1632
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Volcano popped at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>

1633
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:31.180
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We took a helicopter where you fly over </v>

1634
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.791
<v Speaker 3>the volcano as it leaks into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the steam coming up as the lava </v>

1635
01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 3>is flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1636
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pulled me.</v>

1637
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.300
<v Speaker 3>She's such a sweet kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so sensitive and friendly and nice</v>

1638
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.600
<v Speaker 3>and they beat this fucking and Marlin to</v>
<v Speaker 3>death in front of her and then they're </v>

1639
01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.101
<v Speaker 3>covering it with bags of ice and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>all psyched and it's making all these </v>

1640
01:10:51.101 --> 01:10:54.881
<v Speaker 3>weird noises and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just starts to calm down and get </v>

1641
01:10:54.881 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 3>over it and then 20 minutes later start </v>
<v Speaker 3>flopping again.</v>

1642
01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not totally dead.</v>

1643
01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I've never been able to take her fishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>since she's 20 now.</v>

1644
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.200
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

1645
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 3>fuck you dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you do?</v>

1646
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.860
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

1647
01:11:09.861 --> 01:11:12.200
<v Speaker 3>this is where we get fished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This were from,</v>

1648
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 3>it was the size of a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1649
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dog size thing.</v>

1650
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:18.840
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like we brought in,</v>

1651
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 12 inch trout.</v>

1652
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a giant ass living creature that </v>

1653
01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:26.860
<v Speaker 3>these guys beat to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1654
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a small boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1655
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 3>they beat it to death five feet from </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1656
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.450
<v Speaker 3>so five feet away they're beaten this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing with club.</v>

1657
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:37.080
<v Speaker 3>And I just kind of dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very dramatic.</v>

1659
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.150
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1660
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 3>So that was the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about taking her hunting,</v>

1661
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:50.060
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think still that fucking one Marlin </v>

1662
01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:50.060
<v Speaker 3>messes with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1663
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.470
<v Speaker 3>but they were telling me that you had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke it.</v>

1664
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 3>But on the last trip that I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was about a month ago,</v>

1665
01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.420
<v Speaker 3>these guys were telling me that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1666
01:11:57.421 --> 01:11:57.660
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1667
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 3>You can cut it and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like swordfish.</v>

1668
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cut it and grill.</v>

1669
01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:02.370
<v Speaker 3>No reason why you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had.</v>

1670
01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:07.371
<v Speaker 3>You've ever had it though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never actually said why were you </v>

1671
01:12:07.371 --> 01:12:07.920
<v Speaker 3>saying why would you keep Marlin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because almost nobody does.</v>

1672
01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Like you didn't like if you go to Costa </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rica or Baja or the Caribbean,</v>

1673
01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:17.270
<v Speaker 3>they're caught in a catch and release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only do that to ensure the population.</v>

1674
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1675
01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 3>because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1676
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that the Hawaiians Cedam but </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've eaten it and it's just.</v>

1677
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:27.230
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean almost all Marlin fishing is </v>

1678
01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 3>catch and release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1679
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

1680
01:12:28.861 --> 01:12:31.010
<v Speaker 3>that's the big trophy fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1681
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.150
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never caught one wall.</v>

1682
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:38.640
<v Speaker 3>That was the only time I ever caught one</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we caught it maybe 10 minutes </v>

1683
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.380
<v Speaker 3>into fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swordfish.</v>

1684
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Get that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 3>But that one's coming over the rail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:48.501
<v Speaker 3>That's delicious fish right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that takes a significantly </v>

1687
01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 3>different than a Marlin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they're pretty similar.</v>

1688
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know why I was wanting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ask you about God because I've always</v>

1689
01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:59.241
<v Speaker 3>wanted to go golf fishing because I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen them and when you see those images </v>

1690
01:12:59.241 --> 01:12:59.470
<v Speaker 3>that we just looked at like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

1691
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I want to see that thing in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would wish to.</v>

1692
01:13:02.081 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 3>You had tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried a lot of things.</v>

1693
01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 3>How have you not both in paddlefish is </v>
<v Speaker 3>an interesting one.</v>

1695
01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a Sacramento fish too,</v>

1696
01:13:10.741 --> 01:13:12.480
<v Speaker 3>is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a Missouri River thing.</v>

1697
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 3>They're cousins of the sturgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1698
01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one that doesn't really have,</v>

1699
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any bones,</v>

1700
01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:20.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either.</v>

1701
01:13:20.671 --> 01:13:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Just sturgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1702
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sturgeon's law like a shark in that </v>

1703
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:27.770
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 3>But start sharks have bones only around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jaw right now.</v>

1705
01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.560
<v Speaker 3>There's also some weird thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>paddlefish where you pull that spinal </v>

1706
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.321
<v Speaker 3>cord out of them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a weird looking fucking thing that </v>

1707
01:13:39.321 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty tasty though.</v>

1708
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:41.840
<v Speaker 3>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1709
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:44.280
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever had lump fish caviar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what that is.</v>

1710
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never.</v>

1711
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:49.470
<v Speaker 3>What is a lump fish caviar caviar out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a paddle fish?</v>

1712
01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they call it paddle </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>

1713
01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:52.440
<v Speaker 3>but they should just call it paddlefish </v>
<v Speaker 3>caviar,</v>

1714
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:57.500
<v Speaker 3>which I think they are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something about the restrictions on </v>

1715
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 3>commercial paddle fishing because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think there is.</v>

1716
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all recreational now.</v>

1717
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.450
<v Speaker 3>And then some states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1718
01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 3>that looks like a fake animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even look real football fish.</v>

1719
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 3>But I think that concern was about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>caviar.</v>

1720
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was again,</v>

1721
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

1722
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.990
<v Speaker 1>an illegal trade in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in uh,</v>

1723
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:22.530
<v Speaker 1>and paddlefish caviar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some states where you can </v>

1724
01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>keep your fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fish and game keeps the caviar.</v>

1725
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre.</v>

1726
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.110
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's pretty good.</v>

1727
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be illegal to sell,</v>

1728
01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>but like in Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missouri fishing game.</v>

1729
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Keep the caviar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do this?</v>

1730
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>They sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1731
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>that's even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1732
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>that's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1733
01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it probably.</v>

1734
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope I'm,</v>

1735
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missourians will,</v>

1736
01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell us,</v>

1737
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but I would hope that the proceeds from </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling the caviar by fish fishing game </v>

1738
01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>would go back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like habitat restoration or something.</v>

1739
01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:55.531
<v Speaker 1>I would hope so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would hope so that you could pay </v>

1740
01:14:55.531 --> 01:14:56.600
<v Speaker 1>like an additional tag and get to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the caviar.</v>

1741
01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying he caught a female and he pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extra $30 or something like that.</v>

1742
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:04.981
<v Speaker 1>And You keep the caviar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't in some states like </v>

1743
01:15:04.981 --> 01:15:04.981
<v Speaker 1>Montana for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

<v Speaker 1>put in his mouth.</v>

1781
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Python.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Python in the everglades.</v>

1783
01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he try to do anything with it?</v>

1784
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Marinated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he tried it every which way,</v>

1785
01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:35.400
<v Speaker 1>but Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just like,</v>

1786
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:36.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of it here.</v>

1787
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how do you know when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating something like that?</v>

1788
01:16:38.411 --> 01:16:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it's actually edible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1789
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you can do some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like allbirds are edible.</v>

1790
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:44.920
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allbirds.</v>

1791
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some disgusting and fishy.</v>

1792
01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:49.870
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most mammals are edible,</v>

1793
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the livers on polar bears have so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin A,</v>

1795
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:54.670
<v Speaker 1>it'll kill you if you eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1796
01:16:54.671 --> 01:16:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't need polar bear liver.</v>

1797
01:16:56.570 --> 01:17:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Just just the dude I was about to pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>tip another protest to show folks what a</v>

1798
01:17:03.281 --> 01:17:05.600
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1799
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:09.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like so random it polar bears and </v>
<v Speaker 1>odd,</v>

1800
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1801
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a strange animal in that it's </v>

1802
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:14.800
<v Speaker 1>just 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bear,</v>

1803
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.881
<v Speaker 1>but it's 100 percent carnivorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a vegetable to be seen up </v>

1804
01:17:18.881 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 1>there and it's adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him eat seaweed on TV.</v>

1805
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1806
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because they're freaking </v>

1807
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:29.561
<v Speaker 1>out because they have no sea ice anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're just doing whatever they </v>

1808
01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:30.570
<v Speaker 1>can do to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1809
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:36.730
<v Speaker 1>that's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a really fucking scary video of </v>

1810
01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A polar bear.</v>

1811
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:42.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a seal on an ice shelf and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polar bear slips up behind the seal and </v>

1812
01:17:43.571 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 1>the seal isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1813
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 1>and the seals like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>

1814
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:49.490
<v Speaker 1>They just tries to get away and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sad look on his face.</v>

1815
01:17:49.491 --> 01:17:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1816
01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.680
<v Speaker 1>oh you Lucille,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gets into the water and then the </v>

1817
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.780
<v Speaker 1>polar bears in the water right behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them seconds later,</v>

1818
01:17:56.781 --> 01:18:01.781
<v Speaker 1>and then the polar bear comes out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an incident in his jaws as a Goddamn </v>

1819
01:18:01.781 --> 01:18:01.880
<v Speaker 1>ruth was animal.</v>

1820
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It's poppy's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to eat,</v>

1821
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:05.840
<v Speaker 1>was no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

1822
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:08.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there it is.</v>

1823
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just slowly creeps up.</v>

1824
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.750
<v Speaker 1>It slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just moving around.</v>

1825
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And that sea lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a sea lion?</v>

1826
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a static seal.</v>

1827
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:24.310
<v Speaker 1>So apparently they differentiate seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that one's a good tasting one </v>

1828
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:27.440
<v Speaker 1>and then I think if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is the one that gets eaten,</v>

1829
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:32.441
<v Speaker 1>it's the good tasting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another one that it's </v>

1830
01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.831
<v Speaker 1>really nasty with the sharp teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the polar bears and leave that one </v>

1831
01:18:35.831 --> 01:18:35.831
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a leopard seal.</v>

1832
01:18:35.831 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So when you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1833
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:41.591
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a that some CEO that lives up </v>

1834
01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 1>in the Arctic that's kind of bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>leopard seals are amazing.</v>

1835
01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy animal.</v>

1836
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I remember that marching at the penguins</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1837
01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know there was a leopard </v>
<v Speaker 1>seal real.</v>

1838
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1839
01:18:50.121 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 1>we're just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

1840
01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.320
<v Speaker 1>And he just right in the water after </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1841
01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't gonna make it there.</v>

1842
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I like the silence is kind of epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a standup comedian,</v>

1843
01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Fitzgerald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1844
01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:14.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a veterinarian and I worked with </v>

1845
01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:15.761
<v Speaker 1>them once in Denver and he told me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>polar bears are one of the few animals </v>

1846
01:19:15.761 --> 01:19:19.361
<v Speaker 1>that when they come out of the womb to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elect a little alien from the movie </v>

1847
01:19:19.361 --> 01:19:23.351
<v Speaker 1>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the burst out of the chest lifting to </v>

1848
01:19:23.351 --> 01:19:23.351
<v Speaker 1>bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1849
01:19:23.351 --> 01:19:25.370
<v Speaker 1>they are predatory from the moment they </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of the vagina.</v>

1850
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said they just look at you </v>

1851
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:31.080
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at you like your meat leds.</v>

1852
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1853
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:31.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another friend of mine,</v>

1854
01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:33.800
<v Speaker 1>a woman named Rebecca who's really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>with animals,</v>

1855
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1856
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:36.950
<v Speaker 1>she works with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's worked with all kinds of animals,</v>

1857
01:19:36.951 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 1>but she mostly focuses on raptors now.</v>

1858
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1859
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:44.990
<v Speaker 1>she worked with cats back in the day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said that,</v>

1860
01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions are big kitty cats.</v>

1861
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.110
<v Speaker 1>They're giant house cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can understand a house cat,</v>

1862
01:19:51.111 --> 01:19:56.111
<v Speaker 1>you can understand a mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>leopards and jaguars very different </v>

1863
01:19:56.111 --> 01:19:56.490
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1864
01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:57.890
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1865
01:19:57.891 --> 01:20:02.891
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at you for you to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and it's just a very different </v>

1866
01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 1>vibe from those cats and funded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>

1867
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1868
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 1>don't make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1869
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1870
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>back to our talk about Jaguars coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into the United States.</v>

1871
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any animal that's forced to kill things </v>

1872
01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.671
<v Speaker 1>with its face in order to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketchy thing to have in your </v>

1873
01:20:22.671 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just so big.</v>

1874
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They need so much food too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1875
01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you think about how big a polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much actual meat the thing must need</v>

1876
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 1>to consume in order to keep that mass a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

1877
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1878
01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:35.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1879
01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a place called Ollie's big game </v>
<v Speaker 1>lodge and packs in Nebraska and it's one</v>

1880
01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>of these places in the middle of western</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska is kind of a knower,</v>

1881
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's where you get off the highway </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got to go eat and uh,</v>

1882
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:47.760
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk in,</v>

1883
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:48.780
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

1884
01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:53.810
<v Speaker 1>there's this giant 12 foot tall polar </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear stuffed like right at the door when</v>

1885
01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:59.061
<v Speaker 1>you open up the door and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you an instantaneous notion of </v>

1886
01:20:59.061 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 1>how small you are compared to a polar </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

1887
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:00.900
<v Speaker 1>They're the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1888
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bigger than a Kodiak bears.</v>

1889
01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1890
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing,</v>

1891
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:11.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An animal that lives whereas no </v>

1892
01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:13.131
<v Speaker 1>vegetation and does the law all the life</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the sea and it's bigger than </v>

1893
01:21:13.131 --> 01:21:14.880
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1894
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:20.270
<v Speaker 1>blubber must be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What isn't also that principle that the </v>

1895
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 1>larger mammals Bergman's rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the further north you go,</v>

1896
01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:25.200
<v Speaker 1>the larger body has to be in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain his skull Bergman's rule.</v>

1897
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Thus Scandinavians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:32.370
<v Speaker 1>That's another animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears are that Steve Rinella likes to </v>

1899
01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:33.210
<v Speaker 1>call charismatic megafauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an,</v>

1900
01:21:33.230 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that's an old biological term for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for when back in the seventies when,</v>

1901
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:42.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save the whales and everything and </v>

1902
01:21:42.801 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 1>everybody who was studying keystone </v>
<v Speaker 1>species like Krill or you know,</v>

1903
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:44.910
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't very charismatic were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1904
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:50.430
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to say the charismatic </v>

1905
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 1>megafauna and what really is the key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything of these,</v>

1906
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:56.210
<v Speaker 1>this indiscriminate Krill or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little teeny forage fish or </v>

1907
01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:56.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1908
01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Or like ants we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say of all the aunts died,</v>

1909
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 1>there would be no life on this planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of 100 years.</v>

1910
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead.</v>

1911
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Even though it might be less than 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1912
01:22:08.071 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Find out what would happen if all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ants dot.</v>

1913
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually less than 100 fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>ants.</v>

1914
01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I hate fire ants with.</v>

1915
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 1>They're not nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely.</v>

1916
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>When I first discovered fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they existed all the time,</v>

1917
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:24.351
<v Speaker 1>but I'd never actually encountered them </v>
<v Speaker 1>until I was in Texas in Austin digging </v>

1918
01:22:24.351 --> 01:22:26.400
<v Speaker 1>wild onions and these ants crawl over my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

1919
01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

1920
01:22:26.851 --> 01:22:31.851
<v Speaker 1>there's an isolated Florida Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were all over the place and my </v>

1921
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:38.850
<v Speaker 1>friend Jesse is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have died for sure.</v>

1922
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:41.640
<v Speaker 1>There was some little old lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember the story?</v>

1923
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:46.641
<v Speaker 1>She tripped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell right onto a mound and they just </v>

1924
01:22:46.641 --> 01:22:47.910
<v Speaker 1>consumed or with bites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1925
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And just fucked her up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought she was a threat and time </v>

1926
01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:53.060
<v Speaker 1>to take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1927
01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>what's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going to be on that poor ladies </v>

1928
01:22:57.570 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1929
01:22:57.570 --> 01:22:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1930
01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of bullet ants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1931
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:23:00.251 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting one.</v>

1933
01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Didn't Steve and counter Bolivia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia.</v>

1934
01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the same place where he ate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey.</v>

1935
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1936
01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.590
<v Speaker 1>thanks dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't eat a monkey now.</v>

1937
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.870
<v Speaker 1>That's where you cross the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if someone cooked it in front of you</v>

1938
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:15.871
<v Speaker 1>and it smelled good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the bowl and you were with </v>

1939
01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:15.871
<v Speaker 1>these people and they were all eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1940
01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't take a bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1941
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to judge that when I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would.</v>

1942
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I would probably try and get out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation before it ever happened.</v>

1943
01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I would worry about primate primate </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>

1944
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 1>like I know they're cooking it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1945
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but I know that prions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prions,</v>

1946
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>it caused mad cow disease that come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain matter.</v>

1947
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1948
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:34.950
<v Speaker 1>chronic wasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that from prions as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

1950
01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then chronic wasting disease for </v>

1951
01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 1>folks who don't know what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is a disease that affects dear and</v>

1952
01:23:43.241 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 1>it's really common in the Midwest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that it may have originated,</v>

1953
01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:52.411
<v Speaker 1>at least this is the rumor from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird commercial dear farms where they </v>

1954
01:23:52.411 --> 01:23:56.791
<v Speaker 1>grow all these deer and they all lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>together because apparently one of the </v>

1955
01:23:56.791 --> 01:24:00.490
<v Speaker 1>things that happens is if deer eat out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the same spot,</v>

1956
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.560
<v Speaker 1>like that's where it develops.</v>

1957
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if there's like a feed tray and </v>

1958
01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>they're all eating out of the feature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unnatural for the wild,</v>

1959
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:09.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

1961
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:11.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1962
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.300
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to.</v>

1963
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get asked about it all the time,</v>

1964
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1965
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:17.820
<v Speaker 1>what do I do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1966
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.280
<v Speaker 1>if I want to make chops or for I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make stock out of the bones of the deer,</v>

1967
01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do with cwt?</v>

1968
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:28.321
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done an exhaustive look of all the </v>

1969
01:24:28.321 --> 01:24:31.740
<v Speaker 1>science that's out there and it's never </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped the species barrier to humans to </v>

1970
01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:31.740
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1971
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:35.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's primarily gonna be located in,</v>

1972
01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 1>in spinal tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your pelvis to skull and that's not </v>

1973
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>what we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it was me,</v>

1974
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:48.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was testing available for my </v>

1975
01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:48.980
<v Speaker 1>dear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would absolutely do it.</v>

1976
01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in the clear and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearer and if not it was too hard.</v>

1977
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I would probably keep the limb bones but</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the uh,</v>

1978
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 1>but not anything off the spinal column </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've just,</v>

1979
01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would keep the limb bones for </v>

1980
01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:01.890
<v Speaker 1>marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1981
01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:02.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either marrow or um,</v>

1982
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 1>or making a stocks and broths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1983
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking,</v>

1984
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:06.810
<v Speaker 1>cooking shanks on the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1985
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.640
<v Speaker 1>And when you do shanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you braise them slow cook.</v>

1986
01:25:09.641 --> 01:25:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a neglected part of,</v>

1987
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of undulates right?</v>

1988
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the single easiest way of,</v>

1989
01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the stupid catchphrase opening or a </v>

1990
01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.591
<v Speaker 1>game because it grinding shank meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>socks because there's so much connected </v>

1991
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.450
<v Speaker 1>tissue and they're easy to solve for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sawzall or hacksaw.</v>

1992
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 1>They usually will fit in your pot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing race like that.</v>

1993
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And even if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you do different and </v>

1994
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 1>besides your butcher will like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all he's got to do is solve them</v>

1995
01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in a butcher paper,</v>

1996
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:44.940
<v Speaker 1>butcher paper and bring it back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you started your,</v>

1997
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
<v Speaker 1>your hunting and cooking career off you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start as a chef and then you wanted to </v>

1998
01:25:50.441 --> 01:25:55.441
<v Speaker 1>get closer and may maybe understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were cooking better.</v>

1999
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good way to describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that accurate as sort of.</v>

2000
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2001
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:05.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started hunting in Minnesota and my </v>

2002
01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:05.251
<v Speaker 1>best friend was the</v>

2003
01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:09.520
<v Speaker 2>outdoor writer for the St Paul Pioneer </v>
<v Speaker 2>Press and we had been fishing at the </v>

2004
01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.810
<v Speaker 2>time and then hunting season came around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he invited me out.</v>

2005
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:14.270
<v Speaker 2>And it hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let me preface this,</v>

2006
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:19.271
<v Speaker 2>but he'd been sort of plying me with </v>
<v Speaker 2>mallards and with rabbits and with some </v>

2007
01:26:19.271 --> 01:26:22.511
<v Speaker 2>venison prior to me ever going out so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had killed.</v>

2008
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.820
<v Speaker 2>He wanted you to try and this and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were already a shaft by then.</v>

2009
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point it was a newspaper </v>

2010
01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:30.880
<v Speaker 2>reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started as a restaurant Cook,</v>

2011
01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>line cook and a low level sous chef.</v>

2012
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Then I went into newspapers and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was still in as a newspaper </v>

2013
01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:36.670
<v Speaker 2>reporter at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2014
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I got into it because I wanted to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

2015
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I loved cooking the mallards I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking pheasants.</v>

2016
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.490
<v Speaker 2>I love cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2017
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 2>medicine and he can't buy it.</v>

2018
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:49.990
<v Speaker 2>So gotta learn to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that was really life</v>

2019
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:55.001
<v Speaker 2>changing about it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a pretty good fisherman and when </v>

2020
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a place for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2021
01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you learn to read the body water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2022
01:27:00.171 --> 01:27:03.140
<v Speaker 2>in my case back in Long Island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn tides,</v>

2023
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:08.260
<v Speaker 2>you learn weather patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learned all of the little </v>

2024
01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.640
<v Speaker 2>intricacies of what it takes to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on fish.</v>

2025
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
<v Speaker 2>So most anglers are just and lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real fisherman knows where to put </v>

2026
01:27:17.271 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 2>the boat to find the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how fast patrol knows what,</v>

2027
01:27:20.751 --> 01:27:22.370
<v Speaker 2>what angle to the waves you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2028
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 2>all these little detailed things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew that,</v>

2029
01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:30.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Chris knew this by looking at </v>

2030
01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:30.700
<v Speaker 2>the land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he could just take out a glance,</v>

2031
01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:30.860
<v Speaker 2>you could look at a field like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

2032
01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:35.861
<v Speaker 2>no fences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be in that and I didn't </v>

2033
01:27:35.861 --> 01:27:35.861
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know?</v>

2034
01:27:35.861 --> 01:27:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And he just knew because he'd done this </v>
<v Speaker 2>a zillion times and his ability to read </v>

2035
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.180
<v Speaker 2>land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could read water.</v>

2036
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I wanted that ability and that every bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as I'm the eating part of it was</v>

2037
01:27:48.771 --> 01:27:52.130
<v Speaker 2>what brought me into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you say that you really enjoyed</v>

2038
01:27:52.131 --> 01:27:53.900
<v Speaker 2>cooking them and you really enjoy eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2039
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:58.100
<v Speaker 2>is it because the flavors are different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more complex,</v>

2040
01:27:58.101 --> 01:27:59.950
<v Speaker 2>they're more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2041
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.960
<v Speaker 2>one of the main criticisms that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have said to me when I talk about wild </v>

2042
01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:06.940
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2043
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.230
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried Venessa in like it's game me and</v>

2044
01:28:09.231 --> 01:28:11.960
<v Speaker 2>my God damn somebody ruined you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2045
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:14.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they did something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2046
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's two things to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one I think we both agree that what </v>

2047
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>we would call Gamie is somebody screwed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2048
01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:27.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So poor you almost 75 percent of all </v>

2049
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>good venison care happens before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet ever gets the kitchen.</v>

2050
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:34.310
<v Speaker 2>So that can give you what we would call </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamey.</v>

2051
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:39.680
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I've had people eat backstrap</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was perfectly prepared,</v>

2052
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 2>perfectly cared for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

2053
01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:46.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of gave me what they're </v>

2054
01:28:46.391 --> 01:28:46.391
<v Speaker 2>talking about is that it doesn't taste </v>
<v Speaker 2>like corn.</v>

2055
01:28:46.391 --> 01:28:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Every meat animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including to some extent salmon that we </v>

2056
01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.900
<v Speaker 2>will get an a supermarket is corn fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2057
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:55.100
<v Speaker 2>they corn feed salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2058
01:28:55.101 --> 01:28:57.460
<v Speaker 2>That it's in the pellets that they feed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them Christ.</v>

2059
01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn corn industry that it has its </v>

2060
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.550
<v Speaker 2>tentacles deep into America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2061
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:08.960
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those corn tastes like it has very </v>

2062
01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:08.960
<v Speaker 2>particular favorite pillow file.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so with,</v>

2063
01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 2>with that flavor profile is broken by </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer that ate something else.</v>

2064
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2065
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:15.810
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2066
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tastes like something.</v>

2067
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Someone can actually lived a life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me that about mule deer,</v>

2068
01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:24.891
<v Speaker 2>that they don't like mule deer because </v>
<v Speaker 2>mule deer tastes like the sage that it </v>

2069
01:29:24.891 --> 01:29:26.310
<v Speaker 2>eats and that they like white tails </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they corn.</v>

2070
01:29:26.311 --> 01:29:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ man.</v>

2071
01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had a mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They taste great.</v>

2072
01:29:30.151 --> 01:29:32.280
<v Speaker 2>You're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a no.</v>

2073
01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Then people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk is so much better than deer.</v>

2074
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2075
01:29:36.181 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some minor differences in</v>

2076
01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:39.540
<v Speaker 2>subtle differences</v>

2077
01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.440
<v Speaker 2>if you put one next to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2078
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:45.080
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that dramatic.</v>

2079
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a duck hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between a Spoonie and a </v>

2080
01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:52.280
<v Speaker 2>pin tail is profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a spoonie and what's a pin tail?</v>

2081
01:29:52.281 --> 01:29:57.020
<v Speaker 2>So a spoonie is in northern shoveler and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the least desired ducks that</v>

2082
01:29:57.021 --> 01:29:58.610
<v Speaker 2>we are then shoveler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.860
<v Speaker 2>And is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a diver doc?</v>

2084
01:30:00.861 --> 01:30:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a hybrid.</v>

2085
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2086
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.300
<v Speaker 2>it's technically a puddle duck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it dives more so than the other </v>

2087
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:09.920
<v Speaker 2>puddle duck if you don't mind explaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people what the differences are.</v>

2088
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:13.130
<v Speaker 2>So every bucket you've seen in a park </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his butt up in the air,</v>

2089
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a Dabbler or a puddle duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a diver duck is a duck that dives </v>

2090
01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:23.821
<v Speaker 2>very deep and the deepest of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a third kind of duck called the sea </v>

2091
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:23.821
<v Speaker 2>dock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as you might guess,</v>

2092
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:24.650
<v Speaker 2>listen deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

2093
01:30:24.651 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep water.</v>

2094
01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.730
<v Speaker 2>So divers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be like bluebills,</v>

2095
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:29.150
<v Speaker 2>canvasbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redheads,</v>

2096
01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.060
<v Speaker 2>buffalo heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold,</v>

2097
01:30:30.061 --> 01:30:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Nih.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2098
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.710
<v Speaker 2>and then puddle docs would be obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mallard,</v>

2099
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:37.040
<v Speaker 2>which everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mallards pin tales,</v>

2100
01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.450
<v Speaker 2>spoonie wigeon a teal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in general,</v>

2101
01:30:41.451 --> 01:30:44.330
<v Speaker 2>puddle ducks tastes better than diver </v>
<v Speaker 2>ducks because the,</v>

2102
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.480
<v Speaker 2>what they eat and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2103
01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.840
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ducks are all omnivores much like </v>

2104
01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:53.750
<v Speaker 2>pigs and bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a spoonie which loves to eat</v>

2105
01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.840
<v Speaker 2>shrimp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He things and algae may versus a pentel </v>

2106
01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.160
<v Speaker 2>which loves seeds in seeds of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds.</v>

2107
01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's a more tasty bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any bird that eats seeds as a matter of </v>

2108
01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.730
<v Speaker 2>habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are going to like to eat it</v>

2109
01:31:07.731 --> 01:31:12.731
<v Speaker 2>more because it's just a creates a set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of flavors that we're more familiar </v>

2110
01:31:12.731 --> 01:31:12.731
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2111
01:31:12.731 --> 01:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>the exception is that are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

2112
01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:18.430
<v Speaker 2>If you talked to newfoundlanders where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Icelanders or anyway,</v>

2113
01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:23.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are grown up eating </v>

2114
01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:24.110
<v Speaker 2>seabirds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love that fishy,</v>

2115
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:27.400
<v Speaker 2>low tidy flavor thing going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

2116
01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I see her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting hairy.</v>

2117
01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Eyebrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try even though I know I'll </v>

2118
01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.751
<v Speaker 2>hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try that fermented shark that </v>

2119
01:31:37.751 --> 01:31:37.751
<v Speaker 2>they live in Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2120
01:31:37.751 --> 01:31:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had it.</v>

2121
01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what it's like.</v>

2122
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:40.770
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>

2123
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.930
<v Speaker 2>What's not toe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fermented stinky soybeans.</v>

2124
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.520
<v Speaker 2>So I've heard of that stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting.</v>

2125
01:31:52.521 --> 01:31:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly stinky blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheesy,</v>

2126
01:31:55.670 --> 01:31:58.820
<v Speaker 2>fishy ammoniated.</v>

2127
01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It attacks your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ammoniated.</v>

2128
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavily ammoniate.</v>

2129
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Now the Iceland people with a drunk when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat this.</v>

2130
01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just was there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a polar bear.</v>

2131
01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he developed a taste for a while.</v>

2132
01:32:11.591 --> 01:32:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you can't eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shark fresh what?</v>

2133
01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2134
01:32:16.770 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's another vitamin A or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2135
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:22.150
<v Speaker 1>There's some reason you can't eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a greenland shark and you can't eat</v>

2136
01:32:22.151 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>a greenland shark fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was the only way to eat.</v>

2137
01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It was too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a minute.</v>

2138
01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.310
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2139
01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:29.630
<v Speaker 1>and so they became the first guy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that one out.</v>

2140
01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2141
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's eat the rotten one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to prepare it.</v>

2142
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how to ferment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing because I have never seen or </v>

2143
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:40.000
<v Speaker 1>heard of seen videos of people trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2144
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anybody's tried it.</v>

2145
01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.110
<v Speaker 1>They enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who lives in Iceland though will</v>

2146
01:32:44.111 --> 01:32:46.360
<v Speaker 1>tell you like it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a delicacy.</v>

2147
01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:48.400
<v Speaker 1>We like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't understand.</v>

2148
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:53.401
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what our delicacy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the thing that we either in </v>

2149
01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 1>California or in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2150
01:32:54.221 --> 01:32:56.800
<v Speaker 1>really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else in the world was like,</v>

2151
01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.720
<v Speaker 1>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you eat that?</v>

2152
01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:04.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have anything like </v>

2153
01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our food is so bland.</v>

2154
01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Like an American food is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of a cheeseburger and fries or</v>

2155
01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:12.331
<v Speaker 1>steak and mashed potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think of anything that has </v>

2156
01:33:12.331 --> 01:33:13.750
<v Speaker 1>like an incredibly potent flavors to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2157
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:18.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of some regionalities like </v>

2158
01:33:18.751 --> 01:33:18.751
<v Speaker 1>scrapple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2159
01:33:18.751 --> 01:33:18.751
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not you.</v>

2160
01:33:18.751 --> 01:33:22.000
<v Speaker 1>You call scrapple regional American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not dominant American food.</v>

2161
01:33:22.001 --> 01:33:23.640
<v Speaker 1>What's scrapple again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2162
01:33:23.641 --> 01:33:28.641
<v Speaker 1>that's basically Lipson assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ground up really small and mixed with </v>

2163
01:33:28.641 --> 01:33:31.740
<v Speaker 1>either cornmeal or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes oatmeal and it still won't </v>

2164
01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:31.810
<v Speaker 1>be potent.</v>

2165
01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's baked it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

2166
01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liver Mush is even more potent.</v>

2167
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much liver mush,</v>

2168
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Mush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2169
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It's basically that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's made with liver and they're </v>

2170
01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 1>both breakfast meats and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had good scrapple.</v>

2171
01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I've not had liver much that I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed it.</v>

2172
01:33:48.871 --> 01:33:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2173
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot in south central </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania,</v>

2174
01:33:53.621 --> 01:33:55.270
<v Speaker 1>West Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee,</v>

2175
01:33:55.271 --> 01:33:57.190
<v Speaker 1>that area well lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's.</v>

2176

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you cut it like a low flow </v>
<v Speaker 1>meatloaf.</v>

2179
01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you fry it.</v>

2180
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you horrible.</v>

2181
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:09.160

<v Speaker 1>How do you get into that state?</v>

2182
01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all liquid.</v>

2183
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's all liquid liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like scrapple is the </v>

2184
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 1>scraps from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from slaughtering a pig.</v>

2185
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So is it almost like a gelatin thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a head cheese type of a scenario?</v>

2186
01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of,</v>

2187
01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say is probably a more wholesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

2188
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Head cheese is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what head Cheese Romano </v>

2189
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.330
<v Speaker 1>should do tat until probably like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2190
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.600
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching a video of someone </v>

2191
01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 1>making head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had cheese.</v>

2192
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I've never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

2193
01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it is,</v>

2194
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:51.060
<v Speaker 1>is while the German way that is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dig on the gelatin and I'm not super </v>

2195
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.360
<v Speaker 1>heavy on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gelatin comes from the collagen </v>

2196
01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 1>breaks down and the tissues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those</v>

2197
01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>take a pig's head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2198
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:04.990
<v Speaker 2>And typically you will either have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ears thrown in there or you'll have an </v>

2199
01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:08.180
<v Speaker 2>extra foot thrown in there for some more</v>
<v Speaker 2>collagen.</v>

2200
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:13.810
<v Speaker 2>You boil it slowly with a lot of spices </v>
<v Speaker 2>and herbs until practically falls apart.</v>

2201
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Then you fish everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the iron rule of,</v>

2202
01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:22.550
<v Speaker 2>of head cheese making is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it looks like meat,</v>

2203
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:26.420
<v Speaker 2>keep it fairly big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have no idea what it is,</v>

2204
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:31.950
<v Speaker 2>chop it very small and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you pack it into a loaf pan or </v>

2205
01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.900
<v Speaker 2>a sausage casing and then you boil down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cooking liquid by half and then that</v>

2206
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:43.901
<v Speaker 2>really concentrates the gelatin and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pour that hot broth over the mixture</v>

2207
01:35:44.991 --> 01:35:49.991
<v Speaker 2>that you packed into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the loaf pan or the or the sausage </v>

2208
01:35:49.991 --> 01:35:53.531
<v Speaker 2>casing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you put it in the refrigerator </v>

2209
01:35:53.531 --> 01:35:55.601
<v Speaker 2>and it sets and you eat it cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best head cheese as is where the </v>

2210
01:35:57.801 --> 01:36:02.801
<v Speaker 2>gelatin is set just enough where it kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of melts when it hits the heat of your </v>

2211
01:36:02.801 --> 01:36:07.061
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not 99 new sort of to a knox</v>

2212
01:36:07.731 --> 01:36:09.470
<v Speaker 2>gelatin and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2213
01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually very,</v>

2214
01:36:11.541 --> 01:36:12.820
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

2215
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it needs pickles and slash or mustard </v>
<v Speaker 2>pickles and slash or.</v>

2216
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's head cheese,</v>

2217
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks good.</v>

2218
01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 2>That looks better than scrapple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2219
01:36:21.231 --> 01:36:22.310
<v Speaker 2>It's much better than scrapple,</v>

2220
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:24.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2221
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's because it's not Dixon </v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>

2222
01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:30.960
<v Speaker 3>More uteruses please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2223
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:33.720
<v Speaker 3>I've always been fascinated by sharp </v>
<v Speaker 3>prudery.</v>

2224
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Just the idea that people figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago how to draw things and </v>

2225
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:39.060
<v Speaker 3>preserved thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2226
01:36:39.061 --> 01:36:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Had cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2227
01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.720
<v Speaker 2>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I make it.</v>

2228
01:36:40.721 --> 01:36:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That's called Beta tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an Italian style.</v>

2229
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you slice it very thin.</v>

2230
01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:47.080
<v Speaker 2>See that arc thing and the bottom left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand corner.</v>

2231
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:49.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a little bit slice of pig ear.</v>

2232
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2233
01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's edible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can now yet.</v>

2234
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been boiled for hours and hours.</v>

2235
01:36:56.101 --> 01:36:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Just become superintendent because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of them as things.</v>

2236
01:36:58.581 --> 01:37:03.581
<v Speaker 3>I feed my dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the pet store if they're not </v>

2237
01:37:03.581 --> 01:37:03.581
<v Speaker 3>boiled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2238
01:37:03.581 --> 01:37:03.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pigs are a weird one,</v>

2239
01:37:03.711 --> 01:37:08.711
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's such a weird thing because you </v>

2240
01:37:08.711 --> 01:37:10.541
<v Speaker 3>find out how smart they are and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial pig farming becomes very </v>

2241
01:37:10.541 --> 01:37:11.420
<v Speaker 3>disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find out how.</v>

2242
01:37:11.470 --> 01:37:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That's another reason why I got into </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting so too.</v>

2243
01:37:14.050 --> 01:37:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I have not bought meat or fish for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house since [inaudible].</v>

2244
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:19.420
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With maybe a handful of exceptions.</v>

2245
01:37:19.421 --> 01:37:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I bought a chicken a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of that is I.</v>

2246
01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I would prefer to opt out of that system</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're exactly right.</v>

2247
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did a podcast recently with my </v>

2248
01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:31.420
<v Speaker 3>friend Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ari Shaffir,</v>

2249
01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:35.771
<v Speaker 3>who's a stand up comedian and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his podcast is called the skeptic tank </v>

2250
01:37:35.771 --> 01:37:38.981
<v Speaker 3>and we went into that because he's never</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hunted and he asked me about it and </v>

2251
01:37:38.981 --> 01:37:43.391
<v Speaker 3>that is what I gave him is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>my reason for doing it in the first </v>

2252
01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:47.111
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I didn't want to be a part </v>

2253
01:37:47.111 --> 01:37:47.111
<v Speaker 3>of that system anymore and I wasn't sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to be a vegetarian.</v>

2254
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be one of these things,</v>

2255
01:37:48.771 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 3>either vegetarian or a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let me try this hunting thing.</v>

2256
01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 3>And then I got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the connection with the food.</v>

2257
01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.520
<v Speaker 3>It becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a completely different </v>

2258
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.981
<v Speaker 3>experience and it's so hard to explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>that without sounding pretentious or </v>

2259
01:38:03.981 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 3>without just repeating myself over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again,</v>

2260
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:07.230
<v Speaker 3>which I've done many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2261
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:08.880
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times on this podcast.</v>

2262
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.520
<v Speaker 3>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'll,</v>

2263
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll pull like an elk backstrap out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the freezer tonight and I'll thought out</v>

2264
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 3>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2265
01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.640
<v Speaker 3>marinade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put some kosher salt and pepper and </v>

2266
01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 3>grill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a wonderful experience.</v>

2267
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Like while I'm cooking this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all excited.</v>

2268
01:38:24.241 --> 01:38:26.280
<v Speaker 3>I remember the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

2269
01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:27.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the elk,</v>

2270
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2271
01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:30.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a totally to.</v>

2272
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:35.030
<v Speaker 3>And when you're eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just rich with vitamins and flavor </v>

2273
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.180
<v Speaker 3>and it's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2274
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2275
01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:42.380
<v Speaker 3>it has this taste to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so different than anything </v>

2276
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:42.380
<v Speaker 3>you're going to buy in a store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2277
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.960
<v Speaker 3>for me as a cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having entered this whole game as a,</v>

2278
01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>as a cook or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pursuit of hunting,</v>

2279
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really challenges me to make great </v>

2280
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.720
<v Speaker 3>food out of every bet because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2281
01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 3>you broke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bought it.</v>

2282
01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.010
<v Speaker 3>And tacos to language made from elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>tongue,</v>

2283
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.150
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2284
01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 3>head cheese made from a dose head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brace.</v>

2285
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Shanks a hell I even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I even made a venison tripe.</v>

2286
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:13.580
<v Speaker 3>One of the most delicious meals that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever cooked with wild game was on our </v>

2287
01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.870
<v Speaker 3>first hunt Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cooked a deer head in the ground.</v>

2288
01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sky,</v>

2289
01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:18.580
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2290
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.160
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he read about it in that book,</v>

2291
01:39:20.161 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Big Sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Guthrie Book.</v>

2292
01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:25.320
<v Speaker 3>And he decided that he wanted to try it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

2293
01:39:25.321 --> 01:39:26.790
<v Speaker 3>So this is like the first time you ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried it.</v>

2294
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 3>And we buried this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put hot coals,</v>

2295
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:34.500
<v Speaker 3>you wrapped it up in a cloth and a wet </v>
<v Speaker 3>cloth,</v>

2296
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.170
<v Speaker 3>put it under ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poured hot coals all over.</v>

2297
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.230
<v Speaker 3>And I do not remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was amazing.</v>

2298
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.880
<v Speaker 3>Whatever he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it right.</v>

2299
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:43.680
<v Speaker 3>And maybe he didn't solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

2300
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I love Steve will always take the hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>way out.</v>

2301
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the hardest motherfucker on earth.</v>

2302
01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Every time I out with him I feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

2303
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.840
<v Speaker 3>He just always wanted to do everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard and if he doesn't get miserable.</v>

2304
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Like I watched a show once where he saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>this giant bull elk on the first day.</v>

2305
01:39:59.101 --> 01:40:04.101
<v Speaker 3>It was hunt within the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours and he didn't shoot it because he </v>

2306
01:40:04.101 --> 01:40:07.311
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to be done hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that's why you go fishing </v>

2307
01:40:07.311 --> 01:40:07.311
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2308
01:40:07.311 --> 01:40:09.120
<v Speaker 3>you're out of your fucking time to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing.</v>

2309
01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 3>He explained it to me afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It made more sense and it was because he</v>

2310
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:18.381
<v Speaker 3>had just come from Kentucky where he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>did another show and he had shot an elk </v>

2311
01:40:18.381 --> 01:40:20.040
<v Speaker 3>and Kentucky like literally the week </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

2312
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.950
<v Speaker 3>so he felt bad about shooting one right </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2313
01:40:22.951 --> 01:40:27.951
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you're going to let it go </v>

2314
01:40:27.951 --> 01:40:27.951
<v Speaker 3>to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2315
01:40:27.951 --> 01:40:27.951
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2316
01:40:27.951 --> 01:40:31.291
<v Speaker 3>we have to make a show and I can just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot it on the first day of shoot on </v>

2317
01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:32.640
<v Speaker 3>the first day and then pretend you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for an l three days afterwards.</v>

2318
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2319
01:40:33.481 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 3>you know about editing your hot tea </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's so.</v>

2320
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.480
<v Speaker 3>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his ethics are so strong and his </v>

2321
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
<v Speaker 3>inability to be disingenuous is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful that he won't do that.</v>

2322
01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one I did with him was like,</v>

2323
01:40:48.970 --> 01:40:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2324
01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm older than he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2325
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:55.550
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to climb to the top of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain and look for things and then </v>

2326
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.550
<v Speaker 3>sit here for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until</v>

2327
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I find something and then walk to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and shoot it.</v>

2328
01:40:56.390 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's climb all over these mountains </v>

2329
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>like woo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to know as it turned out,</v>

2332
01:41:04.570 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 1>he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows what he's doing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can go if you want them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2341
01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:19.780

<v Speaker 1>They're gone.</v>

2342
01:41:20.170 --> 01:41:21.580

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2345
01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like one of those things,</v>

2346
01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:29.410
<v Speaker 1>what you friend could read the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to listen.</v>

2347
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have someone that has this deep</v>

2348
01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 1>experience in something that's very odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

2349
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:39.290
<v Speaker 1>like where the quail will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotTa,</v>

2350
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2351
01:41:40.271 --> 01:41:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that with ducks.</v>

2352
01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I can do that with ducks and geese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that your favorite bird?</v>

2353
01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2354
01:41:46.341 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't have my favorite favorite book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe grouse,</v>

2355
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 1>grouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe never had it.</v>

2356
01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it like?</v>

2357
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Imagine it's what a chicken dreams about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being when it grows up and goes wild.</v>

2358
01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little tiny wild chicken.</v>

2359
01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 1>They're not that tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a fat grouse?</v>

2360
01:42:03.610 --> 01:42:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I shot a big blue grouse in Utah that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plucked gutted and dress just it looked </v>

2361
01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Jessica chicken you buy in the store was</v>
<v Speaker 1>two pounds.</v>

2362
01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty heavy.</v>

2363
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 1>That's about as big as they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like about like that.</v>

2364
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty big animal.</v>

2365
01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.890
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Sage grouse or even bigger?</v>

2366
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:29.340
<v Speaker 1>A really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's like the biggest world record </v>

2367
01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:30.100
<v Speaker 1>grouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a five pound grouse Capercaillie in</v>

2368
01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Sweden there I think there were like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds or so.</v>

2369
01:42:33.441 --> 01:42:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking Turkey.</v>

2370
01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have turkeys there.</v>

2371
01:42:35.921 --> 01:42:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2372
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I guess the biggest gallon </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] bird would be the Turkey I </v>

2373
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:42.330
<v Speaker 1>was interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2374
01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.300
<v Speaker 1>what the difference between wild Turkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>and regular Turkey is.</v>

2375
01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's surprisingly not as big as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might think.</v>

2376
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.990
<v Speaker 1>The breast was almost identical except </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very narrow,</v>

2377
01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:58.410
<v Speaker 1>but the wings and the other brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drumsticks did have a different </v>

2378
01:42:58.410 --> 01:42:58.410
<v Speaker 1>flavor to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2379
01:42:58.410 --> 01:43:02.710
<v Speaker 1>it was more just more distinct and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked for living.</v>

2380
01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there hustling.</v>

2381
01:43:04.241 --> 01:43:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the same.</v>

2382
01:43:05.261 --> 01:43:10.261
<v Speaker 1>You could say about pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the darkness of the meat of wild </v>

2383
01:43:10.261 --> 01:43:12.790
<v Speaker 1>pig is so preferable to a domestic pigs.</v>

2384
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved shooting wild hogs.</v>

2385
01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2386
01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.720
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the animals that really,</v>

2387
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:23.830
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people that are anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and anti,</v>

2388
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:25.930
<v Speaker 1>they just want to let nature run its </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

2389
01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some animals where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally can't do that,</v>

2390
01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:31.000
<v Speaker 1>like pigs or one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially invasive pigs.</v>

2391
01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I had no so 500 pigs in California for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years and years.</v>

2392
01:43:34.031 --> 01:43:39.031
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard all these stories about </v>

2393
01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Texas and a few years ago I finally went</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to South East Texas to do.</v>

2394
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I do punting and cooking schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2395
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:47.880
<v Speaker 1>so the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working with this in Bay city and </v>

2396
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.630
<v Speaker 1>so we're down there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2397
01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:54.631
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing you have to understand is </v>

2398
01:43:54.631 --> 01:43:54.631
<v Speaker 1>that these are a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were talking about.</v>

2399
01:43:54.631 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>So we went out and there are these herds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pigs and like 90 pigs in a shot,</v>

2400
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the walk into a field to do $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage in one night and it's,</v>

2401
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it's astonishing and this is all year </v>
<v Speaker 1>round and I had no idea like,</v>

2402
01:44:08.091 --> 01:44:10.910
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you found it pigs in California,</v>

2403
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:11.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a hunt.</v>

2404
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:17.590
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like how many can you kill and you </v>

2405
01:44:17.991 --> 01:44:22.991
<v Speaker 1>still won't make a dent on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population as a story that I've told </v>

2406
01:44:22.991 --> 01:44:22.991
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell it again just for the sake</v>

2407
01:44:22.991 --> 01:44:27.611
<v Speaker 1>of this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a new highway they opened up in </v>

2408
01:44:27.611 --> 01:44:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Texas and the first night they opened up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

2409
01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:32.711
<v Speaker 1>Forty car accidents with pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lao just overrun.</v>

2410
01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.400
<v Speaker 1>They were just overrun with big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Car accidents and wild game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>population control is one of the most </v>

2412
01:44:42.351 --> 01:44:45.570
<v Speaker 1>surprising statistics when you give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell people $2,</v>

2413
01:44:45.571 --> 01:44:50.571
<v Speaker 1>million car accidents with deer every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and the one point $5 million at </v>

2414
01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:51.800
<v Speaker 1>least in the United States with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with deer.</v>

2415
01:44:51.801 --> 01:44:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And they will what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't know.</v>

2416
01:44:53.591 --> 01:44:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Go what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2417
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you're one and a half million car </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents with deer a year.</v>

2418
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Just the United States and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

2419
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Years ago I did.</v>

2420
01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I was working at the pipe press pioneer </v>
<v Speaker 1>press and St Paul and I did a data </v>

2421
01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first ones that was ever done</v>

2422
01:45:10.761 --> 01:45:14.600
<v Speaker 1>and try dear vehicle collisions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently if you're in an oca county,</v>

2423
01:45:14.690 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 1>north of the twin cities on November </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighth at dusk,</v>

2424
01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.650
<v Speaker 1>watch your ass.</v>

2425
01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the one day that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd like.</v>

2426
01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:24.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge cluster right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2427
01:45:24.141 --> 01:45:25.640
<v Speaker 1>the November is the Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2428
01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.720
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when they just get completely </v>

2429
01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:30.720
<v Speaker 1>bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're running into traffic and.</v>

2430
01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been to a singles bar at closing </v>

2431
01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:34.930
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2432
01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also been an Iowa in the Rut.</v>

2433
01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Was just there a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to Iowa Tag.</v>

2434
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a governor's tag for my buddy of </v>

2435
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:45.311
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Owns some property out there and knows </v>

2436
01:45:45.311 --> 01:45:45.311
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky.</v>

2437
01:45:45.311 --> 01:45:45.311
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very lucky.</v>

2438
01:45:45.311 --> 01:45:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get one there.</v>

2439
01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It takes a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put it in points.</v>

2440
01:45:48.051 --> 01:45:50.590
<v Speaker 1>You can get one every five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2441
01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.370
<v Speaker 1>I was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

2442
01:45:52.371 --> 01:45:57.371
<v Speaker 1>the white tail population is so strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons is they don't </v>

2443
01:45:57.371 --> 01:45:57.800
<v Speaker 1>have a rifle season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2444
01:45:57.801 --> 01:46:02.801
<v Speaker 1>It's on only shotgun and archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta work for it because if </v>

2445
01:46:02.801 --> 01:46:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to shoot some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shotgun,</v>

2446
01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you got to be pretty fucking close.</v>

2447
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather use a bow even with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2448
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:08.160
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say bit rifle,</v>

2449
01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:11.180
<v Speaker 1>barrel slug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still talking a hundred yards.</v>

2450
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Is that the most you could shoot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went out.</v>

2451
01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I've heard guys shoot farther but </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend and week out 100 yards with </v>

2452
01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 1>those rifled save at slugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would imagine there's a giant drop</v>

2453
01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.180
<v Speaker 1>to how far it falls in 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2454
01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:28.200
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like she didn't have top of the </v>

2455
01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.431
<v Speaker 1>back about a hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed it to 70 and I lose two inches </v>

2456
01:46:30.431 --> 01:46:32.600
<v Speaker 1>at 300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard this with some places,</v>

2457
01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:35.120
<v Speaker 1>some states that allow you to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>shotguns,</v>

2458
01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:37.430
<v Speaker 1>but you can't use a scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2459
01:46:37.431 --> 01:46:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2460
01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:40.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't use the scope on the shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to use the old,</v>

2461
01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:44.180
<v Speaker 1>the old timey iron sights or you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably use a peep site.</v>

2462
01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a favorite game that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy cooking?</v>

2463
01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that you like this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite</v>

2464
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.040
<v Speaker 3>game to cook in a variety of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways?</v>

2465
01:46:53.041 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Or do you just like all of them?</v>

2466
01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're talking about a </v>

2467
01:46:59.380 --> 01:46:59.380
<v Speaker 2>variety of different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ducks and venison,</v>

2468
01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:03.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're talking about favorite </v>

2469
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.430
<v Speaker 2>thing to cook it in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to grouse.</v>

2470
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:09.380
<v Speaker 2>But graphs are not as versatile but I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love the flavor of grouse,</v>

2471
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2472
01:47:09.981 --> 01:47:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole bird you're cooking.</v>

2473
01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:14.120
<v Speaker 3>And is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it because of its wild diet?</v>

2474
01:47:14.121 --> 01:47:16.260
<v Speaker 3>It just has a more complex flavor to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

2475
01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Very much so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2476
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:19.400
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that tastes like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grouse.</v>

2477
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:21.170
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like a chicken,</v>

2478
01:47:21.171 --> 01:47:23.720
<v Speaker 2>but you'll know you're eating grass now.</v>

2479
01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know this either until fairly </v>

2480
01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:29.190
<v Speaker 3>recently that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you were explaining before,</v>

2481
01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:33.121
<v Speaker 3>that there's different kinds of ducks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ducks and the seeds are </v>

2482
01:47:33.121 --> 01:47:34.360
<v Speaker 3>preferable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but diver ducks you can eat,</v>

2483
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:36.080
<v Speaker 3>but they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

2484
01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:37.190
<v Speaker 3>do you enjoy them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2485
01:47:37.610 --> 01:47:40.750
<v Speaker 3>And they have like a fishy taste or </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they primarily seafood.</v>

2486
01:47:40.810 --> 01:47:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2487
01:47:42.610 --> 01:47:45.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a great example of Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So brant,</v>

2488
01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.150
<v Speaker 2>which is like a sea goose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2489
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:52.190
<v Speaker 2>there's east coast brand and west coast </v>
<v Speaker 2>brand and the season just ended </v>

2490
01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:54.850
<v Speaker 2>yesterday I think on Brandon and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2491
01:47:55.300 --> 01:48:00.030
<v Speaker 2>and so on the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are the best eating waterfowl.</v>

2492
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:04.420
<v Speaker 2>There is period Barton because they eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>eel grass in there have a very clean,</v>

2493
01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:07.930
<v Speaker 2>almost celine flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very fishy.</v>

2494
01:48:07.931 --> 01:48:09.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not Pondi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2495
01:48:09.191 --> 01:48:11.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fantastic birds.</v>

2496
01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:14.890
<v Speaker 2>You shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brand and the east coast in the East</v>

2497
01:48:14.890 --> 01:48:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Sea lettuce a see a seaweed revolting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like barely edible.</v>

2498
01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like barely just got to chew through it.</v>

2499
01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2500
01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:25.570
<v Speaker 2>so canvas backs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there a diver?</v>

2501
01:48:25.571 --> 01:48:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Red Heads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a diver.</v>

2502
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part I'll always pluck them</v>

2503
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:32.080
<v Speaker 2>because they have a different diet and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

2504
01:48:32.230 --> 01:48:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Goldeneye as buffalo heads most blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>bills but not all ring next.</v>

2505
01:48:38.170 --> 01:48:40.330
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2506
01:48:40.331 --> 01:48:41.350
<v Speaker 2>there's still tastes good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>

2507
01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll tend to skin them.</v>

2508
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:47.790
<v Speaker 3>It is really fascinating to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>taste of when you eat an animal depends </v>

2509
01:48:47.801 --> 01:48:52.510
<v Speaker 3>so much on what the animal's diet is and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it makes me think about my own diet</v>

2510
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:55.570
<v Speaker 3>and like what is going on with the cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my own body.</v>

2511
01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.720
<v Speaker 3>And you think about people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor diets that have terrible food that </v>

2512
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.070
<v Speaker 3>they consume and they choose to drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>soda all the time and they,</v>

2513
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:06.190
<v Speaker 3>their tissue itself is affected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So drastic lung pig,</v>

2514
01:49:06.191 --> 01:49:07.260
<v Speaker 3>this one sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2515
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:11.020
<v Speaker 3>long pig animals called human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that accident was,</v>

2516
01:49:11.021 --> 01:49:15.310
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had blueberry bear?</v>

2517
01:49:15.850 --> 01:49:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had Manzanita bear.</v>

2518
01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:19.950
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Anthony,</v>

2519
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:21.730
<v Speaker 2>is it just a different bearer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

2520
01:49:21.731 --> 01:49:24.080
<v Speaker 2>just a different barrier that bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved to eat in northern California.</v>

2521
01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2522
01:49:24.911 --> 01:49:28.030
<v Speaker 3>And how was it similar to like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blueberry bear concept?</v>

2523
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't turn anything blue,</v>

2524
01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:31.500
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>

2525
01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was super sweet,</v>

2526
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:35.730
<v Speaker 2>super fatty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just very mild.</v>

2527
01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I hear that blueberry bear </v>

2528
01:49:41.170 --> 01:49:43.781
<v Speaker 3>is like the ultimate game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you get a bear in the fall </v>

2529
01:49:43.781 --> 01:49:46.880
<v Speaker 3>that's been eating blueberries and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rinella did a whole episode.</v>

2530
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It on his show where he</v>

2531
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.890
<v Speaker 1>cut one open and it had purple fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

2532
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a better one.</v>

2533
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And it lives right near you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So legend has it.</v>

2534
01:49:55.930 --> 01:50:00.930
<v Speaker 1>So I believe the state record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black bear and California as a 700 </v>

2535
01:50:00.930 --> 01:50:01.550
<v Speaker 1>pounder from the San Gabriel mountains </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ventura.</v>

2536
01:50:01.610 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2537
01:50:03.071 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Or it's been from Ventura County.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Ventura.</v>

2538
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>700 prejudice on far.</v>

2539
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So apparently these bears live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains and they come down to the </v>

2540
01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:14.110
<v Speaker 1>avocado groves and gorge themselves on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Avocados.</v>

2541
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my bucket list goals is to </v>

2542
01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:23.401
<v Speaker 1>get what they call a guacamole bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guacamole because that's supposed to </v>

2543
01:50:23.401 --> 01:50:28.261
<v Speaker 1>be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only imagine how delicious a avocado </v>

2544
01:50:28.261 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 1>eating bear would taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it would affect it that much</v>

2545
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:32.230
<v Speaker 1>because Avocados are a fairly mild </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

2546
01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but as a fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2547
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:34.570
<v Speaker 1>but when you consider all the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

2548
01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.610
<v Speaker 1>but the fact quality would be amazing.</v>

2549
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very rich and fat.</v>

2550
01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of Avocados.</v>

2551
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I would see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the blueberry bear </v>

2552
01:50:47.370 --> 01:50:50.941
<v Speaker 1>though is that it's got that engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sweetness to it that I think </v>

2553
01:50:50.941 --> 01:50:55.351
<v Speaker 1>would be really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd get that from the </v>

2554
01:50:55.351 --> 01:50:57.301
<v Speaker 1>avocado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have an urge to eat Mexican </v>

2555
01:50:57.301 --> 01:50:57.301
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2556
01:50:57.301 --> 01:50:57.301
<v Speaker 1>Is that what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

2557
01:50:57.301 --> 01:50:57.910
<v Speaker 1>the other Rinella One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2558
01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just showing how many cuts into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fat has this insane sort of Blueish</v>

2559
01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:06.480
<v Speaker 1>hint to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2560
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can see how that.</v>

2561
01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Is this when he gets himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2562
01:51:11.410 --> 01:51:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that was later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the.</v>

2563
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2564
01:51:15.571 --> 01:51:17.170
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just crazy.</v>

2565
01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:22.200
<v Speaker 1>He's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best part is that everything is </v>

2566
01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:22.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said trick gnosis.</v>

2567
01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:22.850
<v Speaker 1>He's had lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get charged for the ups.</v>

2568
01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2569
01:51:23.621 --> 01:51:25.090
<v Speaker 1>he got Giardia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giardia.</v>

2570
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

2571
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other cool thing is that if you were</v>

2572
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 1>to get one of these guacamole bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can freeze it and be free of chicken</v>

2573
01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:37.441
<v Speaker 1>houses because south of about Oregon </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw a line all the way across the </v>

2574
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bears there,</v>

2575
01:51:40.871 --> 01:51:43.050
<v Speaker 1>if they have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will tend to have a,</v>

2576
01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:46.100
<v Speaker 1>a variety called trick and trick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellis by Rallis,</v>

2577
01:51:46.630 --> 01:51:49.240
<v Speaker 1>which you can kill by freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2578
01:51:49.241 --> 01:51:54.241
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but north of there from the northern </v>

2579
01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:54.241
<v Speaker 1>tier of this country and all Canada and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>

2580
01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:58.140
<v Speaker 1>it's called trick and I nativa and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one is resistant to freezing so it stays</v>

2581
01:51:58.271 --> 01:52:00.910
<v Speaker 1>alive even if you have it in the freezer</v>
<v Speaker 1>for months.</v>

2582
01:52:00.930 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sick.</v>

2583
01:52:02.970 --> 01:52:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Creepy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2584
01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's from up there.</v>

2585
01:52:05.171 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So it must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2586
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:07.690
<v Speaker 1>frost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frost resistant.</v>

2587
01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised how good beer taste I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was too.</v>

2588
01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those ones where you go,</v>

2589
01:52:12.491 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to eat this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a teddy bear.</v>

2590
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:20.460
<v Speaker 1>St Says Yogi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all the amp for more physicians </v>

2591
01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:20.980
<v Speaker 1>of ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madec megafauna.</v>

2592
01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:24.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had people more mad at me for</v>

2593
01:52:24.431 --> 01:52:26.070
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever shot than bear,</v>

2594
01:52:26.490 --> 01:52:29.770
<v Speaker 1>like they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't seem to be that mad about a</v>

2595
01:52:29.771 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are,</v>

2596
01:52:31.031 --> 01:52:33.790
<v Speaker 1>but most people understand it like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ate that you're going to eat it.</v>

2597
01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:38.791
<v Speaker 1>That's the way shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we are who we are because we hunt </v>

2598
01:52:38.791 --> 01:52:38.791
<v Speaker 1>deer know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologically speaking.</v>

2599
01:52:38.791 --> 01:52:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's all kinds of evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that the reason why we can run,</v>

2600
01:52:43.001 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>we were the only primate with an arch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason</v>

2601
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:51.010
<v Speaker 2>that we can actually throw properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why that we can communicate </v>

2602
01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:52.910
<v Speaker 2>so complicated in so many complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

2603
01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:56.120
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of reasons that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of our shoulders,</v>

2604
01:52:56.121 --> 01:53:01.121
<v Speaker 2>the structure of our hips that are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great amount of the way we're built in </v>

2605
01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:06.191
<v Speaker 2>the way we think and the way we act has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with us teaming up to hunt large </v>

2606
01:53:06.631 --> 01:53:08.590
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like things real [inaudible].</v>

2607
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you get this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All over the,</v>

2608
01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anthropological literature.</v>

2609
01:53:12.801 --> 01:53:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could cite you a bunch of books,</v>

2610
01:53:14.241 --> 01:53:15.980
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

2611
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's debatable,</v>

2612
01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:21.680
<v Speaker 2>but the consensus is that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of,</v>

2613
01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:27.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of developments that stemmed out of </v>

2614
01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:32.110
<v Speaker 2>pursuit hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ganging up on things like mammoths </v>

2615
01:53:32.110 --> 01:53:34.460
<v Speaker 2>and rhinos and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically large,</v>

2616
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:37.010
<v Speaker 2>large herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2617
01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we were hardwired hunt deer.</v>

2618
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I said that I was</v>

2619
01:53:43.321 --> 01:53:47.310
<v Speaker 3>describing to my friend Ari about it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this strange familiarity.</v>

2620
01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2621
01:53:48.330 --> 01:53:53.330
<v Speaker 3>and almost like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deep reward system that gets plugged </v>

2622
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:57.501
<v Speaker 3>into that you weren't even aware that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had when the deer's down and you </v>

2623
01:53:57.501 --> 01:53:59.100
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're quartering it and cutting it</v>

2624
01:53:59.101 --> 01:53:59.580
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2625
01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of know how to do this,</v>

2626
01:54:01.141 --> 01:54:04.200
<v Speaker 3>or at least I don't know how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this seems normal to me.</v>

2627
01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.310
<v Speaker 3>It seems familiar.</v>

2628
01:54:05.650 --> 01:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been in.</v>

2629
01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.900
<v Speaker 2>This is the other thing about some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the research I've been doing lately is </v>

2630
01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:12.910
<v Speaker 2>that everybody hunts deer or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a deer.</v>

2631
01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:17.730
<v Speaker 2>So all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my banker guy named Omar,</v>

2632
01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:20.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing some banking stuff and I was</v>

2633
01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.780
<v Speaker 2>talking to him about the book I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote.</v>

2634
01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:25.240
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2635
01:54:25.241 --> 01:54:30.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really miss hunting gazelles and the </v>

2636
01:54:30.241 --> 01:54:31.070
<v Speaker 2>eastern deserts of Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2637
01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:31.830
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2638
01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:37.110
<v Speaker 2>it's the same reaction as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend from the Yucatan who </v>

2639
01:54:37.110 --> 01:54:37.960
<v Speaker 2>hunts deer in the Yucatan and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've uh,</v>

2640
01:54:37.961 --> 01:54:42.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another friend from Hokkaido in the </v>

2641
01:54:42.961 --> 01:54:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Northern Ireland in Japan who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who hunts the same sick of blacktail in </v>

2642
01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Alaska now that he used to hunt in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hokkaido as a kid and you know,</v>

2643
01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 2>South Africans and New Zealanders and </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

2644
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:53.320
<v Speaker 2>even if you can be for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're smart and thinking out there,</v>

2645
01:54:53.321 --> 01:54:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2646
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:56.350
<v Speaker 2>what about Australia and Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2647
01:54:56.351 --> 01:55:01.351
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever eaten </v>

2648
01:55:01.351 --> 01:55:01.351
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kangaroo looks exactly like medicine</v>

2649
01:55:01.351 --> 01:55:01.351
<v Speaker 2>and pretty much tastes like medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2650
01:55:01.351 --> 01:55:02.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2651
01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of a weird hopping deer with a tail</v>

2652
01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:06.880
<v Speaker 2>ish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me,</v>

2654
01:55:08.231 --> 01:55:09.290
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2655
01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:13.940
<v Speaker 2>the human connection with hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating something like a deer is very,</v>

2656
01:55:13.941 --> 01:55:15.550
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is worldwide and in very,</v>

2657
01:55:15.551 --> 01:55:16.630
<v Speaker 2>very deep.</v>

2658
01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Now this new book that you have here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been reading it,</v>

2659
01:55:19.371 --> 01:55:21.260
<v Speaker 3>I was reading it today actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buck,</v>

2660
01:55:21.261 --> 01:55:26.261
<v Speaker 3>Buck Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of really interesting </v>

2661
01:55:26.261 --> 01:55:29.270
<v Speaker 3>information about animals and about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to prepare them.</v>

2662
01:55:29.271 --> 01:55:34.271
<v Speaker 3>The difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I thought it was </v>

2663
01:55:34.271 --> 01:55:35.921
<v Speaker 3>really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the whole point about </v>

2664
01:55:35.921 --> 01:55:35.921
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Testosterone stinks.</v>

2665
01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:40.070
<v Speaker 3>And like the animals that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants the big bucks with the big racks,</v>

2666
01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:45.071
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be smelly animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be tougher if you get </v>

2667
01:55:45.071 --> 01:55:45.071
<v Speaker 3>them before the Rut,</v>

2668
01:55:45.071 --> 01:55:46.470
<v Speaker 1>which is not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get them before the route,</v>

2669
01:55:46.471 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the rub is that,</v>

2670
01:55:49.861 --> 01:55:52.800
<v Speaker 1>that's when they're easiest to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're all horny and confused.</v>

2671
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2672
01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 1>but you've got some great fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipes and ideas in here,</v>

2673
01:55:57.781 --> 01:55:58.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

2674
01:55:58.350 --> 01:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take you to put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>together over?</v>

2675
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I've started a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2676
01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:05.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of it 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2677
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:07.590
<v Speaker 1>but actually sitting there writing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

2678
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2679
01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:14.870
<v Speaker 1>because all the recipes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a test and I had to send the </v>

2680
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.870
<v Speaker 1>recipes out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2681
01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of readers because one of the </v>

2682
01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.420
<v Speaker 1>things is important for me is that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipes are as water tight as possible.</v>

2683
01:56:21.421 --> 01:56:26.421
<v Speaker 1>So I send them out to civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't let other chefs test my recipes </v>

2684
01:56:26.421 --> 01:56:27.030
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2685
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna follow the recipe.</v>

2686
01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't.</v>

2687
01:56:29.971 --> 01:56:31.510
<v Speaker 1>They would have their own bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2688
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't help themselves.</v>

2689
01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 1>So no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>

2690
01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy I'm at peace with it.</v>

2691
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:39.090
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

2692
01:56:39.091 --> 01:56:44.091
<v Speaker 1>What I want is for somebody who reads </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I write to be able to make what I </v>

2693
01:56:44.091 --> 01:56:48.891
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who's ever sent a text </v>

2694
01:56:48.891 --> 01:56:50.280
<v Speaker 1>message knows that if you ever send a </v>
<v Speaker 1>text message,</v>

2695
01:56:50.281 --> 01:56:53.040
<v Speaker 1>what you write is not necessarily what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person hears in their head.</v>

2696
01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at that can't,</v>

2697
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.380
<v Speaker 1>that can't go if I'm writing a recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because especially because,</v>

2698
01:56:58.381 --> 01:56:59.070
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2699
01:56:59.370 --> 01:57:00.660
<v Speaker 1>If I'm going to tell you to do x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>

2700
01:57:00.661 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 1>or z with the tenderloin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one.</v>

2701
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:09.620
<v Speaker 1>You only get one shot at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one set of tenderloins on </v>

2702
01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:13.011
<v Speaker 1>any animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm going to tell you to do </v>

2703
01:57:13.011 --> 01:57:14.961
<v Speaker 1>something with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beyond whatever it is that you </v>

2704
01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:14.961
<v Speaker 1>normally do.</v>

2705
01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:14.961
<v Speaker 1>If better damn work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't,</v>

2706
01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:19.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go to the store to get another 10 </v>

2707
01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:19.460
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2708
01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get another chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get another,</v>

2709
01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:23.771
<v Speaker 1>the tenderloin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you may tenderloin from a moose or </v>

2710
01:57:23.771 --> 01:57:26.810
<v Speaker 1>from a prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everything has to be airtight and</v>

2711
01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:31.820
<v Speaker 1>in and tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will any of these recipes work with </v>

2712
01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:32.520
<v Speaker 1>domestic animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if somebody is really curious about</v>

2713
01:57:32.521 --> 01:57:33.210
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2714
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you know how to substitute?</v>

2715
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I would say a bison or grassfed beef </v>
<v Speaker 1>will get you pretty close and flavor and</v>

2716
01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:43.050
<v Speaker 1>a lamb or goat will get you pretty close</v>
<v Speaker 1>in size.</v>

2717
01:57:43.730 --> 01:57:46.620
<v Speaker 1>No lamb doesn't taste like medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of size,</v>

2718
01:57:46.621 --> 01:57:50.880
<v Speaker 1>like a shank recipe for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a shoulder recipe or a neck recipe.</v>

2719
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Land would be a perfect substitute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to get close to what a </v>

2720
01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:58.020
<v Speaker 1>good deer or an elk tastes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass fed beef or bison.</v>

2721
01:57:58.350 --> 01:58:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And when people do buy commercially </v>
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>

2722
01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:03.990
<v Speaker 1>venison and elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it all come from other countries</v>

2723
01:58:03.991 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 1>as a come from New Zealand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it,</v>

2724
01:58:05.521 --> 01:58:08.340
<v Speaker 1>at least most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of whatever it is that you will see</v>

2725
01:58:08.341 --> 01:58:10.920
<v Speaker 1>that called Venison will be red stag </v>
<v Speaker 1>from New Zealand,</v>

2726
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000
<v Speaker 1>but there are elk farms in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States that I've seen how commercially </v>

2727
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.601
<v Speaker 1>for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really Marshall Elk growing in the </v>

2728
01:58:20.601 --> 01:58:20.601
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems wrong.</v>

2729
01:58:20.601 --> 01:58:22.440
<v Speaker 1>You might say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't possibly comment.</v>

2730
01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Does that seem a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the weird things about</v>

2731
01:58:27.511 --> 01:58:29.670
<v Speaker 1>wild game is that you can't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2732
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the really </v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing things about because they </v>

2733
01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:35.120
<v Speaker 1>belonged to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>

2735
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the market hunting is what </v>

2736
01:58:40.190 --> 01:58:40.570
<v Speaker 1>wiped them out at the turn of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>century and the,</v>

2737
01:58:40.710 --> 01:58:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as late as the 19 fifties,</v>

2738
01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:47.040
<v Speaker 1>it was a news item for somebody to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eight point.</v>

2739
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know guys who an eight point buck what</v>

2740
01:58:51.191 --> 01:58:53.830
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about the yellers because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there there were almost wiped out.</v>

2741
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a news event even in the </v>

2742
01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:58.980
<v Speaker 1>sixties in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like these are the good old days</v>

2743
01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:00.000
<v Speaker 1>of deer hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2745
01:59:01.361 --> 01:59:02.770
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw a lot of,</v>

2746
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>we didn't see any big deer that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>

2747
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:05.710
<v Speaker 1>but we saw like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2748
01:59:05.711 --> 01:59:06.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

2749
01:59:06.641 --> 01:59:07.450
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're here.</v>

2750
01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 1>The biggest white tell ever saw was this</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant in western Kansas when I was quail</v>

2751
01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:14.050
<v Speaker 1>hunting as this is supposed to be Mecca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2752
01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a mecca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2753
01:59:15.311 --> 01:59:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowa,</v>

2754
01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Kansas for big,</v>

2755
01:59:18.821 --> 01:59:20.470
<v Speaker 1>giant white tails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2756
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:25.471
<v Speaker 1>I know people that moved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend John Dudley moved there just </v>

2757
01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:25.471
<v Speaker 1>because just because of the deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

2758
01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:27.490
<v Speaker 1>he's an archer and there's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive,</v>

2759
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:29.560
<v Speaker 1>little crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little crazy.</v>

2760
01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a,</v>

2761
01:59:31.221 --> 01:59:32.280
<v Speaker 1>a favorite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

2762
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mammal that you like to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eno.</v>

2763
01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first thing that popped in my </v>

2764
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:44.431
<v Speaker 1>head and was heavily ina have Alina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's because I'm a fan of </v>

2765
01:59:44.431 --> 01:59:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the underdog a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I shot a couple of skunk pigs.</v>

2766
01:59:49.110 --> 01:59:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm so heavily in columns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gunk,</v>

2767
01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:52.780
<v Speaker 1>pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a pig,</v>

2768
01:59:52.781 --> 01:59:53.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2769
01:59:53.311 --> 01:59:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't,</v>

2770
01:59:53.951 --> 01:59:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a peccary.</v>

2771
01:59:55.170 --> 02:00:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's native to the United States </v>

2772
02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:00.170
<v Speaker 1>where pigs are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they look like pigs,</v>

2773
02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:04.891
<v Speaker 1>they act like pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are related to pigs on the family </v>

2774
02:00:04.891 --> 02:00:04.891
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>

2775
02:00:04.891 --> 02:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>they're not that close and there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why people should hate heavily </v>

2776
02:00:08.741 --> 02:00:13.741
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you go to Arizona or New </v>

2777
02:00:13.741 --> 02:00:13.741
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves how heavily,</v>

2778
02:00:13.741 --> 02:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>like he was to eat and he'd go only to </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Texas.</v>

2779
02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>There you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy fucker.</v>

2780
02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>If you go to south Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2781
02:00:19.690 --> 02:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're disgusting over the rats or </v>

2782
02:00:24.690 --> 02:00:26.521
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was in south Texas and I said </v>

2783
02:00:26.521 --> 02:00:26.521
<v Speaker 1>to the landowner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was weighing like,</v>

2784
02:00:26.521 --> 02:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you a couple of like a.</v>

2785
02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So I cleaned up because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering about this mysterious </v>

2786
02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clan that you're not supposed to break </v>

2787
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the smaller back.</v>

2788
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2789
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a heavily in a tramp </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamp.</v>

2790
02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you,</v>

2791
02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>if you skin the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would scan a pig,</v>

2792
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you never see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the skin.</v>

2793
02:00:45.250 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>So if you come underneath the skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never nick it,</v>

2794
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>you'll have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like a little teeny pig.</v>

2795
02:00:50.650 --> 02:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And they taste fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really.</v>

2796
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>There is no off taste to them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Describe it.</v>

2797
02:00:56.011 --> 02:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Was it pork pig like big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2798
02:00:58.780 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2799
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>More like pork pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then wild boar is really.</v>

2800
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there because they're almost,</v>

2801
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're obligate </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians,</v>

2802
02:01:07.601 --> 02:01:12.601
<v Speaker 1>but they're primarily vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my friend Doug Stan Hope told me </v>

2803
02:01:12.601 --> 02:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>that one killed his neighbor's dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking they surrounded the dog and mold</v>

2804
02:01:16.431 --> 02:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good.</v>

2805
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen heavily to teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2806
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the big ass crazy spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually like spikes were,</v>

2807
02:01:22.481 --> 02:01:27.481
<v Speaker 1>were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were wild boars have like a arcs like </v>

2808
02:01:27.481 --> 02:01:27.481
<v Speaker 1>comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>

2809
02:01:27.481 --> 02:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>They hunted this thing like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed it on purpose.</v>

2810
02:01:28.761 --> 02:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're that fucking creepy bastard.</v>

2811
02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roar.</v>

2812
02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Ferocious looking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbit,</v>

2813
02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>animal hobbit tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't want a real animal.</v>

2814
02:01:38.111 --> 02:01:43.111
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like something from a movie </v>

2815
02:01:43.111 --> 02:01:43.111
<v Speaker 1>like Lord</v>

2816
02:01:43.111 --> 02:01:43.111
<v Speaker 3>of the rings movie.</v>

2817
02:01:43.111 --> 02:01:43.111
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>

2818
02:01:43.111 --> 02:01:43.111
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2819
02:01:43.111 --> 02:01:44.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

2820
02:01:44.341 --> 02:01:49.341
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love cooking them because they're fun </v>

2821
02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:51.051
<v Speaker 2>and I like pork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you prepare it the same way you </v>

2822
02:01:51.051 --> 02:01:53.481
<v Speaker 2>would cook or the pork loin or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to go a lot of Mexican Central </v>

2823
02:01:53.481 --> 02:01:56.811
<v Speaker 2>American recipes because that's where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they live and in desert southwest kind </v>

2824
02:01:57.271 --> 02:01:58.080
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2825
02:01:58.270 --> 02:01:58.860
<v Speaker 2>took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get me wrong.</v>

2826
02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I love Angela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably pronghorn antelope wouldn't be </v>

2827
02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:04.100
<v Speaker 2>my second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this delicious save.</v>

2828
02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:05.640
<v Speaker 2>You'll hear it's delicious in your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting.</v>

2829
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.490
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because pronghorns are,</v>

2830
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:11.880
<v Speaker 2>they're super nervous animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like high strong,</v>

2831
02:02:11.881 --> 02:02:13.500
<v Speaker 2>dear basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they're out of here,</v>

2832
02:02:13.730 --> 02:02:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm pseudo capra something or other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their,</v>

2833
02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>that's their genus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're their own thing.</v>

2834
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Weird side note there so fast because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were evolved to run away from the </v>

2835
02:02:24.781 --> 02:02:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Cheetah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this blue mind.</v>

2836
02:02:27.810 --> 02:02:32.810
<v Speaker 2>So the Cheetah in Africa was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheetah and the American Great Plains </v>

2837
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:35.970
<v Speaker 2>before the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it migrated back over the land bridge.</v>

2838
02:02:36.690 --> 02:02:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It got itself into Asia and Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Cheetah that exists now is our </v>

2839
02:02:41.690 --> 02:02:45.651
<v Speaker 2>Cheetah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said our cheetah died out in the ice </v>

2840
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:45.651
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>

2841
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:49.371
<v Speaker 2>the pronghorn antelope did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the antelope is essentially waiting </v>

2842
02:02:49.371 --> 02:02:50.070
<v Speaker 2>for the Cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing can catch it.</v>

2843
02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:52.110
<v Speaker 2>The other so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing can catch it.</v>

2844
02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>People call them speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goats,</v>

2845
02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.310
<v Speaker 2>goats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2846
02:02:54.590 --> 02:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>And so they're super nervous and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>die really easy.</v>

2847
02:02:56.611 --> 02:02:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2848
02:02:57.351 --> 02:02:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they fall over.</v>

2849
02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:03.680
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you go with what you do is you go</v>

2850
02:03:03.781 --> 02:03:04.680
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take your little shot,</v>

2851
02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then got him right there,</v>

2852
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:12.120
<v Speaker 2>throw the wobbly bits in a bag and throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>it a cooler and get them out of the skin</v>

2853
02:03:12.121 --> 02:03:14.520
<v Speaker 2>as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do those two things,</v>

2854
02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:17.820
<v Speaker 2>it's some of the best events and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>see why do you have to get it out of the</v>

2855
02:03:17.821 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>skin as fast ball?</v>

2856
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Because they burn hot body temperature </v>
<v Speaker 2>is hotter than a deer in there.</v>

2857
02:03:22.321 --> 02:03:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Hide holds heat better than a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those two things,</v>

2858
02:03:26.131 --> 02:03:27.840
<v Speaker 2>plus the fact that they're super nervous</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

2859
02:03:28.290 --> 02:03:33.290
<v Speaker 2>they can go off in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you see a lot of guys do is </v>

2860
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:36.720
<v Speaker 2>let's say you and me and steve were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting antelope and you know,</v>

2861
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:40.210
<v Speaker 2>I shot mine first thing in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you shot yours,</v>

2862
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:42.570
<v Speaker 2>meaning an hour or two later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Steve can't buy a shot,</v>

2863
02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:45.810
<v Speaker 2>which is probably not how it would work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the sake of the story,</v>

2864
02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>so let's say steve finally gets one at </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 3:00</v>

2865
02:03:49.081 --> 02:03:50.220
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You often hunt antelope and warm weather</v>

2872

<v Speaker 3>about gaming ness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a preparation and an </v>

2876
02:04:16.761 --> 02:04:18.921
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you are required to do in order to </v>

2882
02:04:28.050 --> 02:04:31.350
<v Speaker 3>We can wrap this up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of animals that,</v>

2883
02:04:31.351 --> 02:04:32.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2884
02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no equivalent in domestic food,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like what would you say if you've </v>

2886
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:44.850
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were trying to coach someone into</v>

2887
02:04:44.890 --> 02:04:47.700
<v Speaker 2>a trying wild game or being interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in wild game,</v>

2888
02:04:47.701 --> 02:04:50.430
<v Speaker 2>what do you think would be one that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would start them off with?</v>

2889
02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Something that's familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So duck.</v>

2890
02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm venison backstrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything with wild boar because it's </v>

2891
02:04:58.550 --> 02:05:00.390
<v Speaker 2>basically if you had to pick a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an a recipe out of this.</v>

2892
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one I would do just a simple seared</v>

2893
02:05:04.021 --> 02:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>backstrap with like a cumberland sauce </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a or steak.</v>

2894
02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Diane steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diane.</v>

2895
02:05:09.210 --> 02:05:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Diane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diane is a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's a classic for a reason.</v>

2897
02:05:15.961 --> 02:05:17.680
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's back.</v>

2898
02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:20.430
<v Speaker 2>It's Diane is for Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goddess of the hunt.</v>

2899
02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:25.610
<v Speaker 2>So originally in France it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was venison for recipe and it became </v>

2900
02:05:25.610 --> 02:05:29.241
<v Speaker 2>a beef recipe later and it is a recipe </v>
<v Speaker 2>with cognac or brandy,</v>

2901
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:31.290
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of mustard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of cream.</v>

2909
02:05:53.751 --> 02:05:53.970
<v Speaker 2>anybody who has made my recipe for it </v>
