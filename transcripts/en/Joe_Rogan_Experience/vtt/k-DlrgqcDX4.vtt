39
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>That's just one more dumb thing in the Bible.</v>

49
00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 2>And I looked and behold,</v>

50
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>a whirlwind came out of the north,</v>

51
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 2>a great cloud and a fire enfolding itself in brightness was about it and out of</v>

52
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:48.091
<v Speaker 2>the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire.</v>

53
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

54
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.623

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.113
<v Speaker 2>Hmm?</v>

56
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Somebody putting two points together that don't go together</v>

57
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

58
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

60
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.</v>

61
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.081
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

62
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was</v>

63
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:05.414
<v Speaker 2>their appearance.</v>

64
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 2>They had the likeness of a man woe.</v>

65
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.651
<v Speaker 2>After in,</v>

66
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>everyone had four faces in.</v>

67
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Every one had four wings and their feet were straight and the sole of their feet</v>

68
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 2>was like the soul of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished</v>

69
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:22.964
<v Speaker 2>brass.</v>

70
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 2>What a trippy book.</v>

71
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>

72
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.791
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

73
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:26.624
<v Speaker 2>it's so real.</v>

74
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I hear God's words when you're saying each things God's speaking to me through</v>

75
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:31.131
<v Speaker 2>your words,</v>

<v Speaker 2>please read on.</v>

77
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And they had the hands of man under their wings on their four sides and they</v>

78
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

79
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.470
<v Speaker 2>and they four had their faces and their ways.</v>

80
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Somebody might have just made all this up and me like an asshole as reading</v>

81
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 2>these fake Bible quotes shitting all over the Bible and the aliens.</v>

82
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>

83
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

84
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

85
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not reading any further.</v>

86
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

87
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 2>it seems like if this is,</v>

88
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 2>if this really is the gills,</v>

89
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.750
<v Speaker 2>it says it is.</v>

90
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.650
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

91
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 2>They could saw nuttiness.</v>

92
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 2>They walked up with their four faces and they said,</v>

93
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 2>why are you guys cooking things in Shit?</v>

94
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And the living creatures ran in,</v>

95
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 2>returned as the appearance of a flash of lightening.</v>

96
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Now as I behold the living creatures,</v>

97
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces.</v>

98
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>These guys were tripping hard eating shit cake.</v>

99
00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

100
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>losing their mind.</v>

101
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 2>But you are afraid of aliens though,</v>

102
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

103
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.801

110
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.663
