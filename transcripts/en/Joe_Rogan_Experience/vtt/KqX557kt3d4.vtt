00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't they making James Bond a woman?</v>

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I think they are magazines by a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's a black woman who's queer.</v>

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>The only way for justice to be served </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nonbinary.</v>

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does that mean?</v>

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.763
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her gender can switch throughout the </v>

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>film depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Binary gender flux.</v>

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Gender fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was gender fluid.</v>

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your Pronoun Today?</v>

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Caesar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your highness.</v>

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

14
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Highness can be a guy or a girl.</v>

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

16
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It's gender neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Highness.</v>

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Now if you said I'm a princess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go,</v>

18
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're gendering yourself.</v>

19
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

20
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>And I refused to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two little boys and you know,</v>

21
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>we forced them to be gender neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't always watch a show on that.</v>

22
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>A legit show on that from Cambridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This couple was raising their kid gender</v>

23
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have two kids and they're both like</v>

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>wearing like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wearing weird clothes.</v>

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Like it didn't necessarily agree they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing boys clothes or girls' clothes.</v>

26
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>When they didn't call them girls or </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>

27
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>they let them play with anything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted and they didn't call them boys.</v>

28
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>What would they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking weird.</v>

29
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:34.761
<v Speaker 1>It was just some poor guy who stuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy bitch and she's,</v>

30
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was probably trying really hard </v>

31
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>to be like progressive and like figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

32
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

33
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we not gender our children and.</v>

34
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting you do that voice </v>

35
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.464
<v Speaker 1>because they all do up speak at do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way to show your progressive </v>

36
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>because if you didn't know it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>

37
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>people just don't talk like that.</v>

38
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>No need to stop the caravan before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to the wall.</v>

39
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Donald trumps our savior because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one who really appreciates like</v>

40
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>American values and never hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only,</v>

41
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a super liberal calling.</v>

42
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

43
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Back to this non binary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

44
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.903
<v Speaker 1>we did a clip on your mom's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple somewhere in the </v>

45
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:23.334
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands and they had a three year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old zamzar child and another and every </v>

46
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 1>day they would ask the three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gender do you feel like today?</v>

47
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>And I'm talking about the pressure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

48
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I have a almost three year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he doesn't know.</v>

49
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't think in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

51
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to put the pressure like,</v>

52
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>what are you today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you feeling?</v>

53
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.503
<v Speaker 1>My eight year old loves to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like race cars and she used to </v>

54
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>love to play with trucks and she still </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves it.</v>

55
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.273
<v Speaker 1>She's a</v>

56
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

57
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.113
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she loves to play with superheroes and </v>

58
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some of them are like very.</v>

59
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.953
<v Speaker 2>But then again she loves pink and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes getting her nails done and she </v>

60
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.274
<v Speaker 2>likes looking pretty and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some cool shit that boys like </v>

<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

62
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>which takes MMA classes and she throws </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys around.</v>

63
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>She gets like super hyped up when she </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to wrestle with boys.</v>

64
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.053
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

65
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.933
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little psycho aggressive eight </v>

66
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's also like really sweet,</v>

67
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.963
<v Speaker 2>like the sweetest kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just gets like real </v>

68
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>competitive with that kind of stuff.</v>

69
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that that's the magic age </v>

70
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.063
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine and girls and then a where they're </v>

71
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:48.904
<v Speaker 3>very confident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the end of the confidence era </v>

72
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.560
<v Speaker 3>and then puberty strikes and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones takeover and the pressure.</v>

73
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be sexy.</v>

74
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.430

<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Remember Pippi longstocking beating up </v>

<v Speaker 3>Shannon.</v>

77
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.960
<v Speaker 3>She had like a treasure trove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she was like,</v>

78
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 3>she was a millionaire on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her Dad was a pirate.</v>

79
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And remember the name.</v>

82
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the narrative.</v>

83
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>A Sweden,</v>

89
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:29.524
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Astrid Lindgren wrote these books about </v>

90
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.940
<v Speaker 3>her daughter who was that age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

91
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 3>eight years old as a magic age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There she is,</v>

92
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 3>the original one who'd be long stockings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she said,</v>

93
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 3>girls are kind of smelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of awkward,</v>

94
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 3>and that's before puberty robs you of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

282

<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

283
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.400
<v Speaker 1>So one day Dr Chris Ryan from a sex at </v>
<v Speaker 1>dawn,</v>

284
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.323
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying that there's an </v>

285
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:57.874
<v Speaker 1>imprinting stage in young men's lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like the a young man that's not </v>

286
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:04.504
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say during this imprinting stage </v>

287
00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:06.754
<v Speaker 1>when they're very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they get their dick sucked by a guy </v>

288
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they orgasm,</v>

289
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.283
<v Speaker 1>they could potentially get turned on by </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy sucking their dick even if they're </v>

290
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:20.290
<v Speaker 1>not gay because it's imprinted on them </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a very early age.</v>

291
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Like by them getting molested at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>early age.</v>

295
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:39.631

344
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're protected because people believe</v>

<v Speaker 1>in Christianity.</v>

347
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.123
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to attack priests </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they feel like that's an attack </v>

348
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:10.034
<v Speaker 1>on the church and they feel like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be blow back politically and </v>

349

00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:19.964
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do like as the </v>

353
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:21.914
<v Speaker 1>international is going to do a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale investigation into the Catholic </v>

354
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Church and we're going to lock people </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

355
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why the Vatican has </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own country.</v>

356
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>You know the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a fucking passport.</v>

357
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an actual country separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

358
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 1>little tiny ass place filled with kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckers.</v>

359
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if you looked at the per capita kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckers of people in the Vatican,</v>

360
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:44.451
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

361
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:49.451
<v Speaker 1>it's a nation of kid fuckers so fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and they're in untouchable.</v>

362
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Well for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually people are gonna.</v>

363
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Realize how irrelevant a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient fucking cults actually are.</v>

364
00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Whether you believe in whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God or not.</v>

365
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.373
<v Speaker 1>Those are cults are ancient cults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you believe in the scripture or </v>

366
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic church is clearly a cult.</v>

367
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a cult that I was a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

368
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I went to Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

369
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 1>my family was Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been around it my whole life.</v>

370
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever molested me and the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got lucky.</v>

371
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I know I got lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people that got molested.</v>

372
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:20.424
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that told me stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being chased by priests and I have </v>

373
00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 1>friends that told me stories about a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they knew that got molested,</v>

374
00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 1>like damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got them.</v>

375
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:29.574
<v Speaker 1>He got them like they knew about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>priest and he got one of their friends </v>

376
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and this is just all across the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

377
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 1>the numbers that went to justice so </v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

378
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.600
<v Speaker 1>so small in comparison to the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>acts.</v>

379
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.163
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy that people would get </v>

380
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 1>upset at you saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

381
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

382
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me defend my pedophile priests.</v>

383
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I love this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

384
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we still invested in this?</v>

385
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been ever since I had kids too,</v>

386
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:57.294
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of see the world a lot </v>

387
00:18:58.651 --> 00:18:59.650
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

388
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I had children I was like,</v>

389
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:02.101
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 1>God could exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm spiritual and now I'm like,</v>

391
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:05.724
<v Speaker 1>I just got to defend my children from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking evil and insanity of this </v>

392
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's jungle law.</v>

393
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

394
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not spiritual really.</v>

395
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 1>People can go bad for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

396
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 1>there's something about people that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes wrong,</v>

397
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

398
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can go back,</v>

399
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.950
<v Speaker 1>they can go bad serial killer style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can go bad rapist style.</v>

400
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.933
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many guys are out there dropping </v>

401
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>pills into girls drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still still,</v>

402
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 1>still hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

403
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:38.220
<v Speaker 1>It's happening all across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all across the world.</v>

404
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.383
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just fucking disgusting human </v>

405
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bad people out there and there's</v>

406
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 1>people that got fucked over and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to pay people back.</v>

407
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're upset,</v>

408
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>they're upset that they got a shit deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want,</v>

409
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:54.030
<v Speaker 1>they want other people to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

410
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it's traumatized people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

411
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Doing all this shit traumatize people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely some of that.</v>

412
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.890
<v Speaker 1>But that makes me also too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I always laugh at the,</v>

413
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:07.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti bullying stuff.</v>

414
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not pro bullying clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a misguided effort to try </v>

415
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 1>to completely eradicate the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet.</v>

416
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 1>We're going to stop like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

417
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:16.764
<v Speaker 1>you're not dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to stop stupid if </v>

418
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:21.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to stop the bullying </v>
<v Speaker 1>because stupid people have kids.</v>

419
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>They don't raise the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

420
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:23.754
<v Speaker 1>those kids are angry because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid parents and they're being abused </v>

421
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:26.484
<v Speaker 1>at home and then they hit your kid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so what'd you can do is teach your kid </v>

422
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 1>to not be a victim and to fucking kick a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy in the nuts,</v>

423
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.553
<v Speaker 1>but now we don't teach that to children </v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend yourself and then your kid </v>

424
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 1>would be the problem.</v>

425
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to show a reason to express </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

426
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.150
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

427
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.993
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a time for violence and that </v>

428
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:48.064
<v Speaker 1>time is when you're defending yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone is fucking with you and </v>

429
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna do something to you.</v>

430
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 1>There's times when no one's there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save you.</v>

431
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 1>That's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't teach your kids that,</v>

432
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.390
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be real confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that moment does arise,</v>

433
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 1>they're going to look around for someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to save them and there's no one there.</v>

434
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very unfortunate.</v>

435
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:07.730
<v Speaker 1>No one wants it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

436
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 1>No one wants that to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is the case.</v>

437
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

438
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.473
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just around a bunch of bad </v>

439
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 1>people and you hope that nothing goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

440
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.113
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an effective way to prepare </v>

441
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 1>yourself for what could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about having kids,</v>

442
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start thinking of the world.</v>

443
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's been like this like danger written </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

444
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a different world.</v>

445
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Fucking cess pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

446
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.553
<v Speaker 3>and especially with the Internet now you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can see exactly who's crazy before you </v>

447
00:21:39.921 --> 00:21:40.731
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

448
00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:41.564
<v Speaker 3>people are generally okay and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see the fucking try it out guy </v>

449
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:45.490
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could tell she was so hot back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

698
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's still a beautiful woman,</v>

699
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.590
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during like 10,</v>

700
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a fucking smoke show,</v>

701
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.203
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a gorgeous woman and I don't hate </v>

702
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 1>on women for being 30 and bought hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate on him for fucking using it</v>

703
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:46.214
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like I don't hate on Arnold </v>

704
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger for being a bodybuilder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you present yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what you are.</v>

706
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not entitled to any specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

707
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get reactions and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are entitled look,</v>

708
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:05.681
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're not threatening you </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

709
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 1>physically doing anything to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is reacting to what you're</v>

710
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:11.294
<v Speaker 1>putting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any obligation to react </v>

711
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 1>the way that you would like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

712
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>jerking off to like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

718
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

719
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I guess I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never led with that.</v>

720
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not because I'm A.</v>

721
00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

722
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm just as thirsty as is that bitch.</v>

723
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Were strippers to comedians are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>strippers,</v>

724
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 1>like we want the attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want it for this.</v>

725
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I prefer to get it for my mind or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever.</v>

726
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd prefer to get it from.</v>

727
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

728
00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

729
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.570
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tripper thing comes from for sure,</v>

730
00:35:03.571 --> 00:35:04.404
<v Speaker 1>a variety of different places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely women that are </v>

731
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:07.334
<v Speaker 1>strippers that are doing it just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty and it's a good way to </v>

732
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:10.724
<v Speaker 1>make a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to make a lot of money </v>

733
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 1>fast from what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with it.</v>

734
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.353
<v Speaker 1>The other wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also ones that are doing it </v>

735
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 1>because they have sorbent need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

736
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.123
<v Speaker 1>an extraordinary need for sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and a lot of them had been </v>

737
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:30.221
<v Speaker 1>molested and that's more the case with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn stars.</v>

738
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy study on porn.</v>

739
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Stars were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were going over,</v>

740
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.081
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:35:39.081 --> 00:35:39.914
<v Speaker 1>they did like a random survey and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them and ask them how many of them </v>

742
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 1>have been molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 10.</v>

743
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 1>It was like some crazy number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you,</v>

744
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching people fuck on </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and you know,</v>

745
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

746
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:55.483
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine the vast majority of </v>

747
00:35:57.871 --> 00:36:02.871
<v Speaker 1>males specifically watch porn or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of porn and you're,</v>

748
00:36:03.231 --> 00:36:04.064
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially watching the product </v>
<v Speaker 1>of either a completely sexually </v>

749
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:10.290
<v Speaker 1>liberated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberated woman who likes doing that,</v>

750
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:11.320
<v Speaker 1>which is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

751
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some like Dr.</v>

752
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.640
<v Speaker 1>drew doesn't believe it's possible at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

753
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

754
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.823
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

755
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impairment.</v>

756
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I read a book even from a woman who who </v>
<v Speaker 1>said yeah,</v>

757
00:36:22.181 --> 00:36:23.014
<v Speaker 1>this is from an empowerment angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd gotten into an ivy league school </v>

758
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 1>and wanted to pay for it.</v>

759
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It definitely exists in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

760
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 1>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and estimation,</v>

761
00:36:32.041 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's likely lasted and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you mean.</v>

762
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

763
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not probable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a woman out there that's so</v>

764
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:42.643
<v Speaker 1>sexually liberated person who enjoys </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing porn is you don't have any more </v>

765
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 1>molestations and your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting upset right now,</v>

766
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 1>will we knowledge we acknowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you exist,</v>

767
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 1>not trying to diminish your perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

768
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 1>it's an odd thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads to all this sex.</v>

769
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.143
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also an odd thing when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the sheer volume of people </v>

770
00:37:03.001 --> 00:37:03.834
<v Speaker 1>fucking uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for a living that's a lot of </v>

771
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 1>foreign born and I have to say it can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be that lucrative anymore because of the</v>

772
00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Internet to have a joke about it where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

773
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I need to bring it back and figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do it correctly because I kind of</v>

774
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:17.814
<v Speaker 1>abandoned it.</v>

775
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 1>But the premise was who's seen all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn?</v>

776
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Like why are they making new porn porn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

777
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:26.460
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking,</v>

778
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you suck everybody's fucking sucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you are you just looking to beat</v>

779
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:31.524
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you wasting your whole life will </v>

780
00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:37.350
<v Speaker 1>look like super specific scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doggish down.</v>

781
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to see her feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of her feet.</v>

782
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if in a certain position like </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a break,</v>

783
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:45.953
<v Speaker 1>take a week off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently there is a need for it </v>

784
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:53.661
<v Speaker 1>because they're making it and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming this really these niche lanes.</v>

785
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.653
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it has to do with the fact </v>

786
00:37:56.911 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 1>that people are always ramping up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

787
00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 1>if you give person a car that has 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower,</v>

788
00:38:02.821 --> 00:38:03.654
<v Speaker 1>they want a car that is 200 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then next year that car better be </v>

789
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 1>faster than the year after that.</v>

790
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.813
<v Speaker 1>A better breathe better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he after that and they were </v>

791
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to get that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge,</v>

792
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>like the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's just regular sex.</v>

793
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:16.031
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

794
00:38:16.031 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular sex.</v>

795
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see in an hd.</v>

796
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you come in her face?</v>

797
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's tickling her ass?</v>

798
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Then come her face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

799
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Now we're getting crazy and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it all goes.</v>

800
00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Like asked to mouth and gagging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gagging,</v>

801
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.323
<v Speaker 1>all that crazy shit comes from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like watching so much porn than just </v>

802
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 1>regular stuff's not doing it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to.</v>

803
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.440
<v Speaker 1>They want to grow to be smacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to come out of her mouth,</v>

804
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.610
<v Speaker 1>tears to come out of her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want all that stuff that's.</v>

805
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking get it,</v>

806
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:48.920
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

807
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:54.030
<v Speaker 1>it's this psychological trait that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have is ramping up the bigger,</v>

808
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 1>better deal.</v>

809
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Constantly wanting something more </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme violent movies today,</v>

810
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>like Julie and I were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra sister the other day,</v>

811
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:07.690

<v Speaker 1>breastfeed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like his forehead was locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't going nowhere.</v>

00:44:44.391 --> 00:44:45.320
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

928
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.670
<v Speaker 3>What is it doing to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it,</v>

929
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.490
<v Speaker 3>what does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they paralyzed.</v>

930
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.400
<v Speaker 3>They put botulism in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I'm also reluctant because,</v>

931
00:44:52.401 --> 00:44:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit's not been studied really.</v>

932
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

933
00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:58.130
<v Speaker 3>How do we know what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got a wrinkle here,</v>

934
00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.970
<v Speaker 3>so they'll put it here and they freeze </v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle at paralyzes it.</v>

935
00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:05.870
<v Speaker 3>So you can't make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't scowl scour.</v>

936
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Scour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my.</v>

937
00:45:09.651 --> 00:45:12.740
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is going online?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the same one.</v>

938
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

939
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.750
<v Speaker 3>so at paralyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't do the gesture that creates</v>

940
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.600
<v Speaker 3>the wrinkles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's more of a preemptive measure.</v>

941
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.670
<v Speaker 3>So you should start doing early is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

942
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:23.683
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about being a comic and making </v>

943
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.410
<v Speaker 3>expressions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

944
00:45:27.411 --> 00:45:29.360
<v Speaker 3>So when you're on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up getting migraines because you</v>

945
00:45:29.361 --> 00:45:30.194
<v Speaker 3>can't because you.</v>

946
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Move your eyebrows.</v>

947
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:37.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm surprised with squares on welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I make my eyes water.</v>

948
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:42.683
<v Speaker 3>You want to see a show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a show on netflix where people </v>

949
00:45:44.861 --> 00:45:48.160
<v Speaker 3>go to Thailand for cheap plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

950
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it.</v>

951
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Have you been in Thailand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never have yelled.</v>

952
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:54.641
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

953
00:45:54.641 --> 00:45:56.540
<v Speaker 2>it just went to summer camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole family.</v>

954
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Where did you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chiang Mai.</v>

955
00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a northern Thailand.</v>

956
00:46:00.771 --> 00:46:03.440
<v Speaker 2>It's really close to where those kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>got trapped in the cave.</v>

957
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:04.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got there right after they got </v>

958
00:46:05.481 --> 00:46:06.770
<v Speaker 2>rescued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's happy times.</v>

959
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.633
<v Speaker 2>Thailand is dope though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people are so friendly and the food </v>

960
00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:12.320
<v Speaker 2>was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hear.</v>

961
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.213
<v Speaker 2>We took cooking classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hung out with elephants and an </v>

962
00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.873
<v Speaker 2>elephant sanctuary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty bad ass on your </v>

963
00:46:18.291 --> 00:46:20.330
<v Speaker 2>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elephants are sweet.</v>

964
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.100
<v Speaker 2>They're so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so kind.</v>

965
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.920
<v Speaker 2>You get super nervous around him when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you first around them because they're so</v>

966
00:46:24.921 --> 00:46:25.754
<v Speaker 2>goddamn big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then afterwards you realize like </v>

967
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.750
<v Speaker 2>they're just gentle giants there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so sweet.</v>

968
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.750
<v Speaker 2>And these animals at this one place that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to,</v>

969
00:46:32.751 --> 00:46:36.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a rehabilitation place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would take animals that had been</v>

970
00:46:36.111 --> 00:46:36.944
<v Speaker 2>to the circus and they'd been harmed or </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistreated and they'd bring them back </v>

971
00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:41.690
<v Speaker 2>and they even released them into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>

972
00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

973
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they wander around with them in </v>

974
00:46:45.861 --> 00:46:46.694
<v Speaker 2>the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we took them for this long hike </v>

975
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.690
<v Speaker 2>where you ride them all through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods,</v>

976
00:46:50.691 --> 00:46:51.524
<v Speaker 2>so it was like a couple miles who went </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just stop and eat things so </v>

977
00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to worry about feeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

978
00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:00.910
<v Speaker 2>They're are fucking pretty confident </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they know what to eat.</v>

979
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:06.050
<v Speaker 2>They just grab leaves and starts shoving</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the trunk and then they shit and</v>

980
00:47:06.051 --> 00:47:10.330
<v Speaker 2>piss and you can't believe the volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you hear the logs hit the ground.</v>

981
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.420
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is happening?</v>

982
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And then you look down there shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

983
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:17.270
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just was just bushels of shit.</v>

984
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.193
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

985
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.620
<v Speaker 2>boom clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>

986
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Just giant clumps of broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegetable matter.</v>

987
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.270
<v Speaker 2>They're herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

988
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.400
<v Speaker 2>that's all they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so sweet though.</v>

989
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Dillard up to you rub their head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>

990
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 2>you actually kind of bond with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you feed them sugar cane.</v>

991
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get to know them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wash them.</v>

992
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 2>The first thing they have you do is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wash them and you feed them.</v>

993
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.400
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we fed them first.</v>

994
00:47:43.401 --> 00:47:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Then washed them and we have these like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just big piles of sugarcane and you hand</v>

995
00:47:48.171 --> 00:47:50.150
<v Speaker 2>them these pieces of sugarcane is </v>
<v Speaker 2>chewing,</v>

996
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 2>crunch it and swallow it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they and they take it from you,</v>

997
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:57.730
<v Speaker 2>like real gentle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking 2000 plus pound animal,</v>

998
00:47:57.731 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably bigger than that and there's so</v>

999
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:02.440
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like real easy.</v>

1000
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 2>They know they walk around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't try to knock you over there.</v>

1001
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Just real relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They help you get up if you want to ride</v>

1002
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift their arm up so you can step on the</v>

1003
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 2>arm and then you climb onto their back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to get a pet elephant?</v>

1004
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're.</v>

1005
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>They're interesting animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really are.</v>

1006
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:20.224
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really sweet and this area that </v>

1007
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:23.580
<v Speaker 2>we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

1008
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 2>They actually have elephants that live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Thailand.</v>

1009
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 2>They actually live in the wild because </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that many of them,</v>

1010
00:48:29.111 --> 00:48:29.944
<v Speaker 2>but they've introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they said seven new ones to the </v>

1011
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:34.900
<v Speaker 2>wild from this sanctuary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was pretty.</v>

1012
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting that you get to see</v>

1013
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 2>them where they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're free,</v>

1014
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 2>they're free roaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they roam all around that area.</v>

1015
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 2>They're not in pens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not captive.</v>

1016
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.150
<v Speaker 2>They're basically just freely roaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they feed them and take care of</v>

1017
00:48:49.151 --> 00:48:49.984
<v Speaker 2>them and they know the food's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be there and then they just eventually </v>

1018
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:54.820
<v Speaker 2>get them to the point where they can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>free again.</v>

1019
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty bad ass.</v>

1020
00:48:57.061 --> 00:48:59.940
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people were so friendly,</v>

1021
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.043
<v Speaker 1>so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this on that show because they're </v>

1022

<v Speaker 1>always smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super,</v>

<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1030
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.180

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1032
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.840

<v Speaker 1>Whitley strieber.</v>

<v Speaker 1>striper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willis' driver's Whitley strieber.</v>

1035
00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:42.810
<v Speaker 1>As the guy who was behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote,</v>

1036
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 1>he's an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole store is really suspect.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and he wrote it that it was based on his</v>

1041
00:49:57.181 --> 00:49:58.014
<v Speaker 2>own life that it actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem was he was already this </v>

1042
00:50:01.381 --> 00:50:02.214
<v Speaker 2>fiction novelist who's writing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild stories and they decided to say </v>

1043
00:50:06.001 --> 00:50:08.970
<v Speaker 2>this one's real and it got all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>traction,</v>

1044
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.223
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all like being abducted in the </v>

1045
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:15.323
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night and taken out of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>bed by aliens and brought to ships and </v>

1046
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 2>scientific experiments like that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1047
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.233
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's aliens doing that </v>

1048
00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they care about your,</v>

1049
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1050
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.100
<v Speaker 3>that's the weirdest thing is that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go up your butt.</v>

1051
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 3>It's always a homoerotic sort of fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and anal fantasy with the alien.</v>

1052
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Why does it always turn sexual?</v>

1053
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.553
<v Speaker 1>I think because if you're paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one fear is that someone's </v>

1054
00:50:42.311 --> 00:50:43.380
<v Speaker 1>going to put something up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your bought</v>

1055
00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 3>were out at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1056
00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1057
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:48.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do,</v>

1058
00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 3>but stuff for that re unlike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is,</v>

1059
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:53.354
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a combined with the other thing </v>

1060
00:50:57.711 --> 00:50:58.544
<v Speaker 3>is I think they worry people worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>being impregnated or having their baby </v>

1061
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.530
<v Speaker 3>taken them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1062
00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:05.540
<v Speaker 3>The aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a common theme too.</v>

1063
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd be afraid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been to Roswell,</v>

1064
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.641
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1065
00:51:08.641 --> 00:51:09.474
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went there for some TV show I worked </v>

1066
00:51:10.941 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 3>on like a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1067
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they claim that's where the,</v>

1068
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:19.090
<v Speaker 3>the aliens is that they live with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the crash happened in 1947.</v>

1069
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.450
<v Speaker 3>When I say that there's like a museum </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to and see.</v>

1070
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever I bought a tee shirt,</v>

1071
00:51:24.501 --> 00:51:25.334
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>

1072
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole story is super suspect.</v>

1073
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>The story of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1074
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.233
<v Speaker 1>there was some records they found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They flew the wreckage in two separate </v>

1075
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:38.750
<v Speaker 1>planes to Wright Patterson Air Force </v>
<v Speaker 1>Base and Truman actually met them.</v>

1076
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:42.860
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck did crash.</v>

1077
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.933
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough importance that Truman flew </v>

1078
00:51:46.941 --> 00:51:47.774
<v Speaker 1>out and they flew it in two separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>planes in case one of the planes went </v>

1079
00:51:50.001 --> 00:51:51.250
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the,</v>

1080
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:52.084
<v Speaker 1>this is the folk lore and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>day they had this press conference and </v>

1081
00:51:54.881 --> 00:51:55.371
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1082
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:56.204
<v Speaker 1>we made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a balloon and then you know </v>

1083
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.020
<v Speaker 1>my joke that I used to do it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1084
00:52:02.021 --> 00:52:04.400
<v Speaker 1>what about the aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are Mexicans.</v>

1085
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Theory got drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were mistook the balloon for Jada.</v>

1086
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

1087
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.253
<v Speaker 1>The whole story behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem was it got put in the </v>

1088
00:52:15.681 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Roswell daily record that the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>is recovered,</v>

1089
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 1>a crashed flying disc and then everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>went fucking bananas,</v>

1090
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:24.243
<v Speaker 1>so no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really knows what actually </v>

1091
00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:26.510
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1092
00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:27.723
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear why they picked right </v>

1093
00:52:29.091 --> 00:52:31.100
<v Speaker 1>pat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's in the middle of Ohio.</v>

1094
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Roswell is pretty far.</v>

1095
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just a big air force base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that right?</v>

1096
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Patterson Air Force Base where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanger 18 was.</v>

1097
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that Dayton,</v>

1098
00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:43.923
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hang on a team was another famous </v>

1099
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:49.220
<v Speaker 1>thing and Ufo folklore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folklore.</v>

1100
00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:50.054
<v Speaker 1>There was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose it hanger 18 and find out where </v>

1101
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:54.434
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hangar 18 was supposed to be this place </v>

1102
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:57.794
<v Speaker 1>where they stored all of the crashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>wreckage from various ufo over the last </v>

1103
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:06.780
<v Speaker 1>few decades because apparently there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been numerous crashed Ufo,</v>

1104
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 1>great on alien planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says.</v>

1105
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>18.</v>

1106
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 1>There's like a website about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's that right pat.</v>

1108
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Long as there's a website about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>traces a squarespace website.</v>

1109
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 1>We believe Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1110
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.710
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the ones?</v>

1111
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Cities remember those with the animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>little gifts school?</v>

1112
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the moon landing?</v>

1113
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the movie Ryan Gosling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1114
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was good though.</v>

1115
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you love.</v>

1116
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.433
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't put the American flag </v>

1117
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:46.581
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something so cool.</v>

1118
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Right to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music video.</v>

1119
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.080
<v Speaker 1>There was something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought his daughter's necklace up.</v>

1120
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 1>He has his young daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to give it all away,</v>

1121
00:53:57.961 --> 00:54:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but then he put his daughter's necklace </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I don't know,</v>

1122
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.760
<v Speaker 1>based on real life that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1123
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 1>loosely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>

1124
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It's probable that that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flag thing,</v>

1125
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1126
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy,</v>

1127
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:13.323
<v Speaker 1>didn't plant the US flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were upset and they were saying </v>

1128
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1129
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:18.143
<v Speaker 1>in this climate they just thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be a good idea to express </v>

1130
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.540
<v Speaker 1>nationalism or something.</v>

1131
00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:27.510
<v Speaker 1>So I remember reading some cockamamie </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why they didn't have the flag.</v>

1132
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.630
<v Speaker 1>They actually had the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck there actually,</v>

1133
00:54:30.631 --> 00:54:31.464
<v Speaker 1>if you believe in the moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe it happened and you want to </v>

1134
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:35.400
<v Speaker 1>show you a movie of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to show the flag.</v>

1135
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 1>They put it in the ground is a big part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the program.</v>

1136
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's our flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the,</v>

1137
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.740
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking dirt on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>

1138
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.580
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he also paid brown on the way up</v>

1139
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.430
<v Speaker 1>on the 40 day journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I heard you just Pete Brown,</v>

1140
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:50.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete,</v>

1141
00:54:50.801 --> 00:54:51.634
<v Speaker 1>a little brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like amber colored ice tea </v>

1142
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>colored while I was a little worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1143
00:54:57.601 --> 00:54:58.434
<v Speaker 1>There's something called rhabdomyolysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you do crossfit or actually a </v>

1144
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:03.894
<v Speaker 1>couple of fighters have died from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually just found out about that </v>

1145
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:06.474
<v Speaker 1>this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fighters who had been overtrained </v>

1146
00:55:08.491 --> 00:55:09.324
<v Speaker 1>going into fights and then exerted </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to extreme during the fight </v>

1147
00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:14.430
<v Speaker 1>and then died afterwards.</v>

1148
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:17.830
<v Speaker 1>A couple of them turned out to have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhabdo my locis,</v>

1149
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:18.600
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1150
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1151
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.183
<v Speaker 1>your muscle tissue breaks down your </v>
<v Speaker 1>liver crashes or your kidneys crash </v>

1152
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that.</v>

1153
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just dehydrated.</v>

1154
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love this challenge because I love </v>

1166
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 1>surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned to do it in my twenties.</v>

1167
00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:07.284
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's like that's why it's so </v>

1168
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:11.410
<v Speaker 1>incredibly difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you served?</v>

1169
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:12.443
<v Speaker 1>Not at all and I'm not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to touch it until </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 1>We got to wait until October and then do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1173
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>I will say the ocean is very in</v>

1174
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.873
<v Speaker 3>October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one you're going to get a </v>

1175
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 3>special suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are.</v>

1176

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sharks can't eat me.</v>

1178
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing though.</v>

1179
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.033
<v Speaker 2>Not getting aided by no big fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a tablet that does a tentative </v>

1180
00:56:47.081 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 2>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to say this last one,</v>

1181
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.673
<v Speaker 2>your husband Tommy bonds is the one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up with the fitness challenge and </v>

1182
00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 2>there was only like the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>days before October,</v>

1183
00:56:56.111 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 2>like we hadn't really decided on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do.</v>

1184
00:56:57.851 --> 00:56:58.684
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were even thinking about repeating </v>

1185
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 2>our 15 yoga class thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd kind of settled into that.</v>

1186
00:57:03.221 --> 00:57:03.731
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1187
00:57:03.731 --> 00:57:04.564
<v Speaker 2>I can do 15 yoga classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we kind of had decided that that's </v>

1188
00:57:06.581 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I know where your husband goes,</v>

1189
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this fitness thing,</v>

1190
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:12.274
<v Speaker 2>I wear this app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we could just see who gets the </v>

1191
00:57:13.451 --> 00:57:14.680
<v Speaker 2>most points for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1192
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:15.630
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1193
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You weren't excited about that idea.</v>

1194
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.790
<v Speaker 3>I thought it would be fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever.</v>

1195
00:57:20.791 --> 00:57:21.624
<v Speaker 3>It'd be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think it would be a psycho </v>

1196
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.240
<v Speaker 3>battle to the death when it became </v>
<v Speaker 3>really quick.</v>

1197
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was D as a spouse of the sober?</v>

1198
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Is the sobriety parts not too difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Tommy?</v>

1199
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the time away from the family.</v>

1200
00:57:37.201 --> 00:57:38.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like he would go and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bye.</v>

1201
00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go hike for six hours in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we live near hills and I'm like,</v>

1202
00:57:43.681 --> 00:57:44.514
<v Speaker 3>there's fucking rattle snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cougars and you better be back before </v>

1203
00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:48.190
<v Speaker 3>sundown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know?</v>

1204
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1205
00:57:49.891 --> 00:57:52.890
<v Speaker 3>And then he got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was doing it on antibiotics,</v>

1206
00:57:52.891 --> 00:57:53.724
<v Speaker 3>which was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want them to be doing that </v>

1207
00:57:54.691 --> 00:57:57.810
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen miles on antibiotics.</v>

1208
00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Crazy has bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1209
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:01.980
<v Speaker 3>that is so hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know and.</v>

1210
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:04.770
<v Speaker 3>But we were like talking about it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and he was like,</v>

1211
00:58:04.771 --> 00:58:07.380
<v Speaker 3>well Joe is gonna be first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no question like.</v>

1212
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.900
<v Speaker 3>So it was more about who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>second and third.</v>

1213
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 3>He was</v>

1214
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.560
<v Speaker 2>trying to take that first place spot now</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1215
00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:13.403
<v Speaker 2>He was doing all sorts of sneaky tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to bank up as points and </v>

1216
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 2>try to pretend that I know that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a threat.</v>

1217
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.910
<v Speaker 2>He really was sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

1218
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's super sneaky.</v>

1219
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.370
<v Speaker 2>He came close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came close.</v>

1220
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:30.820
<v Speaker 2>He was the closest to me and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the most sneaky.</v>

1221
00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely the most sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1222
00:58:33.581 --> 00:58:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what's his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how has he sneaky like what we would say</v>

1223
00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:39.850
<v Speaker 2>things to me like you should just work </v>
<v Speaker 2>out normal and see if you beat us.</v>

1224
00:58:39.851 --> 00:58:41.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you just try to beat us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be too easy.</v>

1225
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Like one on one I do that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1226
00:58:47.831 --> 00:58:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I had decided early on that I was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to beat them,</v>

1227
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:53.410
<v Speaker 2>but I decided that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first I was like,</v>

1228
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:54.244
<v Speaker 2>this is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a shit about this competition </v>

1229
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:59.140
<v Speaker 2>really ruined my life for this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could not live with myself.</v>

1230
00:58:59.141 --> 00:58:59.974
<v Speaker 2>If burt one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big part of the problem with </v>

1231
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:04.120
<v Speaker 2>that really have happened though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could have happened.</v>

1232

<v Speaker 2>I have all of you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know if we fucked off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everybody went hard.</v>

1235
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:11.524
<v Speaker 2>Even burt burt's wife was probably used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to him being gone 10 abandoning the </v>

1236
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:18.500
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

<v Speaker 1>monarchy and you're oppressing all those</v>

1257
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>this is back in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was.</v>

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>He was very pro black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black guy who's very pro and he said one</v>

1259
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>of the most ridiculous things any </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's ever said,</v>

1260
01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about black people today </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

1261

<v Speaker 1>black people have got to understand back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day we will kings and I go,</v>

1262

<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1264
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.560

<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that king's work?</v>

1265
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:31.394
<v Speaker 1>There's one person and that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominates all these other people with </v>

1266
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way they do it is through threat</v>

1267
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.830

<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most terrible things to </v>

1270
01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>be is a king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even get elected into office,</v>

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:57.923

01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God ordains the king.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's surprisingly good.</v>

1282
01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Give it four episodes because right </v>
<v Speaker 1>around episode four it really kicks in.</v>

1283
01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:19.323
<v Speaker 1>So one of our friends had told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've watched the first episode of </v>

1284
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:22.004

<v Speaker 1>two comes around by episode four rolls </v>

1285
01:01:25.941 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1287
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to just get executed back then</v>

1288
01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:35.723
<v Speaker 1>the way he looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck him up and that would get people </v>

1289
01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>scared and that's how you keep power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Putin's doing.</v>

1290
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do in North Korea,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because Shogi guy that the journalists </v>

<v Speaker 1>that got assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know about this?</v>

1295
01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in a bubble.</v>

1296
01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Journalists got assassinated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudis.</v>

1297
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>He went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1298
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:01.363
<v Speaker 1>the embassy in Istanbul because his wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went to the Turkish embassy because </v>

1299
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>his wife was Turkish and he was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get married to her and the Saudis had</v>

1300
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:11.084
<v Speaker 1>sent 15 hit men to meet him there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They strangled him and dismembered him </v>

1301
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>with bone saws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry him out in suitcases.</v>

1302
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And they brought in a guy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>forensics expert.</v>

1303
01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:23.844
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the 15 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they brought in someone who would </v>

1304
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:26.934
<v Speaker 1>know how to manipulate the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Turkish apparently they said </v>

1305
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:32.544
<v Speaker 1>that they have all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have video and audio evidence that </v>

1306
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:36.564
<v Speaker 1>he was murdered there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't release it because then </v>

1307
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>it'll show the people how they spy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1308
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is today in 2018.</v>

1309
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>It killed a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't like what he was saying.</v>

1310
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:52.283
<v Speaker 3>That smell is Saudi though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a military gig in Saudi Arabia </v>

1311
01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 3>right before I,</v>

1312
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.893
<v Speaker 3>2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually had two passports when I </v>

1313
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 3>went to go do this military tour and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know why,</v>

1314
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 3>and we get to Riyadh and they go give </v>
<v Speaker 3>them this passport,</v>

1315
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:08.544
<v Speaker 3>the second one that we gave you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was completely blank and just had </v>

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1317
01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.190

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1323
01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.613

<v Speaker 3>some guy had put a bomb up as buttoned </v>

1324
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:31.920

01:04:13.671 --> 01:04:18.170
<v Speaker 1>come here from some countries like Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is get on a raft.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They don't send you back to Cuba ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was some circumstances to that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you when you make it from Miami or to </v>

1355
01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.730

<v Speaker 1>the fat people on the island and then </v>

1409
01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>they get real skinny by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You will lose weight.</v>

1413
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:28.510

1416
01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>something like a rabbit or something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody freaked out.</v>

1417
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 1>People were so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1418
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>they could be serving them chicken out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a bucket.</v>

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.700

<v Speaker 1>You don't want them to do that.</v>

1422
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you want that rabbit to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and become an angel?</v>

<v Speaker 1>They didn't give a fuck about that </v>

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>The hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1434
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.273
<v Speaker 1>let's get a hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to play with it all the </v>

1435
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:21.164
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We promised.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They pick it up a couple times.</v>

1438
01:08:23.891 --> 01:08:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this little rat rat bag.</v>

1439
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>They have cats and dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

1440
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>which are real pants.</v>

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Pet a bullshit pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't really play with it.</v>

1442
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't snuggle with a hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't teach it to do anything.</v>

1443
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>The worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his birds.</v>

1444
01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.053
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have a fucking burst or little </v>

1445
01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>cut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diaz done.</v>

1446
01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Don't give a fuck about this shit all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over your house if you let them out.</v>

1447
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>One thing we did do is we raised a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hummingbird.</v>

1448
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1449
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.300
<v Speaker 1>we brought it back to health and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>released it.</v>

1450
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.793
<v Speaker 1>We found a hummingbird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a baby humming bird that had </v>

1451
01:08:56.571 --> 01:09:01.571
<v Speaker 1>fallen out of the nest and it was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny and so we took it in and uh,</v>

1452
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.130
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know how long it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

1453
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.331
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1454
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 1>this thing might die on us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do we do?</v>

1455
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And then we had a google what they eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically the sugar water,</v>

1456
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.193
<v Speaker 1>so we basically put sugar and mix it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with water and put it in as his or her </v>

1457
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 1>little Balaji gender that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1458
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call it us or in a box in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>

1459
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:24.523
<v Speaker 1>And we fed them and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they them pronouns and the Diet sugar </v>

1460
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>

1461
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:34.874
<v Speaker 1>We kept it for a month and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it got to a point where it </v>

1462
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:38.684
<v Speaker 1>was kind of hopping around inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>box and it seemed to be healthy and </v>

1463
01:09:41.571 --> 01:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>would let us hold it and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really crazy,</v>

1464
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 1>like totally attached to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we let it go and flew away.</v>

1465
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Like it was fucked up in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't move his wings.</v>

1466
01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what to do,</v>

1467
01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:52.634
<v Speaker 1>whether it was wounded to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to take it and get </v>

1468
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it fixed somewhere and we didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

1469
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 1>but it lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1470
01:10:00.381 --> 01:10:01.490
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did you have it?</v>

1471
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>About a month or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1472
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I have a theater outside the kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 1>window and I love to watch them.</v>

1473
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:13.721
<v Speaker 1>I get so excited when they have strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird makes my day so fast,</v>

1474
01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.410
<v Speaker 1>so fast.</v>

1475
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Those little tiny wings to their wings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so small.</v>

1476
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every bird has like a wingspan,</v>

1477
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but their wingspan is like half the size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a normal births.</v>

1478
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:30.641
<v Speaker 1>Wingspan and they just go a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour and they go left and right</v>

1479
01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:32.264
<v Speaker 1>and up and down and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their ability to change direction is </v>

1480
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.314
<v Speaker 1>so strange and hover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just hover perfectly in the </v>

1481
01:10:39.171 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 1>air and then turn it off and then come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and hover.</v>

1482
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very unusual design.</v>

1483
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1484
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 1>They're so tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that's why they have to move</v>

1485
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:48.884
<v Speaker 1>so fast because the wings are so tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen one get fucked up by </v>

1486
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.170
<v Speaker 1>praying mantis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1487
01:10:53.171 --> 01:10:54.004
<v Speaker 1>That's the dark shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Praying mantis will hide underneath a </v>

1488
01:10:57.381 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>bird feeder and just sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sit there like this and wait.</v>

1489
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.173
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the praying Mantis can't fuck up </v>

1490
01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>that bird.</v>

1491
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It's smaller than the bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1492
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:10.670
<v Speaker 1>They can never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put it up.</v>

1493
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Praying mantises regularly kill.</v>

1494
01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.473
<v Speaker 1>I did not climb up to the nest.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hummingbirds,</v>

1522
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:45.443

<v Speaker 1>of the hummingbird and the size of the </v>

1587
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And once they're in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're screwed.</v>

1592
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Well it was one of the reasons why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good to have coyotes around is why it's </v>

1593
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:57.540
<v Speaker 1>good to have owls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things.</v>

1594
01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>

1595
01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:00.184
<v Speaker 1>Keep the rat population down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people run around killing hawks and </v>

1596
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 1>owls and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was also a problem with people</v>

1597
01:16:07.751 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that leave out poison because he leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>out poison for the rats and the rats eat</v>

1598
01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:12.484
<v Speaker 1>the poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the owls eat the rats and they get </v>

1599
01:16:13.961 --> 01:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die out here.</v>

01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:16.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue.</v>

1601
01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.640

<v Speaker 1>they'll bite your fucking kids.</v>

1609
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if no one's around,</v>

1610
01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leave a kid in the yard,</v>

1611
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.143
<v Speaker 1>three year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to take a shit right </v>

1612
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:40.290
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back out.</v>

1613
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Come back onto the half eaten kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take my kid with me to take a shit.</v>

1614
01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I put them on my lap when they shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

1615
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm not going to let my kid be</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

1616
01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Three year olds get into everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with fucking animals.</v>

1617
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Animals out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dark.</v>

1618
01:16:57.610 --> 01:16:59.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those coyotes are really.</v>

1619
01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:00.723
<v Speaker 1>They're predators that are wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we had a big issue with them </v>

1620
01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:05.710
<v Speaker 1>because we have chickens and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started killing our chickens,</v>

1621
01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:06.963
<v Speaker 1>but then we realized we targeted like </v>
<v Speaker 1>our yard is targeted by these little </v>

1622
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>tiny</v>

1623
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange,</v>

1624
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:15.330
<v Speaker 2>sort of wild creatures that are sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1625
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:16.243
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

1626
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:19.270
<v Speaker 3>And they can jump over walls to forget </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1627
01:17:19.271 --> 01:17:21.000
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jump over walls like nothing.</v>

1628
01:17:21.001 --> 01:17:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Like six foot fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bounced to the top of the fence.</v>

1629
01:17:23.791 --> 01:17:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Then bounce over it like it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1630
01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're elegant.</v>

1631
01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:30.480
<v Speaker 3>The way they move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of beautiful to watch.</v>

1632
01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:33.210
<v Speaker 3>They look like just dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll see them in the neighborhood.</v>

1633
01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.453
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a coyote do like at first you're </v>

1634
01:17:35.641 --> 01:17:39.040
<v Speaker 3>like excited someone's dog and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just see them kind of skulking.</v>

1635
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:40.300
<v Speaker 3>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1637
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.423
<v Speaker 3>do you like looking at him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I know what they're capable of </v>

1638
01:17:44.551 --> 01:17:46.060
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here.</v>

1639
01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.110
<v Speaker 3>They will eat your dog for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are a lot of dogs.</v>

1640
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.750
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1641
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:52.500
<v Speaker 3>she had her dog and right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>her shell,</v>

1642
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.670
<v Speaker 3>a little Maltese lived out in Westlake </v>
<v Speaker 3>village in the broad daylight.</v>

1643
01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:57.503
<v Speaker 3>She was just standing in the backyard </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a little Maltese and a coyote just </v>

1644
01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:02.880
<v Speaker 3>came and snatched it up right in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of her and just bring it.</v>

1645
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Just went away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

1646

<v Speaker 3>I don't let them run around and the </v>

1649
01:18:09.721 --> 01:18:11.340
<v Speaker 3>charge out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1650
01:18:11.341 --> 01:18:13.230
<v Speaker 3>she was devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was traumatized.</v>

1651
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Love that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1652
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:18.390
<v Speaker 3>it's the Maltese is essentially a lap </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>

1653
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:20.410
<v Speaker 3>You're not training that thing to do my </v>
<v Speaker 3>gel.</v>

1654
01:18:20.411 --> 01:18:22.070
<v Speaker 3>So other than sleep with you and love </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1655
01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:22.923
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a member of the family and so </v>

1656
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:30.030
<v Speaker 3>fucking coyote snatches it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1657
01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:34.290
<v Speaker 3>It's hard out there for coyote though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to eat fat dogs slipping.</v>

1658
01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Stupid County dog getting fed by these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1659
01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.150
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they won't fuck with Marshall.</v>

1660
01:18:39.151 --> 01:18:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's too big.</v>

1661
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:41.893
<v Speaker 3>He's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two of them could try to take him </v>

1662
01:18:43.771 --> 01:18:44.604
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might.</v>

1663
01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:46.993
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they felt like he wasn't going to do </v>

1665
01:18:48.261 --> 01:18:49.094
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they felt like he was submissive or it </v>

1666
01:18:51.401 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 2>felt like they could just get a hold of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1667
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:53.983
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>

1668
01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 2>They have definitely killed dogs as big </v>
<v Speaker 2>as him before</v>

1669
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:59.110
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mount minds love them.</v>

1670
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.510
<v Speaker 3>They would love a dog that size for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1671
01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1672
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:08.580
<v Speaker 3>we think I sense that submissiveness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I don't know.</v>

1673
01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1674
01:19:11.021 --> 01:19:13.120
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a much bigger dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he died.</v>

1675
01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:14.460
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1676
01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.260
<v Speaker 2>he was a master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 13 years old.</v>

1677
01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:17.123
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just put them asleep a few months </v>

1678
01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.193
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1679
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.033
<v Speaker 2>It was bad at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We probably should've done it earlier </v>

1680
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.273
<v Speaker 2>because the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he literally couldn't walk into the </v>

1681
01:19:26.491 --> 01:19:29.490
<v Speaker 2>house to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was in the yard.</v>

1682
01:19:29.491 --> 01:19:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And when I tried to call them in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner,</v>

1683
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.230
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't walk like it was awful.</v>

1684
01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.093
<v Speaker 2>He would struggle to stand up and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take like a half a step and pause </v>

1685
01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:41.670
<v Speaker 2>another half a step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And paws and his legs were shaking.</v>

1686
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a beautiful dog,</v>

1687
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so sweet,</v>

1688
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.823

<v Speaker 2>like mastiffs are so kind that like so </v>

1689
01:19:51.931 --> 01:19:55.110
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so hard watching him struggle,</v>

1690
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:56.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was like breathing heavy and </v>

1691
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.750
<v Speaker 2>his mouth was open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hey,</v>

1692
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.863
<v Speaker 2>take a step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd be in agony and just he was </v>

1693
01:20:03.631 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>just so old from massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 is old.</v>

1694
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:09.923
<v Speaker 3>The bigger dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't live as long as they live </v>

1695
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

1696
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 3>nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For him to be 13,</v>

1697
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 3>like the vet was pretty shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this dog is old from massive.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Buy Burt's got one of those right?</v>

1700
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got one.</v>

1701
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Priscilla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they guard vampires.</v>

1702
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.680

<v Speaker 3>They protect you from vampires.</v>

1703
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:35.220
<v Speaker 3>Are they per guard for the vampires?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rice books.</v>

1704
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 3>They're always guarding family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They guard the vampires while they sleep</v>

1705
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 3>and then as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>

1706
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 3>those books were fucking good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1707
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:44.900
<v Speaker 3>And Rice went wacky and became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian at the end of the time.</v>

1708
01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard this.</v>

1709
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:47.214
<v Speaker 3>I saw her on a flight once and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>googled her and she's writing a </v>

1710
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Christian stuff and she also wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of snm books under a pseudonym.</v>

1711
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:56.683
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about spanking a lot of </v>

1712
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.780
<v Speaker 3>spanking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very odd.</v>

1713
01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1714
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to read it.</v>

1715
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about women and Vampires?</v>

1716
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

1717
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.320

<v Speaker 3>It's the same.</v>

1718

<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>

1719
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:15.240
<v Speaker 3>it's controlling power and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to 50 shades of gray,</v>

1720
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:18.090
<v Speaker 3>which I tried giving that to read too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1721
01:21:18.091 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of stupid.</v>

1722
01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm too smart for that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1723
01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1724
01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.360
<v Speaker 3>I like dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe me,</v>

1725
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 3>you don't like shit that dumb though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried,</v>

1726
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 3>I really tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to see what the deal is.</v>

1727
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I always try to see what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why people are drawn to stuff.</v>

1728
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:34.463
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a power thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the vampire comes and takes control </v>

1729
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:42.180
<v Speaker 3>of you and you're totally submissive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere I think in the female,</v>

1730
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:46.230
<v Speaker 3>whatever DNA in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our makeup,</v>

1731
01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 3>to have someone totally care for you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>give your power to them.</v>

1732
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:50.963
<v Speaker 3>I think is part of that I have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also a metaphor for sexual </v>

1733
01:21:53.851 --> 01:21:54.684
<v Speaker 3>liberation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe in a time when women couldn't </v>

1734
01:21:55.801 --> 01:21:56.634
<v Speaker 3>be sexually free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vampire is a metaphor for a loss of </v>

1735
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.560
<v Speaker 3>control and sexual desire and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1736
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:05.880
<v Speaker 3>That's my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same with the shades of gray.</v>

1737
01:22:05.970 --> 01:22:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Mostly it was right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like housewives,</v>

1738
01:22:08.281 --> 01:22:12.310
<v Speaker 3>kind of a repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repressed sexual thing because it wasn't</v>

1739
01:22:12.311 --> 01:22:13.144
<v Speaker 3>that risky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a billionaire guy </v>

1740
01:22:14.821 --> 01:22:15.654
<v Speaker 3>who liked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd like to spit in their mouth and </v>

1741
01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:17.724
<v Speaker 3>shit and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know she had a 500 orgasms the </v>

1742
01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:26.330
<v Speaker 3>first time she ever had sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1743
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.620
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is right.</v>

1744
01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try it up,</v>

1745
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.690
<v Speaker 3>but I'll piss on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Me.</v>

1746
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Was that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the word that he said?</v>

1747
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Danielle man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:42.300
<v Speaker 3>Her Pen name wrote a book in 1985 called</v>
<v Speaker 3>exit to Eden.</v>

1749
01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the sadomasochist books </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was turned into a movie.</v>

1750
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember this movie starring Dan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Akroyd?</v>

1751
01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Dan Akroyd didn't do with Rosie </v>
<v Speaker 3>O'donnell.</v>

1752
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:56.070
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a comedy,</v>

1753
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:58.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it supposed to be a comedy?</v>

1754
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:59.343
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1755
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was based off the story of,</v>

1756
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 3>so I think Gary Marshal might've turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>it into a comedy.</v>

1757
01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

1758
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:06.423
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

1759
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She played a slow person.</v>

1760
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1761
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Have you discussed this on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1762
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.034
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Sean Penn has also played a slow </v>

1763
01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one has quite done at the way.</v>

1764
01:23:22.361 --> 01:23:23.194
<v Speaker 1>Ben Stiller did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the people were getting mad </v>

1765
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:25.924
<v Speaker 1>because people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because some football player when a </v>

1766
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.650
<v Speaker 1>simple Jack Shaun white snowboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1767
01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just him.</v>

1768
01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:34.534
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple other people that went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to simple jack for Halloween and they </v>

1769
01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>were getting like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go a simple jacket anymore.</v>

1770
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:40.504
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a simple person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A simple character like dumb characters </v>

1771
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:47.920
<v Speaker 1>are now out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be that anymore.</v>

1772
01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.980
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with us?</v>

1773
01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Some weird new rules like popping up out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere.</v>

1774
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:53.591
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1775
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:54.424
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't simple jack a parody of </v>

1776
01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.260
<v Speaker 1>the thing like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke on a joke,</v>

1777
01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he's actually portraying a</v>

1778
01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:04.150
<v Speaker 1>realistic portrayal of simple.</v>

1779
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Jack was a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the movie,</v>

1781
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Simple Jack was a character in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like an actual person,</v>

1782
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.053
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1783
01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.500
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time there was a retard.</v>

1784
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it says in the movie?</v>

1785
01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fake movie though,</v>

1786
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:26.000
<v Speaker 1>but wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the scene.</v>

1787
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That's not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the thing.</v>

1788
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:30.580
<v Speaker 1>That movie also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all from tropic thunder,</v>

1789
01:24:30.581 --> 01:24:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that movies also the last time anyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to wear black face.</v>

1790
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1791
01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:37.540
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over now.</v>

1792
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:39.510
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Robert Downey Jr.</v>

1793
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Try to wear black face in tropic thunder</v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine.</v>

1794
01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:48.030
<v Speaker 1>JusT imagine back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

1795
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.530
<v Speaker 1>All the hurt feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1796
01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:52.773
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fused this enormous question of </v>

1797
01:24:56.201 --> 01:24:57.170
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.113
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping you have a fresh take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you want to know what I think </v>

1799
01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:01.990
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1800
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.823
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1801
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I think since Donald Trump became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>

1802
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.220
<v Speaker 1>and I think some people are so triggered</v>
<v Speaker 1>by daddy,</v>

1803
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.473
<v Speaker 1>daddy's a little narcissistic at times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy's not very socially conscious at </v>

1804
01:25:17.171 --> 01:25:18.004
<v Speaker 1>times and I think that's affected </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you say anything kind of </v>

1805
01:25:21.581 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 1>insensitive than it's in align with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regime,</v>

1806
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:26.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1807
01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't.</v>

1808
01:25:27.411 --> 01:25:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't identify with everything trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands for.</v>

1809
01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I like inappropriate humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean I aligned with him,</v>

1810
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:34.893
<v Speaker 1>but I think because he doesn't give any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity to these groups that are </v>

1811
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.930
<v Speaker 1>marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes the marginalized people upset.</v>

1812
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.273
<v Speaker 1>I also think that people realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get people in trouble by </v>

1813
01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:47.134
<v Speaker 1>pointing out the factor insensitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come down on them hard and when </v>

1814
01:25:51.431 --> 01:25:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they move.</v>

1815
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reaction.</v>

1816
01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening.</v>

1817
01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is the impulse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy it started with shaming.</v>

1818
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Fire them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take away their income.</v>

1819
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Make them lose their house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>

1821
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck banished away forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1822
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ready for you to come back yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Redemption and how's.</v>

1823
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.710
<v Speaker 1>When is redemption allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How soon has he repented enough?</v>

1824
01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Do we feel like he's earned that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of stuff.</v>

1825
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:29.450
<v Speaker 1>And then who was accused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the grounds for accusation?</v>

1826
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.300
<v Speaker 1>What's enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's enough evidence?</v>

1827
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Just somebody saying something good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1828
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 1>believe all women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe obviously.</v>

1829

<v Speaker 1>who the fuck,</v>

1830
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

1831
01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:39.711
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1832
01:26:39.711 --> 01:26:43.410
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are alive who do </v>
<v Speaker 1>say for sure,</v>

1833
01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.340

1843
01:27:04.150 --> 01:27:07.490
<v Speaker 1>They have wires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole separate breed.</v>

1844
01:27:08.110 --> 01:27:10.580
<v Speaker 1>They're non gender specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1846
01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:13.300

<v Speaker 1>They are not binary.</v>

1847
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:15.830
<v Speaker 1>The wires are just liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1848
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1849
01:27:17.001 --> 01:27:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murderers are predominantly male.</v>

1850
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:24.860
<v Speaker 1>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking true.</v>

1851
01:27:24.861 --> 01:27:28.210
<v Speaker 1>What's up with that testosterone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.393
<v Speaker 1>A long history of killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been within the last couple </v>

1853
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:33.420
<v Speaker 1>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get in trouble for it.</v>

1854
01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true actually.</v>

1855
01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.584
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1856
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:38.540
<v Speaker 1>He used to be not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kill people.</v>

1857
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 1>They killed each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People at duals.</v>

1858
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a president of the dual,</v>

1859
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:45.260
<v Speaker 1>which one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't forget which one,</v>

1860
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.600
<v Speaker 1>jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the presidents had a fucking dual</v>

1861
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:49.580
<v Speaker 1>while he was in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty rad.</v>

1862
01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you guys killed because you </v>

1863
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:54.700
<v Speaker 1>can physically you can.</v>

1864
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:55.663
<v Speaker 1>Like right now you could reach across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table and snapped my neck because </v>

1865
01:27:58.521 --> 01:28:00.740
<v Speaker 1>you're way bigger than me and way </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than me.</v>

1866
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I could poison and kill each other too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed each other.</v>

1867
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:04.364
<v Speaker 1>When each other are the same size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill people that are bigger than </v>

1868
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:09.490
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of.</v>

1869
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:14.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a history of people killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People getting in the way.</v>

1870
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.070
<v Speaker 1>There are problem throws there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>car starting,</v>

1871
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.923
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't let you sleep and you're </v>

1872
01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.481
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god it.</v>

1873
01:28:20.481 --> 01:28:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to just stab this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

1874
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>That's how men handle things or have </v>
<v Speaker 1>handled associate paths,</v>

1875
01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:26.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1876
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:29.810
<v Speaker 1>This Was pathic ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1877
01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:33.410
<v Speaker 1>but I think particularly when it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>common,</v>

1878
01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.473
<v Speaker 1>like it becomes a cultural sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifact like murder and violence </v>

1879
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:40.183
<v Speaker 1>becomes a part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you lived in ancient rome for </v>

1880
01:28:43.671 --> 01:28:44.504
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you got to the colosseum and you </v>

1881
01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:46.454
<v Speaker 1>watch people get chopped up with swords </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eaten by lions and most people were </v>

1882
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:51.163
<v Speaker 1>a lot of murder taking place out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets and very few people got caught </v>

1883
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:55.184
<v Speaker 1>for anything like what kind of meat you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be like right there to catch </v>

1884
01:28:58.131 --> 01:29:01.770
<v Speaker 1>someone doing something to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch no fingerprints,</v>

1885
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>no</v>

1886
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>dna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no understanding of anything.</v>

1887
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:05.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows who killed </v>

1888
01:29:05.851 --> 01:29:06.684
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people were just getting away with </v>

1889
01:29:07.471 --> 01:29:08.800
<v Speaker 2>it left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1890
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does this.</v>

1891
01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:12.603
<v Speaker 3>Was this Alexander Hamilton and aaron </v>
<v Speaker 3>burr was the sitting vice president at </v>

1892
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.510
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought the vice president.</v>

1893
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.621
<v Speaker 3>Aaron burr was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:23.280
<v Speaker 3>And Alexander Hamilton was the former </v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary of the treasury,</v>

1895
01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I believe at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there were political rivals.</v>

1896
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political rivals.</v>

1897
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.500
<v Speaker 2>They had a dual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who won one?</v>

1898
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did he win?</v>

1899
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:35.530
<v Speaker 3>MorTally wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shot him.</v>

1900
01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.393
<v Speaker 3>Killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1901
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like art artists,</v>

1902
01:29:39.731 --> 01:29:43.930
<v Speaker 3>renderings of whatever it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how crazy they would stand,</v>

1903
01:29:43.931 --> 01:29:46.480
<v Speaker 3>like 10 paces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would walk away from each other and</v>

1904
01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:47.790
<v Speaker 3>then shoot each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.260
<v Speaker 3>That's betsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that seem like a fair thing?</v>

1906
01:29:50.261 --> 01:29:51.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just really who's quicker on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>draw?</v>

1907
01:29:51.911 --> 01:29:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not really who's stronger or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an elegant fighter.</v>

1908
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:58.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you judge fights all the time.</v>

1909
01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to kill each other.</v>

1910
01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:01.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1911
01:30:01.611 --> 01:30:03.590
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's figure out a way where we can kill</v>

1912
01:30:03.591 --> 01:30:07.460
<v Speaker 2>each other or try to kill each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make an agreement on how it works.</v>

1913
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:10.490
<v Speaker 2>It's really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1914
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:11.361
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1915
01:30:11.361 --> 01:30:14.000
<v Speaker 2>It's really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you shouldn't tell someone that you</v>

1916
01:30:14.001 --> 01:30:16.040
<v Speaker 2>want to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea was to make it</v>

1917
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:20.240
<v Speaker 3>so that either guy had a fair chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fair killing.</v>

1918
01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:21.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1919
01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that some states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like particularly Washington state,</v>

1920
01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I have a mutually agreed combat laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1921
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:29.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like if you and jamie just decided </v>

1922
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:32.333
<v Speaker 2>fuck each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he might have to be grown girl </v>

1923
01:30:34.761 --> 01:30:37.970
<v Speaker 2>or boy on boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if jamie just said to me like,</v>

1924
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.560
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of your bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1926
01:30:41.150 --> 01:30:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fuck you up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we just decided and agreed.</v>

1927
01:30:44.541 --> 01:30:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Cops will stand by and let them beat the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of each other.</v>

1928
01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I kind of respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

1929
01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.000
<v Speaker 2>some old west type shit about that.</v>

1930
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:52.873
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say knowing what I know about </v>

1931
01:30:54.261 --> 01:30:56.330
<v Speaker 3>males,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of the way,</v>

1932
01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:00.110
<v Speaker 3>at least growing up in the time I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how guys sorted shit out,</v>

1933
01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You put him in his place and then the </v>

1935
01:31:04.551 --> 01:31:05.600
<v Speaker 3>beef is over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1936
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't want to have to do that.</v>

1937
01:31:07.521 --> 01:31:08.354
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that kind of shit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what if that guy can kick your ass and </v>

1938
01:31:10.311 --> 01:31:12.710

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1941
01:31:14.901 --> 01:31:15.734
<v Speaker 2>like you don't want to have to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone or even have to know how to </v>

1942
01:31:19.431 --> 01:31:20.264
<v Speaker 2>fight or have to be in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get fucked up by a god just </v>

1943
01:31:25.281 --> 01:31:28.520
<v Speaker 2>because he likes to talk a lot like god </v>

<v Speaker 2>he doesn't mind if he gets his brains </v>

<v Speaker 2>Being a man's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's better being a mentor being.</v>

<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1953
01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.553
<v Speaker 3>here's I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think whoever controls the money and </v>

1954
01:31:57.071 --> 01:32:00.740
<v Speaker 3>the power for government and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the power.</v>

1955
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually true,</v>

1956
01:32:02.651 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real power.</v>

1957
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.943
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who controls industry and who controls </v>

1958
01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:11.170
<v Speaker 3>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So until that changes,</v>

1959
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:12.383
<v Speaker 3>do you think those supreme court guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gals get together and go to one of </v>

1960
01:32:15.341 --> 01:32:17.530
<v Speaker 3>the eyes wide shut party?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1961
01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1962
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bohemian grove illuminati.</v>

1963
01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:25.410
<v Speaker 3>The bilderberg group?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I started to watch a documentary on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>free masons on netflix.</v>

1965
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:31.323
<v Speaker 3>Most boring fucking thing I ever saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to tap out after five minutes </v>

1966
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:35.163
<v Speaker 3>because it's like a legit organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>where a bunch of nerds get together and </v>

1967
01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1968
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:39.754
<v Speaker 3>it's not even exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freemason in houston was telling me all </v>

1969
01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:44.390
<v Speaker 3>about her fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:50.690
<v Speaker 3>We had a handshake and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secret pyramid inside of that parent was</v>

1971
01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.670
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the eye of horus.</v>

1972
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Where's the witchcraft?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get weird man.</v>

1973
01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.553
<v Speaker 3>But you know about that egg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public execution stuff you were </v>

1974
01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:04.580
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1975
01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.270
<v Speaker 3>there's that book by fuko,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1976
01:33:07.271 --> 01:33:08.104
<v Speaker 3>that old french philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talked about the scaffold scenes and </v>

1977
01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they worked as deterrent </v>
<v Speaker 3>for people committing crimes.</v>

1978
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 3>So now we don't have public execution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do shit behind closed doors,</v>

1979
01:33:18.671 --> 01:33:20.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't hang somebody,</v>

1980
01:33:20.021 --> 01:33:25.021
<v Speaker 3>but we quietly give somebody a lethal </v>
<v Speaker 3>injection and it's all very civilized.</v>

1981
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To kill somebody.</v>

1982
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder which worked better is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>public deterrent thing of like,</v>

1983
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.084
<v Speaker 3>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you steal some shit because look at </v>

1984
01:33:32.391 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1985
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:35.800
<v Speaker 3>they'll cut your fucking hand off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1986
01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:37.420
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1987
01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:38.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steel.</v>

1988
01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1989
01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if the public versus the </v>
<v Speaker 3>private punishment,</v>

1990
01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:48.361
<v Speaker 3>if that ever really works on weirdos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would it stop men from murdering?</v>

1991
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:52.123
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people that do it get caught up </v>

1992
01:33:55.451 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 3>and when they would call crimes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>passion.</v>

1993
01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that.</v>

1994
01:33:58.330 --> 01:33:59.163
<v Speaker 3>Like theY get caught up in this moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just can't help themselves and </v>

1995
01:34:02.741 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 3>they want to kill someone more than they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be free.</v>

1996
01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I just want to kill this motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>the deal without law shit later.</v>

1997
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Right now I've got a rock and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude's got ahead.</v>

1998
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Need to connect this rock to that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hood.</v>

1999
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:20.380
<v Speaker 3>What's this last public hanging and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky in 1936.</v>

2000
01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:23.380

<v Speaker 3>how many people showed up?</v>

<v Speaker 3>They love it.</v>

2003
01:34:29.111 --> 01:34:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Look at those guys climbing up on trees </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to do it a few times.</v>

2396
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's like a calm scene or </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird scene or a love scene or something</v>

2397
01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:07.684

<v Speaker 1>The worst.</v>

2401
01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:17.973
<v Speaker 1>It's so different than actual acting too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like you're doing it in </v>

2402
01:51:20.861 --> 01:51:23.710
<v Speaker 1>this weird environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a conference table.</v>

2403
01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.753
<v Speaker 1>The person is reading with you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like I did one and it was the </v>

2404
01:51:28.241 --> 01:51:29.074
<v Speaker 1>person who read with me was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>insultingly bad at it that I was really </v>

2405
01:51:32.591 --> 01:51:35.800
<v Speaker 1>frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like some a pa and he was like,</v>

2406
01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know if this is what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to happen with us.</v>

2407
01:51:42.351 --> 01:51:43.240
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c'mon man,</v>

2408
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:46.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to fucking just say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word so I can respond to this.</v>

2409
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I can't skate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong?</v>

2410
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:50.740
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were talking to me like that,</v>

2411
01:51:50.741 --> 01:51:52.270

<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with you?</v>

2412
01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you talk?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a coconut fall out of a tree and </v>

<v Speaker 1>this is why you're so successful.</v>

2416
01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:06.550
<v Speaker 1>This is why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2417
01:52:06.551 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 1>because in a world of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2418
01:52:09.581 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 1>You gotta keep it 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the world is.</v>

2419
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2420
01:52:14.170 --> 01:52:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's more reality today I</v>

2421
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:20.890
<v Speaker 1>think we've ever experienced ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

2422
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.110
<v Speaker 1>but what there is is a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are scared.</v>

2423
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:24.783
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scared of getting called out or </v>

2424
01:52:27.281 --> 01:52:29.350
<v Speaker 1>they're scared of getting fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fired.</v>

2425
01:52:29.351 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>One's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll take away your income.</v>

2426
01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:32.653
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to find another job after I </v>

2427
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:37.520
<v Speaker 1>talked about blackface.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They don't care about blackface</v>

<v Speaker 2>at fox was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.700
<v Speaker 2>why can't you give her a raise for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>

2432
01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:50.853
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to have a bone in </v>

01:52:52.371 --> 01:52:53.204
<v Speaker 2>your nose.</v>

2437
01:53:03.581 --> 01:53:04.414
<v Speaker 2>the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The inside word is that she was not a </v>

2438
01:53:06.491 --> 01:53:09.100
<v Speaker 2>nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not like her to be around.</v>

2439
01:53:09.101 --> 01:53:10.540
<v Speaker 2>They were looking for reasons to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of her.</v>

2440
01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the inside word,</v>

2441
01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:13.093

<v Speaker 2>How about someone who's annoying to her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she's not nice because you're </v>

2445
01:53:22.411 --> 01:53:24.630
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She wanted to be wiped up.</v>

2536
01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of girls want to be wiped up.</v>

2537
01:56:59.040 --> 01:56:59.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's the best.</v>

2539
01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go on the road.</v>

2540
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:08.070
<v Speaker 3>We want to make a career has while your </v>
<v Speaker 3>craft.</v>

2541
01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2542
01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:18.720
<v Speaker 3>It's really sad when guys wife up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy that's wifed up,</v>

2543
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:19.511
<v Speaker 3>you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2544
01:57:19.511 --> 01:57:23.440
<v Speaker 3>when the woman takes care of the man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got all the money beyond that,</v>

2545
01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to stay home and he looks miserable</v>

2546
01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:32.310
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't have any say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have any income and money.</v>

2547
01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 3>So who has the money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has the power in the relationship.</v>

2548
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:38.730
<v Speaker 3>She didn't even earn the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Came from the family.</v>

2549
01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're involved too.</v>

2550
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.510
<v Speaker 3>They're always around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2551
01:57:42.511 --> 01:57:43.890
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a weak,</v>

2552
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:45.360
<v Speaker 3>weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weak.</v>

2553
01:57:45.361 --> 01:57:50.361
<v Speaker 3>So that's a dark place for a man to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No sovereignty,</v>

2554
01:57:51.930 --> 01:57:52.763
<v Speaker 3>no control of your existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no real financial decision making </v>

2555
01:57:57.601 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 3>ability because you don't bring in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2556
01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.650
<v Speaker 3>She's scaring me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feeling that they settle for that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>everything's great work.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why should I work?</v>

2561

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2563
01:58:18.001 --> 01:58:21.090
<v Speaker 3>dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it make sense to you?</v>

2564
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Why would it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>gonna work.</v>

2567
01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:31.553
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will work if it's not a real man and </v>

2568
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:37.313
<v Speaker 3>the woman likes that scenario and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's just like this spineless little </v>

2569
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 3>cheese head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're totally on pc and I think</v>

2570
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 3>you're right because I think he's got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be kind of a beta male.</v>

2571
01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:52.660
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who likes his balls busted </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

2572
01:58:52.661 --> 01:58:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he likes his nuts squished.</v>

2573
01:58:55.571 --> 01:58:57.700
<v Speaker 3>He likes to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just scared.</v>

2574
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2575
01:58:58.390 --> 01:59:00.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2576
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:01.023
<v Speaker 2>it's if you're in a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and that someone is a woman and </v>

2577
01:59:06.221 --> 01:59:07.054
<v Speaker 2>she makes far more money than you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just decided to let her pay all the </v>

2578
01:59:09.461 --> 01:59:12.910
<v Speaker 2>bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a squirrely proposition.</v>

2579
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>It may work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible.</v>

2580
01:59:15.671 --> 01:59:19.600
<v Speaker 2>You might find the perfect woman and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect man were their personalities gel</v>

2581
01:59:19.601 --> 01:59:20.434
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of them gives a fuck about </v>

2582
01:59:21.341 --> 01:59:24.820
<v Speaker 2>money and yet the guy still a man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman is still a woman,</v>

2583
01:59:25.050 --> 01:59:27.160
<v Speaker 2>is just that she makes all the money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She puts out a strap on.</v>

2586
01:59:34.421 --> 01:59:35.254
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she pisses his face and that's how he </v>

2587
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:40.780
<v Speaker 2>gets money for food or beats or try it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2588
01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:42.400

<v Speaker 2>Equality.</v>

2589
01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.440
<v Speaker 2>She does whatever she wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She smacks him.</v>

2590
01:59:44.441 --> 01:59:45.274
<v Speaker 2>You can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you think that's what's going </v>

2591

<v Speaker 2>They have no power.</v>

2593
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:51.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>because I obviously I'm down for the </v>

2653
02:02:20.751 --> 02:02:22.490
<v Speaker 3>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the cause?</v>

2654
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a quality to the choice.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But here's the deal.</v>

2667
02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.233
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother was a european lady and as a </v>

2668
02:02:59.931 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 3>female comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an alpha in the streets,</v>

2669
02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:05.790
<v Speaker 3>but I'm kind of a beta and the sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2670
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:06.703
<v Speaker 3>I like to take care of my husband and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's why tommy and I workout </v>

2671
02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:12.770
<v Speaker 3>because I like to bake fucking rice </v>
<v Speaker 3>krispie treats.</v>

2672
02:03:13.730 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I have shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I food in the house.</v>

2673
02:03:15.561 --> 02:03:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a traditional wife.</v>

2674
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:18.103
<v Speaker 2>Well you're powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also still a woman and </v>

2675
02:03:20.181 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you like to be.</v>

2676
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:25.183
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that because you're supposed to be </v>

2677
02:03:27.081 --> 02:03:27.914
<v Speaker 2>even with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you supposed to be treating each </v>

2678
02:03:29.511 --> 02:03:30.344
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like your traditional male versus </v>

2679
02:03:31.941 --> 02:03:33.830
<v Speaker 2>female role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if that's what you like,</v>

2680
02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:34.993
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a problem because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pressure problem that women will put </v>

2681
02:03:37.161 --> 02:03:41.450
<v Speaker 2>on other women to behave in a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>way because they don't want to reinforce</v>

2682
02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:43.430
<v Speaker 2>traditional gender roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2683
02:03:43.431 --> 02:03:44.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2684
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:44.530
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2685
02:03:44.530 --> 02:03:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Given that role feels right to you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do like it.</v>

2686
02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like taking care of my kids.</v>

2687
02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:52.460
<v Speaker 2>There's some dirty cops out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll tell you that's bad.</v>

2688
02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Angry bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2689
02:04:00.131 --> 02:04:00.551
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2690
02:04:00.551 --> 02:04:01.384
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had some people say stuff to me </v>

2691
02:04:02.921 --> 02:04:04.240
<v Speaker 3>about it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2692
02:04:04.630 --> 02:04:05.463
<v Speaker 3>it makes me happy and if that's all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>matters and it's my choice to do that </v>

2693
02:04:08.021 --> 02:04:09.790
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I do it every night.</v>

2694
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:11.620
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2695
02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Whatever makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not hurting anybody.</v>

2696
02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:14.973
<v Speaker 3>That's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that there's something </v>

2697
02:04:16.211 --> 02:04:18.970
<v Speaker 3>wrong with you doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is fucking stupid.</v>

2698
02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.130
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just stupid.</v>

2699
02:04:21.550 --> 02:04:26.020
<v Speaker 3>It is silly already talking about you </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a lot of that though.</v>

2700
02:04:26.370 --> 02:04:27.203
<v Speaker 3>What a lot of that stupid out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People telling people the way they </v>

2701
02:04:30.821 --> 02:04:32.320
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't live.</v>

2702
02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.560
<v Speaker 3>You know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have much time.</v>

2703
02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I are halfway done.</v>

2704
02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Basically almost dead when you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

2705
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 3>when you turned 40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>

2706
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:44.000
<v Speaker 3>oh this is it dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like yeah,</v>

2707
02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:44.913
<v Speaker 3>how much time you got left?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully another 30 years of good </v>

2708
02:04:48.271 --> 02:04:49.104
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying before you really start to </v>

2709
02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:51.810
<v Speaker 3>break down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit starts falling apart.</v>

2710
02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll start coming off.</v>

2711
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2712
02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:54.793
<v Speaker 2>Some people are worried about dumb shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whether or not this woman works or </v>

2713
02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.990
<v Speaker 2>she should have a career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She should do this.</v>

2714
02:04:59.991 --> 02:05:01.220
<v Speaker 2>She should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's happy.</v>

2715
02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.740
<v Speaker 2>She likes eating cheese and getting her </v>
<v Speaker 2>toes done.</v>

2716
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:06.080
<v Speaker 3>Leave her alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2717
02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

2718
02:05:07.281 --> 02:05:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a middle aged revelation</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2719
02:05:09.351 --> 02:05:10.011
<v Speaker 3>You go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2720
02:05:10.011 --> 02:05:12.660
<v Speaker 3>there's only so much time left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about all this.</v>

2721
02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm gonna do me bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy that I know that stuck,</v>

2722
02:05:15.710 --> 02:05:19.220
<v Speaker 3>that's the wife makes all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it in his face though.</v>

2723
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:20.803
<v Speaker 3>I could just see this quiet anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lion at the zoo where </v>

2724
02:05:27.201 --> 02:05:28.034
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of broken and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that they're a hunter inside </v>

2725
02:05:31.761 --> 02:05:33.800
<v Speaker 3>and out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you take that instinct away and they</v>

2726
02:05:33.801 --> 02:05:35.560
<v Speaker 3>get the meat thrown at them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2727
02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:38.270
<v Speaker 3>sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinda just eat the meat off the tray.</v>

2728
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:40.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like a vegan cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2729
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:45.263
<v Speaker 3>Did you bother looking it up by looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and they're all skinny and shit like </v>

2730
02:05:48.621 --> 02:05:51.020
<v Speaker 3>just laying down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are fat as fuck.</v>

2731
02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:51.943
<v Speaker 3>All they eat is carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's the problem and down </v>

2732
02:05:55.100 --> 02:06:00.100
<v Speaker 3>fucking bloated kidney failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know eyes are gray and dull.</v>

2733
02:06:01.670 --> 02:06:02.503
<v Speaker 3>A model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be the problem with the vegan </v>

2734
02:06:06.381 --> 02:06:06.891
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2735
02:06:06.891 --> 02:06:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Is you're eating macaroni and cheese and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2736
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go wrong,</v>

2737
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:11.683
<v Speaker 2>that's why the healthy people call it </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant based because they want it to be </v>

2738
02:06:15.261 --> 02:06:16.094
<v Speaker 2>plant based.</v>

2739
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Is this pasta all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2740
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to get a lot.</v>

2741
02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:22.520
<v Speaker 3>From what I understand that that plant </v>
<v Speaker 3>based protein,</v>

2742
02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:24.430
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2743
02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Well in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of protein,</v>

2744
02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:28.090
<v Speaker 2>there's some foods that are pretty rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>and protein.</v>

2745
02:06:28.091 --> 02:06:28.924
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is bio availability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that there's protein in </v>

2746
02:06:31.331 --> 02:06:32.164
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how much of that protein is </v>

2747
02:06:32.771 --> 02:06:36.850
<v Speaker 2>absorbed in comparison to like a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of beef protein.</v>

2748
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:40.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not as easily absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can definitely do it though.</v>

2749
02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.700
<v Speaker 2>You could definitely live a vegan life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be healthy.</v>

2750
02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:46.120
<v Speaker 2>You just have to really watch your p's </v>
<v Speaker 2>and q's.</v>

2751
02:06:46.121 --> 02:06:50.530
<v Speaker 2>You gotta really mind what you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take be 12 supplements.</v>

2752
02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:51.813
<v Speaker 2>You have to make sure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the correct amount of essential </v>

2753
02:06:53.261 --> 02:06:56.260
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids and there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can do it.</v>

2754
02:06:56.261 --> 02:06:58.480
<v Speaker 2>It can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as effective.</v>

2755
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:59.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as easy,</v>

2756
02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just meat and vegetables.</v>

2757
02:07:02.831 --> 02:07:05.080
<v Speaker 2>You eat meat and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got your bases covered,</v>

2758
02:07:05.590 --> 02:07:07.720
<v Speaker 2>but if you just decided to just going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be vegan,</v>

2759
02:07:07.721 --> 02:07:08.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>

2760
02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.131
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta,</v>

2761
02:07:09.131 --> 02:07:12.930
<v Speaker 2>make sure you have keen our hemp protein</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in.</v>

2762
02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:13.953
<v Speaker 2>There's like certain plants that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some amount of protein but they don't </v>

2763
02:07:17.171 --> 02:07:20.080
<v Speaker 2>have a complete amino acid profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky,</v>

2764
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:21.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people who want the people who </v>

2765
02:07:23.021 --> 02:07:24.520
<v Speaker 2>live it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live that vegan life.</v>

2766
02:07:24.521 --> 02:07:25.354
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want you to think that that's the </v>

2767
02:07:25.721 --> 02:07:27.340
<v Speaker 2>only way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

2768
02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:29.770
<v Speaker 2>You don't live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be sick and you're going</v>

2769
02:07:29.771 --> 02:07:30.604
<v Speaker 2>to be unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my favorite thing is when one of </v>

2770
02:07:31.961 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>those motherfuckers jumped ship living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've singing the praises</v>

2771
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.940
<v Speaker 1>of vegan this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who lasted six months,</v>

2772
02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:42.730
<v Speaker 1>lasted six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and during that time he was telling me,</v>

2773
02:07:42.731 --> 02:07:44.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethical thing to do,</v>

2774
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:45.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was a hypocrite if I </v>

2775
02:07:46.181 --> 02:07:49.780
<v Speaker 1>didn't eat vegan and then he ate vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started getting sick as fuck.</v>

2776
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>He got his blood lipids back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body falling apart.</v>

2777
02:07:52.811 --> 02:07:53.441
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

2778
02:07:53.441 --> 02:07:58.410
<v Speaker 1>you need some meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need some meat now.</v>

2779
02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:00.940
<v Speaker 1>He eats meat like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

2780
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Six months later I ran into him at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steakhouse.</v>

2781
02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Is he like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2782
02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:16.750
<v Speaker 1>listen that the diet is just a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2783
02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:17.613
<v Speaker 1>you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it if you decide it can be </v>

2784
02:08:20.471 --> 02:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a friend who was a.</v>

2785
02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a doctor who was in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle accident,</v>

2786
02:08:25.810 --> 02:08:26.643
<v Speaker 1>got really badly banged up and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegan at the time and his wife made him </v>

2787
02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.290
<v Speaker 1>eat a hamburger.</v>

2788
02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:34.000
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do me a favor.</v>

2789
02:08:34.001 --> 02:08:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to eat some meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't recovering because I kept</v>

2790
02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:39.220
<v Speaker 1>really struggling to get over these </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

2791
02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:42.100
<v Speaker 1>He ate a cheeseburger and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

2792
02:08:42.101 --> 02:08:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I was so overwhelmed with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to jump out of bed.</v>

2793
02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:48.580
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never was vegan again.</v>

2794
02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:51.160
<v Speaker 1>He goes after that one juicy </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger,</v>

2795
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:53.230
<v Speaker 1>he goes to eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt so good.</v>

2796
02:08:53.231 --> 02:08:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And the protein like my body was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying out for it.</v>

2797
02:08:56.530 --> 02:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you think is a good one?</v>

2798
02:08:58.731 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a real cheeseburger with </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

2799
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's is like prison style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheeseburger,</v>

2800
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.920
<v Speaker 1>juicy fat boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good,</v>

2801
02:09:06.930 --> 02:09:08.650
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and I'm pregnant,</v>

2802
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:10.413
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I found interesting when those </v>

2803
02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:14.620
<v Speaker 1>guys were on talking about it is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to eat salami.</v>

2804
02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I do like the process shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is like,</v>

2805
02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:19.300
<v Speaker 1>the processed meats are the no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that's what's going to give you.</v>

2806
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.133
<v Speaker 1>But cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you get a ton of vegetables to </v>

2807
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>offset the damage right in your colon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nitrites.</v>

2808
02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:28.870
<v Speaker 1>So I try to get the nitrite free </v>
<v Speaker 1>wholefoods shit.</v>

2809
02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that cool?</v>

2810
02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:30.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

2811
02:09:30.881 --> 02:09:31.714
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's organically grow organically </v>

2812
02:09:35.441 --> 02:09:40.441
<v Speaker 1>created chart shooter charcuterie </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned this word chart chart,</v>

2813
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:42.500
<v Speaker 1>charcuterie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>charcuterie.</v>

2814
02:09:42.501 --> 02:09:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It's basically salami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortadella,</v>

2815
02:09:45.101 --> 02:09:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

2816
02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:47.860
<v Speaker 1>there's companies that make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>organically,</v>

2817
02:09:47.861 --> 02:09:50.860
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't last very long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any preservatives in it.</v>

2818
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Like that's really what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what gives you the.</v>

2819
02:09:52.991 --> 02:09:53.824
<v Speaker 1>But cancer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that the real problem with all </v>

2820
02:09:56.231 --> 02:09:57.064
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these assumptions is that these are </v>

2821
02:09:58.691 --> 02:10:02.920
<v Speaker 1>correlations based on mostly based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people filling out questionnaires.</v>

2822
02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:04.233
<v Speaker 1>That was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much do you recall what you ate </v>

2823
02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.650
<v Speaker 1>yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Accurately.</v>

2824
02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:10.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2825
02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:11.693
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people tend to make themselves look </v>

2826
02:10:13.931 --> 02:10:14.764
<v Speaker 1>like the better than they actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of lie because they feel bad </v>

2827
02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:19.294
<v Speaker 1>about being a fucking gluttonous slobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask my trainer because that lady I </v>

2828
02:10:25.721 --> 02:10:26.554
<v Speaker 1>do pilates with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she put me on this primal diet and </v>

2829
02:10:28.421 --> 02:10:30.730
<v Speaker 1>that's my last baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait the first time I was like,</v>

2830
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>how many of your clients just stay fat</v>

2831
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.813
<v Speaker 3>for years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you ask them what they eat and </v>

2832
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:37.610
<v Speaker 3>they just lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she's like,</v>

2833
02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.473
<v Speaker 3>oh that's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't really have an </v>

2834
02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:41.930
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2835
02:10:41.931 --> 02:10:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Like you think you're doing one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is completely different.</v>

2836
02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:45.740
<v Speaker 3>It's hard</v>

2837
02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:49.450
<v Speaker 2>for women when they get real big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what your body wants to keep on</v>

2838
02:10:49.460 --> 02:10:50.293
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking wait is that your body is not </v>

2839
02:10:52.101 --> 02:10:54.390
<v Speaker 2>want to let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier for a man to lose weight.</v>

2840
02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.273
<v Speaker 2>Definitely believe that more muscular </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body has more caloric requirements </v>

2841
02:11:00.441 --> 02:11:02.390
<v Speaker 2>because there's all this muscle burn up </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>

2842
02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>And then if you do lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2843
02:11:04.731 --> 02:11:06.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody who wants to get lean,</v>

2844
02:11:06.591 --> 02:11:09.530
<v Speaker 2>I always recommend you got to lift some </v>
<v Speaker 2>weights because if you lift weights,</v>

2845
02:11:09.531 --> 02:11:10.364
<v Speaker 2>your body is burning more fat because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's adding more muscle so it's burning </v>

2846
02:11:13.401 --> 02:11:14.234
<v Speaker 2>more calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you eat the same amount of food but </v>

2847
02:11:16.011 --> 02:11:16.844
<v Speaker 2>you just lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose body fat and the </v>

2848
02:11:18.891 --> 02:11:19.724
<v Speaker 2>reason is because your body's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build up muscle tissue and that muscle </v>

2849
02:11:22.131 --> 02:11:24.080
<v Speaker 2>tissue is gonna have a caloric </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement.</v>

2850
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:24.933
<v Speaker 2>NoT that those calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you eat the exact same amount of </v>

2851
02:11:26.661 --> 02:11:29.090
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're eating,</v>

2852
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you're eating all this food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lifting weights,</v>

2853
02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.480
<v Speaker 2>your body is going to get leaner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're consistent,</v>

2854
02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:38.270
<v Speaker 2>you stay consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And continue lifting weights.</v>

2855
02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.510
<v Speaker 3>You can eat like a fat ass and still</v>

2856
02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.160
<v Speaker 2>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying if you,</v>

2857
02:11:42.161 --> 02:11:44.890
<v Speaker 2>if you are on a diet like a sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

2858
02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.710
<v Speaker 2>like eat a normal amount of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you lift weights,</v>

2859
02:11:48.250 --> 02:11:50.410
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights is a great way to lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

2860
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:51.303
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to lose body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't necessarily lose weight </v>

2861
02:11:53.381 --> 02:11:57.640
<v Speaker 2>because you'll put on muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your body will burn off more fat.</v>

2862
02:11:57.670 --> 02:12:00.070
<v Speaker 2>particularly if you're a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's easier to put on weight,</v>

2863
02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>muscle weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fuckin a man.</v>

2864
02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:07.690
<v Speaker 2>This fucking does this thing that we did</v>
<v Speaker 2>this month.</v>

2865
02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:09.610
<v Speaker 2>One thing that it did teach me is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

2866
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:11.530
<v Speaker 2>you can do a lot more than you think you</v>

<v Speaker 2>well there's a lot of things for sure.</v>

2894
02:13:16.050 --> 02:13:16.883
<v Speaker 2>He is overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes it far more difficult to </v>

2895
02:13:19.381 --> 02:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>keep up that amount of cardio because </v>
<v Speaker 2>your joints are going to hurt and you're</v>

2896
02:13:22.621 --> 02:13:24.060
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2897
02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You knoW what I mean?</v>

2899
02:13:27.421 --> 02:13:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I think he lost some weight during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>

2900
02:13:30.391 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 2>but he was two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

2901
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:33.600
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he,</v>

2902
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:37.500
<v Speaker 1>when he did it and he got down to 2:16</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the weight loss challenge,</v>

2903
02:13:37.570 --> 02:13:41.700
<v Speaker 1>right to 19 tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to 16,</v>

2904
02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:44.220
<v Speaker 1>so that's a significant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

2905
02:13:44.221 --> 02:13:48.840
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a good solid 20 plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>

2906
02:13:48.841 --> 02:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>30 pounds of weight that he put on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2907

<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fat.</v>

2908
02:13:55.060 --> 02:14:00.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just the stakes of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at what a pound of fat is,</v>

2909
02:14:00.841 --> 02:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>because I've had to lose weight from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second pregnancy.</v>

02:17:19.510 --> 02:17:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's a small glass of wine or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular sized glass of wine,</v>

2983
02:17:22.751 --> 02:17:24.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not that bad.</v>

2984
02:17:24.191 --> 02:17:27.220
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 10 calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can keep yourself to one glass</v>

2985
02:17:27.221 --> 02:17:28.600
<v Speaker 1>of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

2986
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a big no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2987
02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:32.170
<v Speaker 1>but you're doing the whole bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2988
02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:34.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were drinking a case of it,</v>

2989
02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:37.180
<v Speaker 1>if they're backing up one of those oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks to your house,</v>

2990
02:17:37.850 --> 02:17:40.780
<v Speaker 1>just sucking on that dick of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

2991
02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:45.540
<v Speaker 1>All that wind dick jews coming down your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat phase.</v>

2992
02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Especially if I do pilates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where like 300 calories,</v>

2993
02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:53.950
<v Speaker 1>that's all for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

2994
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:57.670
<v Speaker 1>you can drink that shit up and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean?</v>

2995
02:17:57.760 --> 02:17:59.390
<v Speaker 1>One of the workouts that we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2996
02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:02.800
<v Speaker 1>because I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided about,</v>

2997
02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:04.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess close to two weeks out that I </v>

2998
02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:06.844
<v Speaker 1>was going to start really pressure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys and just doing workouts to </v>

2999
02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 1>like five hour workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing shit.</v>

3000
02:18:13.001 --> 02:18:14.140
<v Speaker 1>That's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3001
02:18:14.141 --> 02:18:16.360
<v Speaker 1>let's see wheRe we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how far we go.</v>

3002
02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:19.660
<v Speaker 1>One workout I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I burned 4,700</v>

3003
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:21.190
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bananas.</v>

3004
02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was eating boxes of graham crackers or</v>

3005
02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:28.720
<v Speaker 1>animal crackers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ate a whole box of animal crackers.</v>

3006
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank a a cream soda,</v>

3007
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:33.940
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want sugar.</v>

3008
02:18:33.941 --> 02:18:34.960
<v Speaker 1>While I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3009
02:18:34.961 --> 02:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm so taxed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna.</v>

3010
02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:38.261
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3011
02:18:38.261 --> 02:18:39.094
<v Speaker 1>I need some sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just ate these animal crackers and </v>

3012
02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:44.050
<v Speaker 1>drank soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got right back on.</v>

3013
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:48.140
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3014
02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:48.973
<v Speaker 1>puppet master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kept thinking about getting </v>

3015
02:18:50.841 --> 02:18:54.470
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's he going to serve man?</v>

3016
02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So waIt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you guys going?</v>

3017
02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:56.953
<v Speaker 1>Where are you guys going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we would have to do it in like </v>

3018
02:19:01.221 --> 02:19:05.240
<v Speaker 1>malibu or santa monica or wherever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could serve.</v>

3019
02:19:05.710 --> 02:19:06.543
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we would have to figure out a way </v>

3020
02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:11.240
<v Speaker 1>that the app registers how much time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're standing on the board.</v>

3021
02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:16.900
<v Speaker 1>So like you would have to be how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're actually surfing,</v>

3022
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:20.410
<v Speaker 1>not just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get on with believe.</v>

3023
02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:22.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3024
02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:23.930
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be standing.</v>

3025
02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Standing on the surf board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out a way.</v>

3026
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>did you say was some sort of an app?</v>

3027
02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.153
<v Speaker 3>There's something that I passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out what it's </v>

3028
02:19:31.041 --> 02:19:33.140
<v Speaker 3>tracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tracking like the board's movement.</v>

3029
02:19:33.141 --> 02:19:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing side decide stuff,</v>

3030
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:39.500
<v Speaker 3>it knows that you're probably up and is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

3031
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:41.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're lying on your stomach,</v>

3032
02:19:41.061 --> 02:19:43.340
<v Speaker 3>just paddling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a slob.</v>

3033
02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:47.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it would tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell you how hard that shit is though.</v>

3034
02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:48.320
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tell you what the hardest,</v>

3035
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:50.960
<v Speaker 3>at least from when I learned how to surf</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decade ago,</v>

3036
02:19:50.961 --> 02:19:54.500
<v Speaker 3>the hardest part is paddling out on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bored.</v>

3037
02:19:54.530 --> 02:19:55.221
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3038
02:19:55.221 --> 02:19:57.590
<v Speaker 3>you're going against the current,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right against the waves,</v>

3039
02:19:57.980 --> 02:19:58.641
<v Speaker 3>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang,</v>

3040
02:19:58.641 --> 02:20:00.200
<v Speaker 3>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TuRned that board around.</v>

3041
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:02.720
<v Speaker 3>You finally see the wave coming and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to paddle,</v>

3042
02:20:02.721 --> 02:20:03.291
<v Speaker 3>paddle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paddle,</v>

3043
02:20:03.291 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>and then the pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right,</v>

3044
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:09.020
<v Speaker 3>you're on your belly and you got a pop </v>
<v Speaker 3>up from your belly to standing like this</v>

3045
02:20:09.021 --> 02:20:10.460
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to go fast.</v>

3046
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.473
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me that was an and the board's </v>

3047
02:20:12.621 --> 02:20:13.454
<v Speaker 3>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least if you're learning on a banana </v>

3048
02:20:14.451 --> 02:20:15.680
<v Speaker 3>board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like When it was big ones,</v>

3049
02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:16.933
<v Speaker 3>you're probably not going to start on </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the one that fucking what's his </v>

3050
02:20:19.851 --> 02:20:22.560

<v Speaker 3>You're going to learn on a big clunky </v>
<v Speaker 3>banana board.</v>

3053
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:29.773
<v Speaker 3>Probably heavy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if that thing hits you on the </v>

3054
02:20:31.971 --> 02:20:33.700
<v Speaker 3>head because you're.</v>

3062

<v Speaker 1>We're just joking around about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always thought like my first couple of </v>

3096
02:22:30.661 --> 02:22:32.340
<v Speaker 1>workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an hour,</v>

3097
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.010
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 points.</v>

3098
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.983
<v Speaker 1>But then our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he figured out that you could watch a </v>

3099
02:22:39.091 --> 02:22:39.924
<v Speaker 1>movie and be on the elliptical machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got 479 points one day and </v>

3100
02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:46.320
<v Speaker 1>wrecked his body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could barely walk the next day.</v>

3101
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:48.690
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he did that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

3102
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:51.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized like we talked about</v>

3103
02:22:51.661 --> 02:22:51.981
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3104
02:22:51.981 --> 02:22:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the same amount of points for 80</v>

3105
02:22:53.941 --> 02:22:56.550
<v Speaker 1>percent of your max heart rate as you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 90.</v>

3106
02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:00.240
<v Speaker 1>So I kept trying to go as hard as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you would get more points,</v>

3107
02:23:00.390 --> 02:23:02.720
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get more points for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no path.</v>

3108
02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slow and steady wins the race,</v>

3109
02:23:05.821 --> 02:23:06.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3110
02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Which that's not how I work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

3111
02:23:09.631 --> 02:23:11.100
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to Do?</v>

3112
02:23:11.490 --> 02:23:16.490
<v Speaker 1>So time on the board time standing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the board over a month.</v>

3113
02:23:18.470 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hard.</v>

3114
02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.620
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be hard and no,</v>

3115
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:27.621
<v Speaker 1>none of us know how to surf at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to have like do like a</v>

3167
02:25:50.681 --> 02:25:51.514
<v Speaker 1>You go down there and there's that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to learn surf etiquette for </v>

3168
02:25:55.001 --> 02:25:58.960
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they listened to the gre,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's annoying.</v>

3177
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 1>They were joking around about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3180
02:26:17.561 --> 02:26:20.410
<v Speaker 1>people hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's bad because I honestly see more</v>

3181
02:26:20.411 --> 02:26:21.244
<v Speaker 1>people hunting and I really think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of you and because of cameron </v>

3182
02:26:24.581 --> 02:26:25.414
<v Speaker 1>hanes and steve rinella and John Dudley </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these hunters that are </v>

3183
02:26:28.271 --> 02:26:29.104
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool people that more people are trying </v>

3184
02:26:30.491 --> 02:26:31.000

<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

3186
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm going to do.</v>

3187
02:26:35.470 --> 02:26:36.303
<v Speaker 1>It's like when taco bell chihuahua for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ellie's fucking douche bags are buying </v>

3188
02:26:41.741 --> 02:26:42.574
<v Speaker 1>chihuahuas for their kids for christmas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd throw them into the </v>

3189
02:26:46.181 --> 02:26:47.970
<v Speaker 1>pounds or whatever because they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of them.</v>

3190
02:26:47.971 --> 02:26:48.804
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens every time there's a </v>

3191
02:26:50.021 --> 02:26:51.580
<v Speaker 1>talking dog moving.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then that popular breed [inaudible].</v>

3193
02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gets it and they don't like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breed and then stopped talking to him.</v>

3194
02:27:03.570 --> 02:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you.</v>

3195
02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:10.260

<v Speaker 1>meanwhile a chihuahua for the most part,</v>

3196
02:27:10.871 --> 02:27:12.580
<v Speaker 1>from the ones I've known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperament,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're very nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High strung,</v>

3198
02:27:15.791 --> 02:27:18.880
<v Speaker 1>high energy dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very skittish.</v>

3199
02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Not not the ideal family pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your bones were made a toothpicks and</v>

3200
02:27:24.581 --> 02:27:28.980
<v Speaker 1>you're around a bunch of fucking clumsy </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids like kids are always stepping on,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3222
02:28:37.461 --> 02:28:38.294
<v Speaker 1>The dalmatians are dying or they're dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a dare damaged while his german </v>

3223
02:28:41.691 --> 02:28:45.200
<v Speaker 1>shepherds are super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a highly trainable dog.</v>

3224
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They're also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sizing you up.</v>

3225
02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Like when a german shepherd looks at </v>

<v Speaker 1>what would happen if I bit you?</v>

3234
02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:21.530
<v Speaker 1>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wind fire departments have dalmatians.</v>

3235
02:29:21.531 --> 02:29:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Dalmatians and horses are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatible.</v>

3236
02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:24.493
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dogs were easily trained to run </v>

3237
02:29:26.121 --> 02:29:26.954
<v Speaker 1>in front of the engines to help clear a </v>
<v Speaker 1>path and guide the horses in the </v>

3238
02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:32.570
<v Speaker 1>firefighters to fire as quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still chosen by mary,</v>

3239
02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:36.410
<v Speaker 1>many firefighters as pets in honor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their heroism in the past.</v>

3240
02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking heroic dogs.</v>

3241
02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:44.540
<v Speaker 1>You asshole calling them stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst human being ever.</v>

3242
02:29:44.541 --> 02:29:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm always the person like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3243
02:29:46.161 --> 02:29:47.060
<v Speaker 1>they're crippled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:48.140
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3245
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:53.200
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking stupid brain come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is they're all dumb shit.</v>

3246
02:29:53.690 --> 02:29:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Worst person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3247
02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:57.073
<v Speaker 1>their deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are genetic predisposition for </v>

3248
02:29:59.511 --> 02:30:02.030
<v Speaker 1>deafness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious problem for dalmatians.</v>

3249
02:30:02.031 --> 02:30:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Only about 70 percent of them have </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal hearing.</v>

3250
02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Depthness was not recognized by early </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeder.</v>

3251
02:30:07.911 --> 02:30:10.160
<v Speaker 1>So the breed was thought to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unintelligent.</v>

3252
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Crazy thoughts and shit.</v>

3254
02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:19.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you're going to have a </v>

3255
02:30:20.331 --> 02:30:21.440
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a german shepherd,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you got to be around that fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

3260
02:30:31.791 --> 02:30:32.624
<v Speaker 1>My dad got one from the past when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid and he didn't put in the time and </v>

3261
02:30:35.601 --> 02:30:39.710
<v Speaker 1>that dog tore everything apart and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bored out of its mind.</v>

3262
02:30:39.711 --> 02:30:42.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't take a smart fucking dog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just throw it in the backyard.</v>

3263
02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:46.460
<v Speaker 1>That's when they get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They jump out and they escape.</v>

3264
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My rock wild.</v>

3272
02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:17.473
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I adopted our first dog and there was a </v>

3273
02:31:19.711 --> 02:31:20.190

<v Speaker 3>and I remember the lady behind the </v>

3275
02:31:23.581 --> 02:31:24.690
<v Speaker 3>counter saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well sir,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

3277
02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:25.873
<v Speaker 3>You know that these dogs are highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent and they require hours and </v>

3278
02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:30.360
<v Speaker 3>hours of training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to do that.</v>

3279
02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's it for that though.</v>

3286
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3289
02:31:50.370 --> 02:31:53.580
<v Speaker 3>like my dog becomes a different person </v>
<v Speaker 3>or different thing.</v>

3290
02:31:53.581 --> 02:31:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I take him running for purse,</v>

3291
02:31:55.650 --> 02:31:58.140
<v Speaker 3>he gets so excited when he runs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3292
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:59.280
<v Speaker 3>he runs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

3293
02:31:59.430 --> 02:32:03.240

<v Speaker 3>He runs around.</v>

3298
02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.940
<v Speaker 3>but then when the end of the day comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3299
02:32:11.941 --> 02:32:13.790
<v Speaker 3>an hour and a half later when we're done</v>
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>

3300
02:32:13.810 --> 02:32:14.643
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's just chIll the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fairly jumped in the truck.</v>

3302
02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:21.390
<v Speaker 3>He puts his paws up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to help them?</v>

3303
02:32:21.391 --> 02:32:26.391
<v Speaker 3>Some dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we do a mile,</v>

3304
02:32:26.521 --> 02:32:28.290
<v Speaker 3>he jumps in easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do two miles.</v>

3305
02:32:28.291 --> 02:32:30.810
<v Speaker 3>It gets a little sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two miles in the hills.</v>

3306
02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Hills make two miles a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard time to get back in.</v>

3307
02:32:36.691 --> 02:32:37.830
<v Speaker 3>That truck is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on dude.</v>

3308
02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:41.760
<v Speaker 3>You know you can pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put my paws up here.</v>

3309
02:32:41.761 --> 02:32:45.210
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you sleep with them?</v>

3310
02:32:45.370 --> 02:32:46.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3311
02:32:46.420 --> 02:32:47.870
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's crate trained or what?</v>

3312
02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:48.713
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just sleeps outside the door of the </v>

3313
02:32:50.641 --> 02:32:51.120
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

3314
02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean not outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>

3315
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:56.040
<v Speaker 3>outside the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bedroom in the hallway.</v>

3316
02:32:56.190 --> 02:32:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3317
02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:59.190
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like beds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's weird.</v>

3318
02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:00.353
<v Speaker 3>I got him a bunch of dog beds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just throws his toys in that and </v>

3319
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:03.290
<v Speaker 3>sleeps on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3320
02:33:03.300 --> 02:33:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I actually had a dog trainer tell me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the dogs don't need the beds.</v>

3321
02:33:07.470 --> 02:33:10.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a convenient thing to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3322
02:33:10.021 --> 02:33:10.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

3324
02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:15.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck about the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's you.</v>

3325
02:33:15.081 --> 02:33:18.660
<v Speaker 3>And you're definitely true with my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't use them.</v>

3326
02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:19.733
<v Speaker 3>I had beds like in three different spots</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the house and he would never choose </v>

3327
02:33:24.841 --> 02:33:25.560
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3331
02:33:29.161 --> 02:33:30.660

<v Speaker 3>and he'd step on the bed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this stupid thing?</v>

3333
02:33:32.050 --> 02:33:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Or they would climb off the bed and lie </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

3334
02:33:34.260 --> 02:33:36.030
<v Speaker 3>lie down on the wood floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3335
02:33:36.031 --> 02:33:36.864
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that documentary about that </v>

3336
02:33:37.891 --> 02:33:42.210
<v Speaker 3>guy that got out of North Korea and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp and then they gave him an apartment</v>

3337
02:33:42.211 --> 02:33:44.140
<v Speaker 3>and they gave him a bed and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no thanks.</v>

3338
02:33:44.141 --> 02:33:46.170
<v Speaker 3>And he would just sleep on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3339
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some documentary I forget,</v>

3340
02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but he was in a camp in North Korea and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they finally,</v>

3341
02:33:51.090 --> 02:33:53.910
<v Speaker 3>they got them to soul and they're like,</v>

3344
02:33:58.080 --> 02:33:58.913

<v Speaker 3>And he would lay on the floor and sleep </v>

3345
02:34:00.571 --> 02:34:03.450
<v Speaker 3>because he was so used to being in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison essentially,</v>

3346
02:34:04.170 --> 02:34:06.210
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting how the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3347
02:34:06.211 --> 02:34:09.120
<v Speaker 3>When you're traumatized in that way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

3348
02:34:09.150 --> 02:34:13.140

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different ways to be</v>

<v Speaker 2>have gone through war.</v>

3360
02:34:47.610 --> 02:34:48.443

3406
02:36:41.221 --> 02:36:43.970

3436
02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>which is really fascinating.</v>

3437
02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Their bias towards the left and against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right is so.</v>

3438
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

3439
02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:21.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they didn't think that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a problem to make fun of a war </v>

3440
02:38:25.311 --> 02:38:26.144
<v Speaker 1>veteran who lost his eye in combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the man in front of them was </v>

3441
02:38:29.991 --> 02:38:34.991
<v Speaker 1>blown up by an ied torres face apart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined one of his eyes and he handled it</v>

3442
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:40.640
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that he.</v>

3443
02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:41.713
<v Speaker 1>He said something about he works hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to offend an even harder to not be </v>

3444
02:38:45.561 --> 02:38:47.920
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

3445
02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:48.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also said that he really didn't </v>

3446
02:38:50.481 --> 02:38:55.290
<v Speaker 1>think it was a good idea to make jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone who said something.</v>

3447
02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3448
02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:00.260
<v Speaker 1>who was disfigured in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in combat.</v>

3449
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:01.383
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which that seems to be a pretty fair </v>

3450
02:39:02.901 --> 02:39:03.910
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3451
02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3452
02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:07.443
<v Speaker 1>it's not unreasonable and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 1>handled it as good as you can handle it </v>

3453
02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:13.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national television,</v>

3454
02:39:13.191 --> 02:39:15.350
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing and joking about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>having one.</v>

3455
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:16.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you lost your eye in the service </v>

3456
02:39:18.621 --> 02:39:22.540
<v Speaker 1>of the country and an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing that only the people who</v>

3457
02:39:22.541 --> 02:39:23.374
<v Speaker 1>have done it really truly understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's this young kid was bleached </v>

3458
02:39:27.111 --> 02:39:27.944
<v Speaker 1>hair laughing with you only having one </v>
<v Speaker 1>eye and he's doing it on a national </v>

3459
02:39:32.391 --> 02:39:33.224
<v Speaker 1>comedy show and people are laughing </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with them because you're a </v>

3460
02:39:35.951 --> 02:39:37.580
<v Speaker 1>republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3461
02:39:37.581 --> 02:39:39.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's the interesting point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is a republican,</v>

3462
02:39:39.861 --> 02:39:42.740
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

3463
02:39:42.741 --> 02:39:45.260
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

3464
02:39:45.870 --> 02:39:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3465
02:39:48.350 --> 02:39:49.183
<v Speaker 1>But the guy handled it well and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably actually probably won them the </v>

3466
02:39:51.561 --> 02:39:53.780
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably how that shit goes.</v>

3467
02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People going to find out About it.</v>

3468
02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:56.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make fun of the guy because you </v>

3469
02:39:57.831 --> 02:40:00.330
<v Speaker 1>think it's funny and then you're giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>them all this press.</v>

3470
02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.390
<v Speaker 1>He handles it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people are like,</v>

3471
02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:03.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a navy seal.</v>

3472
02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:04.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3473
02:40:04.641 --> 02:40:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I like what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to him talk.</v>

3474
02:40:06.450 --> 02:40:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>

3475
02:40:08.121 --> 02:40:10.020
<v Speaker 1>he wins now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So valiant.</v>

3476
02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wished mccain had a better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better rap.</v>

3477
02:40:13.250 --> 02:40:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Really fucked up that sarah palin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a ding dong.</v>

3478
02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:19.960
<v Speaker 1>That was preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man and I,</v>

3479
02:40:19.961 --> 02:40:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see a woman in the white</v>
<v Speaker 1>house that was not.</v>

3480
02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3481
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:26.260
<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was real.</v>

3482

<v Speaker 1>I'd take 10 hillary clinton for take one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want hillary clinton to win.</v>

3483
02:40:31.231 --> 02:40:32.064
<v Speaker 1>I think she's ridiculously awful too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people really disliked </v>

3484
02:40:35.731 --> 02:40:37.800
<v Speaker 1>hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really disliked her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's completely full of shit.</v>

3487
02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:46.260
<v Speaker 1>She didn'T like gay marriage until 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't.</v>

3488
02:40:46.261 --> 02:40:49.500
<v Speaker 1>She didn't agree with gay marriage until</v>
<v Speaker 1>2013.</v>

3489
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you a dinosaur?</v>

<v Speaker 1>She didn't care.</v>

3493
02:40:58.710 --> 02:41:02.940
<v Speaker 1>She just was doing what she thought was </v>
<v Speaker 1>support her position politically.</v>

3494
02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:04.073
<v Speaker 1>She was leaning right when obama was </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning more left and she was trying to </v>

3495
02:41:07.711 --> 02:41:08.544
<v Speaker 1>center herself as a or position herself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a a wiser choice for people who were </v>

3496
02:41:14.470 --> 02:41:15.303
<v Speaker 1>unhappy with the choices on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>but really unhappy with obama and then </v>

3497
02:41:20.610 --> 02:41:21.990
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a better option.</v>

3498
02:41:21.991 --> 02:41:22.824
<v Speaker 1>She's more sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a little more hawkish with a more </v>

3499
02:41:24.901 --> 02:41:25.734
<v Speaker 1>prone to go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more pro military or at least </v>

02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:01.663
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially</v>

3550
02:44:01.710 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 3>bribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3551
02:44:03.310 --> 02:44:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all it is.</v>

3552
02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Those people aren't pumped to see her </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

3553
02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:09.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of these people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit.</v>

3554
02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:10.113
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3555
02:44:11.250 --> 02:44:13.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done a lot of those paid speeches,</v>

3556
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:16.380
<v Speaker 2>but they get hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars to talk,</v>

3557
02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:17.490
<v Speaker 3>but I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3558
02:44:17.491 --> 02:44:18.930
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fucking get into it,</v>

3559
02:44:18.931 --> 02:44:19.764
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that why people love trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's outside of the whole </v>

3560
02:44:22.410 --> 02:44:23.670
<v Speaker 3>system?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theoretically,</v>

3561
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.903
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the part.</v>

3562
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it goes.</v>

3563
02:44:27.350 --> 02:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's say end of an era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The clinton global initiative shut</v>

3564
02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:35.330
<v Speaker 3>just part of the error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>End of an error,</v>

3565
02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:39.920
<v Speaker 3>not an error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>E r,</v>

3566
02:44:39.921 --> 02:44:40.880
<v Speaker 3>r o r,</v>

3567
02:44:42.310 --> 02:44:44.530
<v Speaker 2>when they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a.</v>

3568
02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:47.170
<v Speaker 2>There was an interview where they asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>him about monica lewinsky like,</v>

3569
02:44:47.171 --> 02:44:48.400
<v Speaker 2>do you owe her an apology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT's like,</v>

3570
02:44:48.401 --> 02:44:49.234
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who thinks so I got out of that </v>

3571
02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:52.690
<v Speaker 2>clean is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3572
02:44:52.691 --> 02:44:55.690
<v Speaker 2>the I call it cost me millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>

3573
02:44:55.691 --> 02:44:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I left the white house in debt and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden that's not when anybody asks</v>

3574
02:44:59.051 --> 02:45:00.640

<v Speaker 2>you fucking sociopath.</v>

3575
02:45:01.700 --> 02:45:02.533
<v Speaker 2>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thinks she deserves an apology </v>

3576
02:45:04.421 --> 02:45:05.170
<v Speaker 2>because he never spoke</v>

3577
02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:06.003
<v Speaker 3>to of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and meanwhile she was one of the first </v>

3578
02:45:08.681 --> 02:45:12.370
<v Speaker 3>people to be publicly shamed for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something of this nature.</v>

3579
02:45:12.371 --> 02:45:13.204
<v Speaker 3>This was a huge scandal and this is back</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the 24 hour news cycle really </v>

<v Speaker 3>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was that?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to tell everybody?</v>

3623
02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jack,</v>

3624
02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:23.290

<v Speaker 3>she was bobbing,</v>

3625
02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:24.380
<v Speaker 3>but she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3626
02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:28.100
<v Speaker 3>well at least from what I've heard read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe bipolar.</v>

3627
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she came from a lot of trauma,</v>

3628
02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:31.693
<v Speaker 3>severely abused as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got the orphanage really making shit </v>

3629
02:47:38.301 --> 02:47:39.134
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3630
02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:40.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was.</v>

3631
02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 3>She was pretty bad childhood man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what I know.</v>

3632
02:47:45.070 --> 02:47:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actress.</v>

3633
02:47:46.530 --> 02:47:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exorbitant need for attention.</v>

3634
02:47:49.850 --> 02:47:50.683
<v Speaker 3>I'm converting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedians at least write their own </v>

3635
02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:56.550
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3636
02:47:56.890 --> 02:47:57.723
<v Speaker 3>The actors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like comedians with no punchlines but </v>

3637
02:48:00.171 --> 02:48:01.004
<v Speaker 3>here's but crazier because they always </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to get audition for stuff on a </v>

3638
02:48:04.100 --> 02:48:05.420
<v Speaker 3>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

3639
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:06.343
<v Speaker 3>here's what I do admire aBout actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they're more in touch with </v>

3640
02:48:10.161 --> 02:48:11.540
<v Speaker 3>their feelings than we are.</v>

3641
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Like that's accessing feeling like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking a real actors and shit.</v>

3642
02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

3643
02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:18.140
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least me,</v>

3644
02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:19.473
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like feeling things too much </v>

3645
02:48:21.471 --> 02:48:23.120
<v Speaker 3>healing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know what I'm saying?</v>

3646
02:48:23.121 --> 02:48:23.954
<v Speaker 3>I get very last hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets very itchy and when talking </v>

3647
02:48:27.801 --> 02:48:31.610
<v Speaker 3>about feeling like I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>RighT.</v>

3648
02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:32.993
<v Speaker 3>I admire that you can access feelings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in and show people feelings and </v>

3649
02:48:37.671 --> 02:48:38.450
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

3650
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

3651
02:48:39.441 --> 02:48:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

3652
02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:41.953
<v Speaker 3>but I think the fake feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the feelings they think </v>

3653
02:48:43.941 --> 02:48:45.860
<v Speaker 3>they should have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they just start crying.</v>

3654
02:48:46.430 --> 02:48:47.600
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be sad here.</v>

3655
02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I think they're sociopaths for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

3656
02:48:52.310 --> 02:48:53.143
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of actors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about the actors when </v>

3657
02:48:56.961 --> 02:49:00.350
<v Speaker 3>they're making a movie and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay in character the whole time?</v>

3658
02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the big associate sociopaths,</v>

3659
02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:04.380
<v Speaker 3>but the best actors to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3660
02:49:04.390 --> 02:49:07.470
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best.</v>

3661
02:49:07.471 --> 02:49:09.030

3666
02:49:20.491 --> 02:49:21.324
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stayed in character the whole time </v>

3667
02:49:22.381 --> 02:49:23.214
<v Speaker 3>and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he would annoy the shit out of </v>

3668
02:49:24.181 --> 02:49:27.240
<v Speaker 3>people the whole time and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and throw tantrums and stuff.</v>

3669
02:49:27.241 --> 02:49:28.050
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3670
02:49:28.050 --> 02:49:29.340
<v Speaker 3>That sounds fucking terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

3673
02:49:37.470 --> 02:49:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Other actors have broken that down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made fun of people who do that.</v>

3674
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love jim carey.</v>

3675
02:49:43.201 --> 02:49:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I think he's so talented and so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be really annoyed.</v>

3676
02:49:47.490 --> 02:49:48.323
<v Speaker 1>That would be annoying if you had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with them for six months and you </v>

3677
02:49:49.681 --> 02:49:51.080
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calvin.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Only annoying asshole.</v>

3679
02:49:53.090 --> 02:49:56.060
<v Speaker 3>And then do things like hold up </v>
<v Speaker 3>production and,</v>

3680
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:58.010
<v Speaker 3>and you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are union people.</v>

3681
02:49:58.011 --> 02:49:58.844
<v Speaker 3>These are dudes that are up at like four</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning putting sets up and </v>

3682
02:50:02.451 --> 02:50:03.284
<v Speaker 3>lighting and that guy and that guy has </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to wait for you because you're on </v>

3683
02:50:05.541 --> 02:50:07.880
<v Speaker 3>your trailer pretending to be somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

3684
02:50:09.290 --> 02:50:11.440
<v Speaker 3>You know whaT I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she would hold up produce that.</v>

3685
02:50:11.450 --> 02:50:12.430
<v Speaker 3>That to me is district.</v>

3686
02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:15.460
<v Speaker 1>What he really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this documentary is about.</v>

3687
02:50:15.610 --> 02:50:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he officially set it in </v>

3688
02:50:18.661 --> 02:50:19.494
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he wanted that whole part </v>

3689
02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:24.010
<v Speaker 1>because they were filming it to be part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the movie too.</v>

3690
02:50:24.011 --> 02:50:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And at some point they decided to not do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and make the movie.</v>

3691
02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3692
02:50:27.820 --> 02:50:30.520
<v Speaker 1>So you wanted it included in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also has an to say he,</v>

3693
02:50:30.521 --> 02:50:31.354
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerry lawler was really mad at him </v>

3694
02:50:32.650 --> 02:50:35.860
<v Speaker 1>because the rest of it was not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that according to him,</v>

3695
02:50:35.861 --> 02:50:37.710
<v Speaker 1>that was not the relationship they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3696
02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:38.830
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all a ruse.</v>

3697
02:50:38.831 --> 02:50:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It was like a wrestling type deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did worked it all out.</v>

3698
02:50:41.350 --> 02:50:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not how jim carrey was </v>

3699
02:50:42.911 --> 02:50:43.744
<v Speaker 1>acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just being addicted to them over </v>

3700
02:50:44.771 --> 02:50:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissing them off.</v>

3701
02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate.</v>

3702
02:50:48.390 --> 02:50:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even not specific to this one person.</v>

3703
02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:52.273
<v Speaker 1>I jusT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems absurd to me to pretend to </v>

3704
02:50:53.711 --> 02:50:54.544
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it and it works and that </v>

<v Speaker 1>were passing By broadway and all these </v>

3733
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:16.810
<v Speaker 1>old dead white people are stumbling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this theater.</v>

3734
02:52:16.811 --> 02:52:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Pretending they just enjoyed what </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

3735

<v Speaker 1>They just saw.</v>

<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3737
02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:31.690
<v Speaker 1>the way she saying about sucking his </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick when she was a prostitute,</v>

3738
02:52:31.700 --> 02:52:34.030
<v Speaker 1>he was a rich guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HamilTon.</v>

3739
02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:36.180
<v Speaker 1>The story of tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a song playing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>

3742
02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

3743
02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this supposed to be good?</v>

3744
02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3746
02:53:09.681 --> 02:53:11.740
<v Speaker 1>near your attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

3747
02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been to two musicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which now I've been to more.</v>

3748
02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been to more because I went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the book of mormon,</v>

3749
02:53:19.061 --> 02:53:21.970
<v Speaker 1>which is I guess technically a musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but awesome.</v>

3750
02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Like this book of mormon.</v>

03:00:04.681 --> 03:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>attention to it operations and what has </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped pay attention.</v>

3896
03:00:09.330 --> 03:00:10.163
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why podcasts are so great </v>

3897
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>because you could do whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want and you don't have a boss.</v>

3898
03:00:16.370 --> 03:00:19.260

<v Speaker 1>You could never.</v>

3901
03:00:23.431 --> 03:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>If you had a radio show and he tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play that,</v>

3902
03:00:25.291 --> 03:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>they'd pull you aside and go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

3927
03:01:22.721 --> 03:01:25.750
<v Speaker 2>because you don't seem invested in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

3928
03:01:25.751 --> 03:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3929
03:01:26.851 --> 03:01:27.684
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3930
03:01:29.681 --> 03:01:33.190
<v Speaker 2>fucking sucks that we're reading now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'm not invested.</v>

3931
03:01:33.191 --> 03:01:34.024
<v Speaker 2>It's just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want me to pretend that it's </v>

<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

3935
03:01:40.690 --> 03:01:41.231
<v Speaker 2>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3936
03:01:41.231 --> 03:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>you might get a script like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3937
03:01:42.731 --> 03:01:43.511
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's hope.</v>

3938
03:01:43.511 --> 03:01:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking comedian.</v>

3939
03:01:46.121 --> 03:01:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this for money.</v>

3940
03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:49.180
<v Speaker 2>They they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They offered me some money.</v>

3941
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I to tell him that drives him crazy when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find out that you're a comedian,</v>

3942
03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:54.910
<v Speaker 2>you don't even give a shit about acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3943
03:01:54.911 --> 03:01:55.744
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to give me some acting </v>

3944
03:01:56.111 --> 03:01:57.400
<v Speaker 2>gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it.</v>

3945
03:01:58.240 --> 03:01:59.110
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she would.</v>

3946
03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:02.170
<v Speaker 2>it was real weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really weird.</v>

3947
03:02:02.230 --> 03:02:04.720
<v Speaker 2>The acting world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coaching world is so weird,</v>

3948
03:02:04.721 --> 03:02:07.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's weird because the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are acting coaches,</v>

3949
03:02:07.690 --> 03:02:11.650
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them are failed actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't make it.</v>

3950
03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they made it,</v>

3951
03:02:12.641 --> 03:02:14.710
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be out there doing it.</v>

3952
03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:16.750
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to teach it for the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

3953
03:02:16.751 --> 03:02:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so I did a few liberal was gross.</v>

3954
03:02:21.550 --> 03:02:22.960
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I didn't have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

3955
03:02:22.961 --> 03:02:23.794
<v Speaker 2>I stopped doing it.</v>

3956
03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:26.653
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The classes are terrible and I did a </v>

3957
03:02:27.380 --> 03:02:31.540
<v Speaker 2>terrible sitcom for six episodes called </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardball on fox.</v>

3958
03:02:31.541 --> 03:02:32.374
<v Speaker 2>It was a baseball sitcom that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>canceled and then I got a development </v>

3959
03:02:35.501 --> 03:02:38.530
<v Speaker 2>deal and then I got cast on news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

3960
03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gone on to auditions ever.</v>

3961
03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:43.413
<v Speaker 2>One was for the hardball show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or news radio was the only two </v>

3962
03:02:45.911 --> 03:02:48.440
<v Speaker 2>auditions had ever been on for sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3963
03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:50.960
<v Speaker 2>it was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3964
03:02:52.290 --> 03:02:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're working with what andy </v>
<v Speaker 2>deck was on that show.</v>

3965

<v Speaker 2>More tiernan.</v>

3968

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3969
03:03:01.930 --> 03:03:02.763
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awesome.</v>

3970
03:03:02.860 --> 03:03:07.860
<v Speaker 2>The cast was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like in terms of sitcoms,</v>

3971
03:03:08.891 --> 03:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>it was like a best case scenario for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom.</v>

3972
03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3973
03:03:14.940 --> 03:03:18.040
<v Speaker 2>the writing in terms of like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where you're.</v>

3974
03:03:18.410 --> 03:03:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was on there with phil </v>
<v Speaker 2>hartman,</v>

3975
03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:21.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like 26 years old and I'm 27 </v>

3976
03:03:23.561 --> 03:03:24.394
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm working with phil hartman and </v>

3977
03:03:25.451 --> 03:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm next to this guy.</v>

3978
03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:28.433
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm seeing you on tv and movies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the sudden we're in the same room </v>

3979
03:03:30.611 --> 03:03:34.060
<v Speaker 2>and we're doing a scene together so this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so and then become his friend.</v>

3980
03:03:34.061 --> 03:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>It was so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is surreal.</v>

3981
03:03:37.690 --> 03:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>It was so surreal for someone with zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>intent on ever acting.</v>

3982
03:03:42.610 --> 03:03:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden I'm acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3983
03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3984
03:03:47.170 --> 03:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess some acting like that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was part of it though,</v>

3985
03:03:51.070 --> 03:03:51.903
<v Speaker 2>was one of the reasons why I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful at auditions and stuff like </v>

3986
03:03:54.011 --> 03:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>that because I'd never planned on being </v>
<v Speaker 2>an actor.</v>

3987
03:03:56.990 --> 03:03:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Didn't care</v>

3988
03:03:58.250 --> 03:04:01.070
<v Speaker 1>as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My world doesn't everything.</v>

3989
03:04:01.071 --> 03:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>To me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this would be cool.</v>

3990
03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make some money here.</v>

3991
03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the whole thing.</v>

3992
03:04:06.021 --> 03:04:07.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like I didn't want to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>

3993
03:04:07.551 --> 03:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Like what made more money doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

3994
03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:12.020
<v Speaker 1>how much can I make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would literally ask like,</v>

3995
03:04:12.021 --> 03:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>whenever something would come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much does this pay?</v>

3996
03:04:14.690 --> 03:04:15.523
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much can I get if I do this thing </v>

3997
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that's always thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile was stand up,</v>

3998
03:04:20.061 --> 03:04:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you were doing what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3999
03:04:21.740 --> 03:04:26.300
<v Speaker 1>$300 a weeks for how many years just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to do it just to,</v>

4000
03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:27.193
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get worried about money coming </v>

4001
03:04:30.651 --> 03:04:31.041
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4002
03:04:31.041 --> 03:04:31.874
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't get booked for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks you don't have any </v>

4003
03:04:33.321 --> 03:04:35.390
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn'T save any money.</v>

4004
03:04:35.391 --> 03:04:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I had like a thousand dollars in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank or something and I'm like,</v>

4005
03:04:37.581 --> 03:04:38.570
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4006
03:04:38.930 --> 03:04:40.850
<v Speaker 1>so if anything went wrong I was fucked.</v>

4007
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.863
<v Speaker 1>So coming ouT here and doing sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about sitcoms is it's </v>

4008
03:04:46.401 --> 03:04:47.234
<v Speaker 1>really hard in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the early days of news radio were </v>

4009
03:04:50.601 --> 03:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>hard long as ours we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4010
03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:56.480
<v Speaker 1>it was hard trying to figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction of the show.</v>

4011
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of rewrites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of work.</v>

4012
03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of long days on the set.</v>

4013
03:05:02.360 --> 03:05:05.390
<v Speaker 1>But then once it got going like season </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4014
03:05:05.391 --> 03:05:06.370
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

4015
03:05:06.420 --> 03:05:07.520
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was easy.</v>

4016
03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like You'd come in,</v>

4017
03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:12.530
<v Speaker 1>we rehearsed for a couple of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home.</v>

4018
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>We were down two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes three days a week,</v>

4019
03:05:15.890 --> 03:05:19.490
<v Speaker 1>one day a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a table read one day blocking,</v>

4020
03:05:19.491 --> 03:05:21.320
<v Speaker 1>one day shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

4021
03:05:21.380 --> 03:05:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did that a few times.</v>

4022
03:05:22.970 --> 03:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4023
03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four days.</v>

4024
03:05:25.250 --> 03:05:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Four days was common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely will we do five whole days.</v>

4025
03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:31.670
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear factor.</v>

4026
03:05:31.671 --> 03:05:33.320
<v Speaker 1>What was the work schedule like for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

4027
03:05:33.321 --> 03:05:34.820
<v Speaker 1>One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three days a week,</v>

4028
03:05:34.821 --> 03:05:39.500
<v Speaker 1>but constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did one year,</v>

4029
03:05:39.530 --> 03:05:42.950
<v Speaker 1>tHirty four episodes I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 36.</v>

4030
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just shitted out.</v>

4031
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America was eating.</v>

4032
03:05:48.771 --> 03:05:52.850
<v Speaker 1>We're shitting shitting on that plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they should though,</v>

4033
03:05:52.851 --> 03:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>because that show was so clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She set up the game.</v>

4034
03:05:57.860 --> 03:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It was very lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very easy to do initially,</v>

4035
03:06:02.210 --> 03:06:03.043
<v Speaker 1>but then the second version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it came back in 2011 or something </v>

4036
03:06:06.561 --> 03:06:07.394
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that burden was a real problem because </v>

4037
03:06:09.861 --> 03:06:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that version that we're ramping it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4038
03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The stents were way more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way more dangerous.</v>

4039
03:06:14.931 --> 03:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was freaking out,</v>

4040
03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but a couple of them I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is getting rough.</v>

4041
03:06:19.970 --> 03:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Like bungee jumps off a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopters in the middle of a canyon.</v>

4042
03:06:23.980 --> 03:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You launching people on these bungee </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumps.</v>

4043
03:06:28.380 --> 03:06:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It Was some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4044
03:06:31.730 --> 03:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>eating stuff always got to me know </v>
<v Speaker 1>people eating the bugs.</v>

4045
03:06:35.930 --> 03:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money did you win on that show?</v>

4046
03:06:39.141 --> 03:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could win.</v>

4047
03:06:40.970 --> 03:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a couple of shows where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want a million dollars,</v>

4048
03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>but even when you win a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really want a million dollars.</v>

4049
03:06:47.900 --> 03:06:50.710
<v Speaker 1>You win a million dollars for The </v>
<v Speaker 1>government comes in,</v>

4050
03:06:50.780 --> 03:06:52.260
<v Speaker 1>steals everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4051
03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it.</v>

4052
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Is there something for winning and on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>game show,</v>

4053
03:06:56.430 --> 03:06:59.520
<v Speaker 2>like do you have some more taken out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a winning or something.</v>

4054
03:06:59.610 --> 03:07:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot like if someone won $50,000,</v>

4055
03:07:04.141 --> 03:07:07.080
<v Speaker 2>which was a normal week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would really take home 34.</v>

4056
03:07:08.130 --> 03:07:08.963
<v Speaker 2>The government doesn't eat any animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick's jump off any buildings and they </v>

4057
03:07:12.900 --> 03:07:17.610
<v Speaker 2>just steal 16 grand for you animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the animal decks now.</v>

4058
03:07:18.030 --> 03:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>That was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The we,</v>

4059
03:07:19.640 --> 03:07:23.490
<v Speaker 2>we did that in griffith Park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Camped out.</v>

4060
03:07:24.090 --> 03:07:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Served up animal dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>

4061
03:07:28.490 --> 03:07:29.323
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking back the liability on that </v>

4062
03:07:31.321 --> 03:07:32.154
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really crazy is it all happened </v>

03:07:33.931 --> 03:07:36.120
<v Speaker 2>post september 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right afterwards.</v>

4064
03:07:36.450 --> 03:07:41.450
<v Speaker 2>That's when it aired and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a preposterous show like from the</v>

4065
03:07:41.701 --> 03:07:42.534
<v Speaker 2>jump and I always thought it was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be canceled and it was a giant hit </v>

4066
03:07:45.840 --> 03:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>was a giant hit and be able to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately it was a hit.</v>

4068
03:07:51.601 --> 03:07:56.601
<v Speaker 2>The show is so stupid and the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome I got the gig was because I</v>

4069
03:07:58.411 --> 03:07:59.244
<v Speaker 2>made fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody else was trying to like </v>

<v Speaker 2>good fit for it because it was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>

4238
03:15:52.201 --> 03:15:53.034
<v Speaker 3>I just want to put it out there now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they offered me a half hour and it </v>

4239
03:15:55.251 --> 03:15:57.000
<v Speaker 3>was five months pregnant or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

4240
03:15:57.001 --> 03:16:00.780
<v Speaker 3>So you only have a couple months to </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw something together and that's it,</v>

4241
03:16:00.781 --> 03:16:01.920
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to vegas.</v>

4242
03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Pregnant is fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a hundred and 20 degrees.</v>

4243
03:16:05.851 --> 03:16:10.851
<v Speaker 3>Joey diaz in me in the desert with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy fucks in fremont.</v>

4244
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:14.010
<v Speaker 3>A lot of women are doing specials </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>

4245
03:16:14.730 --> 03:16:17.050
<v Speaker 3>So it's a stupid question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allie.</v>

4246
03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:17.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4247
03:16:18.330 --> 03:16:19.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4248
03:16:19.201 --> 03:16:20.034
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I throw out a joke to allie in the </v>

4249
03:16:23.610 --> 03:16:25.120
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the oge of all that she is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>

4250
03:16:25.150 --> 03:16:25.983
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we really appreciate is the pregnant </v>

4251
03:16:28.580 --> 03:16:29.413
<v Speaker 3>standup?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think about it before </v>

4252
03:16:30.091 --> 03:16:30.924
<v Speaker 3>that nobody ever did a special where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were pregnant and now a bunch of </v>

4253
03:16:33.391 --> 03:16:34.800
<v Speaker 3>chicks are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

4254
03:16:34.801 --> 03:16:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what happened was we are all</v>

4255
03:16:37.141 --> 03:16:37.974
<v Speaker 3>of the age where we're more established </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our careers and it's a time where </v>

4256
03:16:40.651 --> 03:16:41.484
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's last call for all of us older </v>

4257
03:16:42.601 --> 03:16:44.250
<v Speaker 3>bitches to have babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4258
03:16:44.250 --> 03:16:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Like now's the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

4259
03:16:46.891 --> 03:16:47.724
<v Speaker 3>it all kind of the timing of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like there's something </v>

4260
03:16:49.951 --> 03:16:53.250
<v Speaker 3>cool about filming it while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually pregnant.</v>

4261
03:16:53.270 --> 03:16:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4262
03:16:54.660 --> 03:16:56.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4263
03:16:56.311 --> 03:16:57.144
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the assumption is you should be </v>

4264
03:16:57.661 --> 03:17:00.160
<v Speaker 3>laying at home eating bon bons and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

4265
03:17:00.300 --> 03:17:04.860
<v Speaker 3>my second pregnancy I did polities up </v>
<v Speaker 3>until about two weeks before I delivered</v>

4266
03:17:04.861 --> 03:17:05.694
<v Speaker 3>and I was eating well and really doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it right the second time because I </v>

4267
03:17:07.981 --> 03:17:10.830
<v Speaker 3>fucked up my first pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating carl's jr twice a week,</v>

4268
03:17:11.400 --> 03:17:12.233
<v Speaker 3>getting those extra onion rings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating in the parking lot and shit </v>

4269
03:17:15.750 --> 03:17:16.440
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4270
03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:18.960

<v Speaker 3>I was real fucked up after that one.</v>

4272
03:17:21.961 --> 03:17:23.790
<v Speaker 3>So how long does it take you to lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>that weight?</v>

4273
03:17:24.180 --> 03:17:26.190
<v Speaker 3>A year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took me a year because I didn't know how</v>

4274
03:17:26.191 --> 03:17:27.024
<v Speaker 3>to lose weight and I didn't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise until I found this woman I'm </v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't ever date a comedian just doesn't </v>

03:20:40.280 --> 03:20:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

4351
03:20:41.400 --> 03:20:42.890
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's it.</v>

4352
03:20:43.340 --> 03:20:44.510
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very rare.</v>

4353
03:20:44.511 --> 03:20:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think we,</v>

4354
03:20:45.921 --> 03:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very supportive of me and,</v>

4355
03:20:49.460 --> 03:20:51.410
<v Speaker 3>and this is not politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>

4356
03:20:51.440 --> 03:20:56.440
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's way more famous than me and,</v>

4357
03:20:58.170 --> 03:21:01.040
<v Speaker 3>and that's fine and that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

4358
03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:02.780
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't fuck with you at all.</v>

4359
03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever think about channeling them </v>
<v Speaker 3>in to sleep?</v>

4360
03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Put the pillow over his funny jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that can be a problem if the</v>

4361
03:21:12.411 --> 03:21:15.640
<v Speaker 3>other person has an issue with the mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4362
03:21:15.641 --> 03:21:18.440
<v Speaker 3>mr harwood that horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4363
03:21:20.840 --> 03:21:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4364
03:21:22.401 --> 03:21:23.430
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4365
03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:24.673
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen other couples where one is </v>

4366
03:21:26.661 --> 03:21:28.670
<v Speaker 3>more famous and the other one doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>accept it in.</v>

4367
03:21:28.671 --> 03:21:31.180
<v Speaker 3>That fucks with them for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4368
03:21:31.220 --> 03:21:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it that way.</v>

4369
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:36.390
<v Speaker 3>All I ever wanted was to sell enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>tickets to tell jokes to people who knew</v>

4370
03:21:36.391 --> 03:21:37.224
<v Speaker 3>who I was when I showed up and I'm there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all I've ever wanted is just </v>

4371
03:21:40.071 --> 03:21:41.600
<v Speaker 3>not to be doing like the dinner.</v>

4372
03:21:41.770 --> 03:21:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Quite honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is all anything ever.</v>

4373
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.943
<v Speaker 2>That's all it ever is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just gets bigger in terms of the </v>

4374
03:21:48.381 --> 03:21:50.240
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's all it ever is.</v>

4375
03:21:50.570 --> 03:21:52.580
<v Speaker 2>That when you get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best.</v>

4376
03:21:52.640 --> 03:21:53.473
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get to that at a comedy club</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you get to that where you're doing a </v>

4377
03:21:55.521 --> 03:21:58.610
<v Speaker 2>giant ass arena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kinda feels the same.</v>

4378
03:21:59.390 --> 03:22:00.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4379
03:22:01.120 --> 03:22:04.240

<v Speaker 3>you're at fucking arena,</v>

<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don'T know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get diarrhea.</v>

4383
03:22:10.440 --> 03:22:11.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4384
03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:11.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4385
03:22:11.700 --> 03:22:13.950
<v Speaker 2>The last arena that I did was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest one,</v>

4386
03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:14.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4387
03:22:14.470 --> 03:22:17.790
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to be the air Canada center,</v>

4388
03:22:17.791 --> 03:22:18.624
<v Speaker 2>now it's called the scotia bank arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in Canada that fuck that the ufc is </v>

<v Speaker 2>it was bananas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I'm standing out there looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people make this is fucking </v>

4392
03:22:28.201 --> 03:22:30.410
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once the show started rolling,</v>

4393
03:22:30.450 --> 03:22:31.700
<v Speaker 3>it was like a regular show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4394
03:22:31.860 --> 03:22:33.450
<v Speaker 3>you don't look at all of that.</v>

4395
03:22:33.480 --> 03:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>it was just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just fun.</v>

4396
03:22:35.550 --> 03:22:37.500
<v Speaker 2>But it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as a club,</v>

4397
03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:40.200
<v Speaker 2>like if you go to the funny bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

4401
03:22:48.021 --> 03:22:49.220

<v Speaker 3>I love clubs,</v>

4402
03:22:49.221 --> 03:22:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I love small rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think too about my husband,</v>

4403
03:22:51.621 --> 03:22:54.650
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it never gets to him.</v>

4404
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Like he never sweats himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4414
03:23:18.051 --> 03:23:21.060

<v Speaker 3>Now he,</v>

4415
03:23:21.061 --> 03:23:21.680
<v Speaker 3>he understood</v>

4416
03:23:21.680 --> 03:23:26.120
<v Speaker 2>stands traps and he doesn't allow his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain to go on any mental traps.</v>

4417

03:23:33.740 --> 03:23:37.740
<v Speaker 9>the wiltern.</v>

4420
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:41.140
<v Speaker 2>What's the trap there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe?</v>

4421
03:23:41.480 --> 03:23:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm the ego just to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to the,</v>

4422
03:23:44.720 --> 03:23:46.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing is being in the</v>

4423
03:23:46.581 --> 03:23:47.414
<v Speaker 2>state of mind that you could be in to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>great comedy and that that is not a </v>

4424
03:23:50.930 --> 03:23:54.050
<v Speaker 2>congratulatory state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the opposite.</v>

4425
03:23:54.080 --> 03:23:55.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so interesting.</v>

4426
03:23:55.811 --> 03:23:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>

4427
03:23:57.780 --> 03:24:00.760
<v Speaker 3>I sold out carbs like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a while,</v>

4428
03:24:00.790 --> 03:24:02.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4429
03:24:02.110 --> 03:24:03.300
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can't,</v>

4430
03:24:03.370 --> 03:24:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe these people are here to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see me now.</v>

4431
03:24:04.961 --> 03:24:06.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh the pressure because I'm finally,</v>

4432
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:08.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving the tickets and this and that.</v>

4433
03:24:08.771 --> 03:24:10.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I was like,</v>

4434
03:24:10.230 --> 03:24:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even think like that.</v>

4435
03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Like get into your self-loathing cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you're funnier,</v>

4436
03:24:15.360 --> 03:24:17.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think about,</v>

4437
03:24:18.220 --> 03:24:19.053
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into whatever state of mind that it </v>

4438
03:24:20.051 --> 03:24:23.170
<v Speaker 2>takes for you to do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're doIng.</v>

4439
03:24:23.220 --> 03:24:25.180
<v Speaker 2>You want to go out there and rock that </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd.</v>

4440
03:24:25.181 --> 03:24:26.710
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

4441
03:24:27.010 --> 03:24:30.120
<v Speaker 2>And whatever you need to do to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you definitely don't need to be self</v>

4442
03:24:30.121 --> 03:24:32.130
<v Speaker 2>congratulatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that's the worst</v>

4443
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:33.450
<v Speaker 3>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4444
03:24:33.470 --> 03:24:37.760
<v Speaker 3>because I've done stand up for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who didn't give a shit for years and who</v>

4445
03:24:37.820 --> 03:24:38.653
<v Speaker 3>would sit in the front row with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms crossed and who the fuck is this </v>

4446
03:24:40.221 --> 03:24:41.570
<v Speaker 3>bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

4447
03:24:42.830 --> 03:24:43.800
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it.</v>

4448
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4449
03:24:44.250 --> 03:24:47.280
<v Speaker 1>And also those moments are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical.</v>

4450
03:24:47.420 --> 03:24:48.253
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I feel bad for people that </v>

4451
03:24:49.291 --> 03:24:52.980
<v Speaker 1>are famous that try stand up as a famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>person like jesus.</v>

4452
03:24:52.981 --> 03:24:54.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4453
03:24:54.990 --> 03:24:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Like I've watched people do it that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>charlie murphy,</v>

4454
03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:01.110
<v Speaker 1>he that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love that guy to death,</v>

4455
03:25:01.410 --> 03:25:02.243
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I resPected about </v>
<v Speaker 1>him more than anything was that he </v>

4456
03:25:04.501 --> 03:25:07.380
<v Speaker 1>literally was an open miker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he was famous,</v>

4457
03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:08.673
<v Speaker 1>mean he was just starting out doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup while he was on the chappelle </v>

4458
03:25:11.101 --> 03:25:12.810
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been an actor all these years.</v>

4459
03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:15.300
<v Speaker 1>So for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he realized,</v>

4460
03:25:15.470 --> 03:25:16.230
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

4461
03:25:16.230 --> 03:25:17.063
<v Speaker 1>I'll host a show and bring up these </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians and I'll tell a story or two </v>

4462
03:25:21.270 --> 03:25:23.280
<v Speaker 1>because this is a good way to make some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

4463
03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And then he realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4464
03:25:24.511 --> 03:25:27.860

<v Speaker 1>But I tell a lot of comedians,</v>

4512
03:27:15.271 --> 03:27:16.104
<v Speaker 1>I go see that's what happens when you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got an athlete's mindset like an </v>

4513
03:27:19.021 --> 03:27:23.010
<v Speaker 1>athlete's determination and discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>and apply it to an art form.</v>

03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes himself work.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's the assumption.</v>

4517
03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Assumptionist as a stand up comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

03:27:34.141 --> 03:27:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you just lay around and jack your deck </v>

4525
03:27:46.260 --> 03:27:47.093

4529
03:27:54.210 --> 03:27:55.043
<v Speaker 2>the only way to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be writing all the </v>

<v Speaker 3>I love your last special because you say</v>

4545
03:28:32.831 --> 03:28:35.320

4546
03:28:35.620 --> 03:28:39.220
<v Speaker 3>not that risky in terms of the climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now like I was like,</v>

4548
03:28:39.660 --> 03:28:40.493

4549
03:28:44.191 --> 03:28:45.024
<v Speaker 2>more effectively and more carefully and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just set things up better and your </v>

4550
03:28:49.441 --> 03:28:52.290
<v Speaker 2>writing has to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>

4551
03:28:52.440 --> 03:28:53.880
<v Speaker 2>especially with the subjects that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>cover,</v>

4552
03:28:53.881 --> 03:28:56.440
<v Speaker 2>but I also felt like this was my most</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4556
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I felt it was the most controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I felt like I needed to be.</v>

4557
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I needed to touch on the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be dangerous to touch on.</v>

4558
03:29:08.921 --> 03:29:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Like he said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4559
03:29:10.601 --> 03:29:12.800

03:29:12.870 --> 03:29:15.730

<v Speaker 2>it's actually dangerous.</v>
