1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.490
We are live.
That's it.
Hello Jordan.
How's it going?
Joe?

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.780
Let's costs if professional video game player,
you what's up dude?

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:10.531
You live in the dream.

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.700
That's what every teenage boy who's sitting in front of his parents television

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.030
and is you fucking loser.
Get some shit done with your life.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.290
That's actually how I pick up girls.

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.620
I go on Tinder and I say I'm living the dream so they don't actually see that.

8
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.890
I say I played professional game.
I just said living the dream.
Yeah,

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.340
but it's like,
what's your dream?
The childhood dream.
Everyone's like,

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.170
well if your boy,
I guess.
Right.
Well when you first started playing video games,

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.210
was there any professional option?
Um,
well kind of.

12
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:39.961
There's these teams,

13
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.990
team three d that was the first big team in North America and they like,

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
I remember going to a local fries and a buying a keyboard and seeing like one of

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.330
their players quotes on the box.

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.020
Like I use this keyboard because I'm going to be the fucking best with this

17
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:53.190
keyboard.
Sounds like awesome.

18
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:56.550
Like that was actually super big part of my motivation.
Like,

19
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.500
I want to be on a box
now.

20
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:05.250
When you first started playing,
like how old were you?
Uh,

21
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.910
I think I was nine when my brother and she used to,
I have two older brothers.

22
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.240
My oldest brother was playing counterstrike and of course I wasn't allowed to

23
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.960
play so I'm sitting there watching him play all day.

24
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.310
And you weren't allowed to put no,
it was his computer.
So he's like,
he out,

25
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.980
he was like shoot me out of Israel.
And then I'd kind of like crawl on the floor,

26
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.720
walk in and like try to like watch him like getting his room and watch.

27
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.910
And then when he would leave he'd go to school or something.

28
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.200
I would hop on his computer and I would play counter strike is a weird one

29
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:32.370
because that was,
it was first it was halflife halflife team death match.
Yeah.

30
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.380
And then like no one even talks about half life game.

31
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.610
Then it became,
counterstrike was like the big game,
the pupil.

32
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.150
So death match when you're playing death match counterstrike,

33
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.620
you playing one on one or team versions of the halflife engine,

34
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.150
but against other people.

35
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.110
That's what a lot of people that play Cassia competitively used to like warm up

36
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.660
death match mode cause you just keep dying in responding.

37
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.120
It's like a quake is to give or something,
you know,

38
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:04.020
you just keep restarting and just kill each other to kind of warm up your,

39
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490
your hands and whatnot.
Getting working well together.
Do you,

40
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.610
do you have like a ritual or anything you do before you,
uh,
you play?
Well,

41
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.970
I mean it is muscle memory at his calisthenics.
I at this point though,

42
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:18.300
like obviously if you're a golfer you might not train as hard as you did when

43
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.820
you wanted to make the tour,
but you still have to do maintenance stuff.

44
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.600
So like when I hit a death match,
I'd get maybe a hundred kills with each gun.

45
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
And then I just did obviously have team practice,

46
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.760
which is a different set of coordinating strategies and stuff.

47
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.170
But for personally,
yeah,
I just try to make sure I'm still playing self.

48
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.200
I ever feel off.

49
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.490
I could identify what's really off pretty quick and I'll just go hone in on that

50
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.230
guy or that part of a map or whatever.
But uh,
yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's a mix of both.

51
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880
Do you think that people don't respect how difficult it is to play competitive

52
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:53.430
video games?
Cause yeah,
definitely.
I mean it's fucking really difficult.
Like the,

53
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:57.960
the level of competence,
their level of skill.
Like if you've watched,
uh,

54
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.040
you can watch a lot of games online and that's like

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.390
<v 1>a big part of all this now,</v>

56
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.040
which is really fascinating is how many people watch live games or even with

57
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.910
quake,
the big thing was watching demos.
Yeah.

58
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540
People would watch demos was really good players.
You do that too?
Yeah,
I think,

59
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.730
I think part of it obviously is people don't know what the effect they're

60
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.380
looking at outside perspective.

61
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.300
So like certain games I can understand starcraft or league of legends or what

62
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:23.290
are our calf you're looking at least spells flying around.
That's ridiculous.

63
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.070
Those,

64
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.280
those like action key moments normally happen over the course of like 10 minutes

65
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.140
or something.
Whereas in counterstrike or quake,

66
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.050
it's like that guy just got that point.
He's about to kill this guy.

67
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.730
There's this 30 seconds left on the clock.

68
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.380
So I think that's actually more intuitively easy for a spectator to watch as a

69
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.090
spectator sport.
But you're right.
Yeah.

70
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.880
A lot of people I don't think comprehend what you go through that Oh this kid

71
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:45.040
just plays all day for fun and doesn't think about what he's doing.

72
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.600
He just happened to be good.
Yeah.

73
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.750
It's always been fascinating to me how certain games get,

74
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.610
they get taken seriously.

75
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.630
Like certain games garner respect like chess.

76
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.830
If you were really good chess player,
like oh he's a sophisticated gentleman.

77
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.170
He's a chess player.
Yeah.
What do you do for a living?
Oh I played chess.
Whoa,

78
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.320
interesting.
What do you do for living?
Oh I played video games.

79
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.030
Oh you fucking door counterstrike,
right.
I've got,

80
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.050
I've progressed over that and I played cachet with the fuck.
It's Kinda shake.

81
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.220
Yeah.
Well I do this.

82
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.040
Well that's extra geeky cause your name in the video where you have to,

83
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.960
cause you say play video games.
It's like saying you played pro sports.
Right,

84
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.460
right,
right.
That's true.
So I tried to make that distinction to do justice to my,

85
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.200
my profession or whatever.

86
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.530
So in the future people start questioning more about what I do now.

87
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.850
What level is the,

88
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:38.851
I mean obviously there's halflife that came out and then was the game engine

89
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.700
continually upgraded?
Yeah,
like I started playing in like Beta version.

90
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:45.930
So Beta 5.2 Beta is basically before the game is full released,
right.

91
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.910
You don't know what a Beta is.
There's like Alphas and Beta.
Right.

92
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.120
And then the full release.
So I played Beta before.
It's even a game,

93
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.960
a full version in stores and uh,
yeah all the weapons are different.

94
00:04:55.961 --> 00:05:00.961
And then 1.0 1.1 1.3 the longest lasting version was 1.6 which I went pro in

95
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.433
back in like two.

96
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.580
I went pro in 2008 but it went the how that you can go pro if so join the light

97
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.460
I or you have to pay for anything,
sign up for stuff.

98
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.680
Well there there is a process.
It's not a conventional,

99
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.080
when like sports you don't get to like a high school team and college team.
It's,

100
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.550
it's,
there's no coaches in east sports will recently there are but like that's

101
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.510
coaches recently and that we'll get into that.

102
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:23.170
But like you know how obviously if you're going to play in NHL you try to like

103
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.900
Joe for play for a college team or you go to juniors or semi pro age though.

104
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.570
In this case there is like I finally caught usea they have the open division,

105
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.730
intermediate main from your invite.
If you're an invite,

106
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.450
you're really the only people that have a chance that can get paid to play by

107
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.523
companies.

108
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.180
So when I say I went pro back in 2008 it's because I joined up a contract with

109
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.800
an organization called evil geniuses,

110
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:49.150
which is like my agency for an actor and they had sponsors from Intel,

111
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:50.020
new egg,

112
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.590
a bunch of peripheral companies for my gear and they pay me to fly to the

113
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:55.720
tournament and I had market them like I'm a Nascar car,

114
00:05:55.721 --> 00:06:00.160
I have their logos all over them.
I tell people why their gear is good,
et Cetera,

115
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.840
et cetera.

116
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.420
<v 2>Wow.
Okay.
So now that's the counterstrike,
uh,
the,</v>

117
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.910
the halflife engine.
So what is,

118
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.860
is there a several versions of it that they've come up with?
Like what,

119
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.590
what version are you on now?
So now it's the most recent called global offensive.

120
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.380
Uh,
is this a new version of counterstrike itself or new version?

121
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.243
There's not a new version.

122
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.320
<v 1>Halflife right?
Nope.
They came out with halflife two at one point,
but that,</v>

123
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.350
that was the source engine.
So counterstrike came,
it was on that end.

124
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.400
<v 2>So for folks who don't know what the fuck we're talking about,</v>

125
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:33.890
this is what that means.
Like video game engines,

126
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.060
they take the engine like the three d geometry,

127
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.090
the video,
like the way it looks,
the graphics,

128
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.220
and then they take that engine and then they can port it over to other games and

129
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.530
they can develop games based on that engine.

130
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.170
So it cuts a lot of the development process out because a big part of the

131
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.860
development process out is coming up with a,
a video game engine.

132
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.070
<v 1>Yup.
So yeah,
they have I think half life to you.</v>

133
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:00.080
I don't know when exactly came out,

134
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:04.150
if he was like 2004 or five that's kind of old.
No,

135
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.100
that was that 10 years ago.
Like I said,

136
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.160
I went pro and countered at 1.6 and that was like everyone loved it.

137
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:11.150
It was like the original quake,

138
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.010
like the registration of like my bullet shooting and I hit a guy like it.

139
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.820
It worked,
it hit him when he shot him in the head,

140
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:18.830
like some of these new versions of the counselors that were coming out,

141
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.150
it was almost too easy.

142
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.240
Like you would shoot a bullet like right here because the guy was moving weird.

143
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.710
He would still registered as a headshot.

144
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.690
So that was something was up with the engine and it,

145
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.180
it was like they were trying to up the graphics and the feel and to make it look

146
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.020
more realistic.

147
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.020
But that took away from I guess how fast the computer talks to the server,

148
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.140
you know?
So then there was a discrepancy between like when I shot,

149
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.280
when it actually hit the person.
And obviously that's why like I can't,

150
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.700
when I practice,
I can't play against Europeans because of Internet lag.
Right.

151
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.130
So that's why you would play on a land because that's the fastest interaction

152
00:07:55.131 --> 00:08:00.131
between the server and played on online with the Internet lag and you get used

153
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:04.080
to it and then you play without the lag.
It's like you go to paradise.
Yeah.

154
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.650
It's like having to wait on your baseball bat or something.

155
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.110
But some guys got really good at it.

156
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:13.990
Like some guys get super good at timing their own fuck up their own lag.
Yeah.

157
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.460
That's bullshit though.
Cause then they're harder to hit.

158
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.110
Some of them are just glitching around it.
Bull Shit.
So that's annoying.

159
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:24.770
So at our level we're really like Prima donnas about like what server,
location,

160
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.720
what we planned because my teammates are spread around the country so don't play

161
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.430
on like a Denver a server and you have to make sure that you're paying is very

162
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.500
low.
Right.
Like the pink to the server.
Yeah.
I mean like what's,

163
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.590
what's a Good Ping these days?
Well playing in north,

164
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:43.580
playing in North America for counterstrike player like 40 to 50 is like what we

165
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:45.760
play on.
But like if I were to plan a southern in La,

166
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.970
Los Angeles saver from San Diego,
I get 15 cause I'm closer.
But as a team,

167
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.430
since we're all spread out,
we're in,

168
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.930
we're in like Toronto and all this stuff across the country.

169
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.780
We play centralized and that's a milliseconds.

170
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.620
So it'd be like 15 milliseconds at I guess.

171
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.700
So does that register in your head?
You'd notice a difference between 15 and 40?

172
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.650
Well,
I could feel it.
It's really just like the,
uh,
the gun itself.

173
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.330
I could feel it's like a very small,

174
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:14.580
like a lot of people don't notice a difference for the first couple of years.

175
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:15.570
They probably play the game.

176
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.680
But once you start realizing the different action of the recoil of the guns,

177
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.530
you could feel it between each bullet.
This is super nerdy.
Yeah.

178
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.360
I know you played claims.
We'll talk about that later.
Yeah.
Um,

179
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.870
so my question is like,

180
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:32.310
how do you decide what game to become super adept at?

181
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.610
Because it seems like there's a lot of you become adept at it but I mean the

182
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.110
games have a life like were people won't play them anymore.

183
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.050
Like it gets to a point like try playing quake one today.
Troy,

184
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.480
what happened with kind of sugar 1.6 so this was Kinda,

185
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.310
it was kind of what I was kind of talking about.

186
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.930
The new version came out and because 1.6 is getting stagnant like that,

187
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.130
since the developer doesn't give back to the game much and there isn't a shit

188
00:09:55.131 --> 00:09:58.200
coming out,
people are like wow,
this gets old because they're not pro,

189
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:01.500
they're playing for the fun of it.
That's the people that helped me make this.

190
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:05.400
My job is the 80 or 90% of the community who isn't pro who plays in is my

191
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:08.700
viewership is the people I talked to for my sponsors,
et cetera.

192
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.060
So that was going downhill out at the end of counterstrike and other games like

193
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:16.020
League of legends,
which is not a first person shooter and a Dota.

194
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:17.000
These are like five [inaudible],

195
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.610
five strategies spells and like that's different type of stuff.

196
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.830
That's when they lose me.
Yeah.
And so yes,

197
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.190
I've played counter strike is I just loved the intuitive finesse you could bring

198
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.630
to the game.
It wasn't just like chess,

199
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:33.840
it was more of like a chest to tennis or whatever you want to say.

200
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.290
I could actually,
I could just out skill someone simply,

201
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.930
even if they do a crazy strategy,
I'm just gonna stand there and say,
well I'll,

202
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.940
I'll shoot you every time.
Even if you think you're smarter,

203
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.850
just your hand eye coordination and your understanding of where the mouse is

204
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:45.900
going to move the cursor.

205
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.170
And I find a lot of people who play counter strike were more physically fit

206
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.050
people.
Like there's an archetype to different pro gamers.

207
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.380
A lot of people think everyone's a fat pimply guy.
Well,

208
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:58.350
I notice a lot of counterstrike players like myself grew up playing sports.

209
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:02.790
I played ice hockey.
All my youth,
a lot of my teammates are team athletes.

210
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.860
Um,
or just,
well,
the dorks like starcraft.

211
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.530
I know I'm going to go to work pat for condom dark.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
So,

212
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.920
and the thing is I have friends in those realms too.
Right.
So there are those,

213
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.470
those random people you got into quake yourself,
right.

214
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:19.200
There's all sorts of different people get into games,
but generally,
yeah,

215
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.940
the people,
it's like chess.
Starcraft is more a cerebral game.
You're,

216
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.400
you're kind of premeditating a lot of your decisions,

217
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:29.100
which you are encountering it too,
but in a much more strategic way.

218
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:31.950
You don't need to,
you could probably plug in any mouse and play starcraft.

219
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.200
Whereas when my sponsor tries to give me a new mouse,

220
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.800
I like resist a lot because that's like,
I don't know,

221
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:39.930
different baseball glove or a different pair,

222
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:43.230
a different curve from ice hockey sticker.
Different set of irons as a golfer,

223
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:48.090
like it really throws me off for a little bit.
Or they all laser mice now.
Yeah,

224
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.850
but some obstacles work well if the surface is one color,

225
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.160
if the surface is a multicolored on a mouse,
it actually makes tracking harder.

226
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.710
Like these people have these crazy designs and their mouse bag that's actually

227
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.190
detrimental to like the tracking and stuff.
Really?
Yeah.

228
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.870
<v 2>But no one uses a ball anymore.
Start on a ball.
You open that shit up.</v>

229
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.870
Yeah.
Remember you have to,

230
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.360
I used to have Q tips with alcohol and he used to have a clean the little

231
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:14.380
rollers cause they gunk up with sweat and funk.

232
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.480
<v 3>Oh Joe is a Gamer.
He was,
he was addicted to that thing.
And I have a question.</v>

233
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.220
If you're so good at counterstrike,

234
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.510
can you pick up most first person shooters and be really good at it on PC?
Yeah.

235
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.810
On PC.
So you can go into grand theft auto right now and just kill everybody.

236
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.140
<v 1>Yeah.
That's not really a competitor,
but yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
probably do that.</v>

237
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:34.650
I'm quake.
I used to play quake all time.
Rocket Arena.
Three quakes.
Yeah.

238
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.760
<v 2>So you just have like really good understanding of what movement of your hand</v>

239
00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:41.640
corresponds to the movement on the screen.
You get kind of a feeling.

240
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.550
<v 1>Yeah,
just good dexterity.
Most frustration shooters are just like you said,</v>

241
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:48.070
I heard you talking about quake and it's really just intuitive.

242
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:49.480
Like you play at first and you're like,
oh,

243
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.600
I have to look with my mouse hand in this and yeah,

244
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.010
after awhile it's like an extension of your hands.

245
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.410
I don't think I do a lot of actions per minute that I don't even comprehend

246
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.980
because I'm reacting visually.
Not Mentally.

247
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.200
<v 2>Yeah,
I'd get there was a,</v>

248
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.170
there's like gun switches and moves that you would do that literally would come

249
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:08.150
like tying your shoes.
Yeah.
And then you start playing better

250
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.730
<v 1>players.
You manipulate those little things that like there's,
there's,</v>

251
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:14.190
that's what we call the Meta game is things that like,

252
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.640
it changes constantly because it's all based on intuition.

253
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.770
<v 2>Right.
That's why it's so weird when you switch from game to game.</v>

254
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:22.090
That was why I had that question.

255
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:26.470
Because like if you've got super into counterstrike and then you know,

256
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:31.180
like maybe,
you know,
have you seen the teaser for the new doom?
No.

257
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.700
Oh,
we should pull out yet.
Oh Shit.

258
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.110
And Jamie does a new doomed.
I'm fucking,

259
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.990
I worship at the altar of John Carmack.
Yes.
Yeah.

260
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.750
He's the baddest motherfucker ever when it comes to this shit.

261
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:46.720
But there's new doom.
The graphics are just so ridiculous.

262
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:50.290
It's just like fucking Christ now while right?
Yeah,
it's been awhile.

263
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.380
I mean he's been doing a bunch of different kinds of video games as well,

264
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:55.580
but I remember when the here,
let's,

265
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.140
let's play it real quick and we'll show you this cause this is,

266
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.840
this is really crazy.
It'll be to the left to use or to the right of you as well.

267
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.880
We just play it on that.
Then it doesn't matter.
Go Fullscreen.

268
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.940
Jamie blast.
Peggy 18 what are those?

269
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.630
That's all you get these serious,
that's it.
That's it.
That's all you get.

270
00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:22.840
June 14th they're going to show a game play that has the June for the job.

271
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.860
Won't time June 14th you get to see the actual full thing being played.

272
00:14:27.991 --> 00:14:32.220
I guess.
What are you doing?
Switching things on us.
Pull it again.

273
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.380
Can't hear it.
Three yeah,
we need to duck done.
Maybe 18 welcome to hell.

274
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.300
<v 4>Oh,</v>

275
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.910
<v 2>that's dope.
Cue The pay Tara.</v>

276
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.660
But like when you would play that,

277
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.390
like if you play that game and you got used to that physics,

278
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:51.860
like I remember going from quake to unreal,

279
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.730
<v 0>it was like screw you up a little.
Even though it was awesome,
it was like,</v>

280
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:57.470
it moved just a little different.

281
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.570
The mouse cursor have moved a little different and you know,
you,

282
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.970
you get your settings and you try to like fidget with it and try to get it to a

283
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:08.720
place where you kind of understand what was happening intuitively.
So that yeah,

284
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:10.760
it's always that we always rate when we get a new game,

285
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.180
that's a first person shooter and you go in and see how the game takes your

286
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:17.070
sensitivity if it's directly from your mouse or from windows.

287
00:15:17.071 --> 00:15:18.320
So that's called raw input.

288
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.660
So some games have Ron put where it takes your mouse and CV and I can go and

289
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.070
dial it basically ended out my cash drag fields seven down.

290
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.980
So something you have to go in and like they have their own.
Um,
uh,

291
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.170
it's like they're on in game since taking game sensitivity and you have to slide

292
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:33.501
the notch.

293
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:37.070
We had and it's got to tell an extrapolation of what a default sensors and every

294
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:40.900
time you move one notch,
it's 1.25 the original versus another David.

295
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.390
And then there's mouse acceleration,
which is fucking gonna turn that off.

296
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:47.240
Obviously the faster,
but some guys were really loved it.

297
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:51.290
Like the faster you move the hand it corresponded to a different type of

298
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:54.800
movement with the mouse.
Yeah.
Whereas like under normal circumstances,

299
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.611
you move left,

300
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.150
you move right and the cursor moves left to right and it's independent on

301
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:03.770
whether or not you move fast.
But if you fast with mouse acceleration,

302
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:07.340
it moves way faster.
Onscreen extra spin to it at the end it's like,

303
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.670
it's almost like it's a gyroscope or something like that or it's like it's got

304
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:14.660
some momentum to it.
Yeah.
When,
when,
uh,
if you noticed,

305
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.010
so with first person shooters,

306
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:18.590
a lot of people set their arm differently on the desk.
So people,

307
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.490
some people play with risks,
so their Congress party,

308
00:16:20.491 --> 00:16:23.540
so this is like the hand or wrist Amer,
right.

309
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.390
[inaudible] has a risk kind of sat down.
And when they're,

310
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.570
when they're moving they have risk tamer,
wrist,
wrist,
Amer,

311
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.950
Amer.
And then I'm more of an elbow.
My elbow is my hand.

312
00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:38.320
Should I have more control?
So I use a lower sensitivity.
Right.
Oh okay.

313
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.790
I can walk faster.
Swipe larger swipes,

314
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.210
someone playing with their risk is doing this.
So these are higher sensitivity.

315
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.720
Some of those people don't mind using a little excel because they could do these

316
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:51.560
little like flick moves and kind of just really get into the groove with that.

317
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:55.130
And it's smaller.
Whereas I have bigger emotions that make me more comfortable.

318
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.350
So if I have a little bit of excel,
I just,

319
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:01.400
I want it to be as true as possible to my actual hand cause I'm doing these

320
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:05.330
bigger movements to have a large mouse pad as well.
Uh,
yeah.

321
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:07.130
But I actually have two on top of each other.

322
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:10.370
I'm one of the few people he uses like a hard mousepad versus just cloth.

323
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.340
It's not like the plastic feel and I have to like replace it like every three

324
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:17.810
months because I grind it down like my sponsors are like sending me down.

325
00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:20.150
How many hours you plan a day Sun do you get outside?

326
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:24.530
You know about Vitamin Dane?
Yeah,
that's it.
I went San Diego man,

327
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:25.730
you know I'm outside.
There you go.

328
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.510
But like how many hours do you have to play a day to stay fit?
Um,

329
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.540
well when we're going to say fit in the loose,
I mean,

330
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.420
but it is a sort of push.
That's right.
But it is a sort of in shape for the game.

331
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:41.990
Calisthenics.
Just like,
yeah,
when I take a vacation I come back,
I'm like Whoa,

332
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:43.550
this looks weird for sampling.
Yeah,

333
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:46.290
for a couple of weeks even I just come back but I get into a quick,
um,

334
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.160
we have a turn at coming up since it's very centric,
like we dry

335
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.420
<v 1>run,
we premeditate a does in strategies on the counters and on a terror side,</v>

336
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:57.330
like you really try to memorize what you and your teammates are going to do.

337
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:00.150
So if something is thrown a wrench into your gears,

338
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.860
you have to react on the fly somewhat within a certain scale of thought.

339
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.760
So when I played for Turner,
that's like we get on at 3:00 PM we ended 11 yes.

340
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.980
<v 0>Yeah.
So whoa,
Jesus Christ.
What about food?
Water,</v>

341
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.800
bathroom breaks.
This is why I spelled it the arc type.

342
00:18:18.801 --> 00:18:20.810
No,
like for instance,
when we do these boot camps,

343
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.300
three out of five of us at least wake up and go to the gym.

344
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.650
We wake up in the gym,
shower,
we play on our own like dice,
match,
chill,

345
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.520
eat and then like take down like hour before they make sure when you play on

346
00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:34.010
your own,
when you're saying you play on your own match,

347
00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:34.761
what does that mean to you?

348
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:37.970
Connect to a public server may maybe under an alias so people don't give a shit

349
00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:39.410
because everyone knows her names in the game.

350
00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:43.250
So we'll like go into a death match kind of hidden and I just like you just
kill,

351
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.080
respond,
kill,
respond,
death matches and like a real mode.

352
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.320
Like we don't care about her stats were just just having fun.

353
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.260
We might like sometimes I purposely look away from a doorway so when if some guy

354
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:54.190
comes through at our practice,
a 90 degree turn and hitting him in the head.

355
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.931
So I just constantly,

356
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:58.760
I have my back to a guy so when he comes I could hear him and I fuck around.

357
00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:02.990
And that's the thing that a lot of people don't know about video games is that

358
00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:07.490
you can hear in three dimensions too.
Like if something's coming back behind you,

359
00:19:07.491 --> 00:19:11.240
back to your right,
you can actually hear it back into your right,

360
00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:13.100
which is really spooky.
Yeah,
yeah.

361
00:19:13.101 --> 00:19:16.040
We use sound all the time to manipulate things or we make it seem like they

362
00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.500
didn't hear or like we don't know they're behind us.

363
00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:19.970
I'll run out this doorway and I know a guy's cha trailing me.

364
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.040
So when I rented the last of my teammates on the right,

365
00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:23.600
waiting for him to come shoot me in the last.

366
00:19:23.601 --> 00:19:26.900
So like we manipulate sound all the time.
So it's,
yeah,
it's a huge part of it.

367
00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:30.200
So are you guys,
when you plan out your strategies,
do you guys,
like,

368
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.290
do you have like a video chat where you go over like the strategies in,

369
00:19:36.531 --> 00:19:39.620
in physical form or do you write it out?
Like how do you,

370
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.410
<v 1>so obviously first of all,
when sometimes when we boot camp,</v>

371
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.310
we're on the same location.

372
00:19:43.311 --> 00:19:46.400
So we have a big turn in Stockholm and we'd go to Stockholm 10 days in advance

373
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.460
and we go to,
that's the best teams in counterstrike or in Europe.

374
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.340
That's just where they are on.
Our team has never,
my team is,

375
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.280
I've won a couple world championships and the old game,

376
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:58.430
but I've never been a world champion a new game yet.
Like we,

377
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.220
cause it's a team game and like we get,
we'll get to semis or something,

378
00:20:01.221 --> 00:20:03.920
but those guys are the shit and I'm on friends and all of them.

379
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:05.990
But that point aside,
um,

380
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.420
<v 0>wonder why Europe?
Wait,
what was the question?
Is it,
um,</v>

381
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.660
you were talking about Jesus,
what was the original question?
Um,

382
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.960
you're getting together [inaudible] your strategy.

383
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.960
<v 1>So yeah,
so on offense,
you dry rotting in a server,</v>

384
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:23.100
we all connect to the same private server and we just,

385
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.430
um,
basically were like,
okay,
we're going to take this bomb site.

386
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:28.710
What number ways can we do it?
If we have a full economy?

387
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:31.500
Meaning do we have every grenade in our arsenal?
Do we have no grenades?

388
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.190
So we have to dry walk in.
We say dry when we have nothing to really assist us.

389
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:37.020
No smoke grenades,
no flash.
So we say,
hey,

390
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.770
we're going to three dry walk into this bomb site.
You to watch our flank.

391
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.290
So that means they're not going to throw anything like,
right.

392
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:45.900
So like if we're going to hit this room right here and we're going to come in

393
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:47.950
and kill Joe Rogan,
if we wanted to come in here,

394
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.690
we'd sell a flash bang through that door.
Right?

395
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.690
And then we had smell smoke off the kitchen right here.

396
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:55.600
So no one in the kitchen has a vision on the people coming through that doorway.

397
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:56.621
And then you know,

398
00:20:56.621 --> 00:21:00.350
we expect only angles that can hold her under that TV and behind where,

399
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.000
yeah,
where he sitting back here,
Jamie.
I had his name.

400
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:08.770
I want to say Riley for some reason Jamie and so yeah.
So yeah,
exactly.

401
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:13.000
Riley Riley
about of names.
Right?
Um,

402
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.360
so you will out but we have no grenades.

403
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:20.320
Obviously we're coming into Joe Studio Dry,
right?
The Lube.

404
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.300
So these strategies are based upon the g,
the geometry of the room,

405
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.700
type of the map,
how fast.

406
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.480
If we have things called fakes where we'll throw everything in here and make it

407
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:32.440
look like we're coming to kill you.

408
00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:35.050
And all of a sudden the three of us are taking your teammates out who we were.

409
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.410
We're catching on the rotation cause we're saying when we throw all the shit in

410
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:40.900
this room,
Joe is going to say,
guys,
they're coming in,
they're coming in,

411
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:43.930
which is going to cause your guys watching the outback to come towards you and

412
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:46.860
help you.
And then we're going to,
we're going to jump them in the backyard.

413
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.670
And so these strategies are all planned out in advance names for them?
Yeah.

414
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.290
So we'll call it like sonic or Gatorade or,

415
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.430
and they take hold and you can hear each other but you can't hear them.

416
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.960
Yeah we connect to a third party software like mumble or teamspeak.

417
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:03.760
It's kind of like Skype but you pass a hot key.

418
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:07.870
It's like a walkie talkie and so you will talk to each other while you're

419
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:09.780
playing the game.
Look,
look around and he's behind you.

420
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.200
Cause anybody hack into your line and they can like find out what you're saying.

421
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.290
Back in the day.
That was kind of like a thing that would happen between friends.

422
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:18.124
Like you're playing,
you do,

423
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.430
we call him 10 man's where you pick two captains and everyone throws her name

424
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:24.460
and a hat and you play random five verse five teams and you're all in the same

425
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:26.560
voice.
Several.
Well one guy will,
you can,

426
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.530
you can clone the program and opened it again and he'll come in and join your

427
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:31.320
channel wise playing.
So I'll have like one year,

428
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:34.160
I don't know what you guys are doing and that's like a scummy thing for it to do

429
00:22:34.161 --> 00:22:35.530
to each other person.

430
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.680
But when we're playing at a pro level it can't happen cause her isolated.

431
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.930
Now with online gaming,

432
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:45.040
one of the things that was a real problem with quake was bots was people that

433
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:49.960
would have aiming bots couldn't miss and you would get on a server and some guy

434
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:53.410
would be shooting guys that were like jumping through the air like shooting.

435
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.650
You couldn't miss it did kill everybody.

436
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.240
They have that with counterstrike.
Yup.
There's wall hacking and ain't bought.

437
00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:04.210
So we'll have little hack is just obviously transparent walls.

438
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.060
See those guys are pieces of shit and they ain't bought,

439
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.550
he's a shit.
Right.
So we've all,
like I say,

440
00:23:12.551 --> 00:23:15.670
a majority of pros have messed around with it for fun with their friends.

441
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:18.310
Like Yo guys let's go cheat verse each other and see how gnarly it is.

442
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.190
And like we used to do that back in the old versions and the new game.

443
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:23.830
You can't even screw around if they cause they have such a crazy anti cheat,

444
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:27.340
which is what I was just going to say now.
It's really hard to do that.

445
00:23:27.341 --> 00:23:28.960
You have to literally,
it's like actually a big,

446
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.960
it's a multimillion dollar industry cheating and competitive games.

447
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:33.340
It's not like a huge,
huge industry,

448
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:38.341
but people sell like they update it every time the game developer creates a

449
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:41.860
better like firewall or whatever for the cheats they like go in and look at the

450
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:46.580
code,
make it find a way around it to do there.
Even by it Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

451
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.920
Obviously at pro level I don't do you know cheaters,
oh that's actually wrong,

452
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:55.550
but last year there was the first ever time at a pro level where people found a

453
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:57.890
way to cheat in.
The guy got banned for life from tournaments,

454
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:03.260
lights for fucking life because he cheated at like a land qualifiers,

455
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.300
bulls.
He land local area network.
Where were all,
they were like,

456
00:24:06.301 --> 00:24:08.840
it's a French player and he literally got caught.

457
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.540
It's like the smallest cheat ever found.
They found a way to like,

458
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:15.290
it's like 50 kilobytes and they inserted it and like it was like a trigger

459
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:16.930
bought so it wasn't a fulltime ane bought.

460
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.970
So he could press a button and it would snap to the nearest enemy.

461
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:21.200
So even if they're behind a wall,

462
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:24.140
so he could be chilling and just press this button and it would like snap to the

463
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:24.320
wall.

464
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.250
And you knew a guy was about to come around in that corridors and it was super

465
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:32.570
low key but super scummy.
How'd the catch him?
Um,

466
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.090
I forget the series of events,

467
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.350
but there was some like red flag on his account and then like the people have

468
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:43.790
the ability to like go s s zoom in and narrow their scope onto one account and

469
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:44.960
like scan their system.

470
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.230
And they did that and they found some shady traces of like cheating.

471
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:52.210
And then he admitted it and he's like,
I'm sorry guys,
I can't lie anymore.
Wow.

472
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.290
And so now he's done for the rest of his life.

473
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.530
What if it comes back with a different name?
Halo?
I mean,
we'd see his face.

474
00:24:57.531 --> 00:24:59.670
We know what if he gets plastic surgery,

475
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.790
plastic surgery yet,
right.
That's the surgery is pretty epic.
Couldn't go,

476
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.310
just apologize.
That's what he did formally.

477
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.270
But the thing is is it's like pretty scummy.
Like that's like someone,

478
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.680
it's not only writing that would be like having jet packs on your feet playing

479
00:25:18.681 --> 00:25:22.790
football,
like and almost like poisoning the opponent.
Yeah.
It's,
it's not,
yeah.

480
00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:26.720
It's not just [inaudible] that's like God power.
This is like Nancy Kerrigan.

481
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.420
Yeah.
Like you remember Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding.

482
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.680
We're Tonya Harding and hired someone to whack Nancy Kerrigan and the legs like

483
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.820
the next level of scumbag.
That's next level shit.
So,
um,

484
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.470
so there's very few ways that a person could cheat in the professional realm.

485
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.470
There's things like,
say you have a little mini map or radar,

486
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.540
you can make it so all the other teams shows up on their mate radar too.

487
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.520
So you could find out where you're,
so when you're playing,

488
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:55.130
you know where your guys are in any given moment.
Yeah,
exactly.

489
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:58.790
You could make a hack.
So other people dots,
right.
Moving around.

490
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:01.130
And the rotating map and what's your username mates?

491
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.090
You can make it to all 10 people in the game show up or whatever,
money area.

492
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.460
But if you tried to do that professionally and you'd get banned for like,

493
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:06.951
Oh yeah,

494
00:26:06.951 --> 00:26:10.580
like you might be able to have a button at toggles it on and off and like if no

495
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:12.190
admin is watching you,
but when you played a tournament,

496
00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:16.370
do you have like people walking behind you that so crazy.
Now,

497
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.150
what kind of money is involved in this now?
So which facet of it,
right?

498
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.090
What can like,
okay,
give me the top of the food chain first.

499
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:27.170
Like what's the top of the food chain video game or make per year?
Uh,
well,

500
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:30.100
so I play counterstrike rights and remember legal legends countering league of

501
00:26:30.101 --> 00:26:32.000
legends is huge right now.
League of legends,

502
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:34.200
League of legends because the game developer themselves was,

503
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.520
didn't even know what that is.
Like a superhero game.
FIVERR's five.
It's like,

504
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.410
it's like don't,
I don't know if you've heard of dota either.

505
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:42.390
It's Fiverr's five overview.
Um,
you,

506
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.230
you go one end of the corner of the map through three different lanes and yeah,

507
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:50.460
it spells and different heroes.
I'm only interested in first person.
Yeah.

508
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:54.120
So that's the way more exciting.
That overhead view shit.
Well,

509
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:57.420
regardless I those people,
that's like you said,

510
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.860
I've always been at first person shooters,
but yeah,
those games,
they,

511
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:04.650
their developer was the first one to really get involved with the competitive

512
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:07.690
community and give a bunch of prize money back like $10 million tournaments,

513
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.553
like insane.

514
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.660
So like some of these players in the past couple of years have made like over a

515
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.950
million dollars each because of those tournaments.

516
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.100
But if you're talking like the average salary of League of legends player,

517
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.670
they're all making a couple hundred grand a year,
six figures,
no shit.

518
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.310
So that's for the top guys.
Yes.
So like for me and my teammates,

519
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:24.750
we can all make six figure salaries,

520
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.950
see your parents who've got to fucking respect that.
Right.

521
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.620
At a certain point in time,
you know,
we'll go,
mom,

522
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:34.560
do you know what a lawyer makes?
Okay,
I make that.

523
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.050
So go tell your fucking friends.
I'm a lawyer,
I got a call back.
Yeah,

524
00:27:38.051 --> 00:27:41.640
I had costs parents.
Luckily like my dad was kind of the reality check.

525
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:45.390
But in a positive way like you realize that this is kind of a volatile career,

526
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.190
like you're probably going to like not,

527
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.700
this might not apply to anything after you done competing.
Luckily for me,

528
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:54.720
I've done a lot of little things that I kind of have some connections but yeah,

529
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.810
I'm assuming you were going to be done competing.

530
00:27:57.811 --> 00:28:01.310
I assume need to not just addicted to life but,
no,
but that's the thing is uh,

531
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.990
yeah,
you don't know what it's going to be but my mom was always like,

532
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.680
I credit why I went pro to kind of her being cool with me.

533
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.530
Like she would drive me to Las Vegas from San Diego,
Arizona,

534
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.650
northern California because she saw how into it I was and I was like,

535
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:14.840
and I included her on it.

536
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.120
I think that was a big thing for any of you out there who want to like pursue

537
00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:18.390
gaming.

538
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.020
You can't just like fucking ignore everything in your life and get bad grades

539
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:24.960
and do all this shit in school.
You have to like balance stuff.
Right?

540
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:27.060
So like I was kind of like a nerd in that sense.

541
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:29.350
At a young age I played ice hockey,
came home,
did my schoolwork,

542
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.690
played counter strike the rest of the night.

543
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.870
And I told my mom every night who I'm playing with,
what team,
what level I'm at.

544
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.390
And so when I finally said,
hey mom,
I can go to this tournament,

545
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:39.690
I'm old enough because they had an age limit,
like it'd be 15 I was like,

546
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:40.710
I really want to go.

547
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.460
And so she started driving me and like pretty soon after I was making a name for

548
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:47.190
myself on the west coast.
Like there's this little kid,
sounds like a girl.

549
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.880
He's fucking fucking everybody up.
He's like little Munchkin and he's just,

550
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.710
he's insane at the game individually.

551
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:54.450
But obviously you need to be a good team player.

552
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:57.690
So everyone kind of spread my name,
but my mom was,
yeah,
right.

553
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.850
They're driving me to these lands.
I would play,

554
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:03.390
we'd get there at like 10:00 AM in Irvine or something and she would be knitting

555
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:04.860
and hanging out,
go see a movie,
come back,

556
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:09.510
pick me up at 2:00 AM driving home to San Diego.
So crazy.
No,

557
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.690
like starcraft is still a huge game.

558
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.150
That guy's awesome stands for right now.

559
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:19.140
It's probably first league of legends and DOTA and counter strike us three.
Wow.

560
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.220
So Star Trek,
but star trying to hit a plateau.
2012.

561
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.810
What was that about?
I think,
well I don't,
yeah,

562
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:32.100
I don't know that exactly why.
Just twitch really blew it up.

563
00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:33.270
So twitch is streaming,
right?

564
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:37.080
Like you stream twitch blew it up because the twitches of website where people

565
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:41.410
stream the games.
Yeah.
I don't know if you watched the video games being played.

566
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:42.130
It's like Webcam

567
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.210
<v 0>models for gamers where these guys are making thousands and thousands of dollars</v>

568
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:51.211
an hour just for playing video games on twitch and you get tips and donations

569
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:55.100
and all the hips.
So yeah,
exactly.
I work,
uh,

570
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:59.950
in some cases on my d squirt on street.
There was no squirting man.

571
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:04.360
It's been proven Pete.
Okay.
So let me circle around all the things you just said.

572
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.490
The first wording or not r Kelly,

573
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:13.120
one squirting is like the sexual chem trails.
That's what it is.

574
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.840
It's like the people that believe in it,
they won't let it go.
It's real.
Real.

575
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.420
Nope.
It's,
it's like scientists.
No,

576
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.830
it never existed until a few years ago.
All these years,
all these years,

577
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.410
women for all these years we're holding in their p and then someone told them

578
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.020
they don't have to anymore and they started just pinging all over.

579
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:34.360
Guys call on it.
Squirting the baby boomer.
Yeah,

580
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:36.670
I mean that's exactly what's going on.
It's kind of the same thing.

581
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.870
It's that Shit's funny though.
Yeah.
People do a lot of crazy shit for cameras.

582
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:43.990
I started becoming somewhat of a different person when I first started shooting

583
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:46.870
because the chat itself is like,
like a comedian,
right?
Like you get up there,

584
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:50.980
you get high after people's energy of like interacting right with you.

585
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.400
So while you're playing,
do you have a separate monitor that has the chairs,

586
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:59.200
two webcams to monitor their studio mic?
Like this one hanging above me.
A studio,

587
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:00.700
Mike,
while you're playing.
And like I said,

588
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:03.710
I have a high voice I need to like not pierce people's ears.

589
00:31:03.711 --> 00:31:05.200
So you were saying that before the show,

590
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.710
you were saying your voice is so high that if you go,
what the fuck?
Yeah,

591
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:12.740
like any crazy freak people out.
So,
uh,

592
00:31:12.741 --> 00:31:14.890
I dunno how we got to twitch,
but yeah,
twitch is huge.

593
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.480
They got bought by Amazon for $970 million.
What the fuck?
Amazon,

594
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.380
what are you doing with your money?
Yeah,
no,
it's because it's got,

595
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:26.800
so the League of legends finals last year had more viewership I think.

596
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.920
Then the Nhl Stanley Cup and the Roseville combined

597
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.980
what it's going to,
it's the,
it's the future Joe.
It's the added stuff.

598
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.880
Future and fuck.

599
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.900
And facing the add value is so overwhelmingly valuable is because the

600
00:31:41.771 --> 00:31:44.660
interaction,
right?
Everyone's chatting,
they're,
they're,

601
00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:47.670
they're talking directly to it.
When you're on a couch watching a TV.
Yeah.

602
00:31:47.671 --> 00:31:51.310
It got this commercial is fucking dumb or oh,
cool.
Cerebral commercial on twitch.

603
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.190
You're like,
wow,
look at this fucking clown in the commercial.
Oh that's awesome.

604
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:56.850
Or that's a cool product or whatever you're typing,
right?

605
00:31:56.851 --> 00:31:59.080
So the engagement is there.
The stats are there.
You literally,

606
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:02.140
I have on my channel,
I have one button,
I click and I have my demographic.

607
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.090
What countries watch me,
how many hours they watch.

608
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.380
I have all the stats on my page that I can export it to my sponsors or whoever

609
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:12.160
supports my page.
Whoa,
okay,
let's go to this fucking website.

610
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:15.870
We have to investigate every one of our past ones.
I do.
We do.

611
00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:19.000
I'm with Kim all the time.
Watch some real players.

612
00:32:19.001 --> 00:32:21.190
I want to see some real players,
no disrespect,

613
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.920
but I like to see guys actually know what the fuck they're doing.

614
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.200
When you were playing this and you're doing this,
like what's an average viewer?

615
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.570
Like how many,
how many viewers average do you get?
What of these?

616
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.700
I get like four to 5,000 concurrent at a time.
Four or 5,000 is normal.

617
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.290
He made it has pride.
I have a teammate who seems a lot more than me.

618
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:42.610
He gets like 10 to 15,000 okay,
let's watch your game.
What's wedge?
Counterstrike?

619
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.200
So this is all the different games that are available that you can watch.

620
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.750
You could actually watch poker and music now hold on a second.

621
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:51.380
But you can watch poker.
I had guys play poker from their home.

622
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.120
So you watch people play videos,
live video tournaments or yeah,

623
00:32:56.121 --> 00:33:00.140
so when my buddy Griffin is actually huge at poker jaguars,
his name,

624
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:03.140
he used to be a pro cachet player.
He's up like 6 million in poker.

625
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.410
She gone click on one of these and let's see what the fuck goes on.

626
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:08.720
Like how many viewers are,
this guy's from Poland actually,

627
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:13.610
I might have been pulling away live right now.
He's 3000 Jesus Christ.

628
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.260
What's 27 million?
Well that one is overall viewership.
Fucking Christ.

629
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.310
And so this guy is,
this is counterstrike boy though.
The graphics are crude.

630
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:27.560
So it's,
yeah,
it's uh,
so that's an AK 47.
What?
Hold on.

631
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:29.190
Crack his volume of,
what is he saying?

632
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.670
This is to Polish teams.
He's speaking Polish.
This guy's actually Polish.

633
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:37.790
I've met him when I was in a turn and pull in.
Really the team on the right.

634
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:39.980
Virtus pro is like the best team in Poland.

635
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.700
They're playing gamers too for an online lease.

636
00:33:41.701 --> 00:33:43.870
So I guess the graphics are not that important because this is,

637
00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:48.650
it seems really dated older and kind of shakes like compared to the old version

638
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:50.570
of counterstrike.
This is like a big upgrade.

639
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.660
So that's been the thing that's actually kind of made it cool.

640
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.860
Is that because the obviously the crazy of the graphics and the physics doesn't,

641
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.130
the game play itself is less true.
Like you remember playing quake,

642
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.160
how'd that look?
Right.
Like if quake was super modernized,

643
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:08.480
I have a feeling that the integrity of the physics would,
we'd go down hill.
Yeah.

644
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:12.060
Well that was one of the things that people didn't like about the newer games to

645
00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:16.700
the physics changed like quick to changed and then quick three became more like

646
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:19.460
quick to see.
Seeing the chat on the right.
Everyone's going nuts.

647
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.800
A lot of people like a,

648
00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:24.530
a quick three rather became while a quick one because everyone was there

649
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:27.710
feedback quite too.
You did this.
I don't like it.
Go slower.

650
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.270
The thing about quick too is like the movement was slower but the graphics are

651
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:34.520
better.
But then quick three was like sorta the best.

652
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.800
Jamie do you find one of the hot chicks playing counter strike?

653
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:42.690
That's the new thing was the cam girls are now becoming gamer girls and so

654
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.340
that's what I've been training him condom to do and a couple other girls is to

655
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.860
play games and they went around running the movement.

656
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:49.700
Brian and there's all these,

657
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.670
there's all these girls are like we got to stop showing or Cleveland should be

658
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:55.880
taken seriously.
And I'm like no,
show your cleavage.
You'll make money.
Yes.

659
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.730
Now how is he ruining the movement then?
No,

660
00:34:58.731 --> 00:35:01.750
I was joking cause like he was saying pull up on these cam girls.

661
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:05.390
I'm always up Jamie.
Okay.
She's cool.
She gets shit a lot.
This girl,

662
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:06.224
she's from Canada.

663
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.160
I haven't had the kitty plays so she gets shit a lot because she spends a lot of

664
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:12.400
time interacting and not playing.
So he was,

665
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.720
yeah cause she's sitting there chatting but she's an attention whore.
She's not,

666
00:35:16.721 --> 00:35:20.510
no offense.
Right.
So I've met her.
She's a cool person.
She's likes attention.

667
00:35:20.511 --> 00:35:23.060
She knows she probably makes,
I don't know what she makes.

668
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:26.290
This is me just bullshitting.
But she had me smokes 10 to 20 grand a month.
Yeah.

669
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.080
Hold the fuck on.
This girl makes 10 to 20 Glitz,
Glitz,
listen woods.

670
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:34.070
And she also said,
Jeremy,

671
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.010
<v 5>just talk</v>

672
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.510
<v 6>to the chat is this saga</v>

673
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.990
<v 0>if anyone watching Joe Rogan streamer now can you go and kitties chat and say</v>

674
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:45.330
something?
There it is.
I knew they would.

675
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.930
<v 6>All right.
Play some fast cause if you guys want to play with me,</v>

676
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:50.580
this is the best time to come play with me

677
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.920
<v 0>so we can get a Joe Rogan spam in the chat.
Probably just by saying this.</v>

678
00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.480
I'm sure we can chat to you.
Such cute.
Anyway,
there it is powerful Joe Rogan.

679
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.120
So that's why it kind of gets addictive.

680
00:36:01.121 --> 00:36:03.100
You see like I started streaming and people wouldn't be like,

681
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.180
so if you scroll down,
yeah I'll text on the page.

682
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.860
Can you scroll below her?
Oh Jamie.
Text her like you know her as a human being.

683
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.160
Could you scroll down and share?
Like wait,
it says you can tip.
So right.

684
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.860
Does she keep going down?
It'll say like donate somewhere can contribute.

685
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.360
So you the right there,
if you click contribute or make a donation,

686
00:36:22.361 --> 00:36:25.270
any donation of $50 or more will pop up as a fan letter on the stream.

687
00:36:25.271 --> 00:36:28.690
So what people do is they donate $100 to say,
hey kitty,

688
00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:33.370
hope you have a great a day or $5 or $3 or do you have a minimum right?

689
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.680
Scroll back so we can see the chat,

690
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.510
the chat to go see Joe Rogan or going off.
Hey Jordan,
Joe Rogan.

691
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:40.850
See Evan's going off.
Joe,
Joe,

692
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.540
I love this shit is killing.
Oh Paul Elysse can we see what she's saying?

693
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.190
And people can subscribe to you.
Kind of like,
you know,
uh,

694
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:58.010
and you can have like $5 a subscription and if you have like a shit load of

695
00:36:58.011 --> 00:37:01.310
subscribers every month and just,
it can hear both of you guys at the same time.

696
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.100
Turn her off then so we can't hear it.
What are you saying?

697
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:08.210
So you can subscribe to channels,
right?
That's one of the things that you can do.

698
00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:08.660
I like,

699
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:13.660
her subscription is $5 to subscribe to her channel and so every month that

700
00:37:13.971 --> 00:37:16.040
subscription renews.
So she has like,

701
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.420
I mean subscription ten thousand ten thousand people or whatever.

702
00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:24.740
That's what it's like a few thousand a month.
She makes $50,000 a month.

703
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.980
I mean not her was a split the sub with the website,

704
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.480
so some people get a better deal with a lot,

705
00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:32.660
get 50 $52 it's just trying to figure out what's going on.
Yeah.

706
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:33.890
Could go back to her.

707
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.340
<v 6>Okay.</v>

708
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.620
<v 0>Oh yeah,
let's get an olive garden spam going on.
Yeah.</v>

709
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.310
You guys need to tell Katie to do the Flash Bang dance.
No,

710
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.720
<v 6>I don't think he's looking at,</v>

711
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.370
<v 0>tell him Jordan says to you the Flash Bang,
dance it to camera with him.</v>

712
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.190
So me and her had a dance off one land,

713
00:37:52.191 --> 00:37:54.260
so I'm going to try to get her to do this dance.
I can't do it.

714
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.640
Don't mister red pen.
Why am I on it?

715
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.730
<v 6>Nope.
Another,
I swear to God,</v>

716
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:05.580
you're going to get a strongly worded message from me on Twitter.

717
00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.450
<v 0>You're going to get a strongly worded message.</v>

718
00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:11.530
Who's going to get a strongly worded message?
Me Or you?
Hi.
Hi.

719
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.130
<v 6>I guess,
no,</v>

720
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.150
<v 0>she's fine.</v>

721
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.860
We're just tell it did explain to this lovely young lady that we're just trying

722
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:22.910
to figure things out.
What does that,
we can see that.
All right,

723
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.880
let's let's leave her and go to someone that's actually playing a game.

724
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.780
No offense young lady.
But it's really cool how that is.

725
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.620
That's fascinating in what's interesting is that a lot of people like uh,

726
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.650
are using your x boxes like

727
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:41.070
<v 3>to watch Netflix and stuff like that and twitches now on as Xboxes playstations</v>

728
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:46.060
it's on a Roku now.
So people are watching it as TV.

729
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:49.300
I'll go home at the end of the night,
not turn on NBC or ABC.

730
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.830
I'll just watch somebody play counterstrike Paul Asleep.
Cause it's,
it's,
it's,

731
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.660
I like watching video games.

732
00:38:55.661 --> 00:39:00.140
And one of the cool things is that you to have coaches now like in,

733
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.180
in these professional things.

734
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:05.110
And these are good guys that like to watch video games.
Who's funny?

735
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.830
Which I set up pop and makes yeah,
this guy.
So he's kind of like a,

736
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.110
he's just not competitive at all.
He just jokes around.

737
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:12.910
But he makes so much money.

738
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.970
<v 2>And what is he playing?
What cameras right now?
So war the war,
that's,</v>

739
00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:19.820
this is the game that Dunkin had a throwaway three different times.

740
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.340
He had to delete it.
He broke it.
He,

741
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.820
he like took the discs and snap them in half and then went out and bought new

742
00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:27.440
ones.
I'm done man.

743
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.720
<v 3>Click.
So she,
there's three different ways these people make money,
right?</v>

744
00:39:30.721 --> 00:39:33.900
There's the sub service.
This is what she scraped Shin,
right.
Ad Revenue.

745
00:39:33.901 --> 00:39:37.680
So he's got 18,000 years.
He probably makes like a hundred bucks an hour on that.

746
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.220
And then he has donations or whatever.

747
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.150
So this guy in particular had a couple of crazy fans from the Middle East,

748
00:39:45.151 --> 00:39:48.630
like prince dudes that gave him like 50 grand each.
35 grand.

749
00:39:48.631 --> 00:39:53.631
I had one guy from Abu Dhabi give me 10 grand one time on my work just to yeah,

750
00:39:54.481 --> 00:39:59.360
exactly right.
And we had a private,
my free cams.com/jordan right now.
No.

751
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.460
Uh,
he literally was just like,
he liked the counterstrike scene.
He gave,

752
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.260
he gave a Polish counter player 30 grand.

753
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:07.470
He gave one of my teammates 20 grand now that you only got yeah,
I was told.
Okay.

754
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.740
Sounds like Yo,
what the fuck?
It's a fun dude.

755
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.960
When someone gives you that money though,
you don't really know what to say.

756
00:40:12.961 --> 00:40:16.200
Right.
So it just took time for you to get back into quick joke.
No,

757
00:40:16.201 --> 00:40:18.570
it's definitely not heard about.
The addictive

758
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.710
<v 2>was yeah,
I've,
I've uh,
I have addiction issues of,</v>

759
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.970
of avoided him with drugs for the most part,
although some would disagree,
but uh,

760
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.230
I,
I do have them hardcore with games to the point where I avoid games.

761
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.830
But watching this is,

762
00:40:31.831 --> 00:40:35.210
this is a totally different now because these guys are making the money.

763
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.500
I can't believe you have a subscription link there and you click on that and you

764
00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:43.700
can give this cat five bucks a month.
She had out to soda pop in.

765
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:44.623
I fill out of home,

766
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.180
he's got 93 million fucking views on his channel and t 18,000 people watching

767
00:40:51.651 --> 00:40:53.060
right now.
That's incredible.

768
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.460
<v 3>Yeah.
I was actually teaching a kid who,
he's only 10 years old,</v>

769
00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:02.290
I'm friends with uh,
your friends with 10 year olds.
But uh,
he,
he,

770
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:04.810
he questionable.
He wants the same age.

771
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:09.160
Mentally he wants to grow up to be you.
Like that's what he wants to do.
So,

772
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.040
so I was teaching him how to be a twitch host and uh,

773
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.510
me and Jamie will play grand theft auto with him and he would practice,
you know,

774
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:20.140
talking and stuff like that.
And it's amazing that this is now a job.

775
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.770
That kid pulled us up,
pulled us up on,

776
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:27.370
there was an image she pulled up on the screen to show that you did a scene with

777
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:28.720
David spade.
I washed out.

778
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.000
<v 2>What was it called?
Just shoot me.
Yeah,
I did an episode of that.
Yeah,
I watched</v>

779
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.060
<v 7>this episode.
This is hilarious.</v>

780
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.610
Hey fellow,
this is good for this guy though.

781
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:42.590
So he's making money and he's gonna have to show his tips.

782
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.410
He said what's going on?
Well,
who is pissed?

783
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:48.380
Someone else pulling that up in front of him.
It's him.
It's him doing,

784
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:50.930
let's just do this all day and go people,
it's roommate to freak him out.

785
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.660
Um,
so this guy right now is playing this game.

786
00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:00.290
Give us a volume so I can hear how this is going on.
He's not talking.

787
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:07.100
Okay.
Saying let's do it.
So this game you can kind of like lounge.

788
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.010
Loved it.
That's where I know him from

789
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:25.330
Washington when I was like 1215 now.

790
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:31.850
So he asked for more.
Okay,

791
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
so this guy is playing these games and he just talking I guess.

792
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:38.510
And that's why people like him

793
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.940
had Phil Defranco and Youtube.

794
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:47.720
So like people follow someone and they like right now I'm doing this podcast,

795
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.290
people enjoyed it.
This here behind the story.

796
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:53.240
So for him sometimes he'll sit there.

797
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.620
He does every Saturday night he does a 24 hour stream all day.
He plays 24 hours.

798
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.220
He probably does prior and after.
I would say that's stamina.

799
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.000
Was anybody ever jerked off on screen?
If they do get off of twitch,

800
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:06.300
you'd yes and yes.

801
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.520
<v 3>You got in trouble at times I was playing grand theft auto when a girl came over</v>

802
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:16.220
and she just started taking off her top and stuff like that and I forgot that it

803
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:19.940
was twitching because on Xbox live you can be twitching and you totally forget

804
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.850
it's on and then you fall asleep and wake up the next day and your camera's

805
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:26.920
still on.
Oh,
people who are watching you sleep like creepers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

806
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.430
I've done a few times.
Awesome.
Bruce,
but I play different way.

807
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:32.480
I just go in grand theft auto,

808
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:34.340
kill hookers and try to take pictures of their underwear.

809
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.300
<v 7>Have you seen the fucking complaints that people said that the,</v>

810
00:43:39.301 --> 00:43:42.930
there's a hack in grand theft auto where you could verbally rape some or you

811
00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:47.910
could v virtually rape someone.
You haven't seen that with their body freezes.

812
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.180
They can't do anything and get behind them and you start pumping them.

813
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.820
But people like really upset like you know this girl was talking about how she

814
00:43:56.821 --> 00:44:01.410
felt completely violated because her character was trapped and some guy was

815
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.350
like,
isn't that a game where they're allowed to kill you with a fucking crowbar?

816
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:10.080
Like that doesn't freak you out.
But it did mention it.
Yeah,

817
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:12.570
but it's normal.
The sack side.

818
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.380
But the cocaine that I'm selling to buy this car is cool.
Alright,

819
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.460
so how many people are on this twitch thing in any given moment?
Go back to that.

820
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.380
Let's see what like what's the overall they have like more internet traffic then

821
00:44:25.381 --> 00:44:29.310
like most websites like and like they accounted for some huge number.

822
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.960
I'm sure you could look it up of streaming.

823
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.740
Like it's like them youtube and like Netflix.
God Damn,

824
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:37.170
I'm so out of the loop with the shit now the,

825
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:41.300
I want to see what it's like when you're watching people play poker.
Yeah.

826
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.170
So they normally have like six tables and it's really down.

827
00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.820
There's poker right there.
Yeah.

828
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.320
So you go to poker and so these guys are just playing video poker.

829
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.200
So turning to have like a little art click on that car right there.

830
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.300
I don't understand thousand or 4,000 viewers on this.
Quite a bit less.

831
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.580
So quite a bit less people are playing,

832
00:44:59.581 --> 00:45:04.320
he has a million views but quite a bit less than the video games.

833
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.740
So way more people or want to watch people.
Well this is a game.

834
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:08.551
Here's the website,
right?

835
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:11.160
So a lot of people get residual fuse cause people are just looking around for a

836
00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:12.420
Gamer.
Right.

837
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.210
Not a lot of people are just casually looking around for poker player.

838
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.600
Now do you think you could play pool on something like this?

839
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.000
Like digital,
like no actual pool.
Uh,

840
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.400
could you have a remote camera camera set up where you can play actual pool?

841
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:27.780
I don't know their rules.

842
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:30.570
Like if you're a channel who already does other things and then one day he just

843
00:45:30.571 --> 00:45:33.860
had to have a Friday night is pool night.
I think you could,
I think.

844
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.810
I think you can totally do it.
You'd have to talk to them.
Probably talked to him.

845
00:45:37.811 --> 00:45:40.260
I don't want you to like say I'm playing counterstrike and then you're playing

846
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.490
pool seven days a week obviously.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

847
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:48.850
You wouldn't want to get flashing.
Dan called me an n word.
How the area,

848
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.750
obviously that's the one I've concentrated on.
I know that you got right to it.

849
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.710
So this guy's playing for different games at a time.

850
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.700
A lot of those video game poker dude's the real ace as they do that right from

851
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.730
program to keep track of the hands everyone's been playing like on their tables

852
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:08.520
and stuff.
You pay for it because these guys are playing,

853
00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:11.460
they're making good money now.
Played Poker for tables a day.
Right.

854
00:46:11.461 --> 00:46:14.910
And he's so this cat or at a time,
uh,
his playing,

855
00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.260
he's playing for different games at the same time where he's making money on

856
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:24.240
these games are losing money.
Gambling,
gambling.
Yeah.
Now is that legal again?

857
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.600
Like how's that work now?
Cause I know poker like they were for a while.

858
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:31.740
You could play it out of Vegas,
but you got to play people in Vegas online.

859
00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:33.390
I think it's something to do.
I was like Canada.
Okay,

860
00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:35.340
so this guy wrote it pokers new to twitch,

861
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:38.190
but it's growing rapidly with some poker celebrities.

862
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:43.110
Daniel knew Grano [inaudible] who's been streaming?
Jason Summerville.
Oh,

863
00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:47.010
okay.
So it's a new thing.
Some new additional outside of music recently,

864
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.840
like Dj Steve Aoki,
he plays video.

865
00:46:49.841 --> 00:46:53.880
You put a Gopro up on stage and then he does his set at a club and streams it

866
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:59.180
from twitch.
Kevin does it,
but that's not a video game.
Music.

867
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.590
Oh,
I feel like this.

868
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.280
I thought people would be stoked to have you on twitch as a pod.

869
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.370
I can totally connect you with those people too from dude,
we'll do it.
Yeah,

870
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:11.070
why not?
I mean we do use treme.
I'm saying he,
I know there's new,

871
00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:12.840
what did you say?
You got the new tri caster.
You could be like,

872
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.910
could we do use tree men twitch at the same time?
Oh yes we can folks.
All right,

873
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:22.030
we'll do it.
Yeah,
I'll totally killed those people.
Interesting.

874
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.320
Interesting.
Uh,

875
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.190
Kevin pair has a stage at his new studio and he will have like concerts and

876
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.340
he'll be playing the drums

877
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.820
<v 3>and stuff on twitch now and shit.
How many people are wanting a lot?</v>

878
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.970
Kevin has a full studio where he does at gaming.
Uh,

879
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:40.580
and on one he does podcasts.
How many people watch when he's like,

880
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.720
I haven't watched it.
I just,
he's just telling me about it.
Okay,

881
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:47.500
let's see some other,
uh,
video games.
See what else we got here.

882
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.700
This is fascinating man.
This is a completely new world to me.
Jamie.

883
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.000
We show him call of duty.
So this is kind of professional

884
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.060
<v 0>but not really professional retainer.
Right?
But you,</v>

885
00:47:58.061 --> 00:48:00.460
you're playing and you're making money.

886
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.010
Like I'm a part time streamer cause I still compete.
She,

887
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:06.430
I think the genius of this is the whole donation thing.

888
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.500
The genius of this is getting people to donate and the,

889
00:48:09.501 --> 00:48:12.100
the fact that these guys can,
so how else can they make money?

890
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:14.570
They can make money by subscriptions.
Subscriptions.

891
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.610
That's like you could run your salary if you have 2000 subs consistently and it

892
00:48:18.611 --> 00:48:23.140
fluctuated.
It's always four 99 well,
some people negotiate,
I think it to six,

893
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:23.951
but you split that.

894
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:28.951
So like the average person gets 50% I get 70% of the top people get like 90%

895
00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:34.240
like there's guys that have a shitload of subs and they play all day.
Wow.

896
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:34.810
So they,

897
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:39.810
they get 90% so this guy named lyric or I $4 out of the five at 80% and uh,

898
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.160
um,
he has like around 10,000 subs as of last month.

899
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.130
So that's automatically 40 grand a month.
He's making Jesus.
Yes.

900
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:51.910
From his subs and then donations.
That's a half a million dollars a year.
Oh yeah.

901
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:55.280
He makes,
he owed her a half a million dollars credible that has it.

902
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.110
And he's doing that all on t on twitch while getting his bachelor's in computer

903
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:03.460
science.
That's amazing.
Fast has graduated.
Congratulations Dude.

904
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:07.780
Fuck yeah.
So that guy doesn't even have to be the best of the best.
No,
that's,

905
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.030
and that's the thing is the entertainment value.
Yeah.

906
00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.430
One around interactive numbers.

907
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.220
81 million people have watched him.

908
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.670
He's not even on right now in this people in this chat room.
Oh my God.

909
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.660
81 million because fucking credible.
Yeah.

910
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.480
Your chat becomes like a community home for people.

911
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:28.300
So they literally will hang out in there.
See,
and you could like,

912
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.150
you have all these little emotive con,
see how it's got like a little cat face,

913
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:31.990
that's his icon.

914
00:49:31.991 --> 00:49:35.230
You can paste all sorts of dumb little things and it comes like a fun way for

915
00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:38.530
people to,
there'll be in someone else's chat and they'll spam my emo TACAN like

916
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.960
nothing.
That's fucking incredible.
Uh,
now,

917
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.660
<v 3>no,
I'm really intrigued.</v>

918
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.660
It's interesting because they really took the formula from porn,
you know,

919
00:49:48.661 --> 00:49:52.700
porn noise starts off first in the always invented first and then they moved it

920
00:49:52.701 --> 00:49:55.860
into like having their donations and the chat room and all that stuff.

921
00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:59.730
My Free Cams.
But the hot girl thing is huge.

922
00:49:59.731 --> 00:50:02.340
So that's why I've been trying to get all the girls on here to do it.
Uh,

923
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:06.420
playing video games in the mouth,
Bro.
I like it.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's a career now.

924
00:50:06.421 --> 00:50:07.081
Like these girls,

925
00:50:07.081 --> 00:50:10.170
like especially at porn stars when they get to an end of their porn star life,

926
00:50:10.171 --> 00:50:12.030
they're like,
what am I going to do now?
I have no job.

927
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:15.270
Start playing Mario brothers.
I'm sure you can fucking make

928
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:22.920
diction.
So let's go to another one.
Jamie was interesting.

929
00:50:22.921 --> 00:50:25.980
This lyric guy.
I like that.
I love what he's doing.

930
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.100
So how did that get so big?

931
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.470
<v 7>Why is he so big?
Um,
some of it's a domino snowball.
Killer player.
Yeah.</v>

932
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:36.410
He plays all sorts of games.
He's got a radio voice.
So let me see before you did,

933
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.150
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Go down.
I want to see what other games are available.

934
00:50:39.151 --> 00:50:41.990
But this is grand theft.
So he's got a radio voice.
Oh,
I'm just the lear.

935
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:43.560
He actually doesn't even have a Webcam.

936
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.250
It blows my mind how popular is without even a camera.
It's a,

937
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.960
nobody knows what he looks like.
Well they do,

938
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:50.780
cause he's shown up at a couple of conventions.
Oh.

939
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:53.180
So they take pictures and we know him.
They know him.

940
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:57.980
That exactly shows up with a fucking,
one of those guy Fawkes masks.
Um,
let's see,

941
00:50:57.981 --> 00:51:00.550
scroll down.
Call of duty poker called,

942
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.500
what is h one z one that was made by Sony.

943
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:06.200
It's like a survival Zombie.

944
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.200
Like it's like a shitty version of grand theft auto.

945
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.220
You run around like a mass world.
Okay.
Is this a game?
I'd never heard of.

946
00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:15.590
How many people are watching this cat when he's playing?

947
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.890
He's a new partner and 1000 yen,

948
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.960
which is pretty good for like an average person and you're going to be able to

949
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:24.160
turn that into like a moderate small day job and not have to and he's got

950
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.400
277,000 instead of working at Starbucks here,

951
00:51:28.401 --> 00:51:30.980
a low level twitch streamers,
right?
Yeah.
So okay.

952
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:33.080
This guy's probably making a couple grand a month,

953
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:35.860
maybe a thousand bucks a month.
He's got a subscriber button.
So yeah,

954
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.570
maybe if he's working hard at me.
So maybe a plate pays for his rent.

955
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.250
There you go.
Yeah.
Wow.

956
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:44.390
And so this is a weird game where it's a third person thing and you're running

957
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:47.990
around,
you're fighting zombies and he's okay,
this is a stupid game.

958
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.760
Bull ring.
All right.
What else can I scroll down but I want,

959
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:54.500
I want to see what games are available.

960
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:58.650
Not just grand theft auto games available every day of quake on here.
Yeah.

961
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.340
Let me see that.
I go to that.
You could pretty much play at any single game.

962
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:05.210
People the off.
Hello Jesus.
If people are playing,

963
00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:09.230
the game would be here quick.
I love,
I could,

964
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:12.950
I should text my quake friends in it.
It's a dead game,
Huh?
Yeah,

965
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:16.640
but I love watching quick.
I went to QuakeCon a couple of times in Texas.
Oh,

966
00:52:16.641 --> 00:52:20.030
it's incredible.
Halflife still available,
Huh?
No,
it keeps growing.

967
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.210
Let's see it as a type quake in the top left and see if that pops up.

968
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.570
A lot of weird games that never even heard of.

969
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.980
I mean how does someone even create a new game now when these people get so

970
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:35.690
addicted to the chess?
Chess is video chats.
Is that what it is?

971
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:39.470
Like how chest is like a wizard?
Everyone else's like a young kid.

972
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.760
Remember Chattel chest,
chest,
chest,

973
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.340
where it was the box where they,
where they would,
they were like fighter.

974
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:50.150
It was like a game that was for like early computers and it was chess,

975
00:52:50.151 --> 00:52:53.510
but the guys weren't be nights and it would be animated and they would like cut

976
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:57.530
the other person in house rather than hot
tea.

977
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.450
Oh yeah.
Technology all over the place playing quake life.

978
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.730
Can you watch the video team?
Deathmatch

979
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:17.030
Jean Stream Jean.
So is that what this is?

980
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:22.070
We're going to watch a stream.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yup.
That's it.
See you like this.

981
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.710
The of graphics are quite a bit better in this than they are the counter strike.

982
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:27.600
But even this is old.
This is quick three

983
00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.560
<v 1>dude.
I love this shit though.</v>

984
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.680
My favorite term is to watch back when we were like the painkiller quake.

985
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:34.083
Unreal tournament.

986
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:39.040
<v 7>Well what's interesting to me,
you know these games they,</v>

987
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:44.070
it seems like you get hooked on one and that one game becomes your shit,

988
00:53:44.531 --> 00:53:49.150
but then you run the risk of being left behind because the new games come out.

989
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.010
<v 1>So I think the more legitimate thing each sports gets,</v>

990
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.820
obviously there's more interest for the game developers to keep their game

991
00:53:56.821 --> 00:53:59.520
lasting.
Right.
Whereas in the past it was like by the new game,

992
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.490
how are we going to make money?
We need to come out with a new game.

993
00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:05.130
So people buy it.
But now there's way more ways for them to make money.

994
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.010
So in counterstrike,
you could change the way your AK 47 links.

995
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:13.020
Now you can put a blue dragon decal on it and you pay the $5 should I d
calories,

996
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:16.680
$30 or $2 right?
Depending on how rare the decal is.

997
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.390
And that is used to crowd fund for them to make money and for us to have

998
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.990
tournaments.
So valve now the creators,

999
00:54:22.991 --> 00:54:26.640
the counterstrike hosts a quarter million dollar tournament like every couple of

1000
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.430
months from the money they get from the micro economy they created for

1001
00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:30.264
counterstrike.

1002
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.540
<v 7>This is insane.
That's why legal legends was</v>

1003
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.001
<v 1>big.</v>

1004
00:54:34.001 --> 00:54:37.780
Right now they sell these trinkets and garbs and things for your character and

1005
00:54:37.781 --> 00:54:39.820
they make like $50 million a month or whatever.

1006
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:44.210
<v 7>The world of video.
Don't call me on that.
But I,
I,
I get your point.</v>

1007
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.500
The world of video games is so,
it's so interesting.
So alien to me,

1008
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:51.230
but I had no idea it was this deep and involved.

1009
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.410
It's grown a lot with websites like twitch really combined.

1010
00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:58.550
How many of them are there besides twitch?
That no,
twitch dominates that realm.

1011
00:54:58.551 --> 00:55:02.720
There's like hit box,
Mlg TV majorly gave me TV.
Uh,

1012
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:07.790
Zubu TV.
There's a couple,
but no one's really has the reach that to a chess.

1013
00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.130
Somebody just said that Kevin Prayer is twitching right now.

1014
00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:12.260
We're playing a video game.
Okay.
Go to Kevin for,

1015
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.290
he's twitch.tv/the attack.

1016
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.070
<v 8>Yeah.
See if this works.</v>

1017
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:23.960
<v 7>Okay.
Let's see.
Not a hero and other stuff with Alex.

00:55:23.961 --> 00:55:26.890
Yep.

1020
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.570

I'm sorry.
I don't know.
This.</v>

1021
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:34.670
Kevin Pereira was the host of attack of the show.
Uh,

1022
00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:39.690
g four network daily objective.
He's asking,
he's a very bright man.
Enter.

1023
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:44.640
Why didn't as beautiful complexion and excellent bone structure looking that

1024
00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.180
jawline boom happening.

1025
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.080
<v 8>What's your nonexempt team?
That's the one cop.
Did they dispatch a shot?</v>

1026
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:53.130
That dude in the face so much.
Oh no,
he's got a partner.
Oh,

1027
00:55:53.131 --> 00:55:55.850
he's only got a couple hundred viewers had shot my blogs.

1028
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.810
You don't let them use that on yet.
Sorry Bud.

1029
00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.490
<v 7>He only has a couple of a hundred viewers cause he just got on right now.
Kevin.</v>

1030
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.790
Oh they're saying Joe's watching now.
Hi Kevin.
Hi Joe.

1031
00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:11.170
Say Hi fellow Brian redbeds and we should go back to history and uh,

1032
00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.120
and that was it.

1033
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:16.390
C nine pro Gamer guy knows Gamer guy.

1034
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:21.630
What a weird world we live in that respect to the CS go communities funny.

1035
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.183
We loved that.

1036
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.140
<v 8>Hello cancer that go around it.</v>

1037
00:56:28.141 --> 00:56:33.010
So is that Kevin's studio that we're looking at in the corner?
Yeah,
this is cave.

1038
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.900
This is one part of his studio.

1039
00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:38.440
This is where he does all his twitch gaming and stuff in his podcast.

1040
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:41.860
And now the first thing you think of it in all these rooms,

1041
00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:44.290
just like where did they rub one out?
Like what part of the room?

1042
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:50.080
He's going to have the script on us.
You motherfucker.

1043
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.090
Oh Shit.
Screen on Rogan.
All right,
how can we do this?
Let's enter the Matrix.

1044
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:58.780
We can somehow,
there's a lag though.
Unfortunately.

1045
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:00.220
It's probably like seven to 10 seconds.

1046
00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.740
Looking at it as an open the floodgate of racist

1047
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:12.700
racist stuff.
It's always racist stuff for some reason.

1048
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.620
How do you sub domain?
I subscribers left.

1049
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.340
There we go.
Oh,
not logged in then.
Joe Rogan won't see the studio.

1050
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.050
I want to see your studio.
The studio.
Oh,
how cool.
This is getting way confusing.

1051
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.560
This is so bizarre.
This is like two mirrors facing each other.
Ooh,
Nice.

1052
00:57:29.561 --> 00:57:30.990
Sharat your shirt sir.

1053
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.110
And get that a tall Kevin Pereira with the dope studio.

1054
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.520
Let me go full screen.
Go full screen on the Cam.
Look at that.
Hey Kevin,

1055
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:41.950
we're finally getting to hear you now.

1056
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.310
Oh this is dope
podcast table.

1057
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.780
Oh Nice.
Alex the band room.
But I don't even know how we get up to ban the room.

1058
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:56.380
Alright.
Alright.
Sprint.
This is a place he's renting.

1059
00:57:56.381 --> 00:58:00.820
They need like a USB extension cord.
Walk me.
Look at this.
This is hilarious.
Boy,

1060
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:02.560
this is so bizarre watching Kevin.

1061
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.730
So we're watching Kevin Pereira and it's the attack on,

1062
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.980
on twitch.
We'll get it gone.

1063
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.410
They see you're hearing too far in Los flicks,
Bro.
Is Fuck today backward.

1064
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:24.100
That was brought out.
Wow.
This is very strange

1065
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.190
Joe.
Just wait,
I'm going to give you the,

1066
00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.760
wow,
this is interesting.
Oh,

1067
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:37.600
so he's freaking me out.
Now we've got the

1068
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.000
bar
watching US watching them.

1069
00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:47.470
This is fucking range.
I think we can time travel somehow.

1070
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:49.840
I think we just did.
Look what we're doing here.

1071
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:54.280
We're showing his dick again back to his tablet.
Joe's got a full head of hair.

1072
00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:57.010
What's good?
This is all so bizarre.

1073
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:00.640
It's like a mailbox or whatever that movie was my voice.
She's got deeper.

1074
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:06.360
So this is Kevin's studio and he plays video games out of here as well.

1075
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:10.690
Yeah.
This is his twitch room in his podcast room on this side.

1076
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:16.090
And then on the other side,
Yaz.
Oh Jesus got word.
Oh,

1077
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.840
let's see which one is real now I don't even know what twins.
Wow.

1078
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.370
The one on the lower right hand corner is real time.

1079
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.780
<v 7>The one on the left is like what he's getting from us on Ustream.</v>

1080
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.900
So the left one is the use treme one cause it's a delay.

1081
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:33.680
And the one on the lower right is real time.
Wow.
This is crazy.

1082
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.130
He's got a sweet setup man.
Yeah.
Again,

1083
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:41.430
he's going to show his dick pics.
It's the same thing though,

1084
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:43.490
over and over again.
Now this is like the,

1085
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:46.760
why is the three different levels in the bottom?
I don't know.

1086
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.620
So does he have a bunch of employees or something?

1087
00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:51.730
<v 8>Oh yeah,
he's got,
he's got a full staff over there.</v>

1088
00:59:51.731 --> 00:59:53.200
I mean they have been the one receptionist there.

1089
00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:55.840
They play video games and live the life.
But why is it,

1090
00:59:55.841 --> 00:59:59.810
why does he have a reception?
What's the receptionist?
Therefore,
uh,

1091
00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:03.580
just to play video games and stuff like that.
So,
so here's,
here's,
here's one.

1092
01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:08.170
Here's second room.
So this is where he plays pinball and whose ball?

1093
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.800
It's a bunch of couches.
It's also has a humongous green screen on the side.

1094
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.850
Here's this kitchen area,
which is like a bar in the middle.
Here's this bar here.

1095
01:00:15.851 --> 01:00:17.770
You can just turn it up.
People like,
Oh yeah.

1096
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.970
So this is always a pool table like this.

1097
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:26.100
Wow,
this is the best room.
Right.

1098
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:32.720
<v 7>Well,
okay,
this is really fascinating.
Oh Kevin,</v>

1099
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.370
<v 8>that's a whole recordings get hit to set up.</v>

1100
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.670
He's not messing around 30 sessions and whatnot.
Oh my God.

1101
01:00:38.671 --> 01:00:43.671
His placements to be huge and these walls are Joe rolled out because we have

1102
01:00:44.731 --> 01:00:48.480
issues and then Loungy sorta hang out area,

1103
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.720
but we can also unlatch the big barn doors here and push 'em out.

1104
01:00:51.721 --> 01:00:55.990
They just push out and we have room for like 150 people.
So he has shows there.

1105
01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.870
Yeah.
He has live shows,
concerts and stuff.

1106
01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:01.740
Invites his friends and Fam Dicks we can die.
Wow.

1107
01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:06.610
This is crazy.
Kevin Pereira has taken it to the next level by himself.

1108
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:11.400
Wow.
So he has all these people that work for him.

1109
01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:15.060
Like tell us how generating revenue twitch baby,

1110
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.650
really switch podcasting.

1111
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.490
All of the sudden some other shows they do and some production to do for other

1112
01:01:20.491 --> 01:01:21.324
companies.

1113
01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:26.240
<v 7>They have a whole production company.
Haven't done my podcast.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1114
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.870
In the studio.
We'll hang out and whatnot.
Okay.
All right.

1115
01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:34.610
Well tell Kevin I said thanks pretty dope.
Wow,
this is amazing.

1116
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:39.510
He's got like 10 fucking people working for them.
The,

1117
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:43.670
this is so strange.
Kevin took it to the next level.
That's pretty bad ass.
Yeah.

1118
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:48.671
He took what we did and went like five steps beyond one's step beyond.

1119
01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:52.620
That's the problem guys.

1120
01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:57.000
<v 8>Uh,
when you start showing where you live.
Yeah.
It's the one other side of things.</v>

1121
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.500
We've had bad experiences at that.
What have you had like swatting?
Oh,

1122
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.200
I fucking hate them.

1123
01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.910
Swatting is known as a pretty funny video of actually on youtube of them

1124
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.260
cleaning my room with like,
oh,
so you,
that actually happened with you?

1125
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.860
That was you or oh,
right.
So while you were playing a game,

1126
01:02:13.861 --> 01:02:16.650
someone called the Swat team on the fuck.

1127
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.100
I started kids,
people ordering the pizzas

1128
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.410
<v 0>at first and like shit and not paying for it.
Right.</v>

1129
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.750
So they wouldn't pay for them.
I get my speeches,
sorry guys,

1130
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:27.450
here's a couple of bucks.
You wasted your time.
Can I have that pizza?

1131
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.260
They would leave firetruck.
Stan would next like,
oh,

1132
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:36.210
they said your house is burning down.
Obviously it's not
like a month later.

1133
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:39.270
I'm just chilling and this is so,
yeah,
I'm in my room right here.

1134
01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:41.070
I see my dad out in front of walk down the street.
I was like,

1135
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.220
I started an alarm but it's not loud now.
So what's going on?
I said guys,

1136
01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:48.900
I'll be right back.
I was playing the game and uh,

1137
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.950
this is like 10 20 minutes later.
Oh my God.

1138
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.610
So there's a pretty funny edited version.
I don't know if this is the one.

1139
01:02:56.611 --> 01:03:00.960
So they don't know right now that this isn't real.
I even told them,

1140
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:02.940
cause they were about to come in with the canine unit,
I was like,
yeah,

1141
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:05.220
there's a couple of cats in there.
Can you just chill in the canine units?
They,

1142
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.740
we're looking for dead bodies.
We can adhere to like what you want.
I was like,

1143
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:09.210
guys,
you're getting pranked her now.

1144
01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:11.430
Like look me up on Youtube while you guys are storming the house.

1145
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:12.330
Like you're getting pranked.

1146
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:16.290
Like I have no data to tell them that they're getting some calls.
Christ,

1147
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.600
they're coming in with fucking guns.

1148
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:22.100
And they had me and my dad in handcuffs on the end of the day.
So,

1149
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.040
so someone called and said I had murdered my neighbor and had someone else

1150
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:31.041
hostage and they call it through like a proxy DNS or whatever and or you know,

1151
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:35.040
uh,
what did they call it?
A VPN.
So you can't trace where they call from.

1152
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:40.410
So did you give out your fun or did someone,
someone uh,
they,
I guess my,

1153
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.870
someone found my Skype username and then traced the log for all the calls that

1154
01:03:43.871 --> 01:03:45.690
are,
where are they cause most frequently from.

1155
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.340
And if they just like triangulated my house Ip address and then they did

1156
01:03:50.341 --> 01:03:53.340
something called doxxing where they get everything about my house and my

1157
01:03:53.341 --> 01:03:58.110
personal info.
That's amazing.
Yeah,
that's a real issue,
right,

1158
01:03:58.111 --> 01:04:01.560
with the swatting,
I've seen that on TV a bunch of times.

1159
01:04:01.561 --> 01:04:03.210
It was like real celebrities that I supposedly,

1160
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:05.100
he's like a big issue because it happens all the time.

1161
01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:10.110
Little things like this word for me also I had to do is after I just talked to

1162
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:12.840
the police chief,
I was like,
guys,
this happened a couple of times,

1163
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:15.120
like please don't respond like this again.
Like here's my number.
Right,

1164
01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:16.530
but then what if somebody wants a murder you?

1165
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:18.810
So what they do is they said they have to send one guy

1166
01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.850
every time,
but someone could just do this all day long.

1167
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.290
So they put a little asterisk,

1168
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.690
they said near my house address and they have a message for their crew.

1169
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.540
It's a little protocol now.
Wow.
That'd be scary as fuck man.
Okay,

1170
01:04:33.541 --> 01:04:37.320
let's get out of this.
That'd be scary as fuck.
Yeah.
Well to be honest,

1171
01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:40.500
I actually knew what was happening right away cause it wasn't scary.

1172
01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.320
So my dad was kind of your mouth,
but I walked out to see what's going on.

1173
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:44.340
And Ray went out with my friend door.

1174
01:04:44.341 --> 01:04:46.980
I as you saw something like a tank top and shorts and if you had a dog they

1175
01:04:46.981 --> 01:04:49.650
could've shot.
That's,
and I've talked about that to France.

1176
01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:53.340
I would have been so fucking furious if any animal of mine was killed.

1177
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:57.870
But luckily my rattle,
everybody,
no,
no dogs.
They're my rattle.
I wasn't there,

1178
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:01.350
but that's not normal.
It's a lot of times people over the dog inside the house,

1179
01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.630
they come inside,
they'll just shoot your dog.
Yeah.

1180
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:05.630
And they'll kick down the door.
So like I said,
luckily they,

1181
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:08.520
they were at the end of the block when I walked out and I looked and I see all

1182
01:05:08.521 --> 01:05:11.820
these guys went in bushes and tree lines and 16 is point at me.
I was like,

1183
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:16.100
Oh fuck.
Douchebags God damn man,

1184
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.980
I don't give shit.
Walked down the center

1185
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.450
<v 1>of the street.
I'm like,
cool,
I'm doing it.
Oh my God.
Yeah.</v>

1186
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.870
But yeah,
that's the worry is like,
what if no one is home?
I'm home alone.

1187
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:26.411
I have my dog,

1188
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:30.340
I'm chilling in my apartment and they come up and fucking blow my window and

1189
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:32.660
kicked down the door.
They see me like they,

1190
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.710
maybe they see my expression like surprised or angry cause I just died in the

1191
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:39.100
game.
Or I say,
hey,
bombed down,
buttoned down.
And,
and then they're at the,

1192
01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:41.470
they're at the door behind me while I'm communicating that to my teammates.

1193
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:44.050
They busted in the door and fucking club me over the head or something.

1194
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.340
How often does this happen?

1195
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:49.030
So there is another video actually someone online who got more surprised where

1196
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:52.270
he realized he,
he's being funny.
It's like,
Oh shit,
people are carrying my house.

1197
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:54.410
I think I'm getting swatted.
And they kind of like do that.

1198
01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.450
I've seen a few of them now.
There's no way to get stomped on.

1199
01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:01.390
I mean how could they stop that right now with current technology?

1200
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:05.020
Well like I said,
it only wants,
it's happened at that address they have,

1201
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:10.021
they have a protocol then about don't have one of the kids who put supposedly

1202
01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:10.841
did it to me,

1203
01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:14.910
he got caught and they caught him cause he did 18 different swatting from Vegas

1204
01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:19.690
in 19 year old kid from Vegas he sends to five years.
Oh my God.

1205
01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:23.650
He's doing jail time cause he's 19 Oh my God.

1206
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.650
It's the same type of kids who do those denial of service attacks.

1207
01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:27.700
It's a big problem.
Gaming,

1208
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:30.040
you know the DDOSS Oh we made they flood your Internet.

1209
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:33.190
They can do if they drive here and I'm sure junk had it before.

1210
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.730
It's like I try to picture of the person that like what kind of like gang

1211
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:40.060
initiation of nerds and they're all like circle jerk and in like some kind of

1212
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:43.940
like tech lab.
Does Haldir fury deed or no,

1213
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.950
I got to stock Candyman Candyman it's like talking about fortune to stop and

1214
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:52.710
change the topic.
Let's talk about 14 what's your favorite flavor?
Pieces of fast?

1215
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:56.830
<v 7>Many to me that we're in this weird world where all this stuff is kind of going</v>

1216
01:06:56.831 --> 01:07:01.060
on at the same time like the DNA,
the interaction of this twitch stuff.

1217
01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:02.950
Go back to the twitch website again.

1218
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.780
I find this the most fascinating because this seems to me to be almost better

1219
01:07:07.781 --> 01:07:10.750
than professional gaming,
like being good at it.

1220
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.980
It seems like what you need to do is be like that lyric guy and just be kind of

1221
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:18.030
entertaining.
What does that guy skill level.
He's like really good.

1222
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.390
Keep scrolling down.
We see with other games,

1223
01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.170
<v 1>the decision between being a streamer and a pro Gamer is mostly pride,
right?</v>

1224
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:27.760
Like you compete and you want to win and considered good at something and you

1225
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:33.040
what's created and you travel around a lot.
What's that?
What's creative?
Creative.

1226
01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.660
Oh,
drawing.
Drawing.

1227
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:40.280
<v 7>Come on.
Their video games is someone drawing people drawing and go there.</v>

1228
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.130
Let's see.
This mind occupied.

1229
01:07:43.131 --> 01:07:47.480
How many people are watching this guy draw 30 people who's got 59 was the game

1230
01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:50.170
development one.
Two people watching people.
This actually got it guys.

1231
01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.610
A talented artist.
Yeah.
So you get to watch him draw.

1232
01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:53.810
And is he drawing in Photoshop?

1233
01:07:53.811 --> 01:07:56.310
Is that what's going on or is it taking close to it?
Hmm,

1234
01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:59.730
<v 1>like the popularity of periscope is based on the same formula.</v>

1235
01:07:59.731 --> 01:08:04.260
Also everyone having their own TV shows.
Subscribing do is feed back chat rooms.

1236
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:05.910
All this stuff is the future.

1237
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
<v 7>Now he's doing this with a Wycombe like one of those tablets drawn pretty calm.</v>

1238
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.560
You can just broadcast anything from your computer almost.

1239
01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.900
It's just a matter of if they're going to allow you to put it on their service

1240
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.780
is bullshit.
Let's storm this cause chat 28 people we have on blow up.

1241
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.890
They haven't heard us yet.
There it goes.
Bam.
It takes like 15 seconds there.

1242
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:29.210
It keeps your whole day.
Your whole chats on you might have 500 in there,

1243
01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:33.800
but it won't refresh yet.
Asked for permission before posting a link.

1244
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:38.290
Purge.
Oh my God.
Racism again.

1245
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:41.840
But that's how he didn't say the n word because he uses the number one instead

1246
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:45.360
of an eye.
So it's okay.
Yeah,
you have to do the filter.
Wow.
This is,

1247
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.980
this n word thing is rude.

1248
01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:50.810
I can someone please call me a spic or maybe even a chink in the game.

1249
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.520
Just a tired of the n word.

1250
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:56.360
That's one thing that's weird about the gaming community with like Xbox live or

1251
01:08:56.361 --> 01:09:00.770
online chat or anything.
It's just racist and like there's no,

1252
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.470
there's no like everyone's a racist on Xbox live.
So the,

1253
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.500
because it's forbidden right now.
Let me ask you this,

1254
01:09:07.501 --> 01:09:11.450
so what was your take on this whole Gamergate thing?
Did that affect you at all?

1255
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:13.610
Or You were like,
what are you nerds fighting over?

1256
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.660
And for folks who don't know what Gamer Gate was,
you know it's,

1257
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:22.900
I kinda started out as some sort of a fight over online journalism and became

1258
01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:28.340
some thing about feminism and social justice warriors and all kinds of
craziness.

1259
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:31.580
Yeah.
That was honestly,
I don't even know the whole story I heard,

1260
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:35.630
I only heard about it partially because people were talking about the female

1261
01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:36.291
side of things.

1262
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:39.440
And I remember a lot of the companies I worked with immediately I started

1263
01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:40.760
changing the direction of marketing.

1264
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.930
They're like put females and all of our adverts like Kaylee cause they want it

1265
01:09:44.931 --> 01:09:49.930
to be like we supported female gamers.
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Really?
Yeah.

1266
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.990
So patronizing.
Yeah.

1267
01:09:51.991 --> 01:09:55.100
I don't need this taste fishy with companies but I saw a lot of these east

1268
01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:58.080
sports companies like instead of having a guy wearing the gaming headset,

1269
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:59.870
it wasn't a girl now like by the way,

1270
01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:03.860
like we do like gamers or girl gamers rather.
So,

1271
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.030
so their response to it was to said they're supportive of female gaming,

1272
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:10.380
supporting girls streamers.
On tuition.

1273
01:10:10.381 --> 01:10:14.000
It's the whole thing was just so bizarre because it all happened at a one gow

1274
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:18.110
was banging some dude who was a story.
I never really know.

1275
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:20.720
It's legendary.
It's like the story of Jesus.

1276
01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:23.060
It's like a bunch of different versions of it,
you know,

1277
01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:28.040
all the way back to Thor to fill think.
It's very strange.

1278
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:29.780
It's very strange when you have these,

1279
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:32.930
these little satellite communities and they branch off and they,

1280
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:35.020
they do battle with each other.
Yeah.

1281
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:38.060
I tried to watch one of those two minute videos that explained to everything and

1282
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:42.320
I couldn't even figure it out.
I've tried,
I couldn't,
I just couldn't tolerate it.

1283
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.780
It was just so nonsensical.
But uh,

1284
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.560
it was like a lot of it just seemed like,
you know,

1285
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.070
it seemed like there was a lot of bullshit on both sides,
you know.

1286
01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.770
So you didn't even pay attention like the hardcore gamers,

1287
01:10:54.771 --> 01:10:56.210
like you're like so insulated,

1288
01:10:56.211 --> 01:11:00.300
deepen the hive that you didn't even hear the rumbling outside my manager's,

1289
01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:04.070
yeah,
exactly.
My managers from like the,
I play on a team called cloud nine.

1290
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:08.540
They were talking about it cause it was like their sponsors discussed with them

1291
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.560
about what it was.
But I didn't hear about it until after it's happened.

1292
01:11:10.561 --> 01:11:13.740
I was like,
wait,
what was this thing?
Oh well we try and say Jamie.

1293
01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:15.130
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1294
01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:18.510
<v 3>strong went offline.
What?
Everyone in the chat made him go off line base.</v>

1295
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:21.740
Oh he's angry.

1296
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:26.390
His mind's no longer occupied.
No,
it's 319 people watching though.

1297
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:30.920
I killed the stream.
There's a,
there's a cool video on youtube.

1298
01:11:30.921 --> 01:11:34.190
I don't know Jamie,
I can send you this video.

1299
01:11:34.191 --> 01:11:37.580
Somebody just sent me of somebody getting robbed while twitching.

1300
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:41.240
So there are twitching.
And then in the background you see him getting robbed?

1301
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:45.650
Like someone's stealing things from their house.
Yeah.
Here Jamie.
That girl right?

1302
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:48.680
I just sent it.
So they're playing and behind them people are stealing things.

1303
01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:52.190
Yeah.
It's a girl.
Pretty cute girl.
Looks like she doesn't even know

1304
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.900
<v 0>you.
Stuff like that.
How many people are faking things like that?</v>

1305
01:11:56.110 --> 01:12:00.490
Just to get people to watch them.
Okay.
So we're kind of getting off track here.

1306
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:01.211
Um,

1307
01:12:01.211 --> 01:12:05.700
so just twitch thing seems like a viable source of revenue obviously cause real.

1308
01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.960
But if you bank on that sort of same thing as like your dad was saying like this

1309
01:12:10.961 --> 01:12:13.540
is a volatile industry that you're entering into.

1310
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.720
The one thing I will give people who go big on twitch that ways as you see like

1311
01:12:16.721 --> 01:12:20.050
lyric,
he doesn't necessarily have a marriage to one game.

1312
01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:23.170
So when a new game comes out is falling,
it's just like fuck it,

1313
01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:26.020
go play that game and we'll be entertained.
So that's the benefit.

1314
01:12:26.021 --> 01:12:28.240
And that's why I have dabbled in streaming.

1315
01:12:28.241 --> 01:12:32.440
I'm not a full time streamer but I could pay my bills with streaming and I go on

1316
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:34.480
there and I tried to stream when I don't have to like a big chunk.

1317
01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:38.830
You could pay your bills with streaming.
Wow.
That is fucking crazy.

1318
01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:41.230
So you could just for a goof you could say,

1319
01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.240
oh you know like some people have like a little side job like that.

1320
01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:47.290
Your side job could be streaming and that could like pay for your rent.
Yeah,

1321
01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:50.880
definitely.
And the cool thing is obviously it's your own hours.

1322
01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:53.950
Just being an Uber driver or something.
Exactly.

1323
01:12:53.951 --> 01:12:55.800
But way more money than a new Uber driver will.

1324
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.420
And the tips drivers don't get donation.
Yeah,

1325
01:12:58.421 --> 01:13:01.660
you don't get 10 grand from some dudes and two by.
Exactly.
Wow.

1326
01:13:01.661 --> 01:13:05.860
That is amazing that this is a world that I just was not aware of and so girls

1327
01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:09.370
do it and they do it because like hot girls can do it and they don't even have

1328
01:13:09.371 --> 01:13:12.190
to be good at games.
But there's all that,
there's a lot of girls who like,

1329
01:13:12.191 --> 01:13:15.280
cause there's not a lot of girl pro gamers like counter shake.
Like I don't know,

1330
01:13:15.281 --> 01:13:18.550
the answer lives is always a discussion of why aren't there more girls at the

1331
01:13:18.551 --> 01:13:22.150
top because they're out there looking for Dick.
That's why the side,

1332
01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:25.750
yeah and we're looking for girls.

1333
01:13:25.751 --> 01:13:27.710
You could argue that the guys aren't looking for girls right?

1334
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.280
That well they are but they've given up.
I mean they are,

1335
01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:32.890
but they're like let's be realistic.
Games are here and they're fun.

1336
01:13:32.891 --> 01:13:36.670
So you have the girls that on on the stream that tried to like not portray that

1337
01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:39.670
sexiness because they want to be taken more seriously.
Sorry,
purpose.

1338
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.810
I have a Hoodie on and there's,
yeah,
there's a lot of that right.
And I don't,

1339
01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.880
it's one thing like I understand that there's this one girl,

1340
01:13:45.881 --> 01:13:48.520
her name is Casey Tron and she makes fun of the whole thing.

1341
01:13:48.521 --> 01:13:51.010
She's got big boobs as it is,
but she pushes him up,

1342
01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.480
has the camera like angled in on it and she constantly says stupid shit and like

1343
01:13:55.481 --> 01:13:58.990
make like sexual innuendos all the time and like just different joke on the

1344
01:13:58.991 --> 01:14:03.250
stream because she wants to embrace the chaos that is the twitch chat and just

1345
01:14:03.251 --> 01:14:06.490
kind of,
and how to then,
what kind of like numbers does she get?

1346
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.330
I mean she definitely,
it's definitely a full time job for you can make money.

1347
01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.190
Wow.
So could,
you could actually

1348
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.660
<v 7>make what a lawyer makes or a doctor makes a quarter million dollars.
Yeah,</v>

1349
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:21.910
that so crazy.
I,
I don't know why this is so surprising to me.

1350
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:26.920
The TV networks are shitting their pants because of things like this twitch,

1351
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.050
because the net,
you know,

1352
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.590
more people are watching video games now than they are watching TV.
Is that true?

1353
01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:35.260
Yeah.
Really.
Yeah.
But there's a lot of channels,
man,

1354
01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:37.900
that's 250 channels just on direct TV or something like that.

1355
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:40.540
More than that probably right.
Yeah.
But most of these games,

1356
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:45.541
like they're getting way more viewers per day than an episode of Grey's anatomy

1357
01:14:47.231 --> 01:14:50.650
nowadays.
I saw this thing about the ultimate fighter,
you know,
uh,

1358
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:54.460
the UFC show the reality show where someone who was saying that the,

1359
01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:55.330
I don't know if that's true,

1360
01:14:55.331 --> 01:15:00.331
but the ultimate fighter only had 246,000 people watch,

1361
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.630
uh,
one of the episodes,
which is just,
I mean,

1362
01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:07.600
that's way less than we get for our podcast.
That's normal.

1363
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.770
That's normal nowadays.
That's normal for twitch.

1364
01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.820
What are you saying?
It's normal nowadays for the low numbers on TV,
on cable,

1365
01:15:16.821 --> 01:15:20.560
but it's not because that,
that's like way lower than what it's been before.

1366
01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:22.540
Like as an example,

1367
01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:26.260
there's a show that's on one of these like oxygen networks or something like

1368
01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:29.680
that at a 10:00 PM on a on a Tuesday.

1369
01:15:29.681 --> 01:15:32.740
What would you think that numbers are for that 10:00 PM on a Tuesday on an

1370
01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:37.330
oxygen network show know how will they even configure that out,
man,

1371
01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:38.380
can you figure that out?

1372
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:42.310
You can more so nowadays I think then you used to be able to,

1373
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:46.320
because nowadays those numbers of the cable companies are sold to,
yeah,

1374
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:49.370
that data is all,
that's all data.
Right,
but that's the,

1375
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:54.190
the question is how do they know like it used to be obviously,

1376
01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.770
right?
I don't know.
It used to be Nielsen ratings.

1377
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.410
It used to be you have to have a Nielsen box on your television.

1378
01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.700
That's the old school.
Yeah.
And then I think they still use that though.
My,

1379
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.750
I don't think they're,

1380
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.720
they know when people watch the Dvr show with the 24 hours,

1381
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:09.820
like that's added into a DVR show.

1382
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:13.720
They have to be monitoring your DVR box to know if you have,

1383
01:16:13.721 --> 01:16:17.920
watch my DVR though.
But that is,
is that watching it live?
It,

1384
01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:21.610
can they figure that out as well.
Live number four hours,

1385
01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.700
but they don't add that into the ratings.

1386
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.880
Like if you watch television ratings that's not including the ratings.

1387
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:30.010
Like if you see like um Big Bang theory.

1388
01:16:30.011 --> 01:16:34.120
If that's the number one show they don't factor in direct TV.

1389
01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:35.260
I don't believe they do.

1390
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.660
I think it just depends on which day you're looking at it.

1391
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.480
They might wait two more days and they'll give you the updated facts with

1392
01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.720
which I imagine all these channels have access to that.
That was the debate.

1393
01:16:46.721 --> 01:16:50.500
The debate though and television was whether or not to include the direct TV

1394
01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:53.770
numbers cause directv numbers were different than the numbers that they were

1395
01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:55.630
getting off of regular television.

1396
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:58.210
As many people watching the television together.

1397
01:16:58.211 --> 01:16:59.860
Is there five people watching one screen?

1398
01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:02.230
You got to talk right into that dude I asked closer.
Is there,

1399
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:05.670
is there five people watching one screen?
Right.
That's like the,

1400
01:17:05.671 --> 01:17:09.500
that's obviously the area on a computer you have to fill it in and you make a

1401
01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:09.980
twitch account

1402
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.220
<v 1>which makes it that much more valuable.
All the info is like age based.</v>

1403
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:14.054
They know how old.

1404
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:18.610
<v 2>Okay,
here it goes.
Netflix.
Netflix won't share it.
They won't tell you.</v>

1405
01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.870
They don't need to tell you.
They're like fuck you.
We're Netflix shit internally.

1406
01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:23.704
They obviously have,

1407
01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:28.750
well they have 70 million people on Netflix now paying seven bucks a month.

1408
01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:33.910
Mother fucker.
Mother fuckers.
I think it's the 70 million.
Well Jamie,

1409
01:17:33.911 --> 01:17:38.440
you can find like Hulu seven off this year that either.
No,
I think they do.
Yeah.

1410
01:17:38.441 --> 01:17:40.630
How many people are on Netflix?
Um,

1411
01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:44.080
so how many people were watching house of cards do?
No,
they don't even tell you.

1412
01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.093
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1413
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:49.060
<v 2>Hmm.
They don't know.
Find out how many people are on Netflix.</v>

1414
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.130
I think it's 70 million puzzle.
Yeah.

1415
01:17:51.131 --> 01:17:54.370
This ultimate fighter episode four of last week's ultimate fighter only did

1416
01:17:54.371 --> 01:17:57.310
286,000 views.

1417
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:59.683
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1418
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.160
<v 2>Hmm.
Yeah.
That's like a big key.
That's like a counterstrike tournament nowadays.</v>

1419
01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.740
Cause that really kind of struck tournament.
That's what you would get.

1420
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:11.060
Well the last major we had over a million concurrent fucking Christ.

1421
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:14.950
1 million watching at the same time.
My God.

1422
01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:16.150
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1423
01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:16.400
<v 1>that's,</v>

1424
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.470
I'm in league of legends in those ones are monsters too because they have weekly

1425
01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.520
events this size that is unbelievable man.

1426
01:18:24.521 --> 01:18:27.360
We are living in strange,
strange times.

1427
01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.860
40 million domestic subscribers,

1428
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.420
<v 2>40 million domestic.</v>

1429
01:18:31.421 --> 01:18:35.680
But worldwide I think worldwide they said it was 70 and I'm looking at a Forbes

1430
01:18:35.681 --> 01:18:39.760
article with it.
Hmm.
But even that 40 million domestic at seven bucks a month,

1431
01:18:39.761 --> 01:18:40.490
who,
who it

1432
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:42.190
<v 1>was,
they got cash paying me.</v>

1433
01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.620
So the one side twitch ads or the one downside to twitch ads is that adblock

1434
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:49.930
right?
Not Chrome.
So like some ads don't get shown,

1435
01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.540
so that doesn't go towards the counts per millennia.

1436
01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:55.510
The CPM or whatever that rate you get per thousand viewers.

1437
01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:59.440
So obviously on a TV show,
a TV box,

1438
01:18:59.441 --> 01:19:02.080
you can't turn off the commercial.
You could switch the channel.

1439
01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.310
But online you could literally like disable the ad so that you're always

1440
01:19:06.311 --> 01:19:08.800
watching the streamer because I could run an ad every eight minutes.

1441
01:19:08.801 --> 01:19:11.770
Some people don't want to see the ad,
they just went and watched Jordan.
So I,

1442
01:19:11.771 --> 01:19:12.551
when I ran a commercial,

1443
01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:15.520
I tried to make an effort to like leave the room so people aren't encouraged to

1444
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.270
turn off ad block.
So there's nothing going on during my commercial.

1445
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:22.450
So years commercials are scheduled.
No,
eight minutes.

1446
01:19:22.451 --> 01:19:27.451
I have a dashboard I could run a 30 60 91 20 when 52nd commercial.

1447
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:31.120
And how does that work?
You get a piece of the ad.
Yup.

1448
01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.990
So per every thousand of years I get a rate like three to $5 per commercial

1449
01:19:34.991 --> 01:19:38.800
rents.
If I five 40,000 viewers and I run a commercial at prime hours,

1450
01:19:38.801 --> 01:19:39.730
that's 30 seconds.

1451
01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.120
I'll get like 20 bucks or something for like a couple thousand viewers.

1452
01:19:43.121 --> 01:19:46.900
So you could run for an hour,
that's 80 bucks an hour or whatever.

1453
01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.710
But they have to be,
they still have to tune into it.
Yeah,

1454
01:19:50.711 --> 01:19:52.990
they have to be tuned in.
That's,
that's like live action.

1455
01:19:52.991 --> 01:19:56.080
Like sometimes if I'm having a really funny stream and every was as much,

1456
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:59.160
of course she'd happening,
I don't want to like interrupt with an advert.

1457
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.960
Like it's a commercial.
Right.
But if I'm just playing a game and I'm like,

1458
01:20:01.961 --> 01:20:03.730
all right guys,
I'm gonna go take a Piss,
uh,

1459
01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.290
get some food or a snack really quick.

1460
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:08.010
Are they going to read a two minute commercial?
But I try to never interrupt

1461
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.930
<v 0>the action.
And these too many commercials,</v>

1462
01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:13.920
they used trailers for movies so it drives from a random,

1463
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:17.100
a rotator that,
that that's how switch makes also their money.

1464
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:21.000
So these companies paid switch maybe 10 grand to run their ad three this Friday.

1465
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.180
So you don't get to choose.
You couldn't say like,
Hey,

1466
01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:27.450
I would like to have a Chevy ad right now.
But no,

1467
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:32.451
but what I can do is have advertisers pay me directly and run their prerolls as

1468
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:36.750
my stream and never run a commercial through Twitter or do an internal,
uh,

1469
01:20:36.751 --> 01:20:39.570
advertisement inside the show.
Like what we do.
Yeah,
exactly.

1470
01:20:39.571 --> 01:20:42.660
Or could you have product placement?
Well,
exactly.
Yeah.
You know,

1471
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:45.600
it goes good with gaming.
Kill could kill.
Yeah,
exactly.

1472
01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:47.280
Well that's what I'm doing when I play on my stream.

1473
01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:48.810
I have my sponsor's headphones on.

1474
01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:51.780
I have the keyboard there and they pay you monthly or well those are the people

1475
01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:54.720
who support me to fight it.
Like you're up in all over the world each week.

1476
01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.080
I just got back from London this weekend.
That's you know,

1477
01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.480
big events Samsung put away from me.
So yeah.

1478
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.600
So I have two phones.
Right.

1479
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:06.720
I have to just have to in my phone cause I got sponsored by HTC recently.

1480
01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.000
Oh you had to deactivate your phone because I have an unlimited data plan so

1481
01:21:11.001 --> 01:21:13.650
I've been resisting.
But I have the new HTC m nine,

1482
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:17.010
which I use for everything else aside.
I didn't even know the m nine was out.

1483
01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:19.880
Just came out when um,
yeah,

1484
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:23.400
I think I got it like right as before the MNA was pretty dope.
It was dope.

1485
01:21:23.401 --> 01:21:25.260
So much better as the m nine.
Honestly,

1486
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.280
I pulled up the family plan on team cars and the family plan on t mobile is

1487
01:21:31.231 --> 01:21:35.640
unlimited LTE dates.
My music player,
T-Mobile's your music player now.

1488
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:40.210
I said mate,
she sees in my car,
cause I understand.
So this is uh,

1489
01:21:40.290 --> 01:21:43.950
a whole new world and I'm being introduced to this world of streaming.

1490
01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.800
I mean the world of component of video games.
I'm scared.

1491
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.330
I don't want to be just sweaty on you though.

1492
01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:53.040
The world of competitive video games I was kind of aware of and I knew about

1493
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.330
these enormous starcraft tournaments where people are watching it on television.

1494
01:21:57.331 --> 01:22:00.960
Yeah.
Korea.
It's still huge,
right?
Yeah.
That's why I stuck half one died.

1495
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:04.170
It got so big that everyone was throwing matches for money,
throwing it,

1496
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:08.930
oh here's 20 grand,
lose your next game.
No Way.
And then there's,

1497
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:12.390
cause there's bedding because Korea's,
it got big really fast.

1498
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.470
I hate to bad noodle.

1499
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:18.450
People always find a way to fuck things up of what happened to the original

1500
01:22:18.451 --> 01:22:19.950
starcraft because that game was bad ass.

1501
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:21.510
I don't think they needed to change it too much.

1502
01:22:21.511 --> 01:22:23.160
They could do just updated the graphics a little.

1503
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:27.510
And what happened was that kind of ruined part of the integrity of the Korean

1504
01:22:27.511 --> 01:22:31.020
scene,
which was like the dominant,
those guys are like insane.

1505
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:33.750
Like the way they practice,
the way they play.
It was like just clear cut,

1506
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.750
more efficient,
smarter,
better than everyone in the world.

1507
01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:39.890
So when they're seeing was infected that way,
it kind of,

1508
01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:43.080
is that a cultural issue?
Like you were talking about Europe and Korea.

1509
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:46.890
Is there like a stigma on it in America that doesn't exist and be we're up in

1510
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:47.670
Korea.

1511
01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:50.820
What definitely when I go to Sweden it's like being a pro surfer in California.

1512
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.600
Re Not everyone recognizes me,
but I will get recognized every day over there.

1513
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:57.410
So like I'll be at a Mcdonald's and some big oh shit hit would have nothing.

1514
01:22:57.411 --> 01:22:59.370
And Are you here for DreamHack?
Yeah.
Cool.

1515
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.680
But not everyone in the room will know who I am,

1516
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:05.200
but that one guy will like my buddies from Sweden,
the team and Ip,

1517
01:23:05.201 --> 01:23:06.280
they're the best thing for Sweden.

1518
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.320
<v 1>When most of those guys walk around in Sweden,</v>

1519
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:11.530
they're recognized 2030 times a day.
That's like normal.
At least

1520
01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:14.390
<v 7>they're celebrities or celebrities in their city.</v>

1521
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:19.400
Like a comparable to like a Dan in the Grano.
Who's a big time poker player?
Yeah,

1522
01:23:19.401 --> 01:23:22.580
something like that.
Or fill a,
what's it called?
Phil Ivey.

1523
01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.110
Is it comparable to that or more?

1524
01:23:24.111 --> 01:23:27.290
I would say more like the surfing analogy is probably better because I guess

1525
01:23:27.291 --> 01:23:31.250
those guys are in the region in the world.
Right.
Wow.

1526
01:23:31.251 --> 01:23:34.520
That is unbelievable.
Kelly Slater's.
Yeah,

1527
01:23:34.521 --> 01:23:38.600
well he's pretty famous worldwide,
so that'd be like fatalities at one guy.

1528
01:23:38.601 --> 01:23:42.410
I'm sure you've viewed he's done right.
Yeah.

1529
01:23:42.411 --> 01:23:46.640
He just does all sorts of marketing best Gamer in the world still,
right?
Yeah.

1530
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:48.880
He was really good at quake,
but obviously,
yeah,

1531
01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.360
all the new current pastor to beat him,
you know,

1532
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.280
stuff Raffa is like the best great player ever.
He is.
Yeah.

1533
01:23:55.281 --> 01:23:58.010
Shane Hendrick standing and whatever happened in that one dude,
him.

1534
01:23:58.011 --> 01:24:01.920
What was his name?
Immortal.
No,
the fuck's his name.
Um,
there's,

1535
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.250
there was a guy who was a,
uh,

1536
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:08.210
an Asian cat had his own,
um,

1537
01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:12.770
he had like a whole server and a whole a website rather,

1538
01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:13.790
God dammit.

1539
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:18.790
Why haven't lived the best immediately in the early days was it quick file feel,

1540
01:24:19.911 --> 01:24:23.690
feel like his name is immortal,
but he stopped playing,
probably should know this.

1541
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:28.550
And uh,
he stopped playing and started,
uh,
developing products.
And you know,

1542
01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:31.340
a gaming website.
And I think for a lot of those guys,

1543
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:36.320
the actual game play is so involving like you have to plot practice eight,

1544
01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.760
10 hours a day.
Yeah,

1545
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.110
<v 1>I've experienced the lethargy of it.
Like cause it's like it's a novelty,
right?</v>

1546
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:45.380
You,
you do something,
you're so into it because it's new and exciting to compete.

1547
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:49.280
Well a lot of these parallel MLB and the NFL players probably wouldn't be in and

1548
01:24:49.281 --> 01:24:52.160
if they are barely making a wage they would probably say it.
That's fine.

1549
01:24:52.161 --> 01:24:53.990
But it's not worth it.
Getting my head bashed in,

1550
01:24:53.991 --> 01:24:56.690
well I'm not getting my head bashed in,
but I am spending a lot of time inside.

1551
01:24:56.691 --> 01:25:00.590
I am neglecting,
my hours are odd,
right?
I practice like two little evening.

1552
01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.730
So a lot of my friendship hangouts have to be like weird hours or weekends or

1553
01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.540
when I have no tournament.
So there is downsides to everything.
Right.

1554
01:25:08.541 --> 01:25:10.940
So like for me the novelty has gone away a little bit.

1555
01:25:10.941 --> 01:25:13.880
Like I don't play many games anymore.
I'm not a video game player.

1556
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.480
I'm a counterstrike player and so I don't,
in my free time,
I'm not just like,

1557
01:25:17.481 --> 01:25:20.030
let me just flip on my playstation four.
It's like,
no,
let me go outside,

1558
01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.110
let me go do,
I play ice hockey still once a week.
I play golf sometimes I,

1559
01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:27.020
I try to stay active because I would go insane being saddled to,

1560
01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:30.590
I have one teammate right now who's very new to the pro scene.
He plays all day.

1561
01:25:30.591 --> 01:25:33.890
He streams all night.
He's gonna make way more than all of us cause he literally,

1562
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:36.710
he'll be,
he won't leave his house for two weeks and he's still totally sane,

1563
01:25:36.711 --> 01:25:40.740
happy,
like totally possible.
He,
it's just a way it'll,

1564
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.260
it'll go away probably eventually,

1565
01:25:42.261 --> 01:25:45.470
but he's in that state where he's friends are online and it's not like you're by

1566
01:25:45.471 --> 01:25:48.470
yourself.
You're dealing with,
you played quake,
right,
with your friends.
Right.

1567
01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:52.130
He's very interactive.
We're all very interactive.
He loves gaming.

1568
01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.100
I was at that stage on time where I didn't mind not going out for the whole

1569
01:25:55.101 --> 01:25:58.790
weekend and I would just land with my friends.
After a while,

1570
01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.090
depending on how you've balanced your life,
obviously you,

1571
01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.130
you want to do other things

1572
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:06.360
<v 7>in your day,
right?
You want to feel fulfilled as a human.</v>

1573
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:09.710
I took up golf a couple of years ago just to do something else and try to be

1574
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:14.750
decently skilled at it just for fun because name was thrash,
thrash out.

1575
01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:17.990
He won like,
what are you wearing?
Like a Ferrari or something.
I remember,

1576
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.010
well he was like one of the,
Dennis Fong started started x fire,

1577
01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:25.630
I think a big company now that's,
that's thresh that x fire.

1578
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:30.110
He was a like the best player or one of the best players of the time.

1579
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:32.660
I remember watching that guy.
The first pro Gamer.
Yeah.

1580
01:26:32.661 --> 01:26:34.470
Watching him play in demos,
you know,

1581
01:26:34.471 --> 01:26:39.471
like Jesus Christ and then he came up with a website and he had like a gaming

1582
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:40.730
news portal.

1583
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.600
He definitely paved the way and of all the shows that we've ever done.

1584
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:45.770
Joe Rogan podcast,

1585
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:50.480
I don't think we've ever had 8,000 people viewing our show right now.

1586
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.930
We have like almost 8,000 people doing our show.
We haven't done that.

1587
01:26:53.931 --> 01:26:58.640
Maybe before Jamie,
5,000 before.
Wow.
Gaming community.

1588
01:26:58.641 --> 01:26:59.600
We didn't even hit it up that high.

1589
01:26:59.610 --> 01:27:02.390
I wasn't sure if I can announce this last week.
I was like,
yeah,

1590
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:07.570
that is fascinating.
This whole thing is just the gamer world.
Yeah.

1591
01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:11.420
He gamer fuckers.
We,
we've hit some new plateau.

1592
01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:15.560
I think with interactivity with this,
not we but like the world.

1593
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.210
I'm excited for you to connect you to twitch.

1594
01:27:17.211 --> 01:27:19.250
I think that's going to do some cool shit for you.
Yeah.

1595
01:27:19.251 --> 01:27:22.040
I think we need to put this thing on twitch for sure.
Now it's just,

1596
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.450
it seems to me to be,

1597
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:28.540
there's a whole world out there of people that are involved in this that I just

1598
01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:30.230
had no idea about.
You know?

1599
01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:33.650
I had no idea that people were making donation money and that someone can make

1600
01:27:33.651 --> 01:27:37.520
50 grand aren't always right.
You know how often has been,
I mean,
how new is this?

1601
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:41.270
How recent is it?
Probably 2010 when it really started until the last five years.

1602
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:44.360
You Speak Justin TV.
Justin TV.
Yeah.
We used to,

1603
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:51.280
we used to do Justin TV from the green room at Cobb's comedy club in San

1604
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:54.710
Francisco.
I was old Joe Rogan experience before.
It was Joe Rogan experience.

1605
01:27:54.711 --> 01:27:56.270
We even have with them and they were like,
Harry,

1606
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:59.150
we want to give you laptops in and cameras and stuff.

1607
01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.610
That was like when we used to do it in a,
we did it in my hotel a few times.

1608
01:28:04.611 --> 01:28:07.400
We did it in green rooms.
I do it all kinds of shit.

1609
01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:11.560
Remember I came with a bathrobe on the leopard bathrobes and for you and Joey

1610
01:28:11.561 --> 01:28:15.860
and I danced.
Do you remember the time we,
there was that dude,

1611
01:28:15.861 --> 01:28:17.930
and this was way,
way back in the day,

1612
01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:21.260
but he had some sort of a cellular hookup in his backpack.

1613
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.350
It was attached to a laptop.
Was Justin TV?
Yeah,

1614
01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:27.140
Tyler dorm and shit and he had a Webcam.

1615
01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.710
He had a Webcam that was like on his chest or a hat or something along those

1616
01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:31.400
lines.

1617
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.240
And he had a list this like set and they wanted to give us one of these setups

1618
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:38.150
and have us take it around.
And I think that's where me and Brian like we just,

1619
01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.900
we just said we're crossing the line and it was just too fucking weird.
Next,

1620
01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:44.740
Joe Rogan has a Gopro on his head during the UFC fight night,

1621
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.990
but that's what periscope is.
I'm going to periscope from this UFC this weekend.

1622
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.090
Oh sweet.
Yeah.

1623
01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:52.760
I'm gonna see if I can get a service or a cell phone signal cause I think

1624
01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:56.440
there's a Wifi.
You might want to also talk to Dana first.
The bad.

1625
01:28:56.770 --> 01:29:00.170
Well I'm not going to show that fights.
I'm not going to show the fights.

1626
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.010
I'm going to like periscope.

1627
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.510
<v 2>I wanted to periscope like me and Goldberg like a getting ready and fucking</v>

1628
01:29:06.511 --> 01:29:09.450
around and let everybody know what it is and this is what it looks like on each

1629
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:10.021
juice.
Everybody,

1630
01:29:10.021 --> 01:29:13.380
the people that work behind the scenes and show everybody Thompson Sigora and

1631
01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:17.930
Tony Hinchcliffe.
I'll just come down with,
I haven't messed with it.

1632
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:18.610
Oh yeah.

1633
01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:23.070
To periscope is a streaming app where you use stream from your cell phone using,

1634
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.110
yeah.
So we do it all the time at the comedy store.

1635
01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:27.780
The other day I took people on a tour of the comedy store.

1636
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.140
I took him up to the belly room.
I took him down to the comics bar.

1637
01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:35.330
I took him all over the place.
Very cool.
I should do that.
You need,

1638
01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.550
you could,
yeah.
You could do whatever you want.
I mean,
you could,

1639
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.410
could you show pornography with that?

1640
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.900
<v 3>You know,
I just got,
let me,
I just got banned.
You got banned again?</v>

1641
01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:48.040
I got banned for doing.
Yeah.
What do you do in your free time?

1642
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:52.490
I troll with my free cams,
but here it here.
Take it,
check it out.
Okay,
cool.

1643
01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.070
There's people looking at it right now.

1644
01:29:54.071 --> 01:29:57.400
You have to hold it up and down like for some reason.
Oh,
okay.
Very cool.

1645
01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:02.130
And so there's people chatting.
Edgar hurts the,

1646
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:05.230
the rules of periscope.
It's trippy.
No,

1647
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:10.290
Nudie knows like overall sexual content.
I can't use it.
Uh,
no,
no.
Uh,

1648
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:13.610
like showing fights because they got an a huge trouble for a lot of people

1649
01:30:13.611 --> 01:30:18.340
streaming the Manny fight.
Mayweather fight.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
So they,
uh,

1650
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:22.870
how I got banned,
no,
is because of the fights,
uh,
because of the fights,

1651
01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:28.930
because of the fights,
they had to incorporate some kind of,
uh,
a feature.

1652
01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:31.510
So people were showing the fights that people could report on him.

1653
01:30:31.511 --> 01:30:34.300
So what happened to me is I was,
there was a bipolar,

1654
01:30:34.301 --> 01:30:38.420
schizophrenia cam girl name a Egyptian princess.
It doesn't,

1655
01:30:38.421 --> 01:30:41.920
I just go without saying.
Yeah,
it was,
I mean,
she was wearing clothes,

1656
01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.110
but she was just like,
it was so funny.

1657
01:30:44.111 --> 01:30:46.870
And all these people on Reddit were like trolling her or something.

1658
01:30:46.871 --> 01:30:51.430
So I was filming what was going on with this reddit troll and so many people

1659
01:30:51.431 --> 01:30:55.510
thought I was doing the troll that they,
they reported me and I got banned.

1660
01:30:55.780 --> 01:31:00.670
But a periscope,
periscope and Twitter look at it and goes,
well,

1661
01:31:00.671 --> 01:31:02.070
that's a stupid rule because you,

1662
01:31:02.071 --> 01:31:05.510
you probably have a lot of haters that would just do this every time you get on.

1663
01:31:05.511 --> 01:31:09.580
And I'm like,
Yup.
And then so I think they've kind of relaxed it for me at least.

1664
01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.180
At least they respect the fact that you would have some haters,
you know,

1665
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.140
take your word for it right now on twitch,

1666
01:31:17.141 --> 01:31:20.470
they recently added that like even as a guy you can't be seen with your shirt

1667
01:31:20.471 --> 01:31:21.800
off on the tosh.

1668
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:26.830
I did something funny one time where I killed the whole team and I didn't react

1669
01:31:26.831 --> 01:31:28.330
at all.
I got up,
put my phone down,

1670
01:31:28.331 --> 01:31:31.300
I took my shirt off and I walked out of the room and just have a funny reaction.

1671
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:34.230
<v 2>I would get like my channel would get shut down.</v>

1672
01:31:34.231 --> 01:31:38.130
So that's like how New York City has that law that men can take their shirts off

1673
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:41.270
so women take their shirts off because they can't do anything about it.
Right?

1674
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:42.900
Yeah.
Cause like Ra should fear,

1675
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.300
we'll walk around New York City every day with no shirt on.

1676
01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.350
He does it all the time.
Don't do cause building,
man.

1677
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.050
Our society is pretty weird about that stuff.
Well if you,
you know,

1678
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.270
if you're allowed to show mill nipple,
I,
I,
look,

1679
01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:56.820
I am fully supportive of anybody who wants to be naked.

1680
01:31:57.090 --> 01:32:00.050
If you want to be naked and walked down the street,
I think it's symmetrical.

1681
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.110
<v 7>Well,
I just think the idea of closes is fucking ridiculous.
This is something,</v>

1682
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:05.880
it's not natural,
you know,
it's natural.
Being naked,
closer,

1683
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:08.830
just we were imposing this where we're imposing as a society.

1684
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.440
If you're comfortable being naked,
walking down the street,

1685
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:13.990
what you going to hide it from the kids?
Well,

1686
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.120
you're intimidating when you have no shirt on him.
It's too much like us Saxon,

1687
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.640
perfect muscles and stuff.
So it makes some of us nervous.

1688
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.500
Well,
you're disgusting.
So like maybe somebody had just eaten.

1689
01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:33.740
I said,
we're all going to burning man and we're getting a general good podcasts.

1690
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:38.260
Brian's got,
Jorgenson has a twitch thing.
Oh,
no shit man.

1691
01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:42.380
Oh yeah.
Scott has 725,000 fucking views.

1692
01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:48.610
Call duty.
All right,
I'm going to give this back to Brian show.
There's a Barco.

1693
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:53.110
Yeah,
you should have his little heart things.
You should,
uh,
the UFC twitch.

1694
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:56.700
Do you ever play the UFC game?
Yeah,
well I have to do a some.

1695
01:32:56.850 --> 01:32:58.600
You know what I'll do?
I should,
I should.

1696
01:32:58.710 --> 01:33:03.280
I have to do some voiceover for the newer version of it because they have new

1697
01:33:03.281 --> 01:33:05.920
updated versions of it every year.
So this year I have to go,

1698
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:08.320
I have to go in and like a couple of weeks I have to go in and

1699
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:14.050
fucking laborious task.
I have to fake fights.
Big fights are going on.

1700
01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:16.440
Is there ever going to be a playable character of you?

1701
01:33:16.441 --> 01:33:19.280
Cause that's what one thing that the Internet has been asking for for a while.

1702
01:33:19.281 --> 01:33:21.670
He's having a playable Easter egg character.

1703
01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.210
I would have to do a lot of work to do that.
I'm not really interested.

1704
01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.900
You got to get up to like throw,
I throw a bunch of kicks and get video tape.

1705
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:32.330
My body's going to say,
man,
you have a vicious kick.
I saw something on Instagram.

1706
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:35.620
I was like,
I would've just got broken in half by that kick.
Oh my God.

1707
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.860
You're kicking it up.
Hit you.
Yeah,
but beanbags don't hit back.

1708
01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.920
But it wasn't a bean bag heavy pot to it being bad feedback can bean bag area

1709
01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:50.110
all of the above.
So this where's this going?
This is,

1710
01:33:50.111 --> 01:33:52.090
this is going towards virtual,
right?

1711
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:55.000
Like that's Oculus rift is the next stage for all the shit.

1712
01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.880
I mean that's all I'm thinking when I ended up,
by the way,

1713
01:33:57.881 --> 01:33:59.140
that's what Carmack believes.

1714
01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:02.950
Karmic and I were chatting back and forth the other day on Twitter and one of

1715
01:34:02.951 --> 01:34:07.120
the things that he was talking about that he's obsessed with I guess is Oculus

1716
01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:10.930
Oculus rift and the possibilities that that entails.

1717
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:12.370
Have you fucked with Oculus at all?

1718
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.570
Played like some weird like ocean surfing simulator thing but playing cash I

1719
01:34:17.571 --> 01:34:19.630
could feel like I'd get nauseous.
I want to try it though.

1720
01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:21.010
See that's the biggest problem they did.

1721
01:34:21.011 --> 01:34:24.730
The biggest obstacle that they have to get over is a lot of people put it on and

1722
01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:27.490
get sick immediately and so it's not going to work for them.
Yeah,

1723
01:34:27.491 --> 01:34:30.100
that's a thing man.
Like with motion sickness,

1724
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:33.670
like some folks get motion sickness and some people don't like some people
can't.

1725
01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:35.890
Like,
my wife can't get on boat,
she gets an a boat.
She was like,

1726
01:34:35.891 --> 01:34:37.990
well like I have no problem.

1727
01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:41.620
I can be on waves and doesn't affect me and my kids are the same way.

1728
01:34:41.621 --> 01:34:43.810
It doesn't bug them.
I was worried that it would get them,

1729
01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:46.580
but it doesn't get them.
But some people like,

1730
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:49.540
like if you're in the backseat of a car,
they,
they,

1731
01:34:49.670 --> 01:34:52.510
they'll get sick cause you have to sit in the front seat if you're going around.

1732
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.210
Yeah.
Like Kurt,
like what is that?
What the fuck is that?

1733
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.350
Some people just can't take it.
I know people that came in,

1734
01:34:57.351 --> 01:35:01.130
we'll watch a video games on TV,
first person shooters or they get sick,

1735
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:03.780
some equilibrium shift or something internally.
I don't know.

1736
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:07.190
So that would be a factor with oculus.

1737
01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.220
I don't think it tracks your eye movement.
So if you want to look to the right,

1738
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:13.340
I think you have to do this versus like if you wanted to look to your right with

1739
01:35:13.341 --> 01:35:16.070
your eyes.
Right,
of course.

1740
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:20.780
So it'll be very stiff for a while.
Yeah,
that would be odd.
Um,

1741
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:24.440
but they have those Omni directional treadmills that they're using for Oculus.

1742
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.860
So you would actually get some workout Tahiti?
Well,
no,

1743
01:35:27.861 --> 01:35:30.110
you'd be playing counterstrike and you'd be running.

1744
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.630
I think that's when my leg ranking in the world had really good down here.

1745
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.770
Everybody's would dudes and start taking EPO and running on treadmills every
day.

1746
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:41.210
He would have to do something.

1747
01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.030
I mean if you think about like competitive advantages,
if it's,

1748
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.370
if it's all of a sudden started becoming physical,

1749
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.690
if it's shifted [inaudible] gamers started being like super fit.

1750
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.650
Don't be crazy.
Like you know,
you remember that dance dance revolution.

1751
01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:59.060
I love that game.
Makes so many people get in shape.

1752
01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:00.590
I mean it really did.

1753
01:36:00.591 --> 01:36:04.270
There was all these success stories of people who they want,

1754
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.100
they got into it just for being silly,
you know,
play a video game,

1755
01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:11.780
but then silly all that hopping around got them in incredible shape.
Like guys,

1756
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:16.580
we're losing like 50,
60 pounds.
The health apps on the Xbox live are amazing.

1757
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:20.390
The wheat and the wheat,
my connect tracks my body.
So if you're,

1758
01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:23.480
if you're doing one of the workout videos,
like a,
what is that one?

1759
01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:28.480
That pf 56 chains but you have Chinese apps that actually tracks your body so it

1760
01:36:31.311 --> 01:36:31.581
knows,

1761
01:36:31.581 --> 01:36:35.300
it's like you need to bend your arms more or your legs or bending like cheating

1762
01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:38.600
you're trying to achieve,
try and do half wraps.
Right?
Yeah.

1763
01:36:39.190 --> 01:36:42.560
Well that's um Damn it Brian will the oculus thing,

1764
01:36:42.561 --> 01:36:44.690
I would think that eventually that would be like,

1765
01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:46.490
you could do like you could spar,

1766
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.000
you could have like a martial arts simulator with like there's a person in front

1767
01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:52.130
of you and your fucking to Duke it out with some person.

1768
01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:55.280
Totally practice your little metta fighting.
I don't know.

1769
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:58.640
I wouldn't be able to grab them.
That would be an issue.

1770
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:01.580
Like you wouldn't be able to like there would be no grappling stuff but you

1771
01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:03.860
would be able to kick and punch and stuff.

1772
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:05.990
Just started three d printing opponents.
Yeah.

1773
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:07.910
The thing about grappling is you'd have to,

1774
01:37:07.911 --> 01:37:12.911
you were interacting with a persons body like striking is s kind of independent

1775
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.570
because you could kind of pretend you're hitting someone and they react.

1776
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.590
Yeah and they don't,
you don't really have to have a bike where Jujitsu,

1777
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:25.910
you're actually manipulating bodies and they requires correct leverage and

1778
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.170
you're actually,
you have wait,

1779
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:30.650
you're pushing weight around but they could give you like,
no,

1780
01:37:30.651 --> 01:37:34.790
you didn't have to be fighting a robot that wouldn't work.

1781
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:38.810
That's the way lighter first.
Cause it's like a two or three pound thing almost.

1782
01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:43.340
You're putting on your head what the oculus jiggle around.
Right.

1783
01:37:43.341 --> 01:37:45.410
But it's eventually going to be a neural interface.

1784
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:48.110
I mean it's eventually going to be some sort of a chip to they stick in the back

1785
01:37:48.111 --> 01:37:52.760
of your head.
I don't think,
I think,
I don't think we're long for this world.

1786
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:57.150
I think human beings are going to be some weird computer thing and the next 30

1787
01:37:57.151 --> 01:37:59.010
or 40 years I really do.
I don't,
I don't,

1788
01:37:59.011 --> 01:38:03.150
I just don't see this last days are already fucking guys sitting in airbase in

1789
01:38:03.151 --> 01:38:06.600
Nevada just drowns.
There's a lot of,
I mean the small portion,

1790
01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:10.050
but it's a lot of the technology that we're working on now is also,
um,

1791
01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.640
exoskeletons.
Have you seen those?
I mean,
I know I can,

1792
01:38:13.641 --> 01:38:14.760
I understand what you're saying,

1793
01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:18.330
but now they have these insane exoskeleton suits that are allowing people to

1794
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:23.110
carry hundreds and hundreds of pounds.
They,
you don't get tired.
Your,
your,
your,

1795
01:38:23.111 --> 01:38:24.780
your body can do all sorts of things.

1796
01:38:24.781 --> 01:38:28.020
It would never be able to do before the game called crisis that it's just like

1797
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:30.870
that.
Have you seen crisis you could like flip on your power suit.

1798
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:32.580
It's like in visibility.
Super Strange.

1799
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:36.260
You can like jump over a roof and she calls that Matt Damon Movie The new call

1800
01:38:36.261 --> 01:38:40.740
of duty.
Yeah.
Matt Damon was a Matt Damon.
Remember that movie?

1801
01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:44.820
What's it called?
Yes,
Louisiana.
He has that suit.

1802
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:48.150
They screwed into his brain and he becomes like a super person because he's got

1803
01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:52.840
this,
why can't you get to like chill version,
you remember?
Yes.
He had to,

1804
01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:57.960
he had to go,
we've got to go to some weird place to be 100,000.
Give me,
yeah.

1805
01:38:57.961 --> 01:39:00.990
It was like a dystopian version of the future and everything was bad.

1806
01:39:00.991 --> 01:39:04.100
But the rich people all lived in the sky and some beautiful town where it

1807
01:39:04.101 --> 01:39:06.560
Sigourney weaver and almost squirting weaver.
Who the fuck was it?

1808
01:39:06.561 --> 01:39:08.880
That it was like the king?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1809
01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.780
<v 8>Uh,
from uh,</v>

1810
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:14.670
<v 7>fatal attraction.
That broad seaward Glenn close.</v>

1811
01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.180
Glenn close was the mayor or the queen or whatever the fuck she was.

1812
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:24.590
<v 8>Oh,
it's us paralyzed and you've got a brain controlled arm.</v>

1813
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:29.280
Whoa.
Play that.
She's controlling this with this brain thing.

1814
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:33.380
<v 7>And how was he doing that?
How was he controlling it?
Is that computer interface?</v>

1815
01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:37.800
You see the interface on his head up there?
It was.
Whoa.
It's true.
That's awesome.

1816
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:41.220
You know,
having things with this arm all up,
getting disabled people,
the ability,

1817
01:39:41.221 --> 01:39:46.110
what am I,
there's an incredible story.
I'll talk after.

1818
01:39:46.111 --> 01:39:46.930
This

1819
01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:51.750
<v 9>can be a single neuron so you can get a whole representation of a grasp and</v>

1820
01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.600
another neuron nearby will produce a different type of grass.

1821
01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.010
And be sensitive to

1822
01:39:57.070 --> 01:40:00.420
<v 7>different type of,
oh my gosh.
Picking up a drink.</v>

1823
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:06.110
<v 8>twitch.tv/handy
guy.
Yeah,
he's a friend of mine.</v>

1824
01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.180
Then I'll buy Matt myself and everything's going good.
Right?
I'm about to,
I,

1825
01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:10.483
I'm in,
I'm at,

1826
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:15.440
I'm imagining to picking up the robotic arm omics,
omics,
standing,

1827
01:40:15.441 --> 01:40:17.570
the robotic.
I'm towards the root beer.

1828
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:22.410
I pick it up as a straw to my mouth.
Ready,
close,

1829
01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:26.090
read it so extremely,
I can practically taste the beer.
Right.

1830
01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:31.590
And I dropped it.
I dropped them.
I somehow reliefs and my thought process,

1831
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:36.610
I released the grip on the beer and the fans and if fathers in my lap and it

1832
01:40:36.651 --> 01:40:38.370
spills all over making it.

1833
01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.670
So that was one of the bloopers and that was funny.
But the next one,

1834
01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:47.740
<v 7>because getting hammered with a robot arm,
come back.
Here you are.
I'm no,</v>

1835
01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.850
he gets drunk.
Can you not control it with his mind anymore?
Yeah.

1836
01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.350
Maybe he's like drunk robotic

1837
01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:58.960
<v 0>robot.
Well,
I mean that's beautiful because that's again what we're saying.</v>

1838
01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:01.420
I don't think we're long for this world.
I mean,

1839
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:04.180
I think eventually that right now is really crude.

1840
01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:07.510
That's like the model t of these fucking robot things.

1841
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:11.680
But we're going to get to the Tesla of these robot things and that's not that

1842
01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:14.830
far away.
And then people are going to Google,
fuck this shitty body.

1843
01:41:15.090 --> 01:41:19.240
This is fucking flesh bag that I live in.
It's always farting and going bad,

1844
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:23.320
you know,
getting sick all the time.
Let me just fucking take my brain,

1845
01:41:23.321 --> 01:41:25.690
stuff it into this thing that'll keep it alive and definitely,

1846
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.530
oh and nano stuff is going to start overwhelming.
Okay.

1847
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:33.040
So this guy know personally,
he plays with the nubs.
He was born like this.

1848
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:37.630
He's got no arms or legs and he plays using his nose and his two nubs and he's

1849
01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:41.200
fucking good.
Wow.
Like he shoots better than the yeah,

1850
01:41:41.201 --> 01:41:45.340
he's like better than the average player in the world.
What I like,

1851
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:47.830
so he's like a world class player.
His name is Mikey.

1852
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:52.030
I did a little report on it actually.
Wow.
I grew up playing with this kid.

1853
01:41:52.031 --> 01:41:52.920
He comes to the tournament,

1854
01:41:52.921 --> 01:41:55.960
like I go to tournaments around La when I was younger.
He comes there,

1855
01:41:55.961 --> 01:41:57.190
he's sitting there smoking a cigarette.

1856
01:41:57.191 --> 01:42:01.210
He's got like a little like smoking a cigarette.
He pulls out his,
he has a wire,

1857
01:42:01.211 --> 01:42:04.810
he pulls out of his pocket,
lights up a cigarette,
a wire.
He,
yeah,

1858
01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:09.010
he like has like an assister and it's like an iron like,
like a,
like a hanger.

1859
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:12.060
And he likes straightened it out and like curved the end so you can like pick

1860
01:42:12.061 --> 01:42:16.420
shit up with it and like he's really creative.
If you watch him play,

1861
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:20.350
he's amazing.
Uh,
it's getting the chart room right now.

1862
01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:25.090
Everyone say hi from Jordan to Mikey.
Hey,
what's up dude?
He's a bad ass guy.

1863
01:42:25.091 --> 01:42:26.920
Cause just stuff like I did a report on him.

1864
01:42:26.921 --> 01:42:30.880
The stuff he does like that he's able to do drive,
skateboard,

1865
01:42:30.881 --> 01:42:34.690
surf fish.
Which rob,
how's he drive?
Like,

1866
01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:36.400
so that's what he's building a new car now,

1867
01:42:36.401 --> 01:42:40.570
but they're like extended pedals and like these in the text,

1868
01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:42.730
but foot shifters or people,

1869
01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:47.050
the guy in Texas is like much longer arms than this.
This is incredible.

1870
01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:51.820
So this guy,
how does he write?
Like when he's typing,
how's he type?
Yeah,

1871
01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:55.690
it wasn't nubs and his nose.
He types with his nose.
Yeah.

1872
01:42:55.691 --> 01:42:58.030
Why shouldn't switch weapons?
Oh,
he's dead right now.

1873
01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:00.853
<v 10>Wow.</v>

1874
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.030
<v 0>So he's fixing his,</v>

1875
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.700
<v 10>he's talking about hi Jordan</v>

1876
01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.970
<v 0>saying hi Jordan.
It's that he's a homie.
Wow.
Cool Dude.</v>

1877
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:17.840
And his mindset is insane.
You know,
this guy is just like always just like,
yeah,

1878
01:43:17.841 --> 01:43:20.300
you just gotta live life in Britain.
And I'm just like,
dude,

1879
01:43:20.301 --> 01:43:23.620
you know what if people complain about such menial shit compared to that.
Yeah.

1880
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:27.140
Yeah,
no kidding man.
Well,
perspective as a motherfucker,

1881
01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.980
do you know if he's ticklish,
he's died now.

1882
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:33.470
I don't know what's going on there with these guys in the game without money

1883
01:43:33.471 --> 01:43:36.230
over their head.
So that's so counter straight workshop economy.

1884
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:39.710
So everywhere you start with a pistol,
you have $800 the round,

1885
01:43:39.711 --> 01:43:42.890
the morons you win,
the more money you get,
the better guns you can get.
Oh,

1886
01:43:42.891 --> 01:43:45.050
how rude.
And if you lose,

1887
01:43:45.051 --> 01:43:47.780
that's like a big part of the competitive players controlling your money.

1888
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:49.640
Because if you,
if you like forced by,

1889
01:43:49.641 --> 01:43:52.070
it's called where you just buy everything every,
if

1890
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.650
<v 3>you keep losing,
you're not going to have good inventory.
Hmm.</v>

1891
01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:01.240
Wow.
This is a whole nother world.
You need to tell Mikey,

1892
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:05.150
Dan heading the death match stream.
Oh,
he's playing a game.
He can't leave it.

1893
01:44:05.151 --> 01:44:07.010
He's playing a competitive little.
Um,

1894
01:44:07.011 --> 01:44:09.420
let's go and check out a different game check.

1895
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:14.720
Let's check our grand theft auto and let's see if anybody gets virtually raped.

1896
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:17.160
And when they do that virtual rape thing,
their key,
they key.

1897
01:44:17.170 --> 01:44:21.240
You have to hack into the game,
right?
Every people all the time.
You can,
you can,

1898
01:44:21.241 --> 01:44:24.440
uh,
go into like my,
when we were talking about when you're playing a game,

1899
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:26.500
when they get in the game and the game,
you can go,
like,

1900
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.720
one of my favorite things to do is go to the Strip club and then block the front

1901
01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:34.640
door and then throw in a flash bomb or something from gas and gas.

1902
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:40.710
Yeah.
And they can't get out.
You could pretty much,
uh,
like captured girl shit.

1903
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.520
That guy just went flying through the air when we tuned in.

1904
01:44:44.690 --> 01:44:48.350
This is one of the most fun games to play and just fuck around with like,

1905
01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:50.510
oh yeah,
this is the game that uh,

1906
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:54.890
me and Jamie like twitch a lot together because we can just hang out,

1907
01:44:55.130 --> 01:44:58.470
spend three hours,
just fucking stealing cars going through a lot.

1908
01:44:58.471 --> 01:45:02.210
But you can go to the comedy store in this game,
hang out.
And there's a new,

1909
01:45:02.211 --> 01:45:05.330
a hack because the PC version just came out.

1910
01:45:05.331 --> 01:45:08.150
There's a new hack that lets you go inside the comedy store,

1911
01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:11.240
which now when you played this,
Brian,
do you play this from your computer?

1912
01:45:11.241 --> 01:45:15.350
Do you use x box?
I use mostly Xbox,
but the PC version just came out.

1913
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:18.160
So I have an old computer that I'm trying to you I need,

1914
01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:22.070
Jamie just got a brand new computer so he's playing kick ass,
uh,

1915
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:26.660
version of grand theft auto.
But uh,
the,
the PC versions.
Amazing.

1916
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:30.470
You just have to have a good computer.
And I have like a process.
The graphics,

1917
01:45:30.471 --> 01:45:33.200
is that what it is?
Yeah,
cause it's graphics are amazing.

1918
01:45:33.201 --> 01:45:37.430
The road looks incredible.
We're k broadcast.
Why?

1919
01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:40.540
I just sent out another tweet.
Yeah,

1920
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:45.200
the Pc version does four K so you have to have even some of the top of line

1921
01:45:45.201 --> 01:45:50.030
computers.
What even barely get all the options at high right now.
They made,

1922
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.710
they made this game to last because a computer in two years we'll still have

1923
01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.600
problems probably putting this on mass.

1924
01:45:56.601 --> 01:46:00.680
So if you wanted to get like one of those falcon northwest top of the line

1925
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:03.610
Alienware
yeah.

1926
01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:08.210
And that could play it in full resolution or no,
especially Falcon.

1927
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:11.720
Falcon or an Alienware.
They're the best computers.
Every Joe,

1928
01:46:11.721 --> 01:46:13.190
they would be perfect at this.

1929
01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:15.350
Which one grant that you're trying to get them to send you one?

1930
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:19.910
Is that what you're doing
for people talk at the same time?
Jamie,

1931
01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:24.680
what?
What'd he say?
No,
I think,
yeah,
those would be perfect for this game.

1932
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.950
But you have to have the number one.
What graphics card do you have,
Jamie?

1933
01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.280
You have like the oven.
Okay.
One.

1934
01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:33.530
It's like an Nvidia and a nine 60 but I think everyone's saying like need like

1935
01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:38.830
do they still allow sli where they come all together about that than I do.

1936
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:41.450
I just do that.
Back in the day when I used to make my own computers,

1937
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:44.660
I heard then you had to throw it away,
couldn't take it,
shot him all.

1938
01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.770
They gave me shot a lot of our drives.
Right.
Addiction.

1939
01:46:48.771 --> 01:46:50.220
You go far and things

1940
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.270
<v 2>because you get real immersed in it,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1941
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:54.110
It's just you've got an understanding of limitations.

1942
01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.370
You've got to know if you're a crazy person.
I know I'm a crazy person,
but it's,

1943
01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:00.600
it's good.
Well it's,
it's all because I,

1944
01:47:00.601 --> 01:47:04.170
my brain developed doing competitive martial arts.
So you,

1945
01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:08.430
if you don't get obsessed with that then you get fucked up.
Yeah.
See,

1946
01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:10.770
I was going to ask you when you first got really into like wrestling and my

1947
01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:14.250
shots,
what else did you do at that point in your life?
Like not fun.
Right?

1948
01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:18.930
When I was 14 from the time I was 14 till the time I was 21 there was no nothing

1949
01:47:18.931 --> 01:47:23.880
else in life between 14 and 15 someone I forget.
That's why I like with gaming,

1950
01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:25.410
I love it and I always liked it,

1951
01:47:25.411 --> 01:47:28.350
but like you start to realize if you want to do something else,

1952
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:33.390
you can't just kind of half and half too.
Well,
it's also when you're doing this,

1953
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:37.530
you don't risk your physical health through with the martial arts thing,

1954
01:47:37.531 --> 01:47:41.520
like a lot of guys have a real problem like UFC fighters,
even boxers,

1955
01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:44.070
they have a hard time figuring out what they're going to do when it's over

1956
01:47:44.071 --> 01:47:49.071
because it's so immersive like every day and it's a physically demanding thing.

1957
01:47:49.351 --> 01:47:51.180
So every day when they get up in the morning,

1958
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:55.350
they know they have to do their training,
either physical conditioning,

1959
01:47:55.351 --> 01:47:57.780
they have to do their,
you know,
all the different skill training,

1960
01:47:57.781 --> 01:48:00.540
whether it's wrestling or kickbox and wherever the fuck they have to do that day

1961
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:04.530
when that day is over.
They do a lot of this for relaxing.

1962
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.680
They'll play video games to relax and chill out or their watch television.

1963
01:48:07.681 --> 01:48:12.681
But it's super hard to transition from that to some other life because they have

1964
01:48:14.101 --> 01:48:18.540
a short life where their vehicle can save.
Someone gave you a computer.
Okay.

1965
01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:22.800
And this computer can only handle the graphics that are available today,

1966
01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.800
but the new graphics are coming down the line but you computer can't handle it

1967
01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:26.191
anymore.

1968
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:29.610
You can't upgrade and your hard drive only has a certain amount of years on it.

1969
01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:34.350
Cane.
Yeah.
You can't change your hard drive and you can't change your memory.

1970
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:36.060
You can't change all these different aspects.

1971
01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:39.750
That's essentially what it's like to be an MMA fighter.
There's a very,

1972
01:48:39.751 --> 01:48:43.800
very short window about it.
Yeah.
Yeah it is.
Because like,
you know,

1973
01:48:43.801 --> 01:48:46.220
computers of your hard drive goes bad.
You get a new hard drive.

1974
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:48.930
And then also when the graphics get updated,

1975
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.370
they also update the graphics processors.
Yeah.

1976
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:57.720
So for a fighter they have this really small window of opportunity and then when

1977
01:48:57.721 --> 01:48:59.700
it's over it's fucking over man.

1978
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:03.690
I mean there are very few competitive 60 year old fighters.
I mean it's just,

1979
01:49:03.691 --> 01:49:07.740
it is what it is and when it's gone,
there is none,
nothing left,
you know.

1980
01:49:08.010 --> 01:49:09.000
But with Gamers,

1981
01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:13.620
you got to think that there's gotta be an age on that to where you can't react

1982
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:16.020
quick enough.
Especially first person shooter type Games.

1983
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.300
I think that number has been growing because I think if someone like Teemu Sani

1984
01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:22.710
and Nhl playing in the Stanley Cup at age 40 and you tell me I can't fucking

1985
01:49:22.711 --> 01:49:25.770
play counter strike at age 30 like batteries better example.

1986
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:30.800
Bernard Hopkins is 50 and he's a world championship level box or I don't know if

1987
01:49:31.501 --> 01:49:35.070
he has a title right now.
That's my point.
He,
if he can still do that,
it's still,

1988
01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.490
it's still be into it and,
and train and do everything it needs to do.

1989
01:49:38.491 --> 01:49:39.900
Like I know I could play video games,

1990
01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:44.280
especially now that you can actually make money.
He's an outlier though.
He's a,

1991
01:49:44.281 --> 01:49:48.100
he's a very rare individual and he is extremely disciplined about

1992
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.960
<v 0>his diet and his health and yeah,
and also his skill,
his skill level.</v>

1993
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.740
He has a very defensive oriented like Floyd Mayweather,

1994
01:49:57.070 --> 01:50:01.500
Floyd Mayweather.
We'll be able to like,
he'll be like 50 60 years old and his,

1995
01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:05.440
she's probably going to be fine and he probably won't be fighting anymore but

1996
01:50:05.441 --> 01:50:07.320
he's not going to be hit damaged.
Yeah.

1997
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.150
Whereas like Reus Salon providing a call for someone along those lines where

1998
01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.240
it's like a very face first or aggressive style,

1999
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.050
that guy is not going to be able to do that into his fifties he's not gonna be

2000
01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:21.370
able to be Bernard Hopkins unless he changes his style radically.
See,

2001
01:50:21.371 --> 01:50:23.380
obviously you don't comprehend all the nuances to fighting,

2002
01:50:23.381 --> 01:50:25.690
but I just think of that like to have someone playing a video game and I'm

2003
01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:28.690
sitting here like how can you tell me if I don't balance my physical health?

2004
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:33.010
It's that I can't play.
Well you got to worry about your,
your reflexes.

2005
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.520
I mean whether or not your reflexes are still maintain because they've got to

2006
01:50:36.521 --> 01:50:37.540
think with video games,

2007
01:50:37.541 --> 01:50:41.170
you're dealing with such a small window of opportunity for like getting a shot

2008
01:50:41.171 --> 01:50:43.900
off and stuff like that.
That reaction time.

2009
01:50:43.901 --> 01:50:47.770
Like do you take vitamins and do you fuck around with nootropics or anything

2010
01:50:47.771 --> 01:50:49.480
along those lines.
So there's this company,

2011
01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:53.290
they think nootropics recently just came onto my radar and I've been trying it

2012
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:56.050
for the past couple of months.
A little bit,
but not too consistent.

2013
01:50:56.051 --> 01:50:58.760
And we'll get you some,
we'll get you some Alpha brand.
Gabby asked him to try it.

2014
01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:02.410
I'd love to do like a sample month or two or something cause I take a

2015
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:04.420
multivitamin,
vitamin D,
he'd been 12 in the day.

2016
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.690
I tried to do that fish oil each day.
But nootropics I did it.

2017
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:11.170
It was like a coin or something.
I don't know the brand exactly how to spell it,

2018
01:51:11.171 --> 01:51:13.000
but yeah,
I've always had,

2019
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:15.820
I've always been interested in it ever since I heard on your podcast first,

2020
01:51:15.821 --> 01:51:16.810
but I never knew what they're on.

2021
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:19.930
There's a bunch of different ones from different companies and I'm sure it would

2022
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:24.010
probably benefit you.
Do you fuck with caffeine dude?
You're drinking tea here?

2023
01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:25.870
Yeah,
I try not to overwhelm myself with at coffee.

2024
01:51:25.871 --> 01:51:29.460
Like I only got into coffee a couple of years ago.
Hmm.
Um,

2025
01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:33.160
do you try to do that on purpose?
Like to preserve your Saturday?
Like,

2026
01:51:33.161 --> 01:51:37.660
what are you coffee's one of those things where like depending on how little

2027
01:51:37.661 --> 01:51:41.290
sleep I got and if I'm going to compete right then knowing I just need energy

2028
01:51:41.291 --> 01:51:44.290
for an hour.
I'll give myself a little coffee 30 minutes before,

2029
01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:47.800
so the jitters the way down,
but I have that little hour of up at Enos,

2030
01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:50.700
but generally it was competition.
I have two rules.

2031
01:51:50.701 --> 01:51:53.570
I like to get sleep and I don't like to be on a full stomach when I haven't,

2032
01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:56.830
when I compete.
So,
but yeah,
that's a thing for comedy too.

2033
01:51:56.831 --> 01:51:58.940
You should never have a full stomach.
When you do stand up,

2034
01:51:58.941 --> 01:52:03.490
it'll fuck with your head.
It's like if you have a full stomach,
you're slow.

2035
01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.120
The blood out of your brain,
doesn't it?
Resources.
Just,
just,

2036
01:52:07.121 --> 01:52:10.270
just general resources.
I don't want to go down that line here too much,

2037
01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:12.560
but I wanted to talk to you about that.
Like when you first had what,

2038
01:52:12.561 --> 01:52:15.100
what sparked your mind?
I'm getting into comedy because I was always like,

2039
01:52:15.101 --> 01:52:18.940
I wanted to try to stand up at like the local camp comedy store in La Jolla in

2040
01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:20.380
San Diego.
I was like,
I just want to do it.

2041
01:52:20.381 --> 01:52:23.440
Like I don't just take a sec then just do it.
Yeah.
Is that,
is that what you do?

2042
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:25.600
You just saying I go to an open mic night.

2043
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:27.700
Everybody sucks in the beginning and there's no worries.

2044
01:52:28.210 --> 01:52:31.510
It's just to come up with some stuff that you think is funny right down.

2045
01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:34.660
Anytime you have a funny idea either put it in your phone or write it down on a

2046
01:52:34.661 --> 01:52:37.120
piece of paper and then um,

2047
01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:41.860
you know practices sorta like get the idea of how you're going to do it.

2048
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.130
You have like or whatnot.
Well just be yourself.
It's the best.

2049
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.490
You know like some people like they'll create a persona or stuff like that but

2050
01:52:49.491 --> 01:52:51.750
good luck with all that.
That's a pain in the ass.
The secret,

2051
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:54.740
the secret is just being herself exfoliate,

2052
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.750
exfoliate like who you are and just kind of be a clown.

2053
01:52:56.950 --> 01:53:00.650
I know it can be really good at self depreciation but deprecation deprecation

2054
01:53:00.670 --> 01:53:05.270
that is self deprecation.
Is that when I used to say that too.

2055
01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:08.030
It's because you're reading it.
Yeah instead of saying it.
Yeah,

2056
01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:11.910
but self self deprecation,
right,
because you kind of,
yeah,

2057
01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:16.040
it seems like no value over the course of the show.
Um,
but yeah man,

2058
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:17.960
just go do an open mic night.
You're a smart guy.

2059
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:20.220
He probably be able to pull it off.
Just try it.
Yeah.

2060
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.120
I think if you could get really good at video games,

2061
01:53:23.121 --> 01:53:27.320
I really believe that if you get really good at anything that they're most

2062
01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:31.070
likely you can get good at anything that you direct your mind to.
I mean,

2063
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:33.800
you probably wouldn't be a good linebacker cause you're not a giant dude.

2064
01:53:33.801 --> 01:53:37.160
Nor would I,
you know,
so it's like there's certain physical limitations,

2065
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:40.310
but if you get,
you know,
you're really good video game player.

2066
01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:43.730
If you put that kind of effort into becoming a stand up,
yeah,
you could do it.

2067
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:46.700
There's nothing prohibitive about it.
At least try it.
And that's the fun part,

2068
01:53:46.701 --> 01:53:50.360
right?
Yeah.
Well you,
you get better,
you know,
with effort,

2069
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:54.770
with effort I thought and focus,
you get better,
you analyze it.

2070
01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:00.440
That's an interesting point.
Do you watch demos of your game?
Do you play play on,

2071
01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:03.380
we call him demos and then you watch it and go,
Ooh,

2072
01:54:03.381 --> 01:54:06.650
I should have done this differently or I have to work on that.
Yeah,

2073
01:54:06.651 --> 01:54:09.620
it's definitely,
that's probably the most tedious part of it.

2074
01:54:09.621 --> 01:54:12.830
Like you gotta make sure you're watching from both point of views,

2075
01:54:12.831 --> 01:54:16.430
your opponents and years and you'd be watching and yeah,
and,
and you're right.

2076
01:54:16.431 --> 01:54:18.390
That's how you get successful at anything.
And it was counterstrike.

2077
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:21.710
I think that was one of the differences to me as a young kid and everyone was

2078
01:54:21.711 --> 01:54:25.220
just playing for fun.
But when I was like 1415 right away,

2079
01:54:25.221 --> 01:54:27.830
I started studying the top players.
This is what are they doing?

2080
01:54:27.831 --> 01:54:29.390
And I didn't necessarily do it.
They did.

2081
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.760
It just gave me a lot of confidence to know that there's not,

2082
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:35.810
there's patterns in some areas,
in another area it's open to,
there's variables.

2083
01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:37.670
You could do whatever you want and this type part of the game,

2084
01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:40.850
you could be good at this style or that style.
Just like in fighting the right,

2085
01:54:40.851 --> 01:54:41.840
there's a lot of different styles.

2086
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:45.650
So I noticed that early on and I just by studying.
So yeah,
you just,

2087
01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.700
you kind of immerse yourself and figure out what your natural skill set is.

2088
01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:53.600
For me in counterstrike I had really good just like shooting abilities but like

2089
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:54.920
early on I was so aggressive,

2090
01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:58.760
so hungry to get into the fight early that obviously if I'm not communicating

2091
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:01.900
that with my teammates and I get over ambitious with the play then all of a

2092
01:55:01.901 --> 01:55:02.570
sudden I'm going to die.

2093
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:05.330
Even like is killed two people and it seems like we should win the round but I

2094
01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:07.070
killed two and then went and died for no reason.

2095
01:55:07.071 --> 01:55:09.920
Whereas I could kill to play passive,
let someone else take the reigns.

2096
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:12.680
Like those are things I had to develop more over the game and you have to,

2097
01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:15.290
you have to study that because there's a lot of kids who think they can be a pro

2098
01:55:15.291 --> 01:55:18.590
video game player cause they just have the good shot.
Oh I'm really good sniper.

2099
01:55:18.591 --> 01:55:21.140
Well what kind of person are you?
How do you communicate?

2100
01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:23.690
How do you like let your teammates play off you?
How do you play off of them?

2101
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:26.270
Yeah,
there's a big difference when you're talking about team gaming.

2102
01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:30.350
Gaming versus one gaming.
Yeah.

2103
01:55:30.351 --> 01:55:32.420
But even just obviously knowing what you're good and bad at,
right?

2104
01:55:32.421 --> 01:55:35.000
So you don't just have ignorance when you go play someone he's really good at

2105
01:55:35.001 --> 01:55:36.860
something like,
well I'm just gonna fuck him up at this.
Well No,

2106
01:55:36.861 --> 01:55:38.600
he's really technically good at that.

2107
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:40.790
You're technically not as good as him at that.

2108
01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:43.830
You should probably shy away from that unless you have some way to surprise him.

2109
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:46.050
Hmm.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

2110
01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:51.000
Now are there different schools of thought like there are different like to do

2111
01:55:51.001 --> 01:55:53.610
people train people in this like do you have a coaches?

2112
01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:57.180
I give lessons for 60 bucks an hour lesson,
60 bucks an hour.

2113
01:55:57.181 --> 01:56:01.440
I'll teach you how to play for real.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.
How does that work?

2114
01:56:01.441 --> 01:56:02.041
Like what do you do?

2115
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:05.070
You sit down there and watch them and you do it on near beforehand.
So,

2116
01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:05.881
so that they give,

2117
01:56:05.881 --> 01:56:09.330
I asked them to assess themselves and they answered like 10 questions that I ask

2118
01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.610
experience,
how long they've played competition wise,

2119
01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.680
what they think their qualities are that are good,
bad.
Um,

2120
01:56:15.570 --> 01:56:18.060
and then we meet up after they fill that out,

2121
01:56:18.061 --> 01:56:21.420
we choose it's schedule and then we meet up online on the headset,

2122
01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:24.870
I picture in picture with their screen and then we're going to serve it
together.

2123
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:28.770
And I just talked to them about some things that you need to know just about

2124
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:30.720
timings.
If they don't have a lot of questions.

2125
01:56:30.721 --> 01:56:32.550
Some kids are shy or they just want me to lecture them.

2126
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:34.980
So I go off and I say interrupt me when you have a question.

2127
01:56:34.981 --> 01:56:38.640
Other kids have a lot of specific questions about why am I not able to hit these

2128
01:56:38.641 --> 01:56:41.640
kind of shots?
I seem like I can do it in team death match,
Pr Team,

2129
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:42.930
death match practice.

2130
01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:46.590
But not when I do a competition I seem to get really rigid and timid.
Why?

2131
01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:47.940
How can I stay loose when I'm,

2132
01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.450
when I really want to win and there's pressure on the line.
You know,
how do I,

2133
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:55.260
so I just,
whether it's a psychological help or literal technical things,

2134
01:56:55.261 --> 01:56:56.041
I just tried to help people.

2135
01:56:56.041 --> 01:57:00.810
So with this seems to me it's like from the outside people are looking at this

2136
01:57:00.811 --> 01:57:04.470
like at some frivolous silly thing that people who really need to grow up or

2137
01:57:04.471 --> 01:57:05.304
involved in.

2138
01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:10.460
But from from an objective perspective without the cultural context of how

2139
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:12.420
people look at video games,

2140
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:17.750
it seems to me like a very complex multitasked sort of a skill based

2141
01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:22.010
competition.
It's,

2142
01:57:22.011 --> 01:57:26.640
it's problem solving at a very high level cause you're,

2143
01:57:26.641 --> 01:57:28.830
you're factoring a bunch of different things.

2144
01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:32.460
You also have social interaction with all the different people in your,

2145
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:34.590
your group team,
our community team.

2146
01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:38.220
And then on top of that you have to factor in the playing styles.

2147
01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.090
Various different aggressive or defensive playing styles of the people you're

2148
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:42.930
going up against.

2149
01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:46.890
Like this is a lot of complexity involved and I think the average person

2150
01:57:46.891 --> 01:57:51.000
probably wouldn't understand unless maybe they talk to someone like you.
Yeah,

2151
01:57:51.001 --> 01:57:51.421
exactly.

2152
01:57:51.421 --> 01:57:54.600
And I someone on when I said I was doing this podcast wanted me to try to

2153
01:57:54.601 --> 01:57:57.250
compare it to like fighting.
And have you talked to me about the,

2154
01:57:57.550 --> 01:58:01.040
like the Metta fighting in the small nuances?
Like you know,

2155
01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:02.880
you could tell like if a guy stepped a little weird,

2156
01:58:02.881 --> 01:58:06.090
like what does that represent?
This is right side hurting or something like that.

2157
01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.450
In counterstrike there's all these little things that I know that the outside

2158
01:58:09.451 --> 01:58:09.931
has no idea.

2159
01:58:09.931 --> 01:58:12.720
It just happened because I could see the guy's face because you've been there

2160
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:14.460
because I've been there and I've watched it happen.

2161
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:17.130
And the reason that guys playing so aggressive right now as a front,

2162
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.360
like he has no health,
he has no grenades left.

2163
01:58:19.361 --> 01:58:22.530
He's trying to scare me away from the bomb site.
I know that's what he's doing,

2164
01:58:22.531 --> 01:58:25.890
so I'm just going to run in and kill him simply.
Oh that's interesting.

2165
01:58:25.891 --> 01:58:29.160
So it's what they call information chunking.
You know,

2166
01:58:29.161 --> 01:58:33.030
like you've seen it all so many times before and you know the scenario.

2167
01:58:33.031 --> 01:58:37.020
So you're like,
I see what's happening.
Top people play off that information.

2168
01:58:37.021 --> 01:58:40.170
Right?
Like writing.
I'm sure that's what they work off it,
right?
Well,
yeah,

2169
01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:42.250
I mean there's,
there's that you

2170
01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.890
<v 2>like,
like sometimes like people say like,</v>

2171
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:47.490
how did you predict something in a fight?
And I'm like,
well,

2172
01:58:47.491 --> 01:58:50.200
I kind of seen it so many times before.
Like,
oh,

2173
01:58:50.201 --> 01:58:53.800
there's are also sir subtleties like from actually competing.

2174
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:55.450
Like when a guy will turn his hips,

2175
01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.270
there's certain things when I know a guy is going to spin and I'm like,

2176
01:58:58.271 --> 01:59:00.070
he's going to spend and then they'll throw a spin.

2177
01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:03.520
And what it is is from fighting from actually fighting strength.
So you know,

2178
01:59:03.521 --> 01:59:06.640
he wants to do something.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2179
01:59:06.641 --> 01:59:11.380
Well pretty mild is very few guys who don't spin anymore like a spinning back

2180
01:59:11.381 --> 01:59:12.730
fists.
It at the very least.

2181
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:15.490
But spinning back kicks are getting more and more prevalent.

2182
01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:19.120
Like even Frankie Edgar who's like primarily known as a wrestler,

2183
01:59:19.121 --> 01:59:21.790
was throwing a lot of spitting back kicks.
Um,

2184
01:59:21.850 --> 01:59:25.240
it's just a really effective technique.
But the point being that it's just,

2185
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:29.470
I know that it's going to happen just because I've seen it so many fucking
times.

2186
01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:33.060
It's a very subtle movement that people make that you have to like your,

2187
01:59:33.061 --> 01:59:36.760
your brain goes into that information chunking mode and they go,
oh,

2188
01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.550
this slight shift of his hips equates to that.

2189
01:59:39.730 --> 01:59:42.550
So if you see a guy who's like behaving in a certain way,

2190
01:59:42.551 --> 01:59:46.320
like I fucking seen that before,
that guy doesn't have any health.
Right?

2191
01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:49.450
It's like you're saying the fighting and it's a combination of thoughts and

2192
01:59:49.451 --> 01:59:52.390
things that you've experienced.
Boom,
it hits you.
That's what's happened.
Well,

2193
01:59:52.391 --> 01:59:54.490
that's with chess to like those guys that play chess,

2194
01:59:54.491 --> 01:59:57.250
they say that when they're playing that speed Chast they've seen this game so

2195
01:59:57.251 --> 02:00:00.550
many times.
I've seen those moves that blows me away.

2196
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:03.310
When those guys have those clocks and they're slapping a clock and we will have

2197
02:00:03.311 --> 02:00:05.230
peace.
Yeah.
They're trying to play like seven,

2198
02:00:05.231 --> 02:00:08.530
10 steps ahead because they realize,
oh,
that's three options.
Four options,

2199
02:00:08.531 --> 02:00:10.060
one option,
10 options,
11 options.

2200
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:14.990
Have you ever seen those old school videos of Eddie Fisher?
Bobby Fischer?

2201
02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.860
What does that movie searching for?
Bobby Fischer?
Yeah.

2202
02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:22.510
Well that was about Josh Waitzkin,
who is actually a Jujitsu player now.
He,
uh,
is,

2203
02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:24.610
here's something to do with Marcello Garcia.

2204
02:00:24.611 --> 02:00:28.840
I believe he's a black belt under Marcello.
Uh,
but Josh Waitzkin,

2205
02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:33.900
it was the s I think that was who they were designing that or patterning that

2206
02:00:34.331 --> 02:00:38.800
movie.
I don't know how much of it was based on real life,
but the Bobby Fischer,

2207
02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.510
the original videos,

2208
02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:44.620
it's really fascinating because he would play like 10 games at a time and he

2209
02:00:44.621 --> 02:00:48.580
would walk down this like conference table and just move the pieces,

2210
02:00:48.581 --> 02:00:53.581
like see if you can find Bobby Fischer playing multiple video games or multiple,

2211
02:00:53.890 --> 02:00:56.950
multiple chess games.
Okay.
And probably,

2212
02:00:56.951 --> 02:00:59.290
I think there's one stage where they're in like a little hall and he's walking

2213
02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:00.071
around and playing all of them.

2214
02:01:00.071 --> 02:01:02.800
And these guys are like thinking hard about their one game with him and he's

2215
02:01:02.801 --> 02:01:07.390
just kicking their ass 10 people's asses at the same time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2216
02:01:07.391 --> 02:01:11.380
Well there's just,
again,
it's information chunking.
Like he,
he,

2217
02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:16.150
he looks down and to me it's,
since I don't play chess,
I go,
well,

2218
02:01:16.151 --> 02:01:16.451
okay,

2219
02:01:16.451 --> 02:01:21.320
I know that a rook can move like that and this one can move that way in a pawn.

2220
02:01:21.321 --> 02:01:25.840
Can only do this,
but he's got the whole map set up in his head and he's seen it.

2221
02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:28.030
And just to circle this background,
I think that is,

2222
02:01:28.090 --> 02:01:30.430
people do have a tough time when they look at counter Shaker,

2223
02:01:30.431 --> 02:01:33.720
when they look at quake,
knowing what to look for,
what are the indicators like,

2224
02:01:33.730 --> 02:01:36.280
what are the goals here?
And Keep Watch football or ice hockey say,
okay,

2225
02:01:36.281 --> 02:01:37.270
well they're doing a breakout.

2226
02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.340
This guy's floating deep in the neutral and he's probably gonna look for a pass.

2227
02:01:40.341 --> 02:01:42.890
Like,
okay,
like that's why the defenders thing back with them.

2228
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:45.500
It's much more linear.
You're on one square field.

2229
02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:47.690
When he started playing these video games and all these rooms,
everyone's like,

2230
02:01:47.691 --> 02:01:51.230
what the fuck is going on right there?
It's still there.
Yeah.

2231
02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.540
Well if you watch like Floyd Mayweather fight,

2232
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.530
like one of the things that's amazing about Floyd Mayweather is how he's able to

2233
02:01:57.531 --> 02:02:01.970
kind of dictate his opponent's move shit too.
For this.
They're like,

2234
02:02:01.971 --> 02:02:06.050
he's a pussy.
I'm like,
dude,
this calling him a pussy is so ridiculous.

2235
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:11.280
That is probably one of the most delusional things you could ever do is cold

2236
02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.460
call.
Floyd was,
well he's 48 and no,

2237
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:17.300
it was a professional boxer and a multiple time world champion.

2238
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:22.190
Kind of hard to call him a pussy.
You want people to take your opinion seriously?

2239
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:23.060
Yeah.
They just,

2240
02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:25.250
they get angry because they spent a hundred bucks like I want to see blood

2241
02:02:25.251 --> 02:02:29.240
everywhere.
Yeah.
They just don't understand boxing,
but Mike Tyson,

2242
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:30.650
his movement though,

2243
02:02:30.651 --> 02:02:34.820
what's fascinating about it is he's able to take these guys that are normally

2244
02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:38.870
like high volume attackers and he slows their movement and their Slos,

2245
02:02:38.871 --> 02:02:43.871
their volume output considerably by him dictating how they move.

2246
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:47.690
He just is so much better if they don't get comfortable and they don't know

2247
02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:51.290
exactly what to do because every time they go do something to get popped and so

2248
02:02:51.291 --> 02:02:52.940
they have to recalculate and rude.
They don't,

2249
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:56.510
he doesn't give them the breaks and the openings that they're accustomed to

2250
02:02:56.511 --> 02:02:59.820
getting.
And that's all just because Evansville,

2251
02:03:00.110 --> 02:03:04.130
what's also is information chunking is just better than theirs because he's

2252
02:03:04.131 --> 02:03:07.640
putting more time than they have and thought about it more because he has a

2253
02:03:07.641 --> 02:03:11.990
really good brother or really good father rather who was a who fought sugar ray

2254
02:03:11.991 --> 02:03:13.970
Leonard.
Uh,
his father who trained him,

2255
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:15.740
fought sugar ray Leonard way back in the day.

2256
02:03:15.741 --> 02:03:19.430
Floyd Mayweather see senior and then his uncle is Roger Mayweather,

2257
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.360
who's a world champion as well.
And he's got other people in his family.

2258
02:03:23.361 --> 02:03:26.810
They were really good boxers as well.
So this kid was indoctrinated into boxing.

2259
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.550
So his mind is like,
he's got all these and I'm sure he's a student of the game,

2260
02:03:31.551 --> 02:03:34.670
so he's probably watched a million fights and he knows what goes wrong when you

2261
02:03:34.671 --> 02:03:37.930
do this and just try to bring them down for other things not related to it.

2262
02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.570
All the other things are valid.
I look.
Yeah,

2263
02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:44.200
it just seems like a piece of shit as a human man,
you know,

2264
02:03:44.210 --> 02:03:46.940
I'm just saying that's what they immediately go to,
which is like,
okay,

2265
02:03:46.941 --> 02:03:50.390
well we're watching a fight like he's fighting talk about is like reading

2266
02:03:50.391 --> 02:03:52.030
proclivity or whatever they were talking about.

2267
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:54.590
When people bring that up right away,
that is kind of embarrassing.

2268
02:03:54.591 --> 02:03:56.090
But he's here to fight.

2269
02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:59.750
I know it is kind of weird that he can't read but you know,

2270
02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:03.320
I mean that's a lot of money.
That's an unbalanced thing.
You know,

2271
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:06.590
if you spend that much time boxing and slapping chicks,

2272
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:10.550
you know have much time for reading,
you know,
and counting those out.

2273
02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:13.430
Why does she get counted the money yeahs that's a lot of money.

2274
02:04:13.431 --> 02:04:17.000
It probably can count but can't write well he,
I think he can read.

2275
02:04:17.001 --> 02:04:19.060
It's just a struggle.
It's just not very good at it.

2276
02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:23.450
You were talking about all this like intuitive genius he has and he can't

2277
02:04:23.451 --> 02:04:27.440
transfer it over.
Well it's probably amount of effort.

2278
02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:31.250
How much effort he put into reading was probably very little.
When did he,

2279
02:04:31.251 --> 02:04:34.790
how old was he when he went pro?
I don't know.
I believe it was 19.

2280
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:40.390
He was in the Olympics and he lost a very controversial decision to a guy who's

2281
02:04:41.761 --> 02:04:45.080
like in destitute poverty now.
It's really interesting.
They had a,

2282
02:04:45.081 --> 02:04:48.690
an article about the last guy to beat Floyd Mayweather.

2283
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.040
I forget what publication had it,
but this guy from some,

2284
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:55.680
some country eastern block country,
I think it was,

2285
02:04:56.250 --> 02:05:00.390
it might've been brush or something like that.
Bulgaria,
um,
making shit up China

2286
02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:05.310
hedge my bets.
Um,
but this guy was,
um,

2287
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:10.370
a really good boxer and apparently got a gift decision over Floyd Mayweather and

2288
02:05:11.011 --> 02:05:11.670
then,
uh,

2289
02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:16.670
went on to get involved in a bunch of shady characters and you know,

2290
02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:21.480
career fell apart.
But that was the last time anybody beat Floyd Mayweather.

2291
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:26.010
And that was again,
like when Floyd was 19.
He's 38 now.

2292
02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:30.930
So yeah,
long ass time ago.
Good for him.
Yeah.
I mean,

2293
02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:35.190
look,
there's lessons to be learned.
Even in the Shitty as human beings,

2294
02:05:35.670 --> 02:05:39.150
you can look at what they're successful at and even in the Shitty as human

2295
02:05:39.151 --> 02:05:39.331
beings,

2296
02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:43.650
there's lessons also learning what's the price of success and whether or not

2297
02:05:43.651 --> 02:05:46.470
you're willing to pay that price because oftentimes the price is foolish and

2298
02:05:46.471 --> 02:05:51.270
it's like if you have to become a bad person to be really great at something,

2299
02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:55.830
what are the benefits of being great other than financial success?
Yeah,

2300
02:05:55.831 --> 02:06:00.090
scoring,
getting those points,
you know,
accumulating wealth.

2301
02:06:00.450 --> 02:06:04.650
Is that more important than the way you're treated by your peers,

2302
02:06:04.651 --> 02:06:08.760
your community,
your friends and family?
What'd you you got to Blackbaud?

2303
02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.320
I remember the reading like 15 or something.

2304
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:15.650
I think I was 16 I started training in karate when I was 14 it got super serious

2305
02:06:17.431 --> 02:06:20.520
about taekwondo.
When I was 15 before I was 17 I was a black belt.

2306
02:06:20.610 --> 02:06:23.280
So I mean it sounds like you obviously made a big sacrifice early on.

2307
02:06:23.281 --> 02:06:26.280
You've been doing that your whole life.
Right?
To dive in,
diving into things.

2308
02:06:26.281 --> 02:06:27.600
I didn't have anything else.

2309
02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:32.450
It's like your friends are probably in that realm right now.
Well,
not now.
Let me,

2310
02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:34.860
not a lot of 'em are comedians,
but at the time,
yeah,
it was my whole world,

2311
02:06:34.861 --> 02:06:37.980
but I didn't have anything else.
Like I was socially retarded.

2312
02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:42.750
I didn't have like anything going on.
Like I wasn't academically inclined.

2313
02:06:42.751 --> 02:06:44.040
I didn't like school.

2314
02:06:44.190 --> 02:06:47.900
I just moved into a new neighborhood when I was 14 I felt ostracized and didn't

2315
02:06:47.901 --> 02:06:52.490
feel like I was,
I didn't have any friends while I was in Newton where I was a,

2316
02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:56.400
it was a suburb of Boston.
So it was like,
you get it,
say like I sacrifice,

2317
02:06:56.401 --> 02:06:59.010
but it wasn't like I had all these friends that I couldn't hang out with and I

2318
02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:02.970
had like this family that was missing me.
No,
it was like,
you know,

2319
02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:04.740
my parents were,
I was a latchkey kid,

2320
02:07:04.741 --> 02:07:08.910
so my parents were working all day and you know,
I would,
I just didn't,

2321
02:07:09.150 --> 02:07:10.110
I didn't have anything else.

2322
02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:14.250
So I found this one thing that I felt like could give me some value.

2323
02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:15.810
I could have some.

2324
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:20.520
I felt like I had some personal worth from this,

2325
02:07:20.521 --> 02:07:23.250
from getting good at something.
And then once I got good at it I was like,
wow,

2326
02:07:23.251 --> 02:07:27.720
this is the first thing that I've ever done that gives me like a good feeling by

2327
02:07:27.721 --> 02:07:31.710
being good at.
Whereas like my life before,
that was kind of depressing.

2328
02:07:32.190 --> 02:07:35.890
It was like going from one community to another,
gold,
constantly moving,

2329
02:07:35.891 --> 02:07:38.380
no friends being bullied.
I hated all of that.

2330
02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.250
And then the being bullied part is what led me into martial arts and it's very

2331
02:07:42.251 --> 02:07:45.650
minor bullying.
Like nobody really hurt me or psychological,

2332
02:07:45.690 --> 02:07:49.360
just being nervous all the time,
being scared of people,
you know?

2333
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.290
And I wasn't a big guy,
I was little.
So there's,

2334
02:07:51.291 --> 02:07:55.180
there's like so many different things about it that made martial arts appealing.

2335
02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:59.320
But then the big thing was once I started doing it,
it just became my whole life.

2336
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:02.230
It became everything.
And then that's when I realized,
Oh,

2337
02:08:02.231 --> 02:08:04.210
I'm kind of a crazy person,
you know?

2338
02:08:04.211 --> 02:08:07.570
And all I have to do is like find things and then those things become my whole

2339
02:08:07.571 --> 02:08:08.110
life.

2340
02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:13.110
And the problem with me was that that from the time I was 15 till I was 21 that

2341
02:08:13.391 --> 02:08:17.080
was sort of my developmental period of becoming an adult.

2342
02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:22.320
So that is how my brain formed in this like really laser beam focused kind of

2343
02:08:22.721 --> 02:08:26.470
insane way where I,
I don't give a fuck about anything else.

2344
02:08:26.471 --> 02:08:29.290
And that's what my problem was with video games.

2345
02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:31.060
Cause once I started playing video games,

2346
02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:33.430
somebody be talking to me if I didn't like what they were saying,

2347
02:08:33.431 --> 02:08:35.920
if I was bored I would just start playing video games and my head,

2348
02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:40.160
I'd be like I can be
quick or it can be fucking him rail.

2349
02:08:40.890 --> 02:08:44.620
Yeah.
It's like oftentimes people that are really,

2350
02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:48.970
really good at something or super unbalanced could resonate with different

2351
02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:51.040
things you're saying.
Well that's why I see with you,

2352
02:08:51.041 --> 02:08:55.960
I appreciate the fact that you have put a lot of thought into like doing things,

2353
02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:56.771
going outside,

2354
02:08:56.771 --> 02:09:01.150
playing hockey and getting a real life on top of this video game thing.

2355
02:09:01.151 --> 02:09:03.610
Because obviously if you're really good at this game,

2356
02:09:03.611 --> 02:09:05.080
which obviously you are really good at it,

2357
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:09.190
you must have a sort of obsessive mind.
There's no way.

2358
02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.120
There's no like I have a quote that I use all the time that I came up with a

2359
02:09:13.121 --> 02:09:17.080
long time ago,
is that greatness and insanity,

2360
02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:20.950
our next door neighbors and they borrow each other's sugar cause it really is

2361
02:09:20.951 --> 02:09:25.780
true.
Greatness and madness are so closely related.

2362
02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:29.110
There's almost no way around it because you have to,

2363
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:33.430
in order to achieve a super high level of something you,

2364
02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.670
you have to be able to do it better than the other people.

2365
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:39.250
You have to have more and more of an understanding of it.

2366
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.140
And the only way to do that is you have to,

2367
02:09:41.410 --> 02:09:44.200
you have to not pay attention to other shit.
You know,

2368
02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:47.320
you can't be learning five different languages and you know,

2369
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:51.820
also pursuing a degree in complex mathematics and also doing this and also

2370
02:09:51.821 --> 02:09:54.970
learning how to play guitar and also having a girlfriend who demands all your

2371
02:09:54.971 --> 02:09:58.150
time.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
What about me?
What about us?

2372
02:09:58.151 --> 02:10:00.930
Where are we going?
Where's this headache?
I'm not sure if you're committed.

2373
02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:01.870
Thought

2374
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:03.070
<v 0>about that.
Lately I've been,</v>

2375
02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:06.670
I just kicked someone in the face and a number of double black belt and broads.

2376
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:10.840
They want it all.
They want you all the time.
Where are you?
What about,

2377
02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:14.210
what about our career as a Gamer?
That's the best excuse.
Sorry,
I'm,

2378
02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.130
I got to play a video game for it to like legit chicks probably don't really get

2379
02:10:18.131 --> 02:10:20.440
excited about dating a super high level.

2380
02:10:21.250 --> 02:10:24.070
I don't have too many groupies abroad or here,
but abroad.

2381
02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:28.780
Occasionally there's like girls who it's like they have more like of a new,

2382
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:31.030
like a respect right away you could tell they're trying to put their best foot

2383
02:10:31.031 --> 02:10:34.430
forward when they meet you because here and just,
yeah,
here girls,

2384
02:10:34.431 --> 02:10:37.430
when they meet you and you're their friends,
like their board,
their friends like,

2385
02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:38.960
hey,
by the way,
this guy's really good at video games.

2386
02:10:39.230 --> 02:10:42.950
They want to kind of have their wall up right away.
Like,
is this kid like,
oh,

2387
02:10:42.951 --> 02:10:44.660
he's really good at something.
That's fun.
That's cute.

2388
02:10:44.661 --> 02:10:49.460
You a lot of followers here and I'm just like,
oh sweet bitch.
Fuck you.
Wow.
Now,

2389
02:10:49.461 --> 02:10:53.140
but there's,
there's uh,
yeah,
or their video game groupies though.

2390
02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:57.740
Are there alerts?
There are,
cause there was like pool groupies.

2391
02:10:57.950 --> 02:11:01.010
I mean used to play pool all the time.
The guys who were like really good,

2392
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.650
they would have girls that would like want to bang them.
Yeah.

2393
02:11:03.651 --> 02:11:05.900
I'm not gonna sit here and say that we have like game or orgies everywhere,

2394
02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:10.220
but there are girls who just,
they either linger or they come to events or they,

2395
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.100
they tried to like interact with you in weird ways online so that when they do

2396
02:11:13.101 --> 02:11:16.250
show up at the event you like pay attention to them versus the other.
It's like,

2397
02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:20.030
it's like weird actions.
It's pretty funny.
Yeah.
That's a weird,

2398
02:11:20.031 --> 02:11:21.700
like they're putting out little seeds,

2399
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:24.920
little flirtation seeds to try to get attention when they see you in the

2400
02:11:24.921 --> 02:11:25.754
physical form.

2401
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:28.250
And then that's the best excuse of being a Gamer because you're playing a video

2402
02:11:28.251 --> 02:11:30.710
game you can make,
no,
no,
no,
honey,
I'm practicing really,

2403
02:11:30.711 --> 02:11:35.540
you're actually not doing shades on that computer
practicing.

2404
02:11:35.730 --> 02:11:38.360
So yeah,
team practice,
immerse yourself.
Maybe,
as he said,

2405
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:40.910
don't get anywhere without it.
It is interesting.

2406
02:11:40.911 --> 02:11:44.390
This is the difference in men and women when it comes to what's attractive to

2407
02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:48.620
them,
because with a man,
it's not attractive.
That girl's really good at games,

2408
02:11:48.621 --> 02:11:52.400
but I mean,
it might be on topic.
Watching girls play counterstrike to me,

2409
02:11:52.401 --> 02:11:54.380
I'm always just like,
I had to look away.

2410
02:11:56.690 --> 02:11:57.950
There's few that are pretty good,

2411
02:11:57.951 --> 02:12:01.070
but normally it just immediately turned off like God dammit.

2412
02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:02.720
Well that's the same with standup comedy.

2413
02:12:03.010 --> 02:12:07.430
One of the biggest turnoffs ever is if you like a girl and she's a comic and

2414
02:12:07.431 --> 02:12:11.720
then she's fucking terrible and you're like,
oh,
it's over.
Gotta get Outta here.

2415
02:12:11.721 --> 02:12:16.010
Nice to meet you.
If you're dating a girl and she's a comic and she's bad at it,

2416
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:20.090
you might as well be dating a dude.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

2417
02:12:20.091 --> 02:12:21.010
it's such a turn off.

2418
02:12:21.011 --> 02:12:23.870
She's got a chance to talk like a dude unless you're gay and then getting into

2419
02:12:23.871 --> 02:12:26.860
it is what you're looking for.
But you get my point.
If,

2420
02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:31.490
if you're dating a girl who sucks at something that you're really good at,

2421
02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:35.920
if for whatever reason just immediately kills any attractive quality that she

2422
02:12:35.921 --> 02:12:36.570
might herself.

2423
02:12:36.570 --> 02:12:39.920
What does she just like whip my ass at golf or something now I still feel like I

2424
02:12:39.930 --> 02:12:43.700
just,
some guys are fun like pools a big one for men.

2425
02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:45.200
They find it demoralizing.

2426
02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:48.440
Like they get very intimidated by a woman that was better than them.

2427
02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:49.620
Like some guys,
the,

2428
02:12:49.970 --> 02:12:54.170
even the professional levels we'll play like a really good woman or a high level

2429
02:12:54.171 --> 02:12:57.530
professional woman and fall apart because they're nervous to play.

2430
02:12:57.531 --> 02:13:01.040
A woman didn't want to lose to a wall and I could say from an it the past I've

2431
02:13:01.041 --> 02:13:04.070
played the best counter shit girl teams in the world for like events cause they

2432
02:13:04.071 --> 02:13:06.860
just happen.
They don't go to all the same ones but they have separate events.

2433
02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:10.220
When you play them,
it does feel like a lose lose.
Like you're just like,

2434
02:13:10.221 --> 02:13:13.700
I don't want to either crush them or barely beat them or if I lose then it's

2435
02:13:13.701 --> 02:13:16.700
even worse.
Like even if I win,
I'm expected to crush them.

2436
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:18.080
And see you play them and you're just like,

2437
02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:20.870
I've lost like a couple of rounds like before I went any versus a girl.

2438
02:13:20.871 --> 02:13:24.290
I'm like fuck.
And to blues to them and then you have to talk to them.

2439
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:27.260
Are you intimidated you like,
do you feel like insecure?

2440
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:29.720
I mean at this point in my career I know all the best girls so they kind of my

2441
02:13:29.721 --> 02:13:32.040
friends in the game.
Right.
But yeah,
I'm

2442
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.640
<v 7>sure at certain points for the guys coming up they want to be pro male player</v>

2443
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.520
and they played girls team and lose their probably like fuck,

2444
02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:39.950
I'm going to walk out of the room quietly.
Yeah.

2445
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:44.190
I remember watching pool tournaments in like say like a genetically or someone

2446
02:13:44.191 --> 02:13:46.950
like that would enter the tournament and someone who would play like really good

2447
02:13:46.951 --> 02:13:50.280
would fall apart in front of her cause they just couldn't deal with the

2448
02:13:50.281 --> 02:13:54.020
possibility of losing to this like really pretty girl.
Like they just,

2449
02:13:54.150 --> 02:13:58.500
they wanted to impress her and they were missed nine balls and just like shit.

2450
02:13:58.650 --> 02:14:03.030
Yeah.
The perception men bigger,
stronger,
faster.
Well it's not even just dad.

2451
02:14:03.031 --> 02:14:07.650
It's like men have to win,
you know,
they have this,
this I have to win thing.

2452
02:14:07.890 --> 02:14:12.870
And if you don't win your self worth,
like you devalue who you are.

2453
02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:15.810
I've heard you talk about that stuff in the past,
the caveman mindset,
right?

2454
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:18.090
It's back in the day you just dominate your cave,

2455
02:14:18.091 --> 02:14:21.360
you hunt and you gather like you will.
The reason why,

2456
02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:24.720
I mean there's competition over breeding.
I mean that's really what I mean,

2457
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:26.850
the competition over breeding is,
you know,

2458
02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:31.710
hunter gatherer competition and then it's like fighting off neighboring tribes

2459
02:14:31.711 --> 02:14:34.780
that have trying to come in and take them.
It's all like that.

2460
02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:38.730
So reason why men are such assholes.
It's all,
it's benefited the genes.
It's,

2461
02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:40.140
I mean that's really what it is.

2462
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:42.520
I mean obviously we're moving past that cause you know,

2463
02:14:42.530 --> 02:14:47.530
as technology and society and culture evolves and changes and grows and becomes

2464
02:14:48.151 --> 02:14:51.150
more and more complex,
that stuff becomes less and less necessary.

2465
02:14:51.151 --> 02:14:55.330
But the genetics and the,
the proclivity,
the,
the,

2466
02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:59.280
the inclination rather,
it's always still there.
The competition.

2467
02:14:59.281 --> 02:15:02.640
So when men to lose to women,
like especially in games like pool,

2468
02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:06.750
it's fucking drives them crazy because they can't just say overwhelming them

2469
02:15:06.751 --> 02:15:10.560
with strength.
Anything Ping Pong,
some chick wax at ball by you in ping pong.

2470
02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:15.300
How could he talk?
Damn.
Yeah,

2471
02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:20.430
Ping Pink is intense pink calms her interns.
I'm not interested in it whatsoever,

2472
02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:23.370
but you know,
Aubrey,
Aubrey Plays Ping Pong really goes like,

2473
02:15:23.371 --> 02:15:24.270
let's play ping pong.
I'm like,

2474
02:15:24.271 --> 02:15:27.600
let's go fuck her stupid fucking those bars though,

2475
02:15:27.601 --> 02:15:30.840
that have all sorts of games and I'm like,
they have like shuffleboard pool.

2476
02:15:30.850 --> 02:15:35.660
Foosball drives me nuts.
That's so stupid.
That's so,

2477
02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:37.560
yeah,
but it's just,
it's just,

2478
02:15:37.561 --> 02:15:41.250
you don't have enough control over that stupid fucking,
those shifters.

2479
02:15:41.251 --> 02:15:44.220
They don't have enough movement.
You know?
It's like,
uh,
yeah.

2480
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:47.010
Pissing me off the ball going through the middle of fucking grab that shit and

2481
02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:50.340
throw it out.
Don't even get to it.
Sometimes it's like you can't,

2482
02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:55.140
it's like one of the things that I hate about when you play video games like an

2483
02:15:55.230 --> 02:15:59.100
Xbox controller was how like it doesn't,

2484
02:15:59.101 --> 02:16:00.750
it's not nearly as precise.

2485
02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:06.080
You get used to that was d on the keyboard and the mouse and you know it becomes

2486
02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:07.860
a part of who you are.

2487
02:16:07.890 --> 02:16:10.680
I have so many stories or like I go to like a house or a party or something and

2488
02:16:10.681 --> 02:16:13.530
everyone's like,
let's fuck a pro gamer kid and then it was like played fifa.

2489
02:16:13.531 --> 02:16:15.180
Right now we're playing me in this game and x box.
I'm like,

2490
02:16:15.181 --> 02:16:17.640
I don't fucking play those games.
Like I don't care to be good at them.

2491
02:16:17.641 --> 02:16:18.780
And they're like,
oh,
so I can beat you.

2492
02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:21.600
I'm going to get better in the pro Gamer kid.
And I'm like,
all right,
cool dude.

2493
02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:25.920
You're really sick.
That is an issue though,
right?
What's that?

2494
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:30.010
Switching from a mouse and a KIA team?
Xbox.
I have so

2495
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:33.820
<v 1>much I could probably in counterstrike if you were to pick up all everyone,</v>

2496
02:16:33.850 --> 02:16:36.220
all my friends,
I can play one on 10 against kids.

2497
02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:40.030
Probably playing with an Xbox controller one on one on five.
I've done,

2498
02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:42.580
I did it something from Microsoft so long time ago where they wanted to actually

2499
02:16:42.581 --> 02:16:46.240
see if the synergy was good to have like let x,
y,
x kids play me online.

2500
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:48.730
And I played these kids one on four and I didn't even need sound.

2501
02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:53.200
I was just like running around killing everyone because they're so limited with

2502
02:16:53.201 --> 02:16:56.500
their range of motion that it's not just me.
I'm,

2503
02:16:56.501 --> 02:16:59.620
a lot of my friends could do this,
that or the pro level.
I'm not just some God,

2504
02:16:59.621 --> 02:17:01.320
but it's just the difference between,

2505
02:17:01.450 --> 02:17:03.940
<v 2>isn't that something that they also put into the uh,</v>

2506
02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:08.610
the game engine to make it easier to aim with those things?
Like auto aiming?
Yup.

2507
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:10.320
And it fucks up the precision,
right?

2508
02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.240
<v 1>Yeah.
And then everyone has these things that are extenders for the joysticks,</v>

2509
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:17.210
so it's like longer,
so you have an easier time manipulating the joystick.

2510
02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:17.491
So you know,

2511
02:17:17.491 --> 02:17:20.730
the little thumb pad basically makes them twice as long and that gives you more

2512
02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:21.593
control I guess

2513
02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:22.850
<v 2>we called,
uh,</v>

2514
02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:26.960
how much more control or is it more like a mouse or it's not quiet.

2515
02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:31.610
Just makes it a little plainer to all like call of duty and halo pros at first

2516
02:17:31.611 --> 02:17:35.200
person shooter pros use him on console,
but none of them are.
Yeah,

2517
02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:39.440
that's the thing that sticks up above it.
Oh I see a 10 year old uses that.

2518
02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:43.310
So it just makes it slightly better but still not as good as the mouse and

2519
02:17:43.311 --> 02:17:44.060
keyboard.

2520
02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:47.790
Why don't they have mouse and keyboard for these fucking things if she didn't

2521
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:48.780
been nobody plays out.

2522
02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.670
<v 1>No,
you can use Bluetooth.
We're now,
nowadays you can use Bluetooth keyboards.</v>

2523
02:17:52.671 --> 02:17:56.510
Right.
And there's a,
there's a bunch of input lag when you use them,

2524
02:17:56.570 --> 02:17:58.160
but they do make them,
yeah,

2525
02:17:58.161 --> 02:18:00.920
that's what I had heard that there was a lag between what's not allowed in

2526
02:18:00.921 --> 02:18:03.020
tournaments.
So not you have to use those things.
Yeah.

2527
02:18:03.050 --> 02:18:05.390
Like I couldn't show up and just wax like a call of duty turnout.

2528
02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:07.870
But if I was able to plug in my mouse and keyboard,
I could probably,
even,

2529
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:10.820
this doesn't make any sense to me that they would even have those fucking stupid

2530
02:18:10.821 --> 02:18:14.390
things.
Why not just have mouse and keyboard?
So that's the best input.

2531
02:18:14.391 --> 02:18:17.530
We always joke that like PC players or the master race because you know we

2532
02:18:17.531 --> 02:18:17.990
always,

2533
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:20.510
we always say that that's like a joke between the communities were like let the

2534
02:18:20.511 --> 02:18:23.180
casual guys play on their Xbox and playstation.
That's what it is.

2535
02:18:23.181 --> 02:18:24.340
It's just casual game.
Right.

2536
02:18:24.341 --> 02:18:29.341
It's like I'd rather lay back on my couch and play grand theft auto then have my

2537
02:18:29.661 --> 02:18:32.180
keyboard and mouse.
I tried to twitch and kill people.

2538
02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.970
<v 2>Yeah.
That's what's cool about the keyboard or the uh,
the chiller controller.</v>

2539
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:39.660
I used to have a thing called fucking,
what was it called?

2540
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:42.710
I don't remember the fucking name was,
but it had a,
a,

2541
02:18:42.711 --> 02:18:47.700
a track ball and a handle.
Yup.
But a joystick and you would move it around.

2542
02:18:47.701 --> 02:18:50.580
He would shoot with the trigger was kind of cool cause you could actually shoot

2543
02:18:50.581 --> 02:18:53.320
with a trigger and you would aim with a track ball and track.

2544
02:18:53.321 --> 02:18:58.110
Paul was pretty cool but not quite as good as a mouse and keyboard.

2545
02:18:58.111 --> 02:19:01.680
It was like a step below the really good guys can still fuck you up with it.

2546
02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:04.770
But then once I switched over to a mouse and keyboard,

2547
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:08.100
then all of a sudden I was moving with my left hand and shooting and aiming with

2548
02:19:08.101 --> 02:19:11.790
my right as opposed to shooting with my right and moving and Amy with my left.

2549
02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:14.970
That'd be a mind fuck for me.
I know people use that for like Photoshop,

2550
02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:16.530
I think balls.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2551
02:19:16.531 --> 02:19:19.400
They have like they just move it around but a track balls not nearly as precise.

2552
02:19:19.410 --> 02:19:24.410
A mouse not pry nowadays seems like it's weird because like games are really the

2553
02:19:24.751 --> 02:19:28.100
proving ground for like precision because it's so

2554
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.530
<v 0>critical.
Why?
So?
It's funny when these new,</v>

2555
02:19:30.531 --> 02:19:32.940
these peripheral companies that larger tech or,
yeah,

2556
02:19:32.941 --> 02:19:36.080
larger tech is one of my sponsors.
When they make a new mouse,
they've,

2557
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:36.780
they've recently,

2558
02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:39.470
the past couple of years they have the technology to make amazing stuff,

2559
02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:43.610
but they always add like little like ridges or something on the mouse that as

2560
02:19:43.611 --> 02:19:47.000
pro gamers like,
like to grip the mouse weird.
And the sensor,

2561
02:19:47.210 --> 02:19:50.480
they had these specs that like don't really apply to our range of motion.

2562
02:19:50.481 --> 02:19:52.700
They put like a million dpi you could track,

2563
02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:54.650
well I'm not going to swipe my arm across the room.

2564
02:19:54.651 --> 02:19:58.580
Like I have a certain range of motion and yeah,
I dunno.

2565
02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:02.180
The controller is essentially need.
Um,
I kinda lost my train of thought there.

2566
02:20:02.181 --> 02:20:05.150
But what you then have those Razer mice.
Well,
exactly.
Yeah.

2567
02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:10.100
When I was playing there was still a ball mouse.
It was still ball back then.

2568
02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:12.260
I know their laser now,
right?
Yeah,
of course.

2569
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:15.860
But they had a weird shape that they had created that some people liked and

2570
02:20:15.861 --> 02:20:18.440
other people hated it.
I can never kind of get used to it.

2571
02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:21.620
It was a w it was way weirder than that back in the day.

2572
02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:26.460
The original raiser mouse,
these are,
those are logic tuck.
That's,

2573
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:28.160
that's a Microsoft right there.

2574
02:20:28.970 --> 02:20:32.210
See there's that little like key pad on the top left.
That's weird.
Yeah.

2575
02:20:32.211 --> 02:20:34.340
But those,
this is not,
um,

2576
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:36.470
that none of these are the things that I was talking about.

2577
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:40.250
But this is new shit that they're doing.
This is one,
what's that one?

2578
02:20:40.251 --> 02:20:43.130
That split keyboard down?
Little lower.
Jamie are there.

2579
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:44.750
What the fuck is that thing?

2580
02:20:45.650 --> 02:20:49.550
So since you know a lot of people DWSD so you get your left hand and then I

2581
02:20:49.551 --> 02:20:54.050
guess that's the right handed version.
No,
this is an idea.
This is a concept,
but,

2582
02:20:54.690 --> 02:20:57.570
but I played on something like that just for what?
In my left hand only.

2583
02:20:57.620 --> 02:21:00.860
It's just the WASD.
What's your theory at mouse?

2584
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:06.830
I use a larger tech g 100 s it's very,
it's the,
it's the ambidextrous.

2585
02:21:06.831 --> 02:21:10.340
So it's very simple.
It's is trackball.

2586
02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:12.770
You'll find a lot of the pro gamers,

2587
02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:15.380
they don't need any more than like three to five buttons on their mouse.

2588
02:21:15.381 --> 02:21:17.000
Like the world of Warcraft.

2589
02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:19.580
People are casual gamers and have all these millions of buttons and lights and

2590
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:20.360
switches.

2591
02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:23.210
And that's kind of fun because you have all these macro binds for the spells.

2592
02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:25.930
But for our gave me just like a something you can grip,

2593
02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:29.390
it's not overwhelming in your hand or has a weird center gravity or has all

2594
02:21:29.391 --> 02:21:32.540
these lights.
We just need to grip it well and have good tracking.

2595
02:21:32.541 --> 02:21:36.350
It's pretty simple.
Now if a new game came out,
like say you know,

2596
02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:39.620
there's call of duty and all these different games and new game out came out,

2597
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:41.210
it became the shit.

2598
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:45.230
And you started seeing that trend where everybody was slowly drifting off to

2599
02:21:45.231 --> 02:21:47.960
that game.
What do you do?
Do you decide,
okay,

2600
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:50.150
I've got to fucking pick this game up.
And if you do,

2601
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:54.810
are you starting from scratch?
Are you starting from like halfway?
Uh,

2602
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:57.250
I guess it depends how new the game.
He's like current call Denise,

2603
02:21:57.290 --> 02:21:58.460
if it was on PC,
I'd be,

2604
02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:01.190
I'd be above average would probably be a decent competitive player.

2605
02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:04.130
You have to learn all the maps and then the metagame has gone obviously because

2606
02:22:04.131 --> 02:22:06.460
there's no information chunks that exist at this point.

2607
02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:10.280
The sport said literally new sport.
Now.
Um,

2608
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:14.300
I don't know.
It depends,
you know,
like if the game has so much support,

2609
02:22:14.301 --> 02:22:17.030
how viable is it is a job,
what do I need to do to make money?

2610
02:22:17.031 --> 02:22:20.600
Do I need to win every tournament?
Do I need to just be a top hundred competitor?

2611
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:22.680
Would you dip your toes in like in the,

2612
02:22:22.681 --> 02:22:25.650
would you start fucking with it occasionally and then say,

2613
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:26.760
I've got to figure out what to do here.

2614
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:30.540
Like how do you know where the tide's going?
Yeah,
you don't always,

2615
02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:33.280
but you can kind of tell based off like player numbers,
right?
Like counterstrike,

2616
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:34.980
Grote counterstrike go.

2617
02:22:34.981 --> 02:22:38.520
The game I play is kind of had like an exponential growth the past like year and

2618
02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:39.990
a half still.
Uh,
yeah.

2619
02:22:39.991 --> 02:22:43.030
Recently it got to re insurgence because they took the model of League of

2620
02:22:43.031 --> 02:22:44.940
legends where you can customize all the shit in the game.

2621
02:22:44.941 --> 02:22:47.550
Counterstrike got a little bland for people because there was the same thing

2622
02:22:47.551 --> 02:22:48.180
always.

2623
02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:50.640
But now they've made it so you can customize the way your gun looks and all

2624
02:22:50.641 --> 02:22:52.320
these little gimmicky things that are pretty cool,

2625
02:22:52.321 --> 02:22:55.890
but they don't really change the game and that brought in new players,
new money,

2626
02:22:55.891 --> 02:22:58.170
which makes the game developer pool more money into it.

2627
02:22:58.170 --> 02:22:59.490
Keep updating the nuances.

2628
02:22:59.491 --> 02:23:02.550
Maybe there's a glitch and the old game they would never fix it because that's

2629
02:23:02.551 --> 02:23:04.800
it.
They're not going to release a new version when the next one comes out.

2630
02:23:04.810 --> 02:23:06.410
Have Fun.
With counterstrike,

2631
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:10.200
they constantly updated and upgraded so you could tell how popular the game is

2632
02:23:10.201 --> 02:23:15.030
by just how the community vibe is,
how many tournaments are happening,
what not.

2633
02:23:15.031 --> 02:23:17.830
Like Dota League of legends,
they have tournaments all the time.
Counterstrike,

2634
02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:21.210
we have tournaments all the time.
Quake,
they have QuakeCon now.

2635
02:23:21.211 --> 02:23:24.390
They don't really have any more tournaments.
It just kind of slowly died down.

2636
02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:27.480
Maybe lack of interest back then.
They didn't have the same model.

2637
02:23:27.481 --> 02:23:31.020
The game developers that is to make money.
They will just release the game.

2638
02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.000
They make money and quake.

2639
02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:36.500
The players don't really have an opportunity to make money and what not to this

2640
02:23:36.501 --> 02:23:39.390
point.
Which thing?
Twitch.
Yeah,
so a couple of them,

2641
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:43.680
like I know the top quake players and if they had twitch now and the game was

2642
02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:45.630
still big,
they would all be in a similar boat as I am.

2643
02:23:45.631 --> 02:23:49.500
But unfortunately the game kind of plateaued in the bubble popped before twitch

2644
02:23:49.501 --> 02:23:51.600
got big and they just,
there's no tournaments.

2645
02:23:51.630 --> 02:23:54.240
They just don't have anywhere to compete.
Yeah.
So that's what I'm saying.

2646
02:23:54.330 --> 02:23:58.250
How do you avoid being one of those guys?
It seems to me it's kind of all tell.

2647
02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:01.110
You don't really know,
especially if you're like a starcraft player.

2648
02:24:01.470 --> 02:24:02.640
Those guys play starcraft.

2649
02:24:02.641 --> 02:24:05.850
Like there's not many other shooter games or starcraft style games.

2650
02:24:05.851 --> 02:24:10.280
They can go play.
Starcraft goes away.
Your fun mobile has the most options.

2651
02:24:10.281 --> 02:24:12.510
So mobile is a multiplayer online battle arena.

2652
02:24:12.511 --> 02:24:14.750
That's Dota League of legends and heroes and new earth.

2653
02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:18.180
They're basically almost the same game.
One guy there,

2654
02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:20.070
they're literally one guy created Dota.

2655
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:24.300
There's a Warcraft three brand a long time ago and it had like one map and

2656
02:24:24.301 --> 02:24:24.661
that's it.

2657
02:24:24.661 --> 02:24:28.650
There's like three lanes and whatnot and all these other games since there was

2658
02:24:28.651 --> 02:24:31.140
like the guy in the sky independently made the map.

2659
02:24:31.141 --> 02:24:34.950
I think it was mad frog ice frog or something.
I forget his name.

2660
02:24:34.951 --> 02:24:36.840
And Basically League of legends,

2661
02:24:37.290 --> 02:24:40.920
Dota and heroes of newers three different game developers.

2662
02:24:40.921 --> 02:24:42.990
They're almost the same concept game.

2663
02:24:42.991 --> 02:24:47.610
Everything's have slightly different heroes and champions and spells.
But um,

2664
02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:51.390
basically they normally say like people who can't go pro and Dota go pro and

2665
02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:54.030
legal legends.
People who can't go pro and legal legends go pro in here,

2666
02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:55.380
Hon Niros are new earth.

2667
02:24:55.740 --> 02:24:59.490
So it's like this succession of almost the same game but just like more and more

2668
02:24:59.491 --> 02:25:00.750
money and more and more tournaments.

2669
02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:05.490
If you put me in a time machine from back when I was playing quake and then it

2670
02:25:05.491 --> 02:25:09.240
like in the nineties and then jumped me here today,
I'd be like,

2671
02:25:09.241 --> 02:25:13.860
what in the actual fuck is going on?
Yeah.
I want to see this league of Legend.

2672
02:25:13.861 --> 02:25:17.290
Sure.
Show me some video gaming and streaming.
No,
no.

2673
02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:20.310
I just want to see what it looks like an iPad game.

2674
02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.360
But it wasn't so popular.
It's super casual friendliness.
Is it here?
Yeah.

2675
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:29.110
So so it's v it caters a lot.

2676
02:25:29.111 --> 02:25:32.350
There's a shit ton of girls and the kids and God Jorgensen.

2677
02:25:32.351 --> 02:25:34.270
Just send me a text message.
Thanks for the twitch.

2678
02:25:34.271 --> 02:25:39.040
Shout out homie cause he's got a giant twitch.
So this is the game.

2679
02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:41.590
Um,
so it's the League of legends.

2680
02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:45.190
I honestly don't even play the game so I couldn't tell you what the fuck is

2681
02:25:45.191 --> 02:25:49.690
going on.
I know vaguely what's going on.
It's what?
It's free.
It's free to play.

2682
02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:50.081
It's really,

2683
02:25:50.081 --> 02:25:53.260
that was one of the first games have made their money model not off on the game

2684
02:25:53.261 --> 02:25:55.960
but off all the things you could buy in the game or transactions.

2685
02:25:57.370 --> 02:25:59.680
So that's Kinda,
I guess that was the right term.

2686
02:25:59.681 --> 02:26:01.840
But that's what I was talking about earlier.
That's what cs go has now.

2687
02:26:01.841 --> 02:26:05.350
MAACO transactions.
Those are really problematic for thinking phones.

2688
02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:07.360
That's why quake was never as big though.

2689
02:26:07.361 --> 02:26:09.580
Cause like if they had this model of micro transactions,

2690
02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:11.690
you could change the way your laser gun works.
So your rocket guy,

2691
02:26:12.250 --> 02:26:14.230
that seems like that would have been like,

2692
02:26:14.470 --> 02:26:16.600
I mean even though it might be a dollar $2 transaction,

2693
02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:20.200
if 300,000 kids who are doing it a week,
you're going to see some return.

2694
02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:24.190
They see.
It seems like they're fucking you though.
Like I don't want,

2695
02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:26.500
but they're like,
they have a champion,
they choose,
right,

2696
02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:29.440
and they run around and then these little like minions,

2697
02:26:29.441 --> 02:26:31.510
I honestly don't really even understand the game too much.

2698
02:26:31.511 --> 02:26:33.580
So that that guy with the green health bar next to him,

2699
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:37.910
he's the main one that's his crew mob and behind him that
he's towers.

2700
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:41.640
These are superheroes,
I guess.
Is that what this is not,

2701
02:26:41.641 --> 02:26:43.930
not necessarily superheroes,
but heroes.
Meaning they're just like,

2702
02:26:43.931 --> 02:26:46.980
they're super strong.
Those are,
you choose because they have different skillsets,

2703
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:49.840
right?
One might be more,
have more defense,
so they call him like a tank.

2704
02:26:49.841 --> 02:26:53.320
He's really strong with his defense.
Some are better at attacking,

2705
02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:56.350
maybe they tagged better close range,
maybe the tag better long range.

2706
02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.850
So you check it's five versus five normally.
So the pro teams go,
they've,

2707
02:27:00.851 --> 02:27:04.810
they're strategizing a,
do we need,
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.

2708
02:27:04.811 --> 02:27:08.710
But they need like,
you know,
close range attackers,
the tank,
this guy,
that guy.

2709
02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:12.460
Did you play a lot of destiny?
No.
I would play it if it's on PC,

2710
02:27:12.461 --> 02:27:14.350
but I just honestly first person shooters,

2711
02:27:14.351 --> 02:27:17.560
like I can't spend my free time playing them anymore unless I'm going to

2712
02:27:17.561 --> 02:27:20.660
casually play it on this.
This is ugly to look out.
It looks fat acid.

2713
02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:22.350
It seems like I gave him that.
You would like to think,

2714
02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:26.630
oh you talk about this looks [inaudible] destiny the shooter game the other game

2715
02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:29.050
now.
And then I just never connected to it.
You know,

2716
02:27:29.051 --> 02:27:32.980
stupid and counter striking quake.
You see it,
you feel that you have in flow.

2717
02:27:32.981 --> 02:27:34.450
Their strategy is very intuitive.

2718
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:38.440
He's go to go to war counterstrike one and let's just,
just for graph,
just for,

2719
02:27:38.441 --> 02:27:40.750
um,
so let's see a good person if I scroll down.

2720
02:27:41.470 --> 02:27:45.280
So there's not really any pros playing right now.
You can go to the top though.

2721
02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:49.030
Actually scroll down.
I saw named Robyn official one more down.

2722
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:51.940
Right in the middle,
right there.
Click that guy.
He's an old Swedish pro.

2723
02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:57.880
He gives him a plane in awhile.
So this,
this is so much more interesting to me.

2724
02:27:58.270 --> 02:28:00.940
So he's running out of spawn right now.
Is this,
is the gun around?

2725
02:28:00.941 --> 02:28:04.930
He's got an AK 47 so,
but this is like,

2726
02:28:04.931 --> 02:28:09.190
you're watching like the map.
So he's going to see on the left here.
Most likely.

2727
02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:12.610
I just couldn't imagine why other games don't do it just like this.

2728
02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:15.520
He does that as teammate trade to kill it.
So it's good.

2729
02:28:15.521 --> 02:28:17.680
And then they got another kill.
So there an advantage or enough four hours,

2730
02:28:17.681 --> 02:28:21.610
three and a half to three verse three.
Nice.
What I'm talking.
Yeah,
I

2731
02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:28.110
pointed at it.
Right to kill us.
But this is so much more fun to look at.

2732
02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:30.140
All right.
Yeah.
Like if you're playing it too,

2733
02:28:30.141 --> 02:28:31.700
it's like it's so much more immersive.

2734
02:28:31.701 --> 02:28:35.450
Like you feel like this is going on when you're looking down and everyone has

2735
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:39.740
like a bar with a health bar above their head and we were throwing spells and

2736
02:28:39.741 --> 02:28:41.930
you're looking down there just so bizarre looking.

2737
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:44.090
Yeah and as I said earlier and League of legends,

2738
02:28:44.091 --> 02:28:46.190
when someone's getting out skilled or they're winning around,

2739
02:28:46.191 --> 02:28:49.700
it's normally like pretty drawn out.
Five,
10,
15,
20 minutes.

2740
02:28:50.310 --> 02:28:52.850
What's cool about cash check and very intuitive for spectators.

2741
02:28:52.851 --> 02:28:55.850
That right there you just talking about it didn't die right.
We'll also,

2742
02:28:55.851 --> 02:28:58.340
it seems to count it happens quicker with counterstrike.

2743
02:28:58.430 --> 02:29:01.790
The physics are very similar to real life physics.

2744
02:29:01.791 --> 02:29:05.240
Like you can't do any weird shit like you can,
you can do weird shit and quake.

2745
02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:08.240
We could jump a little higher than you really would kill a to in this game you

2746
02:29:08.241 --> 02:29:12.940
can't prone,
you could duck stand and walk and run.
Um,

2747
02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:16.190
you can prone in some games like call of duty.
You could like do some weird shit.

2748
02:29:16.191 --> 02:29:17.390
We like jumping and slide.

2749
02:29:17.391 --> 02:29:21.140
It's got supermanning I think he like jumped in like extended and lay down.

2750
02:29:21.141 --> 02:29:25.610
It's weird.
Wow.
Stadiums of people watching you guys play or final matches?

2751
02:29:25.611 --> 02:29:29.370
Like League of legends though?
Like Korea,
the biggest one I was at recent,

2752
02:29:29.371 --> 02:29:30.470
it was in Poland and we fill it up.

2753
02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:34.100
There's like a 20,000 person arena and [inaudible] thousand eight I was in the

2754
02:29:34.101 --> 02:29:35.780
final for that,
but it was awesome to watch.

2755
02:29:35.930 --> 02:29:40.130
So you were watching and these guys were playing in 20,000 people were there.

2756
02:29:40.170 --> 02:29:43.220
You have a video on my Instagram or I'm like shooting it over my shoulder and

2757
02:29:43.221 --> 02:29:47.990
everyone's like and Ip virtus pro and ice cream at the teenagers in this epic

2758
02:29:47.991 --> 02:29:52.970
because wow,
the arenas,
thousand people screaming that normally set it up.

2759
02:29:52.970 --> 02:29:55.400
Like every player has a projector to their point of view.

2760
02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:59.090
So there's like 10 projectors and then one giant projector for the commentators.

2761
02:29:59.270 --> 02:30:03.170
Wow.
This is the color of a play by play.
Where do you think this is going?
Like,

2762
02:30:03.171 --> 02:30:04.940
what do you,
if you had to envision,

2763
02:30:04.941 --> 02:30:08.540
if you had to prognosticate and you look at where games are right now and he

2764
02:30:08.541 --> 02:30:11.210
tried to extrapolate and look,
you know,
five,

2765
02:30:11.211 --> 02:30:14.060
10 years in the future when you think it's going to be,
not ray Kurzweil,

2766
02:30:14.061 --> 02:30:17.750
but let's see if I was ray,
I don't think it's,

2767
02:30:17.810 --> 02:30:20.600
I don't think it's success.
Basically.

2768
02:30:20.601 --> 02:30:23.240
I think what we've realized in the community and a lot of these top people who

2769
02:30:23.241 --> 02:30:27.020
run the companies realizes that like TV and the mainstream routes that everyone

2770
02:30:27.021 --> 02:30:29.400
wants to go like reality TV,
let's show the gamers behind the scenes.

2771
02:30:29.401 --> 02:30:32.210
Like that shit just isn't what is necessary for this world.

2772
02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:33.200
So what they're doing now,

2773
02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:36.110
and what I think it'll turn into is what you're currently seeing now.

2774
02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.860
Just a little bit higher production quality and more,
uh,

2775
02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:42.760
more catered to the players and they have an advanced,

2776
02:30:42.761 --> 02:30:44.960
maybe player's lounge is better warm up areas.
Like,

2777
02:30:44.961 --> 02:30:48.530
I think everything's going to be somewhat similar but tidy it up just enough to

2778
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:50.960
make the,
all the narratives of the protein is more clear to the,

2779
02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:55.430
to the mainstream to make when you watched like to make all the information much

2780
02:30:55.431 --> 02:30:59.630
more presented clearly.
Cause obviously not anyone watching would say,

2781
02:30:59.631 --> 02:31:00.590
oh that's their ammo.

2782
02:31:00.591 --> 02:31:03.170
How much ammo to do some really what I was asking what I was,

2783
02:31:03.171 --> 02:31:07.650
I just saying I think,
I think that's,
I think it's going to keep growing and I,

2784
02:31:07.651 --> 02:31:08.484
and I think

2785
02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:13.220
you're not going to see these astronomical changes where we're like every match

2786
02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:16.790
is in a huge Madison Square Garden.
That's not really what I meant either.

2787
02:31:16.791 --> 02:31:19.980
I meant with video games themselves.
Yeah.
Like it seems

2788
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.580
<v 2>like the games themselves are getting more and more complex and more and more</v>

2789
02:31:23.581 --> 02:31:27.130
immersive.
Like where,
where could this possibly type stuff?
Yeah.

2790
02:31:27.131 --> 02:31:31.110
Do you think that that's that that's a possibility like that the oculus rift

2791
02:31:31.111 --> 02:31:34.620
thing that comic was talking about,
do you,
you,
you don't think so Brian?
Yeah.

2792
02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:35.760
How come?
What do you think?

2793
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:38.220
<v 3>I think there's going to be something that's going to Trump that.</v>

2794
02:31:38.221 --> 02:31:42.000
I think it's nice.
It's a fun little gimmick type thing,

2795
02:31:42.001 --> 02:31:45.180
but like the thing we were talking about earlier about get people getting sick

2796
02:31:45.181 --> 02:31:47.130
and how heavy it is and stuff.

2797
02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:51.390
I think in 10 or 15 years that's just going to be like a a Beta test of what

2798
02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:54.240
we're talking about and it's probably going to be just like a contact lens that

2799
02:31:54.241 --> 02:31:58.320
you put it in your eye and it turns your living room and that technology,

2800
02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:00.810
and like you said,
exponential growth of technology is insane.

2801
02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:03.750
We might just have one chip,
we might not need it at Oculus.

2802
02:32:03.751 --> 02:32:05.160
We might just have a little tablet thing.

2803
02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:08.760
We put our temple and all of sudden you're experiencing this with no fatigue.

2804
02:32:09.470 --> 02:32:12.830
<v 2>Have you seen those goggles to turn the whole world into a desktop?</v>

2805
02:32:12.860 --> 02:32:13.730
The video games

2806
02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:18.020
<v 3>posted a crazy video I want to play.
It's called the void.
It's the HD version.</v>

2807
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:22.280
I'll show you.
It's Oculus rift.
Oh,
okay.
Here we go.
Go full screen.

2808
02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:24.040
<v 7>Start it from the beginning.</v>

2809
02:32:28.090 --> 02:32:28.923
<v 4>Okay,</v>

2810
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:36.290
<v 2>cool.
Graphics.
What if you could explore new dimensions,</v>

2811
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:38.060
new worlds

2812
02:32:39.290 --> 02:32:43.430
<v 7>from your bedroom
where dreams become reality.</v>

2813
02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:48.580
<v 4>They build a space in a warehouse.</v>

2814
02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:53.290
<v 7>Imagination has no limits.</v>

2815
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:55.663
<v 4>Whoa.</v>

2816
02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:00.840
<v 7>Okay,</v>

2817
02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:05.840
so this guy has virtual reality goggles on unparalleled visuals and body

2818
02:33:06.841 --> 02:33:10.890
tracking.
Oh,
see you're wearing some crazy vest.
Oh my God,

2819
02:33:10.891 --> 02:33:15.300
this guy's walking through a warehouse and things are coming at them.

2820
02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:20.280
Oh my God.
Virtual worlds built over physical environments.
Oh,

2821
02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:24.900
this is it.
Jamie,
you just answered my question.
This is the fucking future.

2822
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:27.910
So I definitely think like laser tag will get invented.

2823
02:33:28.460 --> 02:33:32.490
It's like little laser tech things will be definitely environmental effects.

2824
02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:37.070
Oh my God.
This is for the super casual player obviously,
right?
Yeah,

2825
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:39.840
super casual per se.
Like single player Games,
right?

2826
02:33:39.841 --> 02:33:42.900
You're playing your own journey story right here.
Not Casual.

2827
02:33:42.901 --> 02:33:47.901
Meaning this is a place where you would rent out like a laser tag and virtual.

2828
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:52.640
Like I don't ever see this taking over where it's in your house and no,

2829
02:33:53.010 --> 02:33:56.400
but this could be like an arena,
like where you play football.

2830
02:33:56.910 --> 02:34:00.840
I mean this could be the future where you're watching people play in a
warehouse.

2831
02:34:01.130 --> 02:34:04.050
So I think that's why my grandpa,
this is amazing.

2832
02:34:04.290 --> 02:34:06.120
I don't think this is going to be when your Grandpa,
dude,

2833
02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:08.760
I think he's going to be a game where you accidentally get your girlfriend

2834
02:34:08.761 --> 02:34:12.330
pregnant.
This exists.
Well,
one of those super soon.

2835
02:34:12.930 --> 02:34:17.850
This is nuts man.
These guys all have fake swords and they're,
oh my God.

2836
02:34:17.851 --> 02:34:22.851
This various games that you could play and they're fighting against dragons with

2837
02:34:23.831 --> 02:34:27.550
swords.
This is fucking,
this is all concept obviously.

2838
02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:31.540
Well it seems like they were showing the actual physical environment,

2839
02:34:31.541 --> 02:34:35.870
like they're creating it.
I think it's like a demo.
What CGI on top of,

2840
02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:38.200
well let's go to the void.com and find out,

2841
02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:41.920
go to the void.com and see what the fuck.
How'd they get the void?

2842
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:46.440
They must have to pay for that bitch.
That's my plan.

2843
02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:47.950
I don't think that'll answer.
East sports says,

2844
02:34:47.951 --> 02:34:52.120
I guess why I went down the other path of talking like I don't know how that

2845
02:34:52.121 --> 02:34:54.730
would enter your sports.
Something that's,

2846
02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:59.670
so you're primarily concerned with the sport professional sport aspect sign

2847
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:04.480
attached to pleasant Grove,
Utah.
And after summer,

2848
02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:09.680
so essentially a year from now I could see how bad ass,
what is that game?
Uh,

2849
02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:14.180
with the dragons recently came out single dragging haunted cat.

2850
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:16.420
Look at what you're saying here.
Look what they're saying here.

2851
02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:19.480
Scroll elder scrolls versions of infinite dimensions.

2852
02:35:19.481 --> 02:35:22.570
The void is exactly what our virtual entertainment centers will offer.

2853
02:35:22.571 --> 02:35:26.950
Experience everything from haunted castles to dinosaur safaris to futuristic

2854
02:35:26.951 --> 02:35:31.450
battlefields.
And with our competitive or cooperative multiplayer modes,

2855
02:35:31.451 --> 02:35:34.030
you can share these incredible experiences with family and friends.

2856
02:35:34.270 --> 02:35:36.250
See that might be a weird issue,
man.

2857
02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:39.280
If these games started becoming physical,

2858
02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:43.690
if you start having these competitions,
like you're playing one on,

2859
02:35:44.050 --> 02:35:45.490
you're playing for other teams,

2860
02:35:45.491 --> 02:35:49.300
five on five or how many people are encountering driver's side,
five versus five.

2861
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:53.500
Imagine if you're doing five versus five and these things and it becomes about

2862
02:35:53.501 --> 02:35:58.501
athletics and comes about athletes competing in virtual environments,

2863
02:35:58.930 --> 02:36:03.160
in video games.
I mean that really could be possible.
Sorta like dance,

2864
02:36:03.161 --> 02:36:06.150
dance revolution.
Get you guys in shape.
Like I said,
that's right.

2865
02:36:06.151 --> 02:36:09.010
I need that supersedes.
Then after that it's,
I don't need to get in shape.

2866
02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:11.520
I just plug in one.

2867
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:15.220
That's going to be weird if people resist the getting in shape part this,
I mean,

2868
02:36:15.221 --> 02:36:17.950
who knows what,
what this is going to be or whether this is going to catch on,

2869
02:36:18.430 --> 02:36:22.510
but I think like,
why would you go to the movies when you could live a movie?

2870
02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:26.170
When you could go,
I mean,
imagine if you had like the Hobbit,

2871
02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:31.200
like that kind of graphics and you're actually in the environment walk through

2872
02:36:31.421 --> 02:36:34.470
the battlefield next to Gandalf fuck dude.
And they,

2873
02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:39.310
they figure out a way to sculpt the ground in a way that makes it feel like

2874
02:36:39.311 --> 02:36:43.030
you're going uphill and downhill and dirt under your feet and rocks and

2875
02:36:43.031 --> 02:36:43.864
different terrains.

2876
02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:47.740
We did figure that out and we're experiencing it in the past of our current

2877
02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.760
development.
Yeah,

2878
02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:55.050
the whole virtual reality right now.
Right.
Well that's,
that's the,

2879
02:36:55.330 --> 02:36:59.210
the mind fuck of all mine is that one day they will be an artificial reality.

2880
02:36:59.211 --> 02:37:02.260
It's indiscernible from this reality and how do we know we're not already in it.

2881
02:37:02.390 --> 02:37:05.410
We're in it.
DMT.
Oh,
people think so.
It comes,

2882
02:37:05.411 --> 02:37:09.070
I mean it does come up every now and again.
Jordan.

2883
02:37:09.071 --> 02:37:11.770
I think we've said everything we can say about video gaming.
Yeah man.

2884
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:12.790
Anything else to add day?

2885
02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:16.160
I shout out to everyone who shout outs all you free speech

2886
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:20.030
<v 3>and a little bit about East sports today.
If you haven't got enough info from me,</v>

2887
02:37:20.031 --> 02:37:21.190
feel free to look around.
Yeah.

2888
02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:24.590
<v 2>And you could find Jordan.
What is your,
uh,
your Twitter handle?</v>

2889
02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:27.920
<v 3>C Nine n zero t.
H.
I.
N.
G.
So c nine nothing</v>

2890
02:37:28.050 --> 02:37:32.650
<v 2>[inaudible] nothing is your handle on cloud nine is my organization I compete</v>

2891
02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:37.520
