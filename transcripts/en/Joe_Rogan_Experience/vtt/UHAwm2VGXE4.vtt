00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day she and she's talking about,</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>this might be my last fight,</v>

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:07.561
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:07.651
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

6
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think she said that.</v>

7
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I think she said she's close a few less.</v>

8
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Which when you hear that right that you were talking about having one foot out</v>

9
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>bowls.</v>

10
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>So let's say she has two fights left,</v>

11
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.231
<v Speaker 1>maybe three,</v>

12
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:19.621
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

13
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but she's not the same draw as Connor.</v>

14
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

15
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just new.</v>

16
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.011
<v Speaker 1>You look at the number,</v>

17
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>she's not the same drawl,</v>

18
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but if she comes back beats and Amanda Nunez armbars or and then fight Cyborg</v>

19
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.361
<v Speaker 1>and then fights.</v>

20
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Holly Beats Beats Holly gets her rematch on Barnard as big as Connor.</v>

21
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that because as that happened,</v>

22
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>he likes to bet Mr Joe Rody.</v>

23
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

24
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>as these people,</v>

25
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>when they're star gets more and more giant as Rhonda,</v>

26
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>if Rhonda came back and started winning again,</v>

27
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>her star would get more and more giant.</v>

28
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.021
<v Speaker 1>It would get bigger.</v>

29
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It would fuel more.</v>

30
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>The more bodies she claims,</v>

31
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>the more fuel for her fire we'll have.</v>

32
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>That is what happens all the time.</v>

33
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It means it's pure speculation.</v>

34
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But when the way Connor has been winning,</v>

35
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>she can win in spectacular fashion or the way she was winning when she fucked up</v>

36
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Alexis Davis and Sara Mcmann Merkin girls,</v>

37
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>mark and convention custom one 15.</v>

38
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>She could never make,</v>

39
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:10.404
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

40
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck No.</v>

41
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.743
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

42
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

43
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>she's way too big,</v>

44
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>but is she okay?</v>

45
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>That'd be,</v>

46
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.981
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>because she looks really,</v>

49
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>really rushed away and sometimes that ain't,</v>

50
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

51
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.073
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing.</v>

52
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.513
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

53
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>if for Conor and this,</v>

54
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.461
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

55
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not rooting for favorites to,</v>

56
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it from business standpoint for Connor,</v>

57
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>he's such a big draw.</v>

58
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

59
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>What's going to help him in his negotiating power if Rhonda worked her lose this</v>

60
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>next fight because then he's like,</v>

61
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only motherfucker in town.</v>

62
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You guys were just claiming me and Rhonda.</v>

63
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

64
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>She's just lost.</v>

65
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I need my fucking money.</v>

66
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.661
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

68
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:43.051
<v Speaker 1>Ron has,</v>

69
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>has a tough fight in front of her.</v>

70
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez has,</v>

71
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>God damn scary.</v>

72
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>She's scary girl.</v>

73
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I was saying before Ronda lost to Holly,</v>

74
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I was saying she should've got the title fight and I said,</v>

75
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I said that,</v>

76
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I think she's the most dangerous one.</v>

77
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.323
<v Speaker 1>I was talking shit to you.</v>

78
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>The way she stopped Sam Mcmann.</v>

79
00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>She cracks hanging I with that right hand.</v>

80
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 1>She hits like a Mack truck.</v>

81
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>She hits like a dude,</v>

82
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

83
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg kits like a dude,</v>

85
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Amanda hits like a strong girl.</v>

86
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.893
<v Speaker 1>Big Difference.</v>

87
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

88
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>case like scary.</v>

89
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Like Tyrone Woodley with braids.</v>

90
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.161
<v Speaker 1>Let's be real.</v>

91
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>She hits so hard and gets no love cause you so goddamn scary and can't make the</v>

92
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

93
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>She also has a,</v>

94
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>a better arsenal.</v>

95
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll throw kicks and knees.</v>

96
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Also Blackstone on the ground.</v>

97
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.353
<v Speaker 1>Think Amanda.</v>

98
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Amanda is,</v>

99
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but Amanda has lost on the ground before she got beat up by cats and gone on the</v>

100
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

101
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

102
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Cyber Grip your limbs off.</v>

103
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>But she's getting no love.</v>

104
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

105
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.263
<v Speaker 1>she's too big.</v>

106
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I know it's nine 55.</v>

107
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.103
<v Speaker 1>at one 50.</v>

109
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.581
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

111
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:41.761
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

112
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>like if they did that whole thing where I'm talking about the eliminated weight</v>

113
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:44.831
<v Speaker 1>cuts,</v>

114
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>so there'd be two girls.</v>

115
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>A cyborg would fight it like one 81 80.</v>

116
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It'd be,</v>

117
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>it'd be hurt in that big ass girl.</v>

118
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Gabby can't see us.</v>

119
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>He applies it to 80,</v>

120
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's all we got for,</v>

121
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>you would have to cut weight to me.</v>

122
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>We fight every other weekend.</v>

124
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Like Tim Silvia and Andrea Lawsky.</v>

125
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's do that every other weekend,</v>

126
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.240
<v Speaker 1>every other weekend because all we did is the old days.</v>

127
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.093
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

128
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

129
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I think for Rhonda,</v>

130
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the Amanda Nunez Fight stylist getting again,</v>

131
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:13.541
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

132
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>We don't know where Rhonda is a mental state.</v>

133
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.981
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

134
00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but stylists gates a great matchup for Rhonda?</v>

135
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.931
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

136
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I think if she comes ready prepared as a good camp,</v>

138
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>she Mercer,</v>

139
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that you look at the way she fucked up Misha Tate,</v>

140
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Eagle techgirl presents a lot of danger with those punches,</v>

141
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>especially considering what happened with Holly and Ronda.</v>

142
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

144
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I think she presents a lot of,</v>

145
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Danes shoot a hundred percent Joe.</v>

146
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.761
<v Speaker 1>I think you Ryan that,</v>

147
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:41.761
<v Speaker 1>but I think her marching forward is the perfect antidote to get murked by Rhonda</v>

148
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.611
<v Speaker 1>cause she's like,</v>

149
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>oh come get some of this judo though.</v>

150
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm an arm bar your ass if she marches forward,</v>

151
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>which is really all she knows how to do.</v>

152
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.803
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

153
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.891
<v Speaker 1>It could be interesting.</v>

154
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a great fight either way,</v>

155
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's also interesting to see what we're round his head is now she's coming</v>

156
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:55.451
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

157
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the x factor because if it's wrong 100% she beats her.</v>

158
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I think nine out of 10 times wrong words it,</v>

159
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I know but if it's Rhonda who's kind of our want to do movies,</v>

160
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:03.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't do this,</v>

161
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I this isn't for me.</v>

162
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.943
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get marked.</v>

163
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Cause that girl hit so hard.</v>

164
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Well what Rhonda has and what you want to has,</v>

165
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and not a whole lot of other women have it is one thing that they do where</v>

167
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>they're really fucking good at it and then they have all those other stuff.</v>

168
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

169
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like Paige vanzant has kind of learning the whole sport and she's</v>

170
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 1>learning as she goes.</v>

171
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

172
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

173
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

174
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

175
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>what she does,</v>

176
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>what Paige has is just toughness and she's hot.</v>

177
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll just take your sleep.</v>

178
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.861
<v Speaker 1>That helps.</v>

179
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Definitely helps.</v>

180
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>But there's not other girls,</v>

181
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you know other than Valentina Valentina Shift Chanko yeah.</v>

182
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 1>She's another one is bad ass.</v>

183
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Who is another super powerful striker.</v>

184
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way she handled Holly Holm standing up.</v>

186
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I know man.</v>

187
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Handled her.</v>

189
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Just countered or at will that,</v>

190
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>that looping left hook,</v>

191
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>that check hook that just throws off the right side.</v>

192
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>She's another one but there's not,</v>

194
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>they need more of those,</v>

195
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:54.551
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

196
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

197
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>That's where Mackenzie dern fits.</v>

198
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.514
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

199
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Come and do work and she's gorgeous.</v>

200
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying if if college like,</v>

201
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

202
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't wish bad on anyone,</v>

203
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>but Ronda were to lose.</v>

204
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.930
<v Speaker 1>We thrown a party in Ireland.</v>

205
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only show in town now.</v>

206
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Gimme my fucking piece of the pot.</v>

207
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Well nobody has that sort of personality that he has.</v>

208
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>No one ever.</v>

209
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I think even he eclipses Ali.</v>

210
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I've seen clips is all of them.</v>

211
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

212
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.440
<v Speaker 1>he's bigger than Chael Sonnen for sure too.</v>

213
00:05:21.441 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>As far as like his ability to,</v>

214
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Talk Shit.</v>

216
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Not Big on all of them,</v>

217
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

218
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.043
<v Speaker 1>I think he is.</v>

219
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he's better than Ali.</v>

220
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Ali Ali stood for a different thing,</v>

221
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

223
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>his message is more important.</v>

224
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Your fight for equal rights,</v>

225
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but he's also fighting to stop the Vietnam War act like this.</v>

226
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>There's times he had several things could form that were bigger.</v>

227
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.653
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

228
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Connor is white privilege.</v>

229
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

230
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.293
<v Speaker 1>His nice suits.</v>

231
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.153
<v Speaker 1>Nice suits.</v>

232
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>If the government's not trying to send them over to fight in a war zone,</v>

233
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:48.681
<v Speaker 1>even a man,</v>

234
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>they're not stripping his belt for how long?</v>

235
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.603
<v Speaker 1>Three years old fight.</v>

236
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Three fucking years.</v>

237
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty prime.</v>

238
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.791
<v Speaker 1>It's prime.</v>

239
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like basically taking the belt from Conrad on the right.</v>

240
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.931
<v Speaker 1>Three years.</v>

241
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:56.764
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you soon.</v>

242
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
