<v Speaker 1>A lot of us right now,</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:09.381
<v Speaker 1>we're going into alternate dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>via technology and hanging out there,</v>

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>enjoying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the freedom,</v>

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the confines of being constantly in</v>

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>an infinitely located in whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical space your body happens to be</v>

6
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:29.151
<v Speaker 1>inhabiting to suddenly remove that</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight and how I can pop these things on</v>

7
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:34.581
<v Speaker 1>and instantly translocate to some art</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that some geniuses created.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

20
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to give up some pussy or</v>

21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I'm kicking you the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say it if you want into the</v>

22
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:13.591
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you could say whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

24
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You have a microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a microphone,</v>

25
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but you can talk to it if you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Weirdo,</v>

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long before you can talk to it,</v>

27
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>how long before it talks back to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look,</v>

29
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we got to figure out a way to either,</v>

30
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:36.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean I imagine that probably exists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rudimentary way for some kind of</v>

31
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>CGI style porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be able to like instantaneously</v>

32
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>communicate with live video porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need some kind of ai</v>

33
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think we probably have just</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet or we are probably on the pr,</v>

34
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will add.</v>

35
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>It's come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

36
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched x Mokena again on the plane</v>

37
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it for the second tire.</v>

38
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as good.</v>

39
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>The second time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie freaks me out,</v>

40
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

41
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Because the girl's so beautiful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so,</v>

42
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>she's so attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

43
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you know that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see as much as he knew that</v>

44
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>she was a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as he knew that he wasn't a</v>

45
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>robot as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as he knew that she was</v>

46
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in love with her and she was</v>

47
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed like she cared about him.</v>

48
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And when she was talking to him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

49
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>like when the lights went out and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera was down,</v>

50
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>

51
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>don't trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

52
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>this is like a real person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real person.</v>

53
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>She's thinking like a person.</v>

54
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And he's like completely locked into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that it's a person.</v>

56
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>He's hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a person.</v>

57
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

58
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>this whole distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and intelligence</v>

59
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>is the same as the distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality and reality.</v>

60
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just like another human attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in control of something.</v>

61
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>You want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to say,</v>

62
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if this is fucking reality</v>

63
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:53.634
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

64
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>this is virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't reality.</v>

65
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

66
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So realities compartmentalized into</v>

67
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>places where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something is created by a human,</v>

68
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not real reality.</v>

69
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Even though humans are reality reality's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

70
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence is intelligence because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is inhabiting something</v>

71
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that isn't the human vessel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to what we were talking</v>

72
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

73
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not in a fucking meat body</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's artificial intelligence.</v>

74
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>How is why intelligence is intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Rosa parks.</v>

75
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Rosa Park one is real.</v>

76
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That's 100% real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that when she,</v>

77
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>that's when she got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.560
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get that story wrong by</v>

79
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think like she sat in</v>

80
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>the front of the bus and then was asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move to the back of the boat.</v>

81
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else had done it before her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

82
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

83
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.593
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

84
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Anybody even the front of the bus part</v>
<v Speaker 1>is incorrect.</v>

85
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>What part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

86
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It's very mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My new thing,</v>

87
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like a history dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a white section in the front,</v>

88
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>African American and a book in the bag.</v>

89
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>At the time they called black or colored</v>
<v Speaker 1>section.</v>

90
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in the colored section.</v>

91
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was if the white</v>
<v Speaker 1>section filled up and a white person</v>

92
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>went back to the colored section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down,</v>

93
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you still had to stand up and give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>your seat.</v>

94
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And then she wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

96
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that was the start of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

97
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I did not know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a small,</v>

98
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:23.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>but everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

100
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't go to the back of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

101
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>well that's even grosser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

102
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

103
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Grocer just like literally just sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then just some guy just got</v>

104
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:33.911
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

105
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:38.400
<v Speaker 1>she's complying with your racist rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like not racist enough.</v>

106
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.950
<v Speaker 2>so then that's when she got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parks original seat.</v>

109
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were totally right.</v>

110
00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Am I correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

112
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen this picture is a</v>

113
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 2>diagram like the Kennedy assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the fucking magic bullet.</v>

114
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Rosa parks boarded the bus and sat in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>aisle seat in the designated colored</v>

115
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:03.020
<v Speaker 2>section.</v>
<v Speaker 2>College stops later.</v>

116
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:08.021
<v Speaker 2>The driver told parks and three other</v>
<v Speaker 2>blacks in her row to move to the back to</v>

117
00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:13.340
<v Speaker 2>make room for a white man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three blacks move to the back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>now that I'm learning something,</v>

122
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.190

<v Speaker 2>like they didn't even want him to have</v>

123
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 2>to sit next to exactly what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an empty seat.</v>

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

163
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 3>transcranial magnetic stimulation</v>
<v Speaker 3>covered by Blue Cross,</v>

167
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really,</v>

168
00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:09.880
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

169
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.820
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of my life I felt like I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

170
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like a,</v>

171
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing like a,</v>

172
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.380
<v Speaker 3>it almost felt like a metal weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bit of like five pound weight on</v>

173
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:25.030
<v Speaker 3>my upper left forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my left.</v>

174
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.540
<v Speaker 3>And then so I went to this whoa dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sound is like an Mri sound.</v>

175
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

176
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.931
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

177
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:37.540
<v Speaker 3>It's basically the same exact magnet as</v>
<v Speaker 3>an MRI.</v>

178
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 3>They do your hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

179
00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:41.530
<v Speaker 3>they put it on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty simple.</v>

180
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.470
<v Speaker 3>The first time they measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to get to the exact spot.</v>

181
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 3>There's another video where my finger is</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulsing that you'll enjoy.</v>

182
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 3>And what is it doing to you?</v>

183
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

184
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 3>it's basically magnetizing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrifying a,</v>

185
00:07:56.471 --> 00:08:00.670
<v Speaker 3>it's waking up basically dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

186
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.700
<v Speaker 3>synopsis according to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

187
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

188
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.390
<v Speaker 3>it's waking up dead synapses and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

189
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 3>waking up dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waking them up so they're dormant.</v>

190
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>

191
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even look into it.</v>

192
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 3>You like good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoot me out.</v>

193
00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:16.944
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

194
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Can I do quarter one and this one time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have kids,</v>

195
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.393
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

196
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit,</v>

197
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it's going to cost me.</v>

198
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had kids,</v>

199
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 3>you think you wouldn't do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I had kids I'd be like,</v>

200
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of more,</v>

201
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.930
<v Speaker 3>more cautious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

202
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

203
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm not like reckless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

204
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

205
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I do research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also vague anyway,</v>

206
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 3>the research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also like we think it does it most</v>

207
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.740
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know,</v>

208
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.160
<v Speaker 3>they think they know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't actually know.</v>

209
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one.</v>

210
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about how many people are</v>

211
00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 2>prescribed these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's not really a direct</v>

212
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how it impacts each</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece.</v>

213
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Each person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they'll tell you,</v>

214
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try this medication and if it</v>

215
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try another one.</v>

216
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this one work?</v>

217
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll cycle through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now how do you know if it's working</v>

218
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 2>for you or if you're having a good time</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life?</v>

219
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And so you're feeling better because</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you started a new relationship but</v>

220
00:09:17.021 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>a new job and it's going well and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

221
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.663
<v Speaker 2>everything seems pretty</v>

222
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on medications that made me</v>

223
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:25.530
<v Speaker 3>nauseous for a year and a half before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

224
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally thought I was nauseous</v>

225
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 3>because I was eating too many</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifesavers.</v>

226
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Not even fucking kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally,</v>

227
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta take it easy on these life</v>

228
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 3>savers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because every night I throw up on the</v>

229
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 3>way to the laugh factory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I realized like,</v>

230
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neil,</v>

231
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you're taking a pretty high dosage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zoloft,</v>

232
00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 3>or you might want to just take it down a</v>
<v Speaker 3>notch.</v>

233
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
