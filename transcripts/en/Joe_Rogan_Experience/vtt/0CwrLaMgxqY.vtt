00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think the ability to</v>

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 2>communicate and open debate is why we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced to the point we're at in the</v>

4
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The suppressing of that is almost always</v>

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 2>someone who has a bad idea and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to shelter.</v>

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 2>So when you see people that are chasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>after someone because they're trying to</v>

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 2>communicate about something like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just doing it super d respectfully,</v>

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when when you see that what you have is</v>

9
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend a bad idea and defend it with</v>

10
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.161
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

12
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if the more you kind of become a</v>

13
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 3>mirror image of whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're projecting,</v>

14
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 3>you reinforce them in their position as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well as from doing other stories about</v>

15
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 3>extreme religious beliefs like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Westboro Baptist church.</v>

16
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I know from people who I met who were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the church when I made my documentary</v>

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 3>and then subsequently left that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

18
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 3>what short circuits their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what allows them to see something bigger</v>

19
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 3>than what they're in is when you treat</v>
<v Speaker 3>them with kindness and instead of</v>

20
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 3>shouting back at them or hurling abuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

21
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 3>which just reinforces their view of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an enemy of God or suppressive or</v>

22
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 3>however they characterize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you actually behave decently and</v>

23
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 3>attempt to robustly present your</v>
<v Speaker 3>position but in a respectful way and</v>

24
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 3>with a kind of coming from a place of</v>
<v Speaker 3>caring and empathy as opposed to,</v>

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so since soria so hostile attitude that</v>

26
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

27
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 3>it can be a much more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely knows what it's being humane.</v>

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I saw this pregnant woman on the l train</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York,</v>

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>but she was one season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those was she didn't,</v>

30
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>she just looked like her stomach was</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else affect like perfect makeup,</v>

32
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>just dressed nice in a nice dress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't have a wedding ring on.</v>

33
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to ask her if everything</v>

34
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she was with the dope,</v>

35
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>like she was so beautiful at cab looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

36
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I know she felt me looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably waited her out.</v>

37
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>She was so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started picturing myself arguing with</v>

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just accidentally put my face in your</v>

74
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:38.631
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>who's baby is that in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he in the baby's life.</v>

76
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you put your long life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

77
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm financially stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not quite a Mosley,</v>

78
00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on that note,</v>

79
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast is a wrap.</v>

80
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Yet I've got family members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not my family of my wife or</v>

82
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the family that I was born into that</v>

83
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:06.210
<v Speaker 1>have never apologized about anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they come from a cultural</v>

84
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 1>landscape where to apologize to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

85
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>to somebody younger is to lose face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A parent is always right.</v>

86
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.131
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

87
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:18.180
<v Speaker 1>that might work when you're too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're both now adults,</v>

88
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you could sort of have to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that and realize that we all make</v>

89
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and we all have to own up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

90
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.080
<v Speaker 1>We all have to apologize honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we make a mistake.</v>

91
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And yet some people it's super unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's unhealthy for the person who</v>

92
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>doesn't admit they make the mistake too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then it puts you in this</v>

93
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>position of being in denial of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know to be the truth,</v>

94
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to run around pretending</v>

95
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>that you were right all along when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know in your head that you weren't</v>

96
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it diminishes your own personal</v>

97
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 1>opinions about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

98
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry you're not sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready on,</v>

99
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.220
<v Speaker 1>on this exact point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 1>So I'm having a chat with a family</v>
<v Speaker 1>member,</v>

101
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 1>an older family member of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my family as the problem person.</v>

102
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.540
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the key problem for</v>

103
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>people in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

104
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something to the effect of,</v>

105
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>those ancient Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.940
<v Speaker 1>those Christians were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.130
<v Speaker 1>antisemetic where I come up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact details.</v>

109
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.911
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

110
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:09.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.051
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

112
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to correct you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

113
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ancient Greeks were not Christian.</v>

114
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we mark that,</v>

115
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>as we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bce,</v>

116
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:21.270
<v Speaker 1>before common era or BC before Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by definition,</v>

117
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 1>those guys were marked as not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>

118
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So when he's now faced with sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical evidence that suggests that</v>

119
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>he was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think?</v>

120
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>He does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so grotesque that I'm not even sure</v>

121
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:36.650
<v Speaker 1>you can guess what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to guess.</v>

122
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.430
<v Speaker 1>So he basically says no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

123
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that they weren't Christian.</v>

124
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:44.010
<v Speaker 1>You said that they were Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he looks at you in the face.</v>

125
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:44.821
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called,</v>

126
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:46.740
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd allow me saying on air,</v>

127
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 1>that's mind fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.790
<v Speaker 1>He looks at you in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows that,</v>

129
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has enough in Arabic.</v>

130
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>You say what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

131
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this kind of pathological pride.</v>

132
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

133
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to look at you.</v>

134
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So rather than saying,</v>

135
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh gee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

136
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for correcting me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He flips what our original points of</v>

137
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 3>this agreements was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

138
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 3>You can talk to that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to cut that guy loose.</v>

139
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I have,</v>

140
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.273
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you have,</v>

141
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I like how you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Long story short for listeners,</v>

142
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe was kind enough to,</v>

143
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I was interviewing Sam Harris for my</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast and Sam was like,</v>

144
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 3>we really should just do more than just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one on one because ordinarily my</v>

145
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 3>podcast is about as a panel of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people sitting around and</v>

146
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 3>talking about the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I texted Joe and I was like,</v>

147
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 3>is there any chance of doing it at your</v>
<v Speaker 3>studio?</v>

148
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 3>And being the gentleman that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

149
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just come on by and we'll just type it,</v>

150
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 3>even though he had to show his</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>

151
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 3>So after those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late at night,</v>

152
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:48.551
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris comes over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Hannibal buress is still here.</v>

153
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 3>So send me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about to call an uber and I said,</v>

154
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 3>why don't you stick around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

155
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 3>we were drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We drink so much whiskey.</v>

156
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 3>The best decision you ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inviting him to stay.</v>

157
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 3>So Hannibal buress and Sam Harris and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan and I have an interesting</v>

158
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 3>episode of my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will come up.</v>

159
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 3>So if you're listening to this now or</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching this now,</v>

160
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 3>subscribe to a way that people live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just switch for we the people space</v>

161
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need the live and then when it drops</v>

162
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will see it.</v>

163
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.820
<v Speaker 3>It was dining epic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our long argument between Hannibal Burr</v>

164
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 3>a drunk Hannibal burress and Sam Harris</v>
<v Speaker 3>regarding a statistics.</v>

165
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 3>We'll just leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

166
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to give him more</v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics that may or may not involve</v>

167
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter and police shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police shootings,</v>

168
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 3>and just the reality of police violence</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus the perceived reality of police</v>

169
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

170
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 3>So arguing about the statistics rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the emotional.</v>

171
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connection and the difference.</v>

172
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 3>And I mean what was interesting is how</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have conversations about things that</v>

173
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 3>are so touchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

174
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason why I want to talk to</v>

175
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Sam and you on my podcast is because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's important for us to find ways</v>

176
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.860
<v Speaker 3>to have the sorts of conversations that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have in that Sam has and that</v>

177
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 3>hopefully I have where there's not a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

178
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of opinionated bloviating it's more</v>

179
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 3>about actually trying to understand each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

180
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 3>actually trying to take each other at</v>
<v Speaker 3>face value,</v>

181
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>not sticking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>what a sword in the sand and saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

183
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that you offended me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>

184
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 3>having tripwires that if someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>transgressed as that or says a certain</v>

185
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.380
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden you're going to</v>

186
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 3>crank up the outrage machine.</v>

187
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 3>So much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much of that.</v>

188
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to talk to Sam and knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what,</v>

189
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 3>how do we have conversations that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are more reasonable.</v>

190
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 3>But of course</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't necessarily have a</v>

191
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:37.631
<v Speaker 3>conversation that reasonable when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk and emotionally sensitive.</v>

192
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 3>A drunk Hannibal burress and says that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's smarter than Sam Harris and smarter</v>

193
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 3>than I think anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he say anyone?</v>

194
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he debates that he was smarter than Sam</v>

195
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

196
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 3>Annabelle's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must be successful and he's,</v>

197
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 3>he's a compelling and good comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not smart enough to know that he</v>

198
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't say smart Sam Harris.</v>

199
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 3>He was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really drunk,</v>

200
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 3>and we kept drinking too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hit it.</v>

201
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hold it like,</v>

202
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bounced back quick.</v>

203
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

204
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 3>So I stopped drinking also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're implying exactly what I</v>

205
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard me and,</v>

206
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:14.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about an hour before the end of our</v>

207
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 3>potty of me and Hannibal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realize I was drunk.</v>

208
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 3>So I backed off and he didn't play out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was pouring himself.</v>

209
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How like half a half a wine glass of</v>

210
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.413
<v Speaker 3>whiskey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

211
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

212
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 3>it was deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went deep.</v>

213
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

214
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 3>he can't be held responsible folks.</v>

215
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.470
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
