1
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Wood.</v>

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could.</v>

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's been a wild year for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

5
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Michael was a former,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.823
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you never really a former marine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a marine,</v>

9
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>you stay marine.</v>

10
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't quite buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

11
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 2>if I would have stayed maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

12
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.870
<v Speaker 2>for the Marines who agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 2>You were</v>

14
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>marine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former sergeant in the Baltimore</v>

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Police Department and he came on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast a while back and expose some</v>

16
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty eyeopening information about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole system sort of works in this</v>

17
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>sort of a kind of a closed loop in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Baltimore where the same</v>

18
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods are having the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crime in the same sort of scenarios</v>

19
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a really important podcasts</v>

20
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>for me and it was really important</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast for a lot of people that listen</v>

21
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:06.091
<v Speaker 1>to it because they got exposed to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner workings of police departments by</v>

22
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I was really happy how honest you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all of it.</v>

24
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>About the thrill of chasing people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:20.721
<v Speaker 1>all of all the cool stuff about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we scheduled this podcast quite a while</v>

26
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:26.151
<v Speaker 1>ago and it's kind of crazy that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in the weekend after these insane</v>

27
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>shootings in Orlando and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely not happy that that</v>

28
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm happy.</v>

29
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Is happy as I could be that your here</v>
<v Speaker 1>while this is all going down and we get</v>

30
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>to kind of talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these insane moments that happen.</v>

32
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>It seems like every few months or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new insane moment happens where</v>

33
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:56.881
<v Speaker 1>some person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually a man blows a fuse and winds up</v>

34
00:01:57.971 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>killing a ton of people.</v>

35
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

36
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 1>and I'm hoping maybe you'll have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>

37
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>What if anything could ever be done to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop something like this?</v>

38
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.993
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

39
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 2>this is where we get into the Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhodes a dirty liberal thing and we're</v>

40
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>going to start talking about gun control</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know what else we can</v>

41
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your only other option is to continue a</v>

42
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 2>cycle of more and more force upon one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

43
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 2>So what we know for sure without a doubt</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the path we're on,</v>

44
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>it is only a matter of time before this</v>
<v Speaker 2>record is broken.</v>

45
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're doing will result in that,</v>

46
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 2>but we have this anti-intellectualism in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America that just won't take that</v>

47
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.951
<v Speaker 2>evidence and apply it to what we know is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be the end result like it.</v>

48
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>We have countries that have done gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

49
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 2>they don't have mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have mass shootings literally on the</v>

50
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>daily in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't hear about them all.</v>

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>So when a mass shooting is generally</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized three or four more</v>

52
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>casually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

53
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>But this happens every day in the cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really.</v>

54
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear about it when it's a</v>

55
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 2>backyard barbecue shooting in the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>So that you can think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

57
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't categorize those</v>
<v Speaker 2>as mass shootings because think of mass</v>

58
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 2>shootings is someone going into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowded place and killing a bunch of</v>

59
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>civilians or innocent people I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

60
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Whereas they think of those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shootings in the hood as rival gangs,</v>

61
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>people competing over drug dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

62
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another point because you were</v>

63
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>running for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to be the head of police of</v>

64
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that still going on?</v>

65
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they certainly,</v>

66
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corruption went in and uh,</v>

67
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 2>so we can tell that story real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they did is they did a national</v>

68
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.170
<v Speaker 2>search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the laws in Chicago said that this</v>

69
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 2>appointed police board has to do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationwide search and then they give</v>

70
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 2>three names to the mayor.</v>

71
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 2>The mayor investigates those people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then chooses one.</v>

72
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>So I predicted they weren't going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

73
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:17.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm too far ahead still that no one's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really ready to take that bite yet,</v>

74
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's still something we could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about and they would have had the</v>

75
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured they would pick that,</v>

76
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I figured they'd pick a black guy</v>

77
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 2>who was educated and not from Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my prediction.</v>

78
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's who the police board did</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose.</v>

79
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:38.281
<v Speaker 2>They chose a guy from Atlanta who fit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bill to the t.</v>

80
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.380
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black guy that represents the police</v>

81
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 2>department but still totes their line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of a word that everybody</v>

82
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 2>knows and I'm just not saying it so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can all pick up on what I'm suggesting.</v>

83
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 2>You're saying uncle Tom and people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an uncle Tom,</v>

84
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>but he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you have an uncle and his name's</v>

85
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

86
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look for something that will visually</v>

87
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 2>seems satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see instructionally be exactly the</v>

88
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:12.181
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they chose that guy and the mayor</v>

89
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 2>still said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

90
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that guy I want you</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this guy that didn't even apply and</v>

91
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>that skews the commissioner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who is this guy that didn't imply he</v>

92
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 2>was a couple of ranks down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already in the agency.</v>

93
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 2>He is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that he has never seen</v>

94
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.320
<v Speaker 2>misconduct or corruption in the Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 2>Police Department and his entire 20 some</v>

95
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:38.321
<v Speaker 2>year career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is intimately tied into a cheating</v>

96
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a promotional test.</v>

97
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that you could solve</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

98
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:48.751
<v Speaker 2>So his friends like wife or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>got number one,</v>

99
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 2>the lieutenant's test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is extremely a qualifying.</v>

100
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.100
<v Speaker 2>So say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as the information comes</v>

101
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 2>down that he actually was the one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was developing the tests,</v>

102
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>had the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she gets this super high score</v>

103
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere is when everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

104
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen this before,</v>

105
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>we know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can solve it.</v>

106
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>You could retest them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

107
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>And see who does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at first of course not.</v>

108
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>So they're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they have any interest in exposing</v>

109
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm going to come in there and I'm</v>

110
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 2>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

111
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be transparent,</v>

112
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>So now when you say that you were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little too far ahead,</v>

114
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

115
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:34.421
<v Speaker 2>it seems the people of a city or of any</v>
<v Speaker 2>area have to be pushed hard enough to,</v>

116
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>to have that change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have to have that breaking</v>

117
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 2>point where they say that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do something different.</v>

118
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Because what I really push is for</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilian controlled policing.</v>

119
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I want you guys to tell me what what</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be done,</v>

120
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.640
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge drop in power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

121
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 2>That would require a mayor that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to give in to the people that</v>

122
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>have pushed hard enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

123
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to relinquish control of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>essential armed wing and I'm going to</v>

124
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>give it to the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's been done before.</v>

125
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In America.</v>

126
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who's going to be the city that takes</v>

127
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>that leap?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to come.</v>

128
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It has to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know it,</v>

129
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 2>so it's a matter of fact.</v>

130
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they've tried to do in some areas</v>

131
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:24.321
<v Speaker 1>like in New Jersey in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is force these people to integrate more</v>

132
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.390
<v Speaker 1>into the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them walk the beat,</v>

133
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.480
<v Speaker 1>which is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear about that anymore.</v>

134
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone's in a car and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving around this closed up vehicle.</v>

135
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Whereas before everybody was walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and you were sort of like,</v>

136
00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:39.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's officer Mike,</v>

137
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a part of the community and they</v>

138
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became normal to see these people,</v>

139
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.760
<v Speaker 1>they develop friendships with the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in their neighborhood that</v>

140
00:07:47.761 --> 00:07:49.950
<v Speaker 1>they were patrolling and it's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained.</v>

141
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 1>She hated them more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think having a bunch of people that</v>

142
00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrolling your streets with guns in a</v>

143
00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>car just driving around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly ever getting out and</v>

144
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.640
<v Speaker 2>they're arresting somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a little odd,</v>

145
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

146
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:11.111
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see that the foot patrol is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the solution to that because what they</v>

147
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>do is they put a facade on it so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it look like foot patrol,</v>

148
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but it still has his essential</v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings of,</v>

149
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 2>of being motivated to go and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrests and to get the stats.</v>

150
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Speaker 2>So I did four patrol for like six months</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it was.</v>

151
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 2>It was just being thrown into get drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrests.</v>

152
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anybody or meet anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was still those same pushing to get</v>

153
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in a,</v>

154
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 2>in a prison cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the paperwork,</v>

155
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 2>go back out and do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we really need is to change the</v>

156
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 2>incentives and disincentives so that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what the role,</v>

157
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 2>we're still going towards that objective</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually serves you.</v>

158
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.913
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

159
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I had Dave Smith and the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

160
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dave Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a hilarious standup comedian and</v>

161
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>he's also a on this podcast called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legion of skanks and he's a libertarian,</v>

162
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

163
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>he was bringing up a point about New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York after the shootings in New York</v>

164
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.910
<v Speaker 1>where a bunch of cops had gotten shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

165
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this sort of a cool off period</v>

166
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.851
<v Speaker 1>where they had just stopped arresting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for Bullshit and the bullshit</v>

167
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>arrests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like loose cigarettes,</v>

168
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines just dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>

169
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And people were really excited about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

170
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.651
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

171
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.070
<v Speaker 1>this is like a good step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

172
00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>this is really how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police shouldn't be glorified</v>

173
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:38.361
<v Speaker 1>revenue collectors just arresting people</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the taxes last on loose cigarettes.</v>

174
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's what killed Eric Gardner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

175
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's disgusting.</v>

177
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not policing because not hurting</v>

178
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Policing should be protecting and</v>

179
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>serving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

180
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad that you brought up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>instance in New York,</v>

181
00:09:55.011 --> 00:10:00.011
<v Speaker 2>so what that is is direct evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>against what the head of the FBI has</v>

182
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.770
<v Speaker 2>said Komi who's coming in these pushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ferguson effect,</v>

183
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea around there saying,</v>

184
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:07.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have crime going up in these</v>

185
00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 2>different neighborhoods because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ferguson effect that the cops are</v>

186
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:14.240
<v Speaker 2>laying back so they're not being as</v>
<v Speaker 2>proactive and because they're not being</v>

187
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:16.700
<v Speaker 2>as proactive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're not locking people up.</v>

188
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:19.760
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stats are going up and we know that</v>

189
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:24.380
<v Speaker 2>if you have a theory and there's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation that says your theories</v>

190
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.990
<v Speaker 2>complete crap when your theory theories</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete crap,</v>

191
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.300
<v Speaker 2>and that's what New York was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So New York,</v>

192
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.180
<v Speaker 2>they step back and they want it to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

193
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:33.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how much you need us.</v>

194
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 2>And didn't show that the stats showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower crime.</v>

195
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.990
<v Speaker 2>They had less calls for service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was happier with what was</v>

196
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:46.991
<v Speaker 2>going on because that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to say that policing should</v>

197
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:50.990
<v Speaker 2>prevent things and it's just not</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

198
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Police are there to clean things up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to investigate after the fact.</v>

199
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Every arrest should be viewed as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>failure of the system.</v>

200
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.870
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't praise and arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is when we failed.</v>

201
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.570
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

202
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

203
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.130
<v Speaker 1>another way to look at it that's maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>more a more common ground is your</v>

204
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're.</v>

205
00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:14.300
<v Speaker 1>When you're around them all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

206
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:15.590
<v Speaker 1>what's going on over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boys?</v>

207
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.390
<v Speaker 1>You know like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking with them.</v>

208
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:21.010
<v Speaker 1>You create intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intention creates arguments.</v>

209
00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It creates crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates resentment.</v>

210
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It creates anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things contribute to crime 100</v>

211
00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:30.350
<v Speaker 1>percent and when you fuck with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>over loose cigarettes or any sort of</v>

212
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:32.330
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>petty crime that nobody gives a shit</v>

213
00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of stuff isn't.</v>

214
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the relationship that</v>

215
00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:40.400
<v Speaker 1>police have with citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the perception of the</v>

216
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:43.190
<v Speaker 1>citizens of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way they view the police.</v>

217
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You make some view the police as these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these thugs</v>

218
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 2>which citizens though a significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount and the citizens in this country</v>

219
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:53.900
<v Speaker 2>very much like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that police do that well did</v>

220
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't live there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

221
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 2>But if they were poor and they lived in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those communities,</v>

222
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't feel like you always do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

223
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>You hit on these big issues because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>

224
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 2>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is obvious.</v>

225
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:10.231
<v Speaker 2>It's right in front of our face and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing is they are funded and you</v>

226
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have a mayor in Baltimore,</v>

227
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 2>the mayor directs the police</v>
<v Speaker 2>department's a way,</v>

228
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 2>no matter what city you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that person is doing is they're</v>

229
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 2>serving those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those rich people,</v>

230
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.170
<v Speaker 2>they're serving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

231
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.220
<v Speaker 2>the mass voters of the area who just had</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mentality still that they want</v>

232
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 2>those animals caged in sentiment and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep them there.</v>

233
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 2>So as long as it doesn't affect us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then who cares?</v>

234
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what you're hitting on</v>

235
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.580
<v Speaker 2>there is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that more of this country</v>

236
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want our police to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they are happy about it.</v>

237
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're misinformed and I</v>

238
00:12:55.711 --> 00:13:00.711
<v Speaker 1>think they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incorrect understanding of how that</v>

239
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:05.370
<v Speaker 1>affects the people that these cops are</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with and that that it</v>

240
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 1>actually does probably create more crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on top of that,</v>

241
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people that are in those poor</v>

242
00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:18.090
<v Speaker 1>communities could just as easily be Uri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were born into those situations</v>

243
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and we were talking about giving people</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity to get out,</v>

244
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.510
<v Speaker 1>given people a possibility to get out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do better and improve their</v>

245
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:29.130
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their standing in life,</v>

246
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're getting fucked with all the</v>

247
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:32.460
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen.</v>

248
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:37.230
<v Speaker 1>If they're in a terrible poverty laden</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime laden community,</v>

249
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.960
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck getting out of that.</v>

250
00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:44.961
<v Speaker 1>It becomes almost insurmountable and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's real convenient for people to</v>

251
00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.120
<v Speaker 1>be outside of that and and look at those</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks and go,</v>

252
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:49.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people need to stop doing crime.</v>

253
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.450
<v Speaker 1>What you need to do is just lock them</v>
<v Speaker 1>all up.</v>

254
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem to make sense.</v>

255
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:59.121
<v Speaker 1>It seems much more likely that the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to handle that is to lock them up</v>

256
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:04.431
<v Speaker 1>less and to sort of somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to calm that area down and I don't</v>

257
00:14:05.491 --> 00:14:07.220
<v Speaker 1>know how you would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

258
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.020
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through some universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic income idea,</v>

259
00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 1>which I've been paying a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to that lately and trying to</v>

260
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.010
<v Speaker 1>explore those ideas and see if I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>read my own,</v>

261
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 2>call me a socialist and you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about minimum.</v>

262
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

263
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>It was an idea that Eddie Huang brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the podcast and I initially</v>

264
00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>laughed at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

265
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to fucking go for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started reading some articles</v>

266
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:32.670
<v Speaker 1>on it and I started thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and financially the issue is where's</v>

267
00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.610
<v Speaker 1>that money come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're obviously gonna.</v>

268
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a shit ton of money that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to somehow or another come out of</v>

269
00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:40.200
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not A.</v>

270
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a financial person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the economy.</v>

271
00:14:44.881 --> 00:14:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an economist so I'm not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person to do the numbers,</v>

272
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 1>but when I think about it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively</v>

273
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.550
<v Speaker 4>as far as from a social stance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people have less problems,</v>

274
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 4>when bills are paid easier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're more relaxed as far as like</v>

275
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:04.620
<v Speaker 4>where food's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you know,</v>

276
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 4>what basic needs are covered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're less likely to commit crime.</v>

277
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.720
<v Speaker 4>So it just makes sense that you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to spend less money on law</v>

278
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 4>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less money on prisons,</v>

279
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:19.400
<v Speaker 4>less money on jails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that perhaps that could translate.</v>

280
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 4>There was a great article written by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see if you could find A.</v>

281
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Jamie's is some prominent libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 4>who wrote this piece about universal</v>

282
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:32.381
<v Speaker 4>basic income is the idea is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving people $13,000 a year that if you</v>

283
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 4>give Americans through essentially a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand bucks plus a month and that if</v>

284
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 4>you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would take care of a shitload of</v>

285
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 4>problems that we have in inner cities</v>
<v Speaker 4>and crime and all this.</v>

286
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.400
<v Speaker 4>And he a sort of outlined it and made a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

287
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 4>a pretty interesting case for this idea.</v>

288
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course you've got a lot of people</v>

289
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.720
<v Speaker 4>that want to go on and on about welfare</v>
<v Speaker 4>babies and,</v>

290
00:15:57.721 --> 00:16:00.320
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people that are juking the system</v>

291
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:03.070
<v Speaker 4>and buying cigarettes with food stamps</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

292
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like this callous sort of</v>

293
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 4>approach to dealing with really poor</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in really bad neighborhoods.</v>

294
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that you brought</v>
<v Speaker 4>up about Baltimore that made it so</v>

295
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:19.391
<v Speaker 4>disturbing was that black people had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy houses in these areas.</v>

296
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 4>They would not sell houses in certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas to black people.</v>

297
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.020
<v Speaker 4>And that this was like a law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was actually written.</v>

298
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Dennis was not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like everybody conspired.</v>

299
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 4>This was something that they actively</v>
<v Speaker 4>set out to do.</v>

300
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.741
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

301
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 4>this idea of caging them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping them in,</v>

302
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

303
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 4>they literally did that through</v>
<v Speaker 4>paperwork.</v>

304
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>

305
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.870
<v Speaker 4>so things that you're talking about and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that sociologists that has that</v>

306
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:45.704
<v Speaker 4>study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

307
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 4>we know these things.</v>

308
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.060
<v Speaker 4>So what you're observing is things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scholarly community has known for a</v>

309
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 4>long time and is trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get these things out there so that</v>

310
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 4>people understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a matter of how much is</v>

311
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:05.180
<v Speaker 4>this going to cost because we're already</v>
<v Speaker 4>spending the money that we're spending a</v>

312
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 4>lot more this book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I brought it with me because</v>

313
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 4>I just finished going through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just put out.</v>

314
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 4>So this is by a Johns Hopkins researcher</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Stefanie Deluca who's a friend of</v>

315
00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:15.741
<v Speaker 4>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

316
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 4>so everybody knows that I am saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>

317
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 4>they did a study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they followed Baltimore youth around for</v>

318
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 4>well over a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like 15,</v>

319
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 4>16 years and their path that they go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through and part of that was it costs</v>

320
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 4>$27,</v>
<v Speaker 4>billion dollars to America every single</v>

321
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.890
<v Speaker 4>year for disconnected youth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's just youth that don't have a</v>

322
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 4>drive and don't have a focus or how is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

323
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:44.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>money?</v>

324
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 4>How does it trickle down so they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>chase things,</v>

325
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you get stuck in this,</v>

326
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea</v>

327
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.520
<v Speaker 2>that you can't escape this neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have so many blockades in the</v>

328
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are stories that go through.</v>

329
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 2>They track like a hundred and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

330
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 2>parents having kids in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods.</v>

331
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Speaker 2>And moving them out and what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and the two biggest pushers for the</v>

332
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:11.601
<v Speaker 2>success of these have any kid in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities was that they had an identity</v>

333
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they're finding their</v>

334
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 2>passion and what they're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards because they don't know these</v>

335
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 2>passions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know that a photographer like</v>

336
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Devin Allen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who a friend of mine in Baltimore can,</v>

337
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 2>can come out and do things for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>community and can actually achieve that</v>

338
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once they see it and it's possible</v>

339
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 2>and you start taking the hurdles down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hurdles of where they live and</v>

340
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:40.690
<v Speaker 2>the hurdles of the arrest for the bag of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed or for,</v>

341
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.573
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

342
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.630
<v Speaker 2>the talking yourself into jail because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cops messing with you every single</v>

343
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 2>day and you're saturated with police in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these neighborhoods.</v>

344
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 2>You start taking down these barriers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids excel and it goes completely</v>

345
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 2>against the narrative that we're hearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these kids don't have motivation</v>

346
00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 2>and they can't push out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighty percent of these kids that grow</v>

347
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 2>up in the city never touched the streets</v>
<v Speaker 2>or have anything to do with it.</v>

348
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 2>They're getting high school degrees at</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or 500 percent.</v>

349
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 2>The rate of their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that what we keep doing is we</v>

350
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:14.040
<v Speaker 2>keep getting them behind and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still fighting super hard,</v>

351
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 2>but we're still throwing more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurdles in their wet,</v>

352
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.390
<v Speaker 1>so the money that you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it costs for these disconnected</v>

353
00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:26.110
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all in prisons.</v>

354
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 2>This isn't even phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>

355
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.230
<v Speaker 2>This is just the lack of their product</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity from achieving what they</v>

356
00:19:32.231 --> 00:19:37.231
<v Speaker 2>can achieve and what it's costing us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>then take care of of what the fallout is</v>

357
00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:39.230
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

358
00:19:39.231 --> 00:19:43.090
<v Speaker 2>that just that microcosm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not throwing in locking up</v>

359
00:19:43.091 --> 00:19:44.980
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not throwing in the parents.</v>

360
00:19:44.981 --> 00:19:46.420
<v Speaker 2>We're not throwing in all this other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

361
00:19:46.421 --> 00:19:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Just youth that don't have a passion.</v>

362
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the subjects that come up</v>

363
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.450
<v Speaker 1>over and over again on this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've always tried to figure out</v>

364
00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 1>what it is that keeps people from trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to socially engineer these,</v>

365
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.400
<v Speaker 1>these environments and make them better</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the people that live there.</v>

366
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Like we're always concentrating on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other countries.</v>

367
00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:13.561
<v Speaker 1>We're concentrating on helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and rebuilding Iraq and all</v>

368
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.870
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian efforts all over the world.</v>

369
00:20:16.871 --> 00:20:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about our own inner city?</v>

370
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're misguided,</v>

371
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.050
<v Speaker 2>so what we end up doing is we have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that we're rich and often white and</v>

372
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:32.201
<v Speaker 2>we're going to come in and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the handout or we're going to</v>

373
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.390
<v Speaker 2>give them what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to show them the right way</v>

374
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.920
<v Speaker 2>and that's not the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is to ask what they want and</v>

375
00:20:39.921 --> 00:20:43.370
<v Speaker 2>provide the structure and platform for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to take place.</v>

376
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 2>So when these smart people that haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>been there,</v>

377
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 2>they'll look at stats and they'll look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the paperwork and they'll say,</v>

378
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just need to move people out and</v>

379
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 2>relocate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we need to.</v>

380
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 2>The idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

381
00:20:56.561 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 2>well we'll put them in this big tower</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're have resources around them and</v>

382
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 2>everything will be fine and we're making</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure they have their own police</v>

383
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 2>department so everything will be will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

384
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 2>but then the police started locking</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody up and you just.</v>

385
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.960
<v Speaker 2>You get into that cycle again because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not giving the identity project</v>

386
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 2>even to adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults where you can say whether it's</v>

387
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 2>comedy or whether it's photography or no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what,</v>

388
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:24.280
<v Speaker 2>you have to have that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that vision because all they see is that</v>

389
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:29.140
<v Speaker 2>their future is in dealing or in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison cell and they keep being told</v>

390
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 2>that if they do the right things they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can move on,</v>

391
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:36.811
<v Speaker 2>but when they do the right things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes good intentions have put up</v>

392
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 2>the roadblocks that prevent them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

393
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.840
<v Speaker 2>So what but how do you.</v>

394
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.100
<v Speaker 5>You sort of engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for lack of a better term,</v>

395
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.270
<v Speaker 5>a whole society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you give them goals?</v>

396
00:21:50.271 --> 00:21:52.610
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you expose them to all these</v>

397
00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:53.430
<v Speaker 5>possibilities</v>

398
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.970
<v Speaker 2>and how do you set up pass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said the word expose.</v>

399
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.120
<v Speaker 2>They're isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

400
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you do that though?</v>

401
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:07.071
<v Speaker 2>I think social media is helping a ton so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can see and interact with people</v>

402
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.140
<v Speaker 2>that are different from them and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see,</v>

403
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.060
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid from New York,</v>

404
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.590
<v Speaker 2>he did get into this school and he has</v>
<v Speaker 2>this job now and now I can maybe go work</v>

405
00:22:16.591 --> 00:22:20.970
<v Speaker 2>for his company or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see these examples of success and</v>

406
00:22:20.971 --> 00:22:24.540
<v Speaker 2>then they start to pick them up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase them and that's what these stats</v>

407
00:22:24.541 --> 00:22:29.541
<v Speaker 2>and all this bookers showing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's staggering how much effort these</v>

408
00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:34.851
<v Speaker 2>kids are putting in to their goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that we're actually setting up</v>

409
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.210
<v Speaker 2>the prevention of it by doing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

410
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

411
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.060
<v Speaker 2>We charge a black kid in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

412
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you charge him.</v>

413
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 2>He commits a homicide because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending his sister from getting raped,</v>

414
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.170
<v Speaker 2>but when he gets a prison sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that that prison sentence just</v>

415
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:58.650
<v Speaker 2>slams him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it's a white kid from Sanford,</v>

416
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.220
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of this.</v>

417
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to push empathy all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

418
00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:06.840
<v Speaker 2>but there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that empathy angle,</v>

419
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's just kind of helping people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they want to get instead of</v>

420
00:23:10.951 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Speaker 2>pushing them where you think they should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

421
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>They'll find their own paths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we treat poor people like</v>

422
00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 2>they're children and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're poor people.</v>

423
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:24.260
<v Speaker 5>There's a dude who works at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>store who was a criminal defense</v>

424
00:23:24.261 --> 00:23:28.730
<v Speaker 5>attorney and he resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He stopped doing it because he got tired</v>

425
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.750
<v Speaker 5>of his.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he was bringing cases to trial.</v>

426
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.360
<v Speaker 5>If it was a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the white guy would get,</v>

427
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:35.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

428
00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:40.340
<v Speaker 5>six months for an identical crime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a young black guy would get 10 years and</v>

429
00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:42.020
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to.</v>

430
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.930
<v Speaker 5>Someone's got to tell me what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>is going on here,</v>

431
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 5>because all I'm looking at</v>

432
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 1>is systematic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at institutional racism.</v>

433
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just over and over and over</v>

434
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.030
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confronted by the same kind of</v>

435
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same age brackets,</v>

436
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 1>but completely different types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

437
00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 1>what's the mentality behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said everybody wanted to just</v>

439
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:04.880
<v Speaker 1>bury their head head in the sand and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it anymore.</v>

440
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It was so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

441
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 1>when the guy talks about he's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cigarettes and freaking out</v>

442
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.310
<v Speaker 1>because it was just a huge 10 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life and it was just too much.</v>

443
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:18.311
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of shit is almost</v>

444
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're living in that world and you are</v>

445
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 1>one of those people that gets sent down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the river for 10 years for something</v>

446
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a white Irish kid,</v>

447
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you would get six months or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much lesser sentence.</v>

448
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 1>That alone is got to be a gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurdle for someone living in these</v>

449
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.640
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is not saying that people</v>

450
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be punished for crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely should be punished for</v>

451
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:45.170
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for sure about that,</v>

452
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 1>they also should be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

453
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It should be our view for be our view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they should do about</v>

454
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:53.150
<v Speaker 1>murder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She punish them or just give him a hug?</v>

455
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.430
<v Speaker 2>It was certainly depend on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

456
00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.080
<v Speaker 2>but I can't help but keep coming back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental idea that our criminal</v>

457
00:25:01.081 --> 00:25:04.250
<v Speaker 2>justice system is based on punishment</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

458
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not a moral system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the death penalty.</v>

459
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:12.350
<v Speaker 2>We know that these things don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now now do they get rights taken</v>

460
00:25:12.991 --> 00:25:15.180
<v Speaker 2>away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I would like to see is,</v>

461
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 2>let's take for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that it costs so-and-so</v>

462
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.720
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars a year to house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody thinks 24,000 depends on where</v>

463
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:25.920
<v Speaker 2>you are though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a college degree from an online</v>

464
00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:29.100
<v Speaker 2>school that's accredited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we can all do easily right now</v>

465
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.490
<v Speaker 2>would cost way less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So put them in a,</v>

466
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:33.510
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a cell,</v>

467
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.540
<v Speaker 2>and you keep them around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you treat them like human beings.</v>

468
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You give them an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a goal where they can achieve something</v>

469
00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:42.510
<v Speaker 2>and they actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because right now we send them into a</v>

470
00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:44.790
<v Speaker 2>prison of punishment and what happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come out,</v>

471
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.200
<v Speaker 2>they're in a worse situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we've created a greater criminal</v>

472
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.670
<v Speaker 2>than we had before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our goal is supposed to be some kind</v>

473
00:25:53.671 --> 00:25:57.540
<v Speaker 2>of rehabilitation that this is a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>person when they leave than when they go</v>

474
00:25:57.541 --> 00:25:59.280
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have that in us.</v>

475
00:25:59.281 --> 00:26:01.020
<v Speaker 2>We want these fuckers to pay.</v>

476
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly for murder,</v>

477
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the families of someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they victimized,</v>

478
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.640
<v Speaker 1>they don't want this person to come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

479
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Not even all victims feel that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

480
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

481
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.920
<v Speaker 2>it's so there are plenty of murder</v>
<v Speaker 2>victims who,</v>

482
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.280
<v Speaker 2>who their parents have gone and asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>for leniency for,</v>

483
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.410
<v Speaker 2>for the person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ask the not give him the death</v>

484
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:22.290
<v Speaker 2>penalty because that's pretty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>rare that it is.</v>

485
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:23.161
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

486
00:26:23.161 --> 00:26:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Most people want revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to look beyond that because</v>

487
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when your sister gets in a fight and</v>

488
00:26:30.061 --> 00:26:32.310
<v Speaker 2>killed your neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's your friend or something like</v>

489
00:26:32.311 --> 00:26:34.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not asking for the death penalty.</v>

490
00:26:34.171 --> 00:26:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's close to you.</v>

491
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the others,</v>

492
00:26:37.501 --> 00:26:41.460
<v Speaker 2>we do that to others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't do that to the ones we know</v>

493
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats to society,</v>

494
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real</v>

495
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 5>issue with some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>White,</v>

496
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:46.411
<v Speaker 5>black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

497
00:26:46.411 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 5>Someone's associate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>associate pass some as a psycho.</v>

498
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 5>They're a threat to society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm the guy who killed all those</v>

499
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 5>people in the theater in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a psycho.</v>

500
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy needs to be locked up forever.</v>

501
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.733
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

502
00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

503
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 5>what do you do about a person like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

504
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 5>how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you take a person like that and</v>

505
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 5>you give them goals in prison?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you try to give them an education</v>

506
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.563
<v Speaker 5>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously,</v>

507
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could become,</v>

508
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.840
<v Speaker 2>not not him obviously saying he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental illness,</v>

509
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 2>but somebody else you could educate them</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they're there and they can</v>

510
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:18.810
<v Speaker 2>contribute to literature and contribute</v>
<v Speaker 2>to science.</v>

511
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 2>They can give back to some society in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>

512
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:25.010
<v Speaker 5>Is that financially feasible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much more money would it take to</v>

513
00:27:25.011 --> 00:27:28.160
<v Speaker 5>make prison a safer environment for</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are locked up?</v>

514
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean were the idea is that we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be protecting the rest of us</v>

515
00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:34.370
<v Speaker 5>from these people that have committed</v>
<v Speaker 5>these awful crimes,</v>

516
00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:36.020
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone's committed rape,</v>

517
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.360
<v Speaker 5>someone's committed murder or armed</v>
<v Speaker 5>robbery.</v>

518
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.830
<v Speaker 5>We separate them from us because we</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want them to victimize anymore</v>

519
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.010
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then goal number two is rehabilitation</v>

520
00:27:46.011 --> 00:27:48.980
<v Speaker 5>and that goal is overwhelmingly a</v>
<v Speaker 5>failure.</v>

521
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.650
<v Speaker 5>Overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the statistics,</v>

522
00:27:51.651 --> 00:27:53.390
<v Speaker 5>if we sit in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been attempted.</v>

523
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good point.</v>

524
00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:55.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll do our,</v>

525
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean Rick Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy that we've had on before,</v>

526
00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:01.100
<v Speaker 5>the real rick Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the rapper guy.</v>

527
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

528
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean he learned how to read and</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally figured out what was wrong</v>

529
00:28:06.771 --> 00:28:08.600
<v Speaker 5>with his case in prison.</v>

530
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them won't give them any access</v>

531
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 2>at some do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are wardens out there that are</v>

532
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:16.500
<v Speaker 2>progressive and are thinking of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

533
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.920
<v Speaker 5>So that shouldn't really be on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>warden.</v>

534
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 5>Honda should be some sort of a standard</v>
<v Speaker 5>nationwide,</v>

535
00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 5>what we should look at it as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a society,</v>

536
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 5>as a civilization and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

537
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

538
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.390
<v Speaker 5>what should we be trying to do to try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make these people better people?</v>

539
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you do that when you arrest them</v>

540
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we say now is when he goes and</v>

541
00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 2>shoots or when someone rapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not looking at it at that as that</v>

542
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

543
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 2>if you were running this business and an</v>
<v Speaker 2>asset,</v>

544
00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 2>a facet of your business failed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you would want to have an analysis</v>

545
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 2>and you would want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

546
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 2>let's do a regression and figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what went wrong and you would want to</v>

547
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:54.360
<v Speaker 2>fix that for the next time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't do that.</v>

548
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:55.500
<v Speaker 2>We just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

549
00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:58.620
<v Speaker 2>throw that one away and continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Path is normal.</v>

550
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:03.770
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be so focused when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrest somebody to figure out how we're</v>

551
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 2>going to throw them away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longest.</v>

552
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:09.300
<v Speaker 2>We should be figuring out why it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened so we can prevent it for the</v>

553
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 2>next person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't seem like we actually</v>

554
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>care about solving the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just keeping these wheels turning.</v>

555
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.320
<v Speaker 2>So if you commit murder than I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know why.</v>

556
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I want to know the scenarios that led</v>
<v Speaker 2>you up to that because the only way that</v>

557
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I can actually prevent that is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority report.</v>

558
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.890
<v Speaker 2>It's finding out what that hurdle was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That moment that you said,</v>

559
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finding ways to prevent that as much</v>

560
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 2>as possible or reduce it for other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

561
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:39.070
<v Speaker 5>Lot of it must have to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>developmental period that you go through</v>

562
00:29:39.071 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 5>when you're a young person and what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're exposed to as a small</v>

563
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that stuff becomes so deeply</v>

564
00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:51.031
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in a person's mind to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse that boy is so much harder than</v>

565
00:29:52.421 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 2>to try to race someone correctly the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

566
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 2>All that's in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about that is coming of age in</v>

567
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 2>the other America that they talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things where that's one of the</v>

568
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 2>predictors is how much exposure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence that these kids have had when</v>

569
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 2>they were going between the ages of zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10,</v>

570
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 2>and so when they got them out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>city and they gave him opportunities</v>

571
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 2>than they got exposed to less violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The really crazy thing in this study is</v>

572
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:22.000
<v Speaker 2>that we found out that the kids that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in this city that didn't get help,</v>

573
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 2>they also fought their way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually a higher rate.</v>

574
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.870
<v Speaker 2>So we did these nice things and we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tweak it,</v>

575
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but like are nice things that we did</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually didn't pan out in the same</v>

576
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 2>results as kids that were just fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their own.</v>

577
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

578
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:37.871
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild.</v>

579
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 2>So they had these housing voucher</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs where they would.</v>

580
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.710
<v Speaker 2>The idea was to take people out of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and put them into nicer</v>

581
00:30:44.711 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods where they would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to less things.</v>

582
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 2>They would have neighbors around that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that did things that was very beneficial</v>

583
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.270
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that happened,</v>

584
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 2>but about an equal percentage of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids went back,</v>

585
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 2>ended up being in the low income areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get involved in to the streets.</v>

586
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 2>And then the ones that fought themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>out on their own ended up at a higher,</v>

587
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 2>slightly higher percentage actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out and being exposed to less</v>

588
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 2>because of their own individual efforts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the control group trying to get out</v>

589
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:16.340
<v Speaker 2>of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while it says that the programs need</v>

590
00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 2>some tweaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it shows that it's counter narrative</v>

591
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.500
<v Speaker 2>that these kids aren't trying and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not succeeding to get out.</v>

592
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Like they are pushing super hard to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>something of themselves and our cultural</v>

593
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look at these kids are not doing</v>

594
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just turning to drugs and</v>

595
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:36.610
<v Speaker 2>they're just dealing and surprisingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

596
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It is a 12 percent of the kids raised in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore in this study ever spent and</v>

597
00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Speaker 2>these are in the worst neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's east and West Baltimore ever spent</v>

598
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 2>a moment on the streets doing any</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal activity.</v>

599
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Twelve percent staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have shocked.</v>

600
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel dumb because I did the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like Yo.</v>

601
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So they're exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

602
00:31:54.521 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fighting out like crazy and</v>

603
00:31:57.971 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Speaker 2>we're the ones stopping them from coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fruition.</v>

604
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Well not US society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're responsible,</v>

605
00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:06.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so what are we mean?</v>

606
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how much effort is actually</v>

607
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 2>being done to try to fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people are actually</v>

608
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money is actually being spent</v>

609
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 2>to try to fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's so many problems</v>

610
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>in the world that to concentrate on bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods or crime ridden</v>

611
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so low on the list of things.</v>

612
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:29.590
<v Speaker 2>The world's worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The polarized caps are melting.</v>

613
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Polar bears are drowning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.930
<v Speaker 2>there's so much shit we're worried about</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of that.</v>

615
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.590
<v Speaker 2>They're trying hard as hell to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it is though and was trying</v>

616
00:32:38.591 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Governments are in Baltimore</v>

617
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

618
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 2>this patent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing that I'm a professor from</v>

619
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Morgan state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Brown is really into this and</v>

620
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 2>tracks it all down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a white l,</v>

621
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 2>we call it the White Allen Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes down through the rich</v>

622
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and comes across to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other rich neighborhoods by the bay and</v>

623
00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 2>then there's the black butterfly which</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes off to the sides East and West</v>

624
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore and it looks like butterfly</v>
<v Speaker 2>wings dispersing out poverty and black</v>

625
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.850
<v Speaker 2>people in the city and what this is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single aspect that you're going to</v>

626
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:12.340
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where that.</v>

627
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Where the money goes for schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are the bus routes are?</v>

628
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Where the free buses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the white neighborhoods have a free</v>

629
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:22.160
<v Speaker 2>bus and the black neighborhoods have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay for their bus.</v>

630
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have all these things that no</v>

631
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:29.960
<v Speaker 2>matter what you think of this white out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this black butterfly come to</v>

632
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:33.170
<v Speaker 2>fruition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on where resources are allocated and</v>

633
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 2>what problems are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that possible that white people</v>

634
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:36.890
<v Speaker 2>don't have to pay for the bus and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people do.</v>

635
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.010
<v Speaker 2>That seems ridiculous when you want me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you that they,</v>

636
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.930
<v Speaker 2>it's the neighborhood because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>

637
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not serving the white people.</v>

638
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 2>They're serving those upper class</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

639
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.580
<v Speaker 4>But is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a tax issue?</v>

640
00:33:50.581 --> 00:33:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Is it a property tax issue where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>spent money for the buses?</v>

641
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.460
<v Speaker 4>All Baltimore city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all the money.</v>

642
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.500
<v Speaker 4>So how the fuck could they justify that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

643
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 4>they just do it and nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

644
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.040
<v Speaker 4>it's so people should follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's at be more dark on twitter.</v>

645
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.620
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lays this out in so many different</v>

646
00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:08.454
<v Speaker 4>avenues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

647
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.040
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be willfully ignorant to not</v>

648
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:13.890
<v Speaker 4>realize that this is going on at Bemer</v>
<v Speaker 4>doc.</v>

649
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

650
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:20.520
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now how much of it is dealing with a</v>

651
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 4>prison guard unions and police unions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are trying to keep business as</v>

652
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:29.820
<v Speaker 4>usual because that keeps people employed</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that's a significant portion and</v>

653
00:34:29.821 --> 00:34:33.420
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing that with the NRA and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing that with the police</v>

654
00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:36.960
<v Speaker 4>unions and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the correctional unions were and like</v>

655
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.010
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even them,</v>

656
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.040
<v Speaker 4>they don't have these bad intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they have is job preservation</v>

657
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.830
<v Speaker 2>comes back to those incentives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disincentives,</v>

658
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.740
<v Speaker 2>so they're fighting for their job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all they're thinking.</v>

659
00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:50.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want jobs,</v>

660
00:34:50.461 --> 00:34:53.730
<v Speaker 2>we want safer conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure that this is a big</v>

661
00:34:53.731 --> 00:34:55.980
<v Speaker 2>company that blows up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're gonna put their money towards</v>

662
00:34:55.981 --> 00:34:59.340
<v Speaker 2>politicians that support them and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the way it goes this way.</v>

663
00:34:59.341 --> 00:35:01.200
<v Speaker 2>It's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as we have money in politics,</v>

664
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.280
<v Speaker 2>you can't get away from that.</v>

665
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most transparent example that is</v>

666
00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:07.930
<v Speaker 4>marijuana that we've shown time and time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again with a million different</v>

667
00:35:07.931 --> 00:35:12.160
<v Speaker 4>studies that marijuana is not dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if it is dangerous.</v>

668
00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:17.161
<v Speaker 4>The danger that it poses is so minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so small that consenting adults</v>

669
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.750
<v Speaker 4>should be able to do whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want with it and yet prison guard</v>

670
00:35:22.751 --> 00:35:27.751
<v Speaker 4>unions and police unions still lobby to</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep the drug laws exactly the same way</v>

671
00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:30.520
<v Speaker 4>they are because that ensures that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna need a certain amount of</v>

672
00:35:30.521 --> 00:35:32.050
<v Speaker 4>guards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to need a certain amount of</v>

673
00:35:32.051 --> 00:35:34.630
<v Speaker 4>police officers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's counterintuitive.</v>

674
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:39.970
<v Speaker 4>It being that's dangerous for society</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that sets up this us versus them</v>

675
00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 4>mentality where it doesn't need to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're telling people there's a</v>

676
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 4>certain forbidden plant that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to use.</v>

677
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 4>We've decided this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to keep it this way even</v>

678
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 4>though it's completely illogical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though we know the history of it</v>

679
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to do it simply because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people want to keep their jobs instead</v>

680
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:04.641
<v Speaker 4>of trying to figure out what other jobs</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people can do like shouldn't there</v>

681
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 4>be a way you could take some of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are prison guards or police</v>

682
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:13.821
<v Speaker 4>officers and give them a job with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>commensurate income that's involved in</v>

683
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:15.300
<v Speaker 4>helping communities.</v>

684
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Something positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something setting up community programs.</v>

685
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many guys that are cops who</v>
<v Speaker 4>were also into martial arts or fitness</v>

686
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 4>or into something else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

687
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.310
<v Speaker 4>anything where they could teach people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these communities,</v>

688
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:34.311
<v Speaker 4>set up community centers and give people</v>
<v Speaker 4>high paying jobs to establish really</v>

689
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 4>good environments for development and</v>
<v Speaker 4>for growing and give people a chance to</v>

690
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 4>be exposed to maybe one of these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could be these paths that you were</v>

691
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

692
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I'm gonna have zero objections</v>

693
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 4>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that that's a great way of going</v>

694
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:53.391
<v Speaker 4>about it and cannabis is obviously the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shining example of complete illogic.</v>

695
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:57.540
<v Speaker 4>They just did a new study where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>tracked people for 30 years.</v>

696
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 4>You know what health problems they</v>
<v Speaker 4>found,</v>

697
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.390
<v Speaker 4>what ginger vidas bad breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just didn't brush her teeth.</v>

698
00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 4>The hippies didn't brush their soki</v>
<v Speaker 4>breath.</v>

699
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Hippies study people said they said the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing,</v>

700
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:13.800
<v Speaker 4>but that probably goes because segment</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the population.</v>

701
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't have anything to do with</v>

702
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 4>the cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

703
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Speaker 4>So we know without a doubt that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's the case.</v>

704
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.510
<v Speaker 4>But what we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so say you still want to do that and we</v>

705
00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 4>only have to change them that far to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get them away from the drug where</v>

706
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:28.980
<v Speaker 4>even though that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably the biggest chunk that's</v>

707
00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:32.430
<v Speaker 4>fucking everything up is the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if we spend that money,</v>

708
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 4>instead of incarcerating them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can spend the money in education.</v>

709
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 4>So for every million dollars that spent</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting the drug war on the supply</v>

710
00:37:41.191 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a 100 kilogram reduction of,</v>

711
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.080
<v Speaker 4>of supply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

712
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:47.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

713
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.160
<v Speaker 4>if you have the kilograms of cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming over the border,</v>

714
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 4>if you fight it with force,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fight the supply side,</v>

715
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.460
<v Speaker 4>then you get a 10 gram per kilogram</v>
<v Speaker 4>reduction.</v>

716
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 4>But if you spend that same million</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars on the demand side educating</v>

717
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:02.940
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a reduction of 100 kilograms.</v>

718
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we,</v>

719
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:05.790
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's this from?</v>

720
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody can look it up.</v>

721
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 4>It's really easy to find it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very logical and it makes sense</v>

722
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know that if you just educate</v>

723
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 4>people and tobacco is the shining</v>
<v Speaker 4>example of that is tobacco rates have</v>

724
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:23.110
<v Speaker 4>gone down like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's take the hair gardner</v>

725
00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 4>situation out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The large part of that has been because</v>

726
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:30.180
<v Speaker 4>of education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you educate people out of drugs,</v>

727
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:31.130
<v Speaker 4>educate people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

728
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.260
<v Speaker 4>like they say all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

729
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 4>if heroin is on Amazon right now to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>order it.</v>

730
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to</v>

731
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about Jamie and Tara when</v>

732
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 2>freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves it.</v>

733
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.830
<v Speaker 2>He gets a bunch of different styles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixes them up.</v>

734
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So it's prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That messes us up.</v>

735
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that.</v>

736
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:50.551
<v Speaker 2>And when you have prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not determining what happens to</v>

737
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:53.920
<v Speaker 2>the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you're doing is determining who is</v>

738
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 2>distributing the drugs because they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be distributed.</v>

739
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.880
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it the government and I e the people</v>

740
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 2>doing the distribution or is it the</v>
<v Speaker 2>black market,</v>

741
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 2>the gangs in the mafia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

742
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:08.050
<v Speaker 2>as long as it's under prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the black market and the gangs in</v>

743
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:08.884
<v Speaker 2>the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

744
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 2>we literally know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to discuss.</v>

745
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 2>And yet we continue with this anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual asm and denial at that.</v>

746
00:39:17.851 --> 00:39:21.160
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs throughout our society in</v>

747
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking about the guns,</v>

748
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with the same thing where</v>

749
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:29.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have evidence we can prove things</v>

750
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 2>empirically and we still continue to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite for for reasons I just</v>

751
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 2>can't get my mind wrapped around lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's were I feel like I'm fighting</v>

752
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:43.261
<v Speaker 2>denial and it's been like a year that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting this denial and talking on</v>

753
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:45.770
<v Speaker 2>radio shows constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yet,</v>

754
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple months ago we pull up the</v>

755
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Internet and the FBI director is pushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ferguson effect and it's just like</v>

756
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do we get past this?</v>

757
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're dealing with two</v>

758
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 1>completely different subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The gun control subject is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>different subject than trying to figure</v>

760
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 1>out how to elevate people in bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods.</v>

761
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.990
<v Speaker 1>The gun control subject is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

762
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the statistics of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many Americans have guns,</v>

763
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:17.530
<v Speaker 1>how many rounds of ammunition there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many armed people there are in this</v>

764
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:21.250
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at how many crimes</v>

765
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:23.140
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many gun shootings there are.</v>

766
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.630
<v Speaker 1>It's relatively small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small.</v>

767
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.820
<v Speaker 1>We're dealing with massive numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

768
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you.</v>

769
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.840
<v Speaker 2>There's $3 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

770
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.450
<v Speaker 1>There's $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million plus people in this country.</v>

771
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this blip on the map where every few</v>

772
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.960
<v Speaker 1>months someone goes fucking crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed a bunch of people.</v>

773
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.110
<v Speaker 1>If we really had a an armed problem in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

774
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the logic that the anti gun control</v>
<v Speaker 1>people use would be that you would see</v>

775
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:57.410
<v Speaker 1>way more shootings and you would see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them all the time.</v>

776
00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.590
<v Speaker 1>If we really had a gun control problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so many armed people.</v>

777
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.760
<v Speaker 1>If it was a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the issue would they try to say,</v>

778
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.540
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not picking the team here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they try to say is that what</v>

779
00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:11.120
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just massive numbers of people,</v>

780
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:16.270
<v Speaker 1>massive numbers of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number $300 million is so hard for</v>

781
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.930
<v Speaker 1>the average person like you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to wrap our head around what that</v>

782
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:25.580
<v Speaker 1>means in terms of the volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheer volume of people and how many</v>

783
00:41:25.581 --> 00:41:27.870
<v Speaker 1>guns are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has many guns,</v>

784
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.960
<v Speaker 1>more guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are people in this country</v>

785
00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:34.150
<v Speaker 1>which is even more insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the</v>

786
00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 4>the people that own these guns for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most part are law abiding citizens that</v>

787
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:41.510
<v Speaker 4>don't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why take away their rights?</v>

788
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.870
<v Speaker 4>Because some dude like this asshole in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Orlando goes fucking crazy and kills 50</v>

789
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 4>gay people exist that have a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>premises there and one of them was that</v>

790
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 4>they have a right to that weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

791
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Which I'm going to argue to the end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day that they don't.</v>

792
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second amendment is clear.</v>

793
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Well regulated militia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's literally clear.</v>

794
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 4>It says it in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well regulated militia and even if we go</v>

795
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:07.330
<v Speaker 4>to bear arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

796
00:42:07.331 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if we go past that,</v>

797
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:13.070
<v Speaker 4>forget that I'm not a big fan of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>constitution and leaning on it because</v>

798
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 4>the world is changed dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a whole new situation.</v>

799
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:18.500
<v Speaker 4>Rethink with the evidence that we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

800
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Let's not rely on the document that's on</v>
<v Speaker 4>parchment somewhere decaying,</v>

801
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

802
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 4>So written with a feather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why they made it amendable.</v>

803
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing is that they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>that right?</v>

804
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they have the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the second is that that number is</v>

805
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 4>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're trading in there is</v>

806
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 4>what are you getting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have an equation where they</v>

807
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 4>can have these guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are you benefiting and what are</v>

808
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 4>you losing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me what is the society we benefit</v>

809
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 4>from handguns and rifles?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

810
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 4>the people that have been able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>protect themselves against dangerous</v>

811
00:42:56.061 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 4>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that have been able to stop</v>

812
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:01.160
<v Speaker 4>people from breaking into their home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stealing their property,</v>

813
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 4>harming them physically or protecting</v>
<v Speaker 4>their level.</v>

814
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:08.861
<v Speaker 4>So when you talk about ratios,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's 30,000 hand gun crimes in</v>

815
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 4>America every year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

816
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The document it have shootings.</v>

817
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:17.060
<v Speaker 4>30,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought it was way more than that.</v>

818
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 4>So if we take the percentage of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that defended themselves,</v>

819
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:26.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've got five to 10 cases a</v>
<v Speaker 4>year like that doesn't actually occur,</v>

820
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 4>but what are they defending themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>against</v>

821
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.200
<v Speaker 4>those people with handguns and rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're in,</v>

822
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 4>you're trapped in this circular logic</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you need a gun because I have a</v>

823
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 4>gun and then eventually Jamie says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well those fuckers have a gun.</v>

824
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 4>I want to gun two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we know where that goes.</v>

825
00:43:45.921 --> 00:43:50.921
<v Speaker 4>We literally know it keeps getting more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more and more.</v>

826
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 4>Now if we have this perpetual society</v>
<v Speaker 4>where everyone has everything and</v>

827
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 4>everything's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's just not gonna happen,</v>

828
00:43:57.951 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have strife and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guns are concentrated in a few</v>

829
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 4>people's hands that have 200 guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

830
00:44:04.761 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 4>dudes that have 50 guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know dudes that 50 guts.</v>

831
00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I know due to so many guns.</v>

832
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 4>Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about you motherfucker.</v>

833
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.480
<v Speaker 4>My Buddy Justin has so many guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't know know how many guns do</v>

834
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 4>you have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have those instances of giant.</v>

835
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.030
<v Speaker 4>He's seven feet tall and he has 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking guns.</v>

836
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 4>So they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have them in a safe or they have</v>

837
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:27.020
<v Speaker 4>them out in rural America where they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even like interacting with people</v>

838
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 4>like to have the strife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

839
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:34.721
<v Speaker 4>he's a firearms enthusiastic and he is</v>
<v Speaker 4>also a guy with a squeaky clean criminal</v>

840
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the argument against him being</v>

841
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 4>able to be a firearms enthusiast and</v>
<v Speaker 4>possess all these guns because of what</v>

842
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:46.110
<v Speaker 4>it's done to our society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just wants to have something.</v>

843
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:48.950
<v Speaker 4>And I've talked to in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

844
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.310
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying it because he's my</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>

845
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 4>So anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

846
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 4>What are you gaining?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's an equation in one,</v>

847
00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 4>one side of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have 30,000 hand gun victims,</v>

848
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 4>we have a society that's gripped by</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear.</v>

849
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 4>We have dudes that can go get an ar 15</v>
<v Speaker 4>and days later,</v>

850
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 4>light up a nightclub and do a hate</v>
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>

851
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 4>We know that that's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we know that as the future</v>

852
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Speaker 4>progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that 103 casualties of this</v>

853
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:17.170
<v Speaker 4>shooting is going to be superseded by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger shooting that that's going to</v>

854
00:45:17.171 --> 00:45:19.560
<v Speaker 4>happen because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to break the records right?</v>

855
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to have more and more</v>

856
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 4>guns that keep coming in and keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>

857
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.070
<v Speaker 4>So that's when the right hand side of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the equation and on your left hand side</v>

858
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:27.810
<v Speaker 4>of the equation for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for having guns,</v>

859
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 4>the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I like them.</v>

860
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also the argument that a well</v>

861
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 4>armed society is a polite society and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there were people that had guns in</v>

862
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 4>that nightclub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would've been able to prevent that</v>

863
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 4>crime by taking that guy out.</v>

864
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 4>There were eight cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was the same thing in</v>

865
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if there were cops there,</v>

866
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.050
<v Speaker 4>but the cops are getting shot by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops get to a point where I wasn't</v>

867
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A hostage situation.</v>

868
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't know the details about</v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>

869
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:54.380
<v Speaker 4>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really problematic.</v>

870
00:45:54.381 --> 00:45:56.130
<v Speaker 4>We're true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cops wouldn't get killed,</v>

871
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have the biggest army.</v>

872
00:45:58.621 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 4>That's when our streets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if more guns we keep having more cops</v>

873
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 4>with more and bigger guns then it would</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>

874
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:05.154
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the cops,</v>

875
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:10.280
<v Speaker 4>the cops roll in armored vehicles with</v>
<v Speaker 4>ar fifteens to combat juveniles dominant</v>

876
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 4>mall during the uprising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So don't more cops shoot more criminals</v>

877
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 4>than criminal shoot cops don't more cops</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill more people that are trying to</v>

878
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:24.980
<v Speaker 4>commit crimes than those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

879
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 4>that is predicated upon the premise that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to shoot the cops and</v>

880
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:28.884
<v Speaker 4>they're absolutely not.</v>

881
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.040
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to get away some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

882
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 4>The ones that are actively trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot cops are super smart because you</v>

883
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:37.290
<v Speaker 4>got to read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying the cops are getting shot</v>

884
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:38.740
<v Speaker 4>when they do get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

885
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.571
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

886
00:46:39.571 --> 00:46:43.690
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't that sort of an argument that.</v>

887
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.071
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

888
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:45.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bet.</v>

889
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.840
<v Speaker 4>And there is one guy with a rifle that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he purchased legally and a bunch of cops</v>

890
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:52.980
<v Speaker 4>and a bunch of cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cops still get shot.</v>

891
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of those jobs.</v>

892
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of those guys that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>

893
00:46:58.321 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 4>this one guys like the remember the</v>
<v Speaker 4>north Hollywood shootout famous of</v>

894
00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:07.380
<v Speaker 4>course arm to the fucking gills and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing body armor and all that shit.</v>

895
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.510
<v Speaker 4>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cops were just so outgunned as far</v>

896
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 4>as fire power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

897
00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:13.400
<v Speaker 4>So our answers that they get more</v>
<v Speaker 4>firepower right now.</v>

898
00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 4>That's not saying that's the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep having.</v>

899
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.320
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the reasons why these</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops are getting shot.</v>

900
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:23.530
<v Speaker 4>They're getting shot and killed in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation in particular because they're</v>

901
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.270
<v Speaker 4>walking around with 38 revolver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine millimeter glock getting shot</v>

902
00:47:27.271 --> 00:47:30.480
<v Speaker 4>because that guy has armor and a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>air through and saying,</v>

903
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm saying is they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>adequately.</v>

904
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Armed with a handgun would be perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fine if we didn't have ar 15</v>

905
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 2>saturating our streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will that guy.</v>

906
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he had an ar 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had something like that.</v>

907
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.430
<v Speaker 2>It's all heavy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

908
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.293
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

909
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 2>so like which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same gun as an m 16 folks.</v>

910
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a military weapon.</v>

911
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 2>It's the same gun that was created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was created in the fifties to deal</v>

912
00:47:55.781 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 2>with the AK 47.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an HPO,</v>

913
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 2>a part series on real sports recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>that talked about it.</v>

914
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about Ar 15 in two to</v>
<v Speaker 2>three can do that damage.</v>

915
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a semiauto and we get caught up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the assault weapons and the assault</v>

916
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:13.630
<v Speaker 2>weapons are going to keep you having</v>
<v Speaker 2>better aim.</v>

917
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 2>They're going to keep you having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher magazine capacity.</v>

918
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Could be a little more reliable weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have a hunting rifle with a 10</v>

919
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 2>magazine clips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a two to three and it's a</v>

920
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:26.080
<v Speaker 2>semiautomatic is gonna do the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of damage that we're talking</v>

921
00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my position on gun control is</v>

922
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 2>extremely simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want your guns for these other</v>

923
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 2>things like say hunting bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>action rifles and shotguns.</v>

924
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you can that's on your,</v>

925
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:44.500
<v Speaker 2>on the pro gun side that they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve can all be accomplished by</v>

926
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 2>shotguns and bolt action rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

927
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that argument,</v>

928
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 2>but I also see the argument that hunters</v>
<v Speaker 2>would use in that situation that if you</v>

929
00:48:54.911 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 2>limit the amount of rounds that a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>can have in his gun or the ability to</v>

930
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 2>fire off round quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're limiting their ability to make a</v>

931
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 2>quick followup shot on an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would kill that animal.</v>

932
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have somebody that's that</v>

933
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 2>dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

934
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

935
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 2>So if you have somebody that we want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>establish this high standard,</v>

936
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.790
<v Speaker 2>so say say we have the super high</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard where this guy,</v>

937
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.820
<v Speaker 2>he can get his big gun that he uses in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his well trained on and he's gone</v>

938
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 2>through a super long process of</v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds and he's all checked out</v>

939
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 2>that I don't have any objection to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like say his gun gets stolen,</v>

940
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't get it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

941
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to maintain this high</v>

942
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 2>standard in order to have such extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>

943
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 2>And I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people that have c,</v>

944
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 2>four explosives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

945
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 2>there are people that can legally carry</v>
<v Speaker 2>det cord and c four to blow up</v>

946
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:50.840
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not a big problem to the rest of</v>

947
00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 2>the society using their debt court and</v>
<v Speaker 2>see for,</v>

948
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hurt people.</v>

949
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 2>So if that's a unique class of</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

950
00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

951
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So you think that should be more</v>
<v Speaker 2>stringent testing and background checks</v>

952
00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:06.800
<v Speaker 2>on people that are getting guns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

953
00:50:06.801 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Especially those kind of high powered</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones or handguns,</v>

954
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

955
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.170
<v Speaker 2>we get caught up a lot in the high power</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

956
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>they're capable of that mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>

957
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's the handguns that caused the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear in society every single day because</v>

958
00:50:19.531 --> 00:50:20.950
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to conceal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

959
00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:23.830
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole problem is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>concealment that you can just pop it out</v>

960
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know who has what and so</v>

961
00:50:26.171 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>everyone becomes a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have</v>

962
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 4>this small death device on you that</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody can do anything and it's just</v>

963
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:36.710
<v Speaker 4>like we gotta go back to that equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is on the other side of the</v>

964
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:41.711
<v Speaker 4>equation of 30,000 handguns and $300</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus a mass shootings per year.</v>

965
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 4>The other side of that equation is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that ridiculous idea.</v>

966
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can figure out something for me</v>

967
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:51.920
<v Speaker 4>other than I liked collecting guns and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think they're cool and it's my right</v>

968
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'm willing to hear it.</v>

969
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.690
<v Speaker 4>I just don't hear an argument beyond</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

970
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:59.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only argument is that a person who</v>

971
00:50:59.931 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 4>is not a criminal and a person who</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have any ill will in their</v>

972
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:08.120
<v Speaker 4>hearts and just enjoys firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be able to have them just like</v>

973
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to have a truck that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just drive through a fucking</v>

974
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.810
<v Speaker 4>crowd of people with if you want it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>

975
00:51:13.811 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 4>but so the argument there that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the truck and the truck is capable</v>

976
00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:21.050
<v Speaker 4>of of harm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so just like a knife,</v>

977
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.870
<v Speaker 4>but a knife has a drilling and other</v>
<v Speaker 4>uses.</v>

978
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.110
<v Speaker 4>So on that other side of that equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you can say,</v>

979
00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:28.460
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we need a knife for?</v>

980
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to chop up food.</v>

981
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:35.111
<v Speaker 4>It's to skin a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to do a thousand other things that</v>

982
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.800
<v Speaker 4>the ar or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's for one purpose and one purpose</v>

983
00:51:39.801 --> 00:51:42.650
<v Speaker 4>only and that's to kill a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

984
00:51:42.651 --> 00:51:45.230
<v Speaker 4>that was what it was designed for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people use them for hunting.</v>

985
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 4>They have a better rifle to used in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>for hunting.</v>

986
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing about hunting with those is</v>

987
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 4>that you can pull the trigger many times</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for hog hunting and things like</v>

988
00:51:54.651 --> 00:51:56.300
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of people actually</v>

989
00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:57.170
<v Speaker 4>prefer them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

990
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you even want to do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

991
00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:02.780
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about that higher class</v>
<v Speaker 4>person and so higher-class hog hunter.</v>

992
00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.663
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher class.</v>

993
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that's not an actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>effect.</v>

994
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:08.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you want to go shoot it and you want</v>

995
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 4>to shoot those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those animals,</v>

996
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:14.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go check it out from your parks and rec</v>

997
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.760
<v Speaker 4>and go use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Check out.</v>

998
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check it out.</v>

999
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 4>You said you just want to use it right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what do you mean?</v>

1000
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.710
<v Speaker 4>But check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1001
00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:26.711
<v Speaker 4>So say you could start at an armory</v>
<v Speaker 4>armory that who runs the government to</v>

1002
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1003
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.820
<v Speaker 4>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be the private,</v>

1004
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:30.640
<v Speaker 4>the private rifle range.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1005
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.750
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's how it is in a lot of places</v>

1006
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 4>in Europe when you know how to do this</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1007
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.310
<v Speaker 4>We literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other countries have done this.</v>

1008
00:52:37.311 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Australia is the shining example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had one mass shooting said,</v>

1009
00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:42.050
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I have none sense.</v>

1010
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can get a rifle in Australia.</v>

1011
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that gets bandied</v>

1012
00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:50.120
<v Speaker 4>about many times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I actually had to do some research.</v>

1013
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not impossible to get rifles for</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting in Australia.</v>

1014
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:55.790
<v Speaker 4>You could super hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult,</v>

1015
00:52:56.490 --> 00:53:01.490
<v Speaker 4>but Australia also has less people than</v>
<v Speaker 4>California and an enormous chunk of land</v>

1016
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:04.670
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we have other countries take China.</v>

1017
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.570
<v Speaker 4>China's four times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our population doesn't.</v>

1018
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even hit the radar screen</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the amount of people they have</v>

1019
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Speaker 4>imprisoned or the amount of violence</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have.</v>

1020
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.500
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But China is.</v>

1021
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Well was until really recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a communist dictatorship that was</v>

1022
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.900
<v Speaker 4>run with an iron fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1023
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 4>think about Tiananmen and what happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people rebel against the government</v>

1024
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.120
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's two completely different sort of</v>

1025
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

1026
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.340
<v Speaker 4>Is it different than what happens here</v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

1027
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.240
<v Speaker 4>Really though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you stand up against the</v>

1028
00:53:35.241 --> 00:53:37.830
<v Speaker 4>government was going to happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just standing up against the</v>

1029
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:38.730
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>

1030
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.210
<v Speaker 4>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have much power over there</v>

1031
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.433
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1032
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 4>We live in an oligarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we've proven that.</v>

1033
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing we've proven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so princeton did a study where they</v>

1034
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:54.111
<v Speaker 4>tracked 19,000 cases of laws that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on and going through congress,</v>

1035
00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 4>so what they found out is that public</v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion on whether a law gets passed or</v>

1036
00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For instance,</v>

1037
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:04.170
<v Speaker 4>gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which over 80 percent of NRA members</v>

1038
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 4>agree with increased gun control and</v>
<v Speaker 4>background checks and things like that.</v>

1039
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:13.340
<v Speaker 4>We don't get it passed congress at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have any bearing on public</v>

1040
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have any bearing on whether a</v>

1041
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:18.750
<v Speaker 4>law gets passed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have donors that care about a</v>

1042
00:54:18.751 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 4>law getting passed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's going to get past.</v>

1043
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 4>And even when public sentiment is</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely against the law being passed.</v>

1044
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 4>If the public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the donors want the law passed,</v>

1045
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.730
<v Speaker 4>they still have a 30 percent chance of</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting the law passed.</v>

1046
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:35.060
<v Speaker 4>I think what the NRA is trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to prevent the slippery</v>

1047
00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 4>slope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to establish laws and</v>

1048
00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 4>keep them in place so that established</v>
<v Speaker 4>rights that are already in place,</v>

1049
00:54:43.171 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep them in place because they worry</v>

1050
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 4>that if you start increasing background</v>
<v Speaker 4>checks,</v>

1051
00:54:48.241 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 4>if you start ramping up any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>restrictions on gun owners,</v>

1052
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.200
<v Speaker 4>that it's a slippery slope that will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll never get back.</v>

1053
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.450
<v Speaker 4>They'll never get the freedom back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I mean,</v>

1054
00:54:57.451 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that freedom is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all afraid to go somewhere.</v>

1055
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:04.730
<v Speaker 4>We don't have freedom in this gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated country where we're not.</v>

1056
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:05.371
<v Speaker 4>We'll hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1057
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:06.210
<v Speaker 4>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1058
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:06.841
<v Speaker 4>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not.</v>

1059
00:55:06.841 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people are afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1060
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people are generally</v>

1061
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:12.390
<v Speaker 4>afraid of fighting to keep the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hold on.</v>

1062
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.600
<v Speaker 4>You're saying we're all afraid as if</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day when you go to the movies,</v>

1063
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:17.780
<v Speaker 4>you're worried about a mass shooting</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day when you go to the wall and</v>

1064
00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:18.614
<v Speaker 4>we're not afraid.</v>

1065
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 4>We travel freely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally things like this happen and</v>

1066
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 4>they're horrific and terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people aren't generally afraid.</v>

1067
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:28.740
<v Speaker 4>We're all afraid to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think that's true.</v>

1068
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.270
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1069
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 4>why then would we all want to protect</v>
<v Speaker 4>this so much?</v>

1070
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the NRAS position,</v>

1071
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 4>the NRAS position is that Liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Democrats,</v>

1072
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever they want to take away your</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to own a gun,</v>

1073
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.790
<v Speaker 4>the NRA does not want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they spend all their money,</v>

1074
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.470
<v Speaker 4>they do other lobbying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do everything they can to stop any</v>

1075
00:55:55.530 --> 00:56:00.530
<v Speaker 4>new restrictions from passing and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop anyone who is trying to take away</v>

1076
00:56:02.191 --> 00:56:03.370
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1077
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.870
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the way you framed that is that they</v>

1078
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:11.730
<v Speaker 4>are trying to protect their rights and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to preserve this thing,</v>

1079
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 4>but I just don't see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people with those people that</v>

1080
00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 4>are fighting against guns like so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So me,</v>

1081
00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 4>I have guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like shooting,</v>

1082
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.720
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking good at it.</v>

1083
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I made a career out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1084
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1085
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time I did enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and enough understanding that</v>

1086
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:33.901
<v Speaker 2>my ultimate goal is that we have a safer</v>
<v Speaker 2>society and that we protect people.</v>

1087
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 2>But the way we protect people</v>
<v Speaker 2>empirically is to not have these guns.</v>

1088
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has the gun crime that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody in the entire world as a</v>

1089
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 2>developed country has the gun crime and</v>
<v Speaker 2>incarceration rate in everything that we</v>

1090
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the worst example in the in the</v>

1091
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:55.660
<v Speaker 2>developed world of how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every other example is a better example</v>

1092
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 2>than what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're continually trying to stay</v>

1093
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:02.950
<v Speaker 2>into into this same mold that we know is</v>
<v Speaker 2>failing.</v>

1094
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I want to protect people and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence says that in order to protect</v>

1095
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't have handguns and assault</v>

1096
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:12.300
<v Speaker 2>rifles there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said the damn assault right forward</v>

1097
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't have a semiautomatic rifles</v>

1098
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 2>out there like crazy that enables</v>
<v Speaker 2>society to have that risk.</v>

1099
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those on the other end of that stray</v>

1100
00:57:22.821 --> 00:57:26.800
<v Speaker 2>bullet is a nine year old girl who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>bleeding out to death in the city and I</v>

1101
00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:29.500
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get rude with people,</v>

1102
00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:31.690
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that you want to go fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot something,</v>

1103
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I just don't give a shit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see the destruction close to</v>

1104
00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:39.640
<v Speaker 2>you is suddenly Gabby Gifford can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1105
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 2>for gun control after it touches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:45.250
<v Speaker 2>or somebody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever it touches you,</v>

1107
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:50.050
<v Speaker 2>suddenly we start to care if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if right now a masked gunman comes and</v>

1108
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 2>starts shooting up the rest of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>building and they,</v>

1109
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 2>they killed Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to care a hell of a lot</v>

1110
00:57:55.571 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 2>more by Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you don't?</v>

1111
00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Because I didn't want to die that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie under the bus please nobody.</v>

1112
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Shoot Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1113
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 2>I think we would all take a slightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspective.</v>

1114
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's an issue with all</v>

1115
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:13.870
<v Speaker 2>sorts of crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1116
00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:17.650
<v Speaker 2>that's also an issue with poverty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad communities is that it's not</v>

1117
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 2>touching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that are,</v>

1118
00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:21.490
<v Speaker 2>that are just want to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lock those people up,</v>

1119
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 2>get them off the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in my way.</v>

1120
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1121
00:58:26.471 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there is a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to getting rid of 300 million</v>

1122
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:33.250
<v Speaker 2>guns are controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't think you can do it in guns.</v>

1123
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I just want stop making them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Like let's just stop making them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of my ideas,</v>

1125
00:58:37.541 --> 00:58:40.540
<v Speaker 2>they are gun companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making a doctor.</v>

1126
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.390
<v Speaker 2>They're making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a weapon of death.</v>

1127
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know guns can last hundreds of</v>

1128
00:58:47.111 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 2>years if you take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1129
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>So if we stop making them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their value will all go up and then</v>

1130
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:53.870
<v Speaker 2>we're going to concentrate it.</v>

1131
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.100
<v Speaker 2>And I know the Libertarians would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1132
00:58:56.101 --> 00:58:57.270
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the rich people are gonna.</v>

1133
00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Hold the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1134
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to use them.</v>

1135
00:58:59.651 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's make it more valuable so</v>

1136
00:59:03.131 --> 00:59:06.310
<v Speaker 2>they're not worth $200 on the street so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1137
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.031
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1138
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>a gun of disrespect before a drug war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beef can lead to that shooting.</v>

1139
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I want to have you sit down with someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a gun proponent.</v>

1140
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1141
00:59:17.561 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been here for a year.</v>

1142
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Doing this day in and day out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging everyone from Sam Harris</v>

1143
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.560
<v Speaker 4>to whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to.</v>

1144
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.820
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The evidence is on my side.</v>

1145
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to do what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to have a debate</v>

1146
00:59:27.951 --> 00:59:29.720
<v Speaker 4>because it certainly would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could definitely set that,</v>

1147
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 4>set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1148
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:32.620
<v Speaker 4>well I can up my friend Justin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1149
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 4>100 percent you can get to do this</v>
<v Speaker 4>please because he needs to give me that</v>

1150
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:41.870
<v Speaker 4>push back that other people need to hear</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if he's right on a position I will</v>

1151
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:43.220
<v Speaker 4>absolutely change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1152
00:59:43.221 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 4>well we're definitely going to set that</v>
<v Speaker 4>up then I'm going to bring in Justin</v>

1153
00:59:46.341 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 4>because Justin is very articulate and</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be intimidated because he has a</v>

1154
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 4>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does have a thousand fucking guns or</v>

1155
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:53.540
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's a nice guy.</v>

1156
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 4>He's a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a good buddy.</v>

1157
00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he is a,</v>

1158
00:59:56.811 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and firearms enthusiast,</v>

1159
00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:02.040
<v Speaker 4>but also a really nice guy that has no</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal record,</v>

1160
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 4>never done anything wrong and very</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate.</v>

1161
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.960
<v Speaker 4>Very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very well read.</v>

1162
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.270
<v Speaker 4>But he's going to say that people like</v>
<v Speaker 4>him should have the guns.</v>

1163
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1164
01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 4>he's right where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1165
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's never done anything with</v>

1166
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 4>those guys and he's the wrong fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude to break into his house every once</v>

1167
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 4>in a while you're going to need a dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>like him to kick down the door,</v>

1168
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:18.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1169
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that,</v>

1170
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 4>so I wouldn't argue if he's going to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>he needs,</v>

1171
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need this elite members of society</v>

1172
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.600
<v Speaker 4>that Swat teams or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can handle these situations.</v>

1173
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:31.900
<v Speaker 4>Of course we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he's a competitive shooter.</v>

1174
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Does contest and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should shoot like me.</v>

1175
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he's right.</v>

1176
01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Like if they can handle it and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>professionalism as him,</v>

1177
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:41.300
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get pushed back from</v>
<v Speaker 4>society because nothing's going to</v>

1178
01:00:41.301 --> 01:00:41.720
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

1179
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.840
<v Speaker 4>But it's what I'm saying is that he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not doing anything wrong and it's</v>

1180
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.630
<v Speaker 4>something he enjoys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when do we decide,</v>

1181
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:50.390
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just putting this out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking a stance because I don't</v>

1182
01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:52.130
<v Speaker 4>understand it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1183
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.690
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people saying that I'm anti-gun or pro</v>

1184
01:00:56.691 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 4>gun or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty neutral on this.</v>

1185
01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:04.121
<v Speaker 4>I also owned guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I see the problems.</v>

1186
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:09.290
<v Speaker 4>I definitely see when something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this happens in Orlando and some crazy</v>

1187
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.740
<v Speaker 4>fuck can go in and just shoot up a</v>
<v Speaker 4>nightclub and kill all these people.</v>

1188
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:16.310
<v Speaker 4>We've got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to solve that problem.</v>

1189
01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some people would say concealed</v>
<v Speaker 4>carry permits,</v>

1190
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 4>so all these people in the nightclubs</v>
<v Speaker 4>could shoot out that guy,</v>

1191
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:25.550
<v Speaker 4>but that's false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's empirically false gunfight in a</v>

1192
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:27.620
<v Speaker 4>nightclub and more people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get shot.</v>

1193
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:31.160
<v Speaker 4>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the people that get involved in</v>

1194
01:01:31.161 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 4>these gunfights it will be their first</v>
<v Speaker 4>gunfight,</v>

1195
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to fuck it.</v>

1196
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Shit your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get target panic.</v>

1197
01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:38.120
<v Speaker 4>You're going to miss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to hit people.</v>

1198
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.090
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glad you're saying that.</v>

1199
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not as simple as via to gun.</v>

1200
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.760
<v Speaker 4>If he had a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd probably wouldn't be able to point</v>

1201
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.580
<v Speaker 4>it at people and if you pulled the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger,</v>

1202
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 4>you'd be lucky if you hit someone right</v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of you.</v>

1203
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.750
<v Speaker 4>So where.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where was that shooting?</v>

1204
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.320
<v Speaker 4>It was relatively recent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was out of college and there were two</v>

1205
01:01:54.321 --> 01:01:59.321
<v Speaker 4>Marines on base on the college campus</v>
<v Speaker 4>with weapons and they didn't engage</v>

1206
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.420
<v Speaker 4>because they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>

1207
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 4>I was only going to make the situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>

1208
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.160
<v Speaker 4>The cops weren't going to know who I am</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had my weapon out,</v>

1209
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 4>but I could have missed and done</v>
<v Speaker 4>something else.</v>

1210
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:13.820
<v Speaker 4>And two guys that were in their actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>right state of mind that we're armed</v>

1211
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:18.970
<v Speaker 4>decided that engaging was more dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually empirically more that</v>

1212
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 4>if you engage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your more likely to die and you're</v>

1213
01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to shoot somebody else or</v>

1214
01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 4>the situation's not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>resolved.</v>

1215
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:28.510
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1216
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 4>we literally know this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have done this.</v>

1217
01:02:30.511 --> 01:02:34.290
<v Speaker 4>They've done studies where they've tried</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take people and simulate it and it</v>

1218
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 4>never pans out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1219
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.290
<v Speaker 4>But that's engaging with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1220
01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.790
<v Speaker 4>an instance where you're not involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are involved,</v>

1221
01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:43.140
<v Speaker 4>you absolutely have to engage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get shot.</v>

1222
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.060
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if</v>

1223
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.330
<v Speaker 4>you have to run like so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the evidence says that if you run,</v>

1224
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 4>that's your best bet for safety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

1225
01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:54.840
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1226
01:02:54.841 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Because that's a bitch move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please.</v>

1227
01:02:56.311 --> 01:02:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone shooting,</v>

1228
01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:03.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm all better hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this delusion of Hiroshima.</v>

1229
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.520
<v Speaker 4>You know that somebody is going to save</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

1230
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 4>And sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may find that happen every so often.</v>

1231
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.421
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

1232
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:11.250
<v Speaker 4>have you not seen Sylvester stallone</v>
<v Speaker 4>movies?</v>

1233
01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:14.880
<v Speaker 4>Because it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that that is a problem,</v>

1234
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super problem that they shoot people in</v>

1235
01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:19.700
<v Speaker 4>the leg while they're running and Tulsa.</v>

1236
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.820
<v Speaker 4>Like we've developed this sort of idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what goes down in a gunfight based on</v>

1237
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:28.470
<v Speaker 4>fiction not based on reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amount of people that have actually</v>

1238
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:33.471
<v Speaker 4>been exposed to a bullet hitting a live</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is so small sound.</v>

1239
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1240
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.700
<v Speaker 4>They don't realize how loud that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you show shoot with,</v>

1241
01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:41.340
<v Speaker 4>with headphones in your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead and start clacking off 15</v>

1242
01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:44.170
<v Speaker 4>rounds with without ear protection on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>

1243
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 4>You'll be ringing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even understand what's going</v>

1244
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be well trained in that</v>

1245
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:51.820
<v Speaker 4>environment and understand like cops</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't even in there the first time they</v>

1246
01:03:51.821 --> 01:03:55.340
<v Speaker 4>get a real gun battle because they shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>with earfold earplugs in and everything.</v>

1247
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 4>The first time they're shooting their</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun,</v>

1248
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.920
<v Speaker 4>they're hearing the sound and everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

1249
01:03:58.921 --> 01:04:00.950
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you got those people like</v>

1250
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:04.410
<v Speaker 4>everybody that I was in the Marine Corps</v>
<v Speaker 4>with doing fast team,</v>

1251
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're going to get any</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun crimes and I think they can handle</v>

1252
01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:11.970
<v Speaker 4>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these are a certain segment that</v>

1253
01:04:11.971 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 4>needs to live up to a high standard.</v>

1254
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are people that have been trained</v>

1255
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 4>and they've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've developed this understanding of</v>

1256
01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 4>firearms that's so deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people just don't get to that.</v>

1257
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like the average person watches a</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC fight and thinks they can kick</v>

1258
01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:30.300
<v Speaker 4>someone's ass and then if you fought</v>
<v Speaker 4>against a train martial artists,</v>

1259
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you really don't know what you're</v>

1260
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:33.840
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of the same thing.</v>

1261
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.890
<v Speaker 4>And when you compare someone who really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my friend Justin really understands</v>

1262
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:41.270
<v Speaker 4>firearms versus the average person who</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes and buys a gun and thinks,</v>

1263
01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm safe now.</v>

1264
01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 4>I got this gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It maybe,</v>

1265
01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.370
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

1266
01:04:47.371 --> 01:04:50.870
<v Speaker 4>but statistics say that you're more</v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to shoot a family member and an</v>

1267
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 4>in a fight or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicide.</v>

1268
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the other thing,</v>

1269
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a wonderful analogy.</v>

1270
01:04:57.571 --> 01:05:01.200
<v Speaker 4>I love that you did that because I mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a perfect analogy almost for mma</v>

1271
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:06.260
<v Speaker 4>and who can handle a weapon as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's all about undue confidence,</v>

1272
01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:09.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and perfect.</v>

1273
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.040
<v Speaker 4>So like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>

1274
01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.870
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to tell people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel that way.</v>

1275
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.330
<v Speaker 4>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you,</v>

1276
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.060
<v Speaker 4>you can have a gun on you right now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can set this up in the morning and I</v>

1277
01:05:19.061 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 4>can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk around your day as normal at some</v>

1278
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 4>point in time today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take that gun away from</v>

1279
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1280
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 4>I will get that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen because you,</v>

1281
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be able to protect</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and you know I'm coming.</v>

1282
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.590
<v Speaker 4>So then why are you actually think</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're safe,</v>

1283
01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.750
<v Speaker 4>that you have that gun on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>

1284
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.700
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're fighting against the</v>
<v Speaker 4>inferior opponent or you're in this</v>

1285
01:05:44.701 --> 01:05:47.580
<v Speaker 4>situation where you have distance and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have all these things like that,</v>

1286
01:05:47.581 --> 01:05:51.420
<v Speaker 4>just like in an MMA fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to go as you planned it,</v>

1287
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.520
<v Speaker 4>I promise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are you saying?</v>

1288
01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:55.020
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as like you're going to take the</v>

1289
01:05:55.021 --> 01:05:57.120
<v Speaker 4>gun away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you wanted to have a concealed</v>

1290
01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.080
<v Speaker 4>weapon on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1291
01:05:58.081 --> 01:05:59.940
<v Speaker 4>And so you're standing in line at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bank.</v>

1292
01:05:59.941 --> 01:06:02.790
<v Speaker 4>You're going about your day as normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could tell you at some point in time</v>

1293
01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get that gun from you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get it because if everything's</v>

1294
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.940
<v Speaker 4>about surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when the bank robber comes in,</v>

1295
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:10.830
<v Speaker 4>well it's not surprised if you tell them</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get it.</v>

1296
01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Well sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just given you 24 hours,</v>

1297
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.410
<v Speaker 4>I'll be all fucking jacked up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>adderall for 24 hours.</v>

1298
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about the life you're meant to</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep that gun safe,</v>

1299
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.110
<v Speaker 4>you definitely wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it makes it an adventure.</v>

1300
01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing that you're bigger</v>

1301
01:06:23.491 --> 01:06:25.170
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be ready for it.</v>

1302
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.220
<v Speaker 4>It's still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1303
01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:28.770
<v Speaker 4>You're just not going to be because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just going to come out of nowhere.</v>

1304
01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.950
<v Speaker 4>So when people have these guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you like really good at disarming</v>

1305
01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:32.930
<v Speaker 4>people or something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1306
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.490
<v Speaker 4>more than anybody else would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you learn how to a holster works.</v>

1307
01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:38.330
<v Speaker 4>Somebody goes from my gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm punching him in their fucking face.</v>

1308
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Come from behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to be standing in line at a</v>

1309
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.030
<v Speaker 4>w.</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's my gun?</v>

1310
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.570
<v Speaker 4>When your head right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're going to come from behind.</v>

1311
01:06:45.571 --> 01:06:46.290
<v Speaker 4>They're going to grab it.</v>

1312
01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Sure you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how hard is it to get a gun out of a</v>

1313
01:06:49.261 --> 01:06:50.460
<v Speaker 4>holster?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain holsters,</v>

1314
01:06:50.461 --> 01:06:52.050
<v Speaker 4>as long as you know the holster works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cake.</v>

1315
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1316
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.900
<v Speaker 4>What does that one holster wear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you yank on it?</v>

1317
01:06:54.901 --> 01:06:56.970
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work with the triple</v>
<v Speaker 4>retention holsters.</v>

1318
01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really going to see your gun if you</v>

1319
01:06:58.771 --> 01:07:00.660
<v Speaker 4>have one of those because those are</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty darn big.</v>

1320
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.030
<v Speaker 4>What if I'm wearing a puffy coat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1321
01:07:03.031 --> 01:07:04.980
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could figure out ways to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>

1322
01:07:04.981 --> 01:07:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're just not actually safer.</v>

1323
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.720
<v Speaker 4>I know a dude who keeps several guns on</v>
<v Speaker 4>them all the time and two knives.</v>

1324
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.400
<v Speaker 4>He's got a knife in his boot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He keeps several guns on them all the</v>

1325
01:07:16.401 --> 01:07:17.700
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been hitting the head a bunch of</v>

1326
01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.170
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's just.</v>

1327
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.440
<v Speaker 4>Some people think you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

1328
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.690
<v Speaker 4>You can't think that that's what's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make you safe.</v>

1329
01:07:24.691 --> 01:07:26.460
<v Speaker 4>It's your mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your,</v>

1330
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.590
<v Speaker 4>it's your awareness of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>surroundings.</v>

1331
01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:30.420
<v Speaker 4>It's your ability to make logical</v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>

1332
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:32.130
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're talking about a very specific</v>

1333
01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.950
<v Speaker 4>case where someone's trying to take your</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun away.</v>

1334
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the thing is you're in a,</v>

1335
01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:39.750
<v Speaker 4>you're in a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even need a gun because odds are</v>

1336
01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:40.620
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be one there</v>

1337
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.700
<v Speaker 4>and that's what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like a big thing of policing is you</v>

1338
01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:50.701
<v Speaker 4>don't get into like Jujitsu Kinda of</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling matches because of that gun.</v>

1339
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because no matter what fight you're in,</v>

1340
01:07:55.510 --> 01:08:00.510
<v Speaker 4>there's always a gun there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same thing with non cops,</v>

1341
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:02.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to get in a fight as a</v>

1342
01:08:02.981 --> 01:08:07.090
<v Speaker 4>cop because if the evidence shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>statistically that if they get that gun</v>

1343
01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:08.380
<v Speaker 4>from you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to use it on you.</v>

1344
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's no different from you.</v>

1345
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 4>If they get that gun from you can use it</v>
<v Speaker 4>on you.</v>

1346
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1347
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 4>So why would you want to be in a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>with somebody?</v>

1348
01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a wrestling match,</v>

1349
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that.</v>

1350
01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 4>But I introduce the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're introducing that potential for</v>

1351
01:08:26.211 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 4>you dying and there's a high possibility</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you didn't have it before.</v>

1352
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:33.500
<v Speaker 4>You literally are making yourself more</v>
<v Speaker 4>at risk.</v>

1353
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean the statistics are clear on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you bring a gun to this fight,</v>

1354
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:42.970
<v Speaker 4>the odds are against you even higher now</v>
<v Speaker 4>because most people that bring a,</v>

1355
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 4>if even if you bring a knife to a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a significant portion of those people</v>

1356
01:08:46.521 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 4>get the knife taken away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets used on them.</v>

1357
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you how many cases we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been where you're trying to figure out a</v>

1358
01:08:52.521 --> 01:08:54.320
<v Speaker 4>stabbing call and come to find out.</v>

1359
01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 4>Know they tried to do the stabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they got that shit taken from them</v>

1360
01:08:59.061 --> 01:09:02.660
<v Speaker 4>and they got stabbed themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once you introduce that,</v>

1361
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.250
<v Speaker 4>that potential,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were more dangerous or yourself.</v>

1362
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 4>But this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about non trained</v>

1363
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 4>individuals and it sort of brings us</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to you and I not the</v>

1364
01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 4>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fight hard on those really trained</v>

1365
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

1366
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1367
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:18.320
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

1368
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's not a right at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a privilege.</v>

1369
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 4>So it's like driving a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>driving your car on a right,</v>

1370
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:26.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if these people want to earn that</v>

1371
01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:27.810
<v Speaker 4>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so be it.</v>

1372
01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 4>But it becomes a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't it?</v>

1373
01:09:30.141 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 4>When a really fucking crazy person earns</v>
<v Speaker 4>that privilege.</v>

1374
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone hasn't done anything yet</v>

1375
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:38.120
<v Speaker 4>criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's been several people that</v>

1376
01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:41.930
<v Speaker 4>have committed mass shootings but didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do anything before they did that</v>

1377
01:09:41.931 --> 01:09:42.764
<v Speaker 4>shooting.</v>

1378
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:43.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1379
01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:44.630
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're still left with those.</v>

1380
01:09:44.631 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 4>You still decided as a society that on</v>
<v Speaker 4>that side of the equation,</v>

1381
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to accept that amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though it's a lesser amount,</v>

1382
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.160
<v Speaker 4>you have decided to set that amount and</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we can just move to a point where we</v>

1383
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 4>can accept a lesser amount,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be wonderful.</v>

1384
01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 4>But we're continually accepting in ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing amounts because more people</v>

1385
01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 4>are buying guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more people buying ammo.</v>

1386
01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.940
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is the solution then in your</v>

1387
01:10:07.941 --> 01:10:09.190
<v Speaker 4>eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1388
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I would like to stop manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

1389
01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like handguns and rifles to be banned.</v>

1390
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that has to take a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Rifle.</v>

1391
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:22.100
<v Speaker 4>It's just a semiautomatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning you can't own them anymore.</v>

1392
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's not go.</v>

1393
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1394
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.500
<v Speaker 4>same trick is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it becomes a privilege.</v>

1395
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 4>So like the handguns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your twitter accounts getting attacked</v>

1396
01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:36.100
<v Speaker 4>right now and that was a real fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal.</v>

1397
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.950
<v Speaker 4>You're never taking my gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be those people that</v>

1398
01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:42.470
<v Speaker 4>earned that privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that it's a right.</v>

1399
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.770
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1400
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.540
<v Speaker 4>I think we could call it a lot in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's just even if it,</v>

1401
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.080
<v Speaker 4>like we were saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the evidence is there that it's</v>

1402
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.220
<v Speaker 4>actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>

1403
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:56.400
<v Speaker 4>but if it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we rethink that?</v>

1404
01:10:56.401 --> 01:10:57.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the Second Amendment?</v>

1405
01:10:57.831 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 4>Read it exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

1406
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.930
<v Speaker 4>In its form please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we can be again,</v>

1407
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.350
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we keep the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the bill of rights exactly intact</v>

1408
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:11.510
<v Speaker 4>some shit that was created hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago before any of the variables</v>

1409
01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>that we have to deal with in society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether</v>

1410
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 5>it's variables about privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>electronic communications,</v>

1411
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:22.431
<v Speaker 5>whether it's variables about the power</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the ability that guns have.</v>

1412
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're dealing with a totally</v>
<v Speaker 5>different world.</v>

1413
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 5>They made the shit back when people had</v>
<v Speaker 5>muskets,</v>

1414
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.810
<v Speaker 5>we really need to consider that and by</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way,</v>

1415
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:35.811
<v Speaker 5>they had just gotten done fighting off a</v>
<v Speaker 5>totalitarian regime and had expanded and</v>

1416
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:38.350
<v Speaker 5>become their own country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Second,</v>

1417
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Constitution reads a well regulated</v>

1418
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 5>militia being necessary to the security</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a free state.</v>

1419
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 5>The right of the people to keep and bear</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms shall not be infringed.</v>

1420
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty clear.</v>

1421
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.800
<v Speaker 5>The right of the people to keep and bear</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms shall not be infringed.</v>

1422
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a well regulated militia being</v>

1423
01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 5>necessary to the security of a free</v>
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>

1424
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 5>the right of the people to keep and bear</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms shall not be infringed if they are</v>

1425
01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 5>a well regulated militia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not saying if it's saying</v>

1426
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:15.900
<v Speaker 5>capital letter a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a well regulated militia being necessary</v>

1427
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:18.810
<v Speaker 5>to the security of the free state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're establishing that it is</v>

1428
01:12:18.811 --> 01:12:22.860
<v Speaker 5>important that you have a well regulated</v>
<v Speaker 5>militia being necessary.</v>

1429
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:25.770
<v Speaker 5>Well-Regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the weird term.</v>

1430
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.290
<v Speaker 5>Well regulated militia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

1431
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:30.900
<v Speaker 5>National Guard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what they're saying though?</v>

1432
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Because it's saying the right of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people to keep and bear arms right?</v>

1433
01:12:34.311 --> 01:12:38.280
<v Speaker 5>They will not be in the state though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that you fight,</v>

1434
01:12:38.281 --> 01:12:39.840
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People of the state mean they're just</v>

1435
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:42.550
<v Speaker 5>people know because that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>states are mean.</v>

1436
01:12:42.551 --> 01:12:43.950
<v Speaker 5>We the people that's the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1437
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.080
<v Speaker 5>But this is a free,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a free state.</v>

1438
01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 5>What that means is they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're worried that we might be invaded</v>

1439
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:53.310
<v Speaker 5>and taken over by England at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>government or the government.</v>

1440
01:12:53.311 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Any government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's against the federal government.</v>

1441
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a state being able to defend</v>

1442
01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:02.430
<v Speaker 5>itself against the federal government</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they still were lingering with</v>

1443
01:13:02.431 --> 01:13:04.290
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That from Britain.</v>

1444
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's what they meant</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they said a free state.</v>

1445
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.080
<v Speaker 5>Is that what they could pull that up</v>
<v Speaker 5>again so I can see that please.</v>

1446
01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:11.643
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1447
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.790
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of weird arguing about this</v>

1448
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 5>because if we had to do this over again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is obviously something that</v>

1449
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 5>was established as we said a long time</v>
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>

1450
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:26.511
<v Speaker 5>If we had to do this over again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we had established new new amendments</v>

1451
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 5>or new rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how we would rate,</v>

1452
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 5>but that's a prep propositional phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a well regulated militia.</v>

1453
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.550
<v Speaker 5>That means everything after that is in</v>
<v Speaker 5>regards to a well reg and Mr. so if I</v>

1454
01:13:38.551 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 5>said and then Joe and everything in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>sentence would be about.</v>

1455
01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:44.550
<v Speaker 5>Joe is a prepositional phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that that's exactly what they</v>

1456
01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:45.420
<v Speaker 5>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1457
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:47.520
<v Speaker 5>a rel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well regulated militia,</v>

1458
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:52.110
<v Speaker 5>meaning that there's a bunch of militia</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning regular people,</v>

1459
01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 5>civilians gathering together to form</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a makeshift army.</v>

1460
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being necessary to the security of a</v>

1461
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:01.500
<v Speaker 5>free state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now when they say a free state,</v>

1462
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.740
<v Speaker 5>this is back when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what were their fucking three states or</v>

1463
01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:07.260
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the 13 isn't,</v>

1464
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.290
<v Speaker 5>should've been 13.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the first ones were 13,</v>

1465
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first initial states,</v>

1466
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.640
<v Speaker 4>the right of the people to keep and bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>arms shall not be infringed.</v>

1467
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 4>Sees fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody talks like that.</v>

1468
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:21.570
<v Speaker 4>You fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know today in 2016 if you wrote a</v>

1469
01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.020
<v Speaker 4>sentence like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

1470
01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:24.190
<v Speaker 4>hey bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you trying to say?</v>

1471
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:27.300
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1472
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thou shalt not for score in 16 years ago</v>

1473
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speak Normal Bitch,</v>

1474
01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1475
01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:38.500
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right of the people to keep and bear</v>

1476
01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 4>arms shall not be infringed is the one</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everybody claims to.</v>

1477
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.440
<v Speaker 4>People of the Free State though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1478
01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:47.170
<v Speaker 4>that's definitely what they meant</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they did that back then.</v>

1479
01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:47.571
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1480
01:14:47.571 --> 01:14:49.830
<v Speaker 4>they formulated those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those books,</v>

1481
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 4>but they're saying shall not be</v>
<v Speaker 4>infringed the right of the people.</v>

1482
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 4>But remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the federal government shall not</v>

1483
01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:59.120
<v Speaker 4>infringe that right against the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1484
01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 4>it's not saying against the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's saying the people to put attack the</v>

1485
01:15:03.101 --> 01:15:06.880
<v Speaker 4>security of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right of the people to keep in bare</v>

1486
01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 4>arms shall not be infringed the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this state.</v>

1487
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what they're saying is that was</v>

1488
01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.570
<v Speaker 4>annoying for people listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to do the car chase story after</v>

1489
01:15:16.571 --> 01:15:17.081
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we all.</v>

1490
01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:17.891
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1491
01:15:17.891 --> 01:15:18.760
<v Speaker 4>that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1492
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.400
<v Speaker 4>A well regulated militia being</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>

1493
01:15:21.401 --> 01:15:23.410
<v Speaker 4>So there's establishing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1494
01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.360
<v Speaker 4>if you're angry right now and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck I'm writing my congressman,</v>

1495
01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.200
<v Speaker 4>you fucking pussies and try to take my</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>

1496
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:33.250
<v Speaker 4>We're just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to unpack this amendment,</v>

1497
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:39.280
<v Speaker 4>a well regulated militia being necessary</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the security of a free state.</v>

1498
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:43.090
<v Speaker 4>So they're establishing that we need a</v>
<v Speaker 4>well regulated militia to make sure that</v>

1499
01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.080
<v Speaker 4>we don't get taken over by tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The right of the people to keep and bear</v>

1500
01:15:47.081 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 4>arms shall not be infringed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>

1501
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not a constitutionalist by</v>
<v Speaker 4>any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1502
01:15:53.681 --> 01:15:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Nor am I a scholar of the bill of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rights.</v>

1503
01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 4>That seems pretty clear.</v>

1504
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.620
<v Speaker 4>The right shall not be infringed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1505
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.850
<v Speaker 4>So I'll give you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say we give you the right of the</v>

1506
01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 4>people is what they mean is that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people can hold the arms until they're</v>

1507
01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 4>needed to form this militia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's weird because that is what</v>

1508
01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:13.560
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like to me to hold the arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:16.120
<v Speaker 4>So the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right of the people to keep and bear</v>

1510
01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:17.080
<v Speaker 4>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1511
01:16:17.081 --> 01:16:18.620
<v Speaker 4>So they have the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1512
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 4>And so they can have them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that so that they can</v>

1513
01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:25.270
<v Speaker 4>formulate a well regulated militia later</v>
<v Speaker 4>if needed,</v>

1514
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.180
<v Speaker 4>so it does kind of relate that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about,</v>

1515
01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:30.160
<v Speaker 4>but you don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1516
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.790
<v Speaker 4>The right of the people to keep and bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>arms shall not be in front of the people</v>

1517
01:16:33.791 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 4>have the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1518
01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the idea could be that they</v>

1519
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:41.620
<v Speaker 4>meant that you can have the guns in case</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to formulate the militia to</v>

1520
01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:42.454
<v Speaker 4>fight tyranny.</v>

1521
01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.630
<v Speaker 4>It could be read that way in case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's just not giving you any</v>

1523
01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:49.810
<v Speaker 4>options and saying shall not be</v>
<v Speaker 4>infringed.</v>

1524
01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 4>Scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it saying?</v>

1525
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:54.150
<v Speaker 4>What is the Second Amendment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually said the exact same.</v>

1526
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:58.240
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the definition of modern</v>

1527
01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:01.750
<v Speaker 4>definition of the rights granted by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>second amendment.</v>

1528
01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Is there any sort of legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's agreed on this thing.</v>

1529
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like these cocksuckers that</v>

1530
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 4>wrote that chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've made it so weird,</v>

1531
01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:14.720
<v Speaker 4>but even if you can get them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they certainly weren't talking</v>

1532
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 4>about Ar fifteens and they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>envisioning a government with 5,000</v>

1533
01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:20.660
<v Speaker 4>nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1534
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Then they weren't envisioning 300</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people.</v>

1535
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:27.500
<v Speaker 4>The PROZAC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of fighting the government just</v>

1536
01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 4>really seems weird like so what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying there.</v>

1537
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 4>So I was in the Marine Corps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying then is that if they</v>

1538
01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:37.640
<v Speaker 4>make a wall like trump gets into office</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>

1539
01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1540
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:42.770
<v Speaker 4>We're going to crack down on our people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that I'm going to come after</v>

1541
01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:44.210
<v Speaker 4>you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

1542
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.190
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the the most.</v>

1543
01:17:46.191 --> 01:17:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Some people will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People at our military will not do that.</v>

1544
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 4>These generals aren't going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to command their their</v>

1545
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.730
<v Speaker 4>members.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a military coup?</v>

1546
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 4>You probably would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you will have some people that are</v>

1547
01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:59.900
<v Speaker 4>willing to comply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you are saying that your friends and</v>

1548
01:17:59.901 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 4>brothers and sisters that are in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>armed forces are going to turn their</v>

1549
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 4>guns on their friends and family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck out.</v>

1550
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.890
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting because you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>make that same argument about the</v>

1551
01:18:09.891 --> 01:18:12.200
<v Speaker 4>police.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that your friends and</v>

1552
01:18:12.201 --> 01:18:14.690
<v Speaker 4>brothers and sisters that are in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>police are going to turn their guns on</v>

1553
01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:15.890
<v Speaker 4>the civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they do.</v>

1554
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:19.160
<v Speaker 4>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a small amount of people that</v>

1555
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:19.994
<v Speaker 4>are affected.</v>

1556
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:22.910
<v Speaker 4>So if you're talking about affecting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire country,</v>

1557
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:26.870
<v Speaker 4>then those people will have that</v>
<v Speaker 4>personal effect because it's not just</v>

1558
01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.090
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're turning on their own family.</v>

1559
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:33.110
<v Speaker 4>They're not just turning the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument that a small amount of</v>

1560
01:18:33.111 --> 01:18:36.380
<v Speaker 4>noncompliant people would be the ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the military would have to go</v>

1561
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:37.580
<v Speaker 4>against.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1562
01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess if you have that kind of</v>

1563
01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:40.070
<v Speaker 4>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1564
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.260
<v Speaker 4>It's Kinda the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're literally say they were to come</v>

1565
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:45.230
<v Speaker 4>take all the guns and they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it by force.</v>

1566
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're also seeing this huge force for</v>

1567
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:48.530
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the military is not allowed to operate</v>

1568
01:18:48.531 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 4>on our soil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they already do.</v>

1569
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:52.790
<v Speaker 4>They're already rolling the national</v>
<v Speaker 4>guard through cities.</v>

1570
01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:57.791
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well have a well regulated militia.</v>

1571
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1572
01:19:00.651 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you look at the tanks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the,</v>

1573
01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:04.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1574
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:09.300
<v Speaker 4>the fucking military vehicles that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're using in some of these riot</v>

1575
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.110
<v Speaker 4>drill militarization of police is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>separate,</v>

1576
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 4>a separate argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1577
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:16.010
<v Speaker 4>it is a separate argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it becomes a military then.</v>

1578
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about war machines,</v>

1579
01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.530
<v Speaker 4>that's something that clearly wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>envisioned and so I would rather you</v>

1580
01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.180
<v Speaker 4>didn't open up that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another channel.</v>

1581
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Arms Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

1582
01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:27.690
<v Speaker 4>where's this going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1583
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>

1584
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:34.490
<v Speaker 4>It's a very unusual sort of a debate</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I see both sides.</v>

1585
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely see both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just remember that equation though.</v>

1586
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:41.780
<v Speaker 4>The both sides of that equation where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can be logical.</v>

1587
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:44.420
<v Speaker 4>One side of that equation is death.</v>

1588
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other argument would be that</v>

1589
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.420
<v Speaker 4>protecting yourself against death is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1590
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.510
<v Speaker 4>but we know that if you want to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>safer society,</v>

1591
01:19:56.511 --> 01:19:59.600
<v Speaker 4>if you want to live in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to get rid of the Goddamn guns.</v>

1592
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Australia so different than adults.</v>

1593
01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.640
<v Speaker 4>I just don't buy those small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that.</v>

1594
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:09.990
<v Speaker 4>We buy it this way by it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many mass shootings have there ever</v>

1595
01:20:09.991 --> 01:20:11.970
<v Speaker 4>been in California besides San</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernardino?</v>

1596
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Take San Bernardino out of the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many black people in the hood that</v>

1597
01:20:16.591 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 4>we don't hear about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm,</v>

1598
01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mass shootings in this country daily,</v>

1599
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to get them every week</v>
<v Speaker 4>or two weeks in California.</v>

1600
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Do they really get them every week or</v>
<v Speaker 4>two weeks in California?</v>

1601
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just don't hear about them because</v>

1602
01:20:29.911 --> 01:20:31.390
<v Speaker 4>you're tall because they happen in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Compton.</v>

1603
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.160
<v Speaker 4>No one gives a shit.</v>

1604
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're.</v>

1605
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:37.200
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminals shooting other criminals and</v>

1606
01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:39.990
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the arguments that gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>

1607
01:20:39.991 --> 01:20:43.680
<v Speaker 4>anti gun control people use against</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that talk about how many people</v>

1608
01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 4>get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's how many people.</v>

1609
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 4>Like when you look at the numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that get shot in this country,</v>

1610
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 4>there are also calculating the number of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are shot by law enforcement</v>

1611
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:54.270
<v Speaker 4>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

1612
01:20:54.271 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 4>They do know they don't even get counted</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they don't get reported to the FBI.</v>

1613
01:20:57.570 --> 01:20:59.940
<v Speaker 4>The Guardian just figured out how many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people got shot.</v>

1614
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:02.820
<v Speaker 4>The Twenty 15 is the first year we</v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out how many people got shot by</v>

1615
01:21:02.821 --> 01:21:04.050
<v Speaker 4>police in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1616
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 4>but it is 2016 and we do calculate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1617
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:10.940
<v Speaker 4>the newspaper does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the federal government or nobody doesn't</v>

1618
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.670
<v Speaker 4>look up statistics of how many people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are killed by guns every year.</v>

1619
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 4>They do include bad guys killed by cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know what?</v>

1620
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:21.790
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So an argument that Ted nugent is don't</v>

1621
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.450
<v Speaker 4>count as homicides either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1622
01:21:23.451 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 4>we're not talking about homicides were</v>
<v Speaker 4>just talking about the them.</v>

1623
01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:27.390
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't count.</v>

1624
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't count against our homicide</v>

1625
01:21:29.071 --> 01:21:30.680
<v Speaker 4>count because it's considered justified,</v>
<v Speaker 4>justified.</v>

1626
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Homicides don't count,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but deaths,</v>

1627
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:34.770
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they use the word homicide</v>

1628
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:36.900
<v Speaker 4>when they're counting firearm deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting point.</v>

1629
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's follow that up because this was</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a Ted nugent and Piers Morgan,</v>

1630
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm using Ted nugent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One appears.</v>

1631
01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's piece of shit,</v>

1632
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.480
<v Speaker 4>but he what his argument with Ted</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nugent,</v>

1633
01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:50.510
<v Speaker 4>he got shredded and then argument</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he,</v>

1634
01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:55.580
<v Speaker 4>he went into it on armed with facts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>nugent spews this out every point he</v>

1635
01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:57.091
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

1636
01:21:57.091 --> 01:21:59.190
<v Speaker 4>he would argue with you all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1637
01:21:59.191 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's arguing with crazy person.</v>

1638
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.180
<v Speaker 4>He's allegedly was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little crazy.</v>

1639
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:04.023
<v Speaker 4>That's not go.</v>

1640
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 4>There are certain people I'm willing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>call out from time to time.</v>

1641
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 4>That'd be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think Ted knew just crazy is crazy</v>

1642
01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 4>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen him talk clearly crazy.</v>

1643
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.390
<v Speaker 4>He's going to argue that until the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of day you can.</v>

1644
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:19.830
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can put the evidence in front of him</v>

1645
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 4>day in and day out and he'll just move</v>
<v Speaker 4>the goal and moved the goalpost and no</v>

1646
01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:25.170
<v Speaker 4>one's interested in having an argument</v>
<v Speaker 4>with somebody who's just going to</v>

1647
01:22:25.171 --> 01:22:27.780
<v Speaker 4>continually move posts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about all that.</v>

1648
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:29.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he would move the</v>
<v Speaker 4>goalposts.</v>

1649
01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Say the one thing that he makes coherent</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments about is in fact against gun</v>

1650
01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:35.850
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we got there at Jamie?</v>

1651
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.243
<v Speaker 4>I'm halfway</v>

1652
01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:38.510
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I got this,</v>

1653
01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:40.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the Washington Post,</v>

1654
01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:45.050
<v Speaker 6>this article that starts with the year</v>
<v Speaker 6>of 1000 people nearly being shot by</v>

1655
01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:46.490
<v Speaker 6>police.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That sound as annoying.</v>

1656
01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.353
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1657
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:51.260
<v Speaker 6>it says right here they start to compile</v>
<v Speaker 6>a record of every fatal police shooting</v>

1658
01:22:51.261 --> 01:22:55.250
<v Speaker 6>in the nation as of 20 15 something no</v>
<v Speaker 6>government agency had done.</v>

1659
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:59.180
<v Speaker 6>It started after Michael Brown shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was when they started looking into</v>

1660
01:22:59.181 --> 01:22:59.820
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1661
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:03.870
<v Speaker 4>British newspaper did that Goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 4>commies or whatever they are.</v>

1662
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but other posts</v>

1663
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>so sought to compile a record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a Washington Post.</v>

1664
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 1>The Guardian started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it says the post sought to compile a</v>

1665
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:16.580
<v Speaker 1>record of every fatal police shooting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nation.</v>

1666
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 15 something no government</v>
<v Speaker 1>agency had done the project,</v>

1667
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>began after police officers shot and</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed Michael Brown in Ferguson,</v>

1668
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Missouri in August of 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provoking several nights of fire rise,</v>

1669
01:23:27.601 --> 01:23:27.911
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1670
01:23:27.911 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Race remains the most volatile</v>

1671
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 1>flashpoint in any accounting of police</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>

1672
01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 1>The black men make up only six percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the US population.</v>

1673
01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 1>They account for 40 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unarmed men shot to death by police this</v>

1674
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Post database shows in the majority</v>

1675
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:46.360
<v Speaker 1>of cases which police shot and killed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who had attacked someone with a</v>

1676
01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:48.910
<v Speaker 1>weapon or brandished a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who was shot was white.</v>

1677
01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1678
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why hasn't the majority of cases in</v>

1679
01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:00.030
<v Speaker 1>which police shot and killed a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had attacked someone with a weapon</v>

1680
01:24:00.031 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>or brandished a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person was shot,</v>

1681
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:04.780
<v Speaker 1>was white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a huge disproportionate number three</v>

1682
01:24:04.781 --> 01:24:08.260
<v Speaker 1>and five of those killed after</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibiting less threatening behavior</v>

1683
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:12.700
<v Speaker 1>were black or Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so meaning they valued the life less of</v>

1684
01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:16.450
<v Speaker 1>people who are black or Hispanic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were quicker to shoot them with</v>

1685
01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:20.140
<v Speaker 1>less threatening behavior than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would with white people regardless,</v>

1686
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>regardless of race and more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the cases,</v>

1687
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 1>the fatal encounter involved officers</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing someone on foot or by car</v>

1688
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:30.250
<v Speaker 1>making chases one of the most common</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios in the data.</v>

1689
01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.773
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1690
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:34.790
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting that it's shooting</v>

1691
01:24:34.791 --> 01:24:36.860
<v Speaker 4>more white people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess there are more white,</v>

1692
01:24:36.861 --> 01:24:39.590
<v Speaker 4>more white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because there's one percent of the</v>

1693
01:24:39.591 --> 01:24:41.060
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably more than that,</v>

1694
01:24:41.061 --> 01:24:43.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of them?</v>

1695
01:24:43.001 --> 01:24:44.750
<v Speaker 4>White people either see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's getting down.</v>

1696
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.480
<v Speaker 4>It's going down slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown people are fucking their way up to</v>

1697
01:24:47.481 --> 01:24:50.720
<v Speaker 4>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We joke about that.</v>

1698
01:24:50.721 --> 01:24:53.450
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that movie where everything</v>

1699
01:24:53.451 --> 01:24:57.020
<v Speaker 4>goes crazy stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

1700
01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Douglas.</v>

1701
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 4>No purge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1702
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Idiocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1703
01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:02.750
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1704
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like the silly one,</v>

1705
01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.910
<v Speaker 4>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that the more educated someone</v>

1706
01:25:07.911 --> 01:25:09.800
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the less kids they have.</v>

1707
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.990
<v Speaker 4>So as soon as you do that you go,</v>

1708
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:13.890
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1709
01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.400
<v Speaker 4>All the smart people don't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1710
01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:22.610
<v Speaker 4>And everybody that's poor as poor kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like that's why another reason why we</v>

1711
01:25:22.621 --> 01:25:24.060
<v Speaker 4>have to educate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1712
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:29.930
<v Speaker 4>the counter to overpopulation that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at the charts and graphs that</v>

1713
01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:30.860
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1714
01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:35.490
<v Speaker 4>in industrialized nations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they become more closer to the</v>

1715
01:25:35.491 --> 01:25:38.190
<v Speaker 4>first world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have less children.</v>

1716
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.230
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:41.880
<v Speaker 4>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're also puck and working more</v>

1718
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:45.000
<v Speaker 4>grinding son necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1719
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 4>My might be better off being poor with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of kids and be happy.</v>

1720
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.850
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know that the most likely time to</v>

1721
01:25:50.851 --> 01:25:53.550
<v Speaker 4>get to a shooting is in a chase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1722
01:25:53.551 --> 01:25:55.920
<v Speaker 4>So we owe chase story and we should</v>
<v Speaker 4>lighten this up a little bit.</v>

1723
01:25:55.921 --> 01:25:56.754
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's.</v>

1724
01:25:56.850 --> 01:26:01.850
<v Speaker 4>So this is a story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the story that we just got</v>

1725
01:26:02.311 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>sidetracked from</v>

1726
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 2>the first conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the middle of talking about it.</v>

1727
01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>We never got to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1728
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking Jamie and I earlier</v>

1729
01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>about it would probably be pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can probably pull this up on street</v>

1730
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 2>maps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's go to the 1800 block of West</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to tell the story if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could get my bearings right because it</v>

1770
01:28:08.581 --> 01:28:10.260
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem like I'm going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pull it off.</v>

1771
01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:11.430
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1772
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just tell the story.</v>

1773
01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:18.420
<v Speaker 2>So one of my favorite times ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best night ever had as a cop,</v>

1774
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:24.870
<v Speaker 2>we were working in major case squad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had been assigned a new vr.</v>

1775
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a violent repeat offender</v>

1776
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.780
<v Speaker 2>target to go after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear a lot of these in,</v>

1777
01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:33.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot of chiefs are starting to push</v>
<v Speaker 2>this out again,</v>

1778
01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.070
<v Speaker 2>which is the violent repeat offender</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have people with um,</v>

1779
01:28:38.370 --> 01:28:40.950
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do like this predictiveness that</v>

1780
01:28:40.951 --> 01:28:44.400
<v Speaker 2>these are the people that were likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get shot or likely to do shootings or</v>

1781
01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:45.234
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1782
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.210
<v Speaker 2>So we want to focus all of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement efforts on them to get them</v>

1783
01:28:48.211 --> 01:28:50.880
<v Speaker 2>on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

1784
01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.130
<v Speaker 2>But regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was doing at the time.</v>

1785
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
<v Speaker 2>And we had a guy set up to the bar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the bar and we knew that this gang go</v>

1786
01:29:01.411 --> 01:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>in and out of this bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had a guy sit in,</v>

1787
01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:07.830
<v Speaker 2>covert in a van and watch the bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>

1788
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 2>our whole intent was to take pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take pictures,</v>

1789
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:14.130
<v Speaker 2>document who is going in and try and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>some associations.</v>

1790
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>And me and another car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were hiding away,</v>

1791
01:29:18.601 --> 01:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>just waiting to see what he reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we could follow somebody,</v>

1792
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking and I spent hours.</v>

1793
01:29:25.831 --> 01:29:30.831
<v Speaker 2>We're on like our 10 sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing going on and we had a secure</v>

1794
01:29:30.961 --> 01:29:34.380
<v Speaker 2>channel so we could just talk back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth on our radio and they're talking</v>

1795
01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:35.690
<v Speaker 2>about sports or something.</v>

1796
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Had to be soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball because it was so nice to give</v>

1797
01:29:37.381 --> 01:29:40.590
<v Speaker 2>a shit about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's bitching,</v>

1798
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.230
<v Speaker 2>going back on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk and trying to pass the time.</v>

1799
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:45.990
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy watching and covert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1800
01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:47.700
<v Speaker 2>finally here and coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1801
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you shut the fuck up?</v>

1802
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're robbing the store next to me</v>

1803
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.100
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching them.</v>

1804
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I could see that it's a silver 38 into</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude's hand robbing the store.</v>

1805
01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up and get over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're like,</v>

1806
01:29:58.770 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1807
01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:02.010
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's calling it out and these guys</v>

1808
01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get into a getaway car and go</v>

1809
01:30:04.771 --> 01:30:09.771
<v Speaker 2>around the block and we get behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're following them and they know</v>

1810
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 2>this is a fresh robbery and so they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand guns in the car and everything.</v>

1811
01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Do they know you're following?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1812
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So we have our cars and we're following</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind him and we're in this area where</v>

1813
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 2>you have the one district to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the west,</v>

1814
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.510
<v Speaker 2>the southwest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the western district in north</v>

1815
01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>and the southern till left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they called the Tri district but</v>

1816
01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:31.860
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of in this area where</v>
<v Speaker 2>communications are going to be weird</v>

1817
01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:33.300
<v Speaker 2>because these are all different</v>
<v Speaker 2>channels.</v>

1818
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.840
<v Speaker 2>So I'm riding with the sergeant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a detective at the time and say to</v>

1819
01:30:39.091 --> 01:30:40.270
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1820
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get on southern channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get on a southwest and coordinate</v>

1821
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:45.810
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can call this out.</v>

1822
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.270
<v Speaker 2>So I get on the radio and I'm calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1823
01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I need a 10:31,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1824
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:52.920
<v Speaker 2>on the southern channel and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps talking.</v>

1825
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to follow him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need a 10:31 on the southern channel.</v>

1826
01:30:56.371 --> 01:30:58.530
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck don't they shut up?</v>

1827
01:30:58.530 --> 01:30:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

1828
01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:01.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like the 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>33 fucking asshole,</v>

1829
01:31:01.861 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 2>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1830
01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So I'll get on radio 10:30 to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>31 is to this day three is an emergency.</v>

1831
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 2>So I get on there and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're calling it out the car going</v>

1832
01:31:14.521 --> 01:31:17.430
<v Speaker 2>westbound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lombard and where we're following it and</v>

1833
01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:21.360
<v Speaker 2>we're coming up to the shopping center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns left on Thompson or the cars full</v>

1834
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:23.760
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets to the,</v>

1835
01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:26.670
<v Speaker 2>goes through the shopping center and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>stops at a stop sign,</v>

1836
01:31:26.671 --> 01:31:29.310
<v Speaker 2>but there's a car in front of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking,</v>

1837
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to light it up here.</v>

1838
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:35.220
<v Speaker 2>But that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it always moves right soon as we</v>

1839
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:36.054
<v Speaker 2>hit the lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1840
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:41.330
<v Speaker 2>you can bet that car is going to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had the lights anyway and the car</v>

1841
01:31:41.551 --> 01:31:46.370
<v Speaker 2>stops in the front row so they can't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>past right.</v>

1842
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:50.790
<v Speaker 2>So they all bail out a one run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's four people in the car.</v>

1843
01:31:50.791 --> 01:31:52.830
<v Speaker 2>One goes one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one goes back the other way,</v>

1844
01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:56.250
<v Speaker 2>one goes for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one goes behind and I jump out of the</v>

1845
01:31:56.251 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 2>car because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

1846
01:32:00.330 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I leave my radio by accident and I</v>

1847
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>drop it because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest,</v>

1848
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a guy running with a gun out of a</v>

1849
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:12.310
<v Speaker 2>car and I'm still like in Jack Rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowed,</v>

1850
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>you know I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going on.</v>

1851
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That's when people shoot people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1852
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting him.</v>

1853
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:20.770
<v Speaker 2>So I take off without the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without my radio chasing.</v>

1854
01:32:20.771 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>This dude going behind the shopping</v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

1855
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.400
<v Speaker 2>The sergeant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he forgot to put the car in park so he</v>

1856
01:32:27.401 --> 01:32:30.520
<v Speaker 2>knows I don't have my radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He starting to panic about where I'm</v>

1857
01:32:30.521 --> 01:32:33.550
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to dive back into the car to put</v>

1858
01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:36.610
<v Speaker 2>it on park so it doesn't hit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspect's car.</v>

1859
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And then the non suspect car in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1860
01:32:40.130 --> 01:32:43.810
<v Speaker 2>the everybody goes running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm chasing behind him and I've got my</v>

1861
01:32:43.811 --> 01:32:45.570
<v Speaker 2>gun out and I'm running and I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1862
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:47.850
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking shoot Yo.</v>

1863
01:32:47.851 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 2>You better stop now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I could tell he eat when he's</v>

1864
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:53.860
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking pure panic.</v>

1865
01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a moment of empathy for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could.</v>

1866
01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.860
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck fuck,</v>

1867
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:00.880
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1868
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Running with that gun in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1869
01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better drop it,</v>

1870
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:08.110
<v Speaker 2>but running some guy comes out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woods for behind the shopping center.</v>

1871
01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking cop from the southwest</v>
<v Speaker 2>who heard us on the radio plainclothes</v>

1872
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:16.450
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy froze the gun and he tries to</v>

1873
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:17.920
<v Speaker 2>throw it up onto the roof of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

1874
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:22.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's pathetically just hits the</v>
<v Speaker 2>building and staff at,</v>

1875
01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:24.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy coming out of the woods.</v>

1876
01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I yelled at him to get him while I run</v>
<v Speaker 2>it back,</v>

1877
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.070
<v Speaker 2>go back and get the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get the gun first.</v>

1878
01:33:29.071 --> 01:33:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're smart because that could end</v>

1879
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:32.470
<v Speaker 2>up with somebody else's hands or or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1880
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:36.520
<v Speaker 2>And we'll get him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so at that moment,</v>

1881
01:33:36.521 --> 01:33:40.180
<v Speaker 2>unbeknownst to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those districts were like all</v>

1882
01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:43.360
<v Speaker 2>coordinators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this moment of serendipity and</v>

1883
01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:46.300
<v Speaker 2>policing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>southern district patrol came up and got</v>

1884
01:33:46.301 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys and like Western patrol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got one of the guys and southwest</v>

1885
01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:52.390
<v Speaker 2>commander was in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there and that drug unit was there</v>

1886
01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 2>helping me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we caught every single person,</v>

1887
01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:58.030
<v Speaker 2>bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got like four guns.</v>

1888
01:33:58.230 --> 01:34:03.230
<v Speaker 2>We get everything rolling them over</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people we were looking for by</v>

1889
01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:09.250
<v Speaker 2>mere coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a gag that we were looking for to</v>

1890
01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:14.251
<v Speaker 2>go into the Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>robbed the store that was next to our</v>

1891
01:34:14.261 --> 01:34:17.950
<v Speaker 2>guy in covert and we started our case</v>
<v Speaker 2>there which ended up being completely</v>

1892
01:34:17.951 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 2>successful because we had this huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumpstart of just dumb ass luck.</v>

1893
01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.310
<v Speaker 2>That does sound like dumb ass luck</v>
<v Speaker 2>because called 10:31 AM,</v>

1894
01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 2>10:33,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot to put the car in park.</v>

1895
01:34:28.721 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 2>You left your radio behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's typical,</v>

1896
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the way it is and that's a</v>

1897
01:34:33.011 --> 01:34:36.610
<v Speaker 2>situation where you do shoot like people</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot in that situation,</v>

1898
01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been there.</v>

1899
01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Who you haven't been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who they are.</v>

1900
01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:47.170
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twitter trolls and stuff or people</v>

1901
01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:49.070
<v Speaker 2>who want to get credit to other cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1902
01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1903
01:34:49.961 --> 01:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>you're just talking about Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never actually done anything.</v>

1904
01:34:52.661 --> 01:34:55.510
<v Speaker 2>What did you actually do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the situations where you</v>

1905
01:34:55.511 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 2>get into these shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1906
01:34:57.651 --> 01:35:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Where you could have easily shot that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was running with a gun and</v>

1907
01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:05.130
<v Speaker 2>that's what the statistics show happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the time that would have</v>

1908
01:35:05.131 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 2>dramatically affected me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically affected him and everyone</v>

1909
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:09.884
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1910
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 2>But what this kid was doing in the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being part of a drug deal,</v>

1911
01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.140
<v Speaker 2>trying to do robberies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to fucking eat and survive and</v>

1912
01:35:20.691 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 2>yet we had those guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have this poverty and you have</v>

1913
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:30.101
<v Speaker 2>this fighting for resources and so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>chose that to rob the store and to being</v>

1914
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:34.130
<v Speaker 2>in these gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they didn't have those guns,</v>

1915
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:38.360
<v Speaker 2>how differently would that have been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably quite a bit.</v>

1916
01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1917
01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.950
<v Speaker 2>So when you talk about saturation</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly,</v>

1918
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.440
<v Speaker 2>look in that incident we got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything went fine and it had</v>

1919
01:35:45.441 --> 01:35:48.380
<v Speaker 2>potential to ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily we were all competent in that</v>

1920
01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:50.870
<v Speaker 2>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sorta thanks.</v>

1921
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I was the youngest one was the rookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut Me some slack,</v>

1922
01:35:55.460 --> 01:36:00.460
<v Speaker 2>but you had 30 guns going around in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and it's just like,</v>

1923
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't.</v>

1924
01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Like England doesn't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see other countries like this</v>

1925
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:11.480
<v Speaker 2>where this all could have just went</v>
<v Speaker 2>bonkers because we're trying to respond</v>

1926
01:36:11.481 --> 01:36:16.481
<v Speaker 2>to a situation in a way go after people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put them in cells because we have</v>

1927
01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guns everywhere,</v>

1928
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:20.570
<v Speaker 2>and they're fighting for these</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

1929
01:36:20.571 --> 01:36:21.980
<v Speaker 2>but that's where we have to stop and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1930
01:36:21.981 --> 01:36:23.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are they here?</v>

1931
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:27.260
<v Speaker 2>What got us to this point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

1932
01:36:27.261 --> 01:36:31.490
<v Speaker 2>what we continue to do is we just throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>that group into jail and the very next</v>

1933
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:33.500
<v Speaker 2>time it took us like six months to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole group down.</v>

1934
01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:36.740
<v Speaker 2>We've got everybody federally indicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as we do that,</v>

1935
01:36:36.741 --> 01:36:40.660
<v Speaker 2>the next group just steps up because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't take a moment to look at the</v>

1936
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:41.541
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1937
01:36:41.541 --> 01:36:42.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old argument,</v>

1938
01:36:42.741 --> 01:36:45.200
<v Speaker 2>if you outlaw guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only outlaws will have guns.</v>

1939
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1940
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's circular logic to it is,</v>

1941
01:36:49.881 --> 01:36:53.960
<v Speaker 2>but when you're dealing with a supply</v>
<v Speaker 2>that already exists in the hundreds of</v>

1942
01:36:53.961 --> 01:36:56.120
<v Speaker 2>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty logical actually.</v>

1943
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1944
01:36:57.801 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to go door to door and dig</v>

1945
01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:03.320
<v Speaker 2>into people's basements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you make guns illegal,</v>

1946
01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.990
<v Speaker 2>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the only people that have guns are</v>

1947
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 2>law abiding people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1948
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.790
<v Speaker 2>No?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And completely legal.</v>

1949
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Completely legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why what you mean?</v>

1950
01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's a circular logic.</v>

1951
01:37:15.810 --> 01:37:18.080
<v Speaker 2>So because those are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The criminals are still criminals.</v>

1952
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Even if the guns are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not everyone's on a law abiding</v>

1953
01:37:22.011 --> 01:37:24.500
<v Speaker 2>citizen that has a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you give a gun to a criminal,</v>

1954
01:37:25.190 --> 01:37:28.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have the law in place</v>

1955
01:37:28.371 --> 01:37:31.220
<v Speaker 2>to make it criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing we're saying,</v>

1956
01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:34.640
<v Speaker 2>well only bad guys will have guns if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>outlaw them.</v>

1957
01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

1958
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:38.900
<v Speaker 2>because we outlawed them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>

1959
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:41.600
<v Speaker 2>it's circular logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we have the law first,</v>

1960
01:37:41.601 --> 01:37:43.550
<v Speaker 2>because you're not changing the gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>ownership,</v>

1961
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:45.230
<v Speaker 2>you're just changing the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1962
01:37:45.231 --> 01:37:47.990
<v Speaker 2>But you're already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've already made it illegal for people</v>

1963
01:37:47.991 --> 01:37:52.530
<v Speaker 2>that are felons to possess firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:54.740
<v Speaker 2>But when you have that level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturation,</v>

1965
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 2>obviously it doesn't work.</v>

1966
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it gets back to the same issue.</v>

1967
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 4>Like how would you ever pass?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like trying to get,</v>

1968
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:03.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like taking a bucket of water and</v>

1969
01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 4>thrown it into the ocean and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that fresh water out.</v>

1970
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you get out the guns that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are in the stop adding salt so we can't</v>

1971
01:38:12.511 --> 01:38:16.950
<v Speaker 4>instantly solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just have to stop doing it the wrong</v>

1972
01:38:16.951 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the drug war.</v>

1973
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:21.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been into the drug war so you</v>

1974
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:23.040
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without a doubt it doesn't work.</v>

1975
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:25.800
<v Speaker 4>But what are we still doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like it's,</v>

1976
01:38:25.810 --> 01:38:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I know we're slowly moving away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1977
01:38:27.331 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we should stop right now.</v>

1978
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:33.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean like you can literally just</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped it just as quickly as we started</v>

1979
01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:34.380
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can say okay,</v>

1980
01:38:34.381 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to imprison people for</v>
<v Speaker 4>those offenses.</v>

1981
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:40.170
<v Speaker 4>If they get into crime and they shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>

1982
01:38:40.171 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 4>well then go after them for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting.</v>

1983
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:47.040
<v Speaker 4>But what we do is we put that law in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and we make it,</v>

1984
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with like we're creating this,</v>

1985
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 4>we know what's wrong and we know to just</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop this.</v>

1986
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:53.460
<v Speaker 4>So with the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1987
01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:58.461
<v Speaker 4>if he just stopped manufacturing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get somewhere if you just stopped</v>

1988
01:38:58.741 --> 01:39:02.340
<v Speaker 4>locking people up for the drug war were</v>
<v Speaker 4>get somewhere and improving that.</v>

1989
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 4>But we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just keep doing the scenes.</v>

1990
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 4>So it's been a year since I was here and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we discussed these drug war issues.</v>

1991
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.110
<v Speaker 4>We haven't really moved the bar much</v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

1992
01:39:13.111 --> 01:39:16.890
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that it is up for ballot</v>
<v Speaker 4>and several different states.</v>

1993
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.840
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course not,</v>

1994
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:23.900
<v Speaker 4>not other drugs and slowly but surely it</v>
<v Speaker 4>will become legal throughout the United</v>

1995
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:26.580
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely now Washington DC is legal.</v>

1996
01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:30.060
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of places that are illegal</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that weren't legal before and then</v>

1997
01:39:30.061 --> 01:39:32.970
<v Speaker 4>it's on the ballot in November in</v>
<v Speaker 4>California and several other states.</v>

1998
01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:37.971
<v Speaker 4>I believe that other states as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But ca marijuana is just one really</v>

1999
01:39:39.301 --> 01:39:41.520
<v Speaker 4>benign law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really,</v>

2000
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:44.370
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a rather benign substance in many</v>

2001
01:39:44.371 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2002
01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:48.210
<v Speaker 4>it's not a dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a real threat or harm to</v>

2003
01:39:48.211 --> 01:39:51.150
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guns are way more dangerous.</v>

2004
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So moving that,</v>

2005
01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.770
<v Speaker 4>changing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're creating that,</v>

2006
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we create the guns are being used</v>

2007
01:39:58.981 --> 01:40:00.400
<v Speaker 4>because of the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2008
01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:05.250
<v Speaker 4>And then we have people that are dying</v>
<v Speaker 4>of heroin overdoses because of the drug</v>

2009
01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:08.040
<v Speaker 4>war and notice we've had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>improvements when people were dying of a</v>

2010
01:40:08.041 --> 01:40:10.500
<v Speaker 4>heroin overdose is now that it's in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts and stuff.</v>

2011
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Massachusetts?</v>

2012
01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Way are like the cops aren't arresting.</v>

2013
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.840
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a chief there that decided he</v>

2014
01:40:18.841 --> 01:40:22.530
<v Speaker 4>was going to be smart and he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to lock up the heroin users.</v>

2015
01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:25.680
<v Speaker 4>He was going to get them into treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] has had excellent success</v>

2016
01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.160
<v Speaker 4>with the heroin problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a one on one of those cnn shows</v>

2017
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.290
<v Speaker 4>was detailing what actually went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went down.</v>

2018
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was Anthony Bourdain show.</v>

2019
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:39.390
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about how what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what really happened was so many people</v>

2020
01:40:39.391 --> 01:40:44.391
<v Speaker 4>got addicted to Oxycontin is because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>prescription drug companies pushing that</v>

2021
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:46.510
<v Speaker 4>shit where people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2022
01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.740
<v Speaker 4>when people are like little small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>minor injuries and they're prescribing</v>

2023
01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 4>pills that are opiates and highly</v>
<v Speaker 4>addictive.</v>

2024
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.650
<v Speaker 2>They're no different than heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2025
01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean like literally their heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:40:58.230 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 2>And so that's money in politics issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2027
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.450
<v Speaker 2>we're not fighting the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those drug dealers who are getting</v>

2028
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:09.010
<v Speaker 2>everybody hooked on heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're fighting the drug dealers that are</v>

2029
01:41:09.011 --> 01:41:09.844
<v Speaker 2>in the city still.</v>

2030
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a gigantic issue of course.</v>

2031
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then these people,</v>

2032
01:41:14.091 --> 01:41:17.060
<v Speaker 1>when they started to crack down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin's,</v>

2033
01:41:17.150 --> 01:41:21.290
<v Speaker 1>that is when heroin moved in to take its</v>
<v Speaker 1>place because these people are sick.</v>

2034
01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.960
<v Speaker 1>They needed their pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get their pill.</v>

2035
01:41:23.961 --> 01:41:25.340
<v Speaker 1>So then they got heroin instead</v>

2036
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:27.360
<v Speaker 2>rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2037
01:41:27.361 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2038
01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 2>so to move onto some reform measures are</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's being shown in the last year.</v>

2039
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2040
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2041
01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.930
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about what happened as the</v>

2042
01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:39.390
<v Speaker 2>years gone on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2043
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:41.730
<v Speaker 2>after I left here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2044
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 2>obviously people picked up and I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2045
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Joe Rogan effect that they,</v>

2046
01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody always talks about after they</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to you,</v>

2047
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:53.350
<v Speaker 2>other people started to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went back to Baltimore,</v>

2048
01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:58.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his dude sends me an email and it</v>

2049
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:03.040
<v Speaker 2>says they arrange it through leap that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to come visit me and he wants</v>

2050
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 2>to talk about a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

2051
01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:10.790
<v Speaker 2>And so he calls so they corrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would get you and we talk about some</v>

2052
01:42:11.171 --> 01:42:14.980
<v Speaker 2>of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very good movie idea that he as trying</v>

2053
01:42:14.981 --> 01:42:18.130
<v Speaker 2>to kind of put some of these things into</v>
<v Speaker 2>an emotional appeal that people can</v>

2054
01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.960
<v Speaker 2>understand and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and comes close to them.</v>

2055
01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.830
<v Speaker 2>But what that did was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

2056
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:27.910
<v Speaker 2>it pushed me to get more involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore so I could get the other</v>

2057
01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:34.360
<v Speaker 2>people involved in the project that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have good ideas and would really</v>

2058
01:42:34.361 --> 01:42:38.230
<v Speaker 2>know the streets well and with know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>activism path and what was going on with</v>

2059
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:39.760
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter and everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2060
01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And so I reached out to a bunch of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>activists and we started forming these</v>

2061
01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:48.280
<v Speaker 2>tight knit groups and come to find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude doing the movie is matthew</v>

2062
01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:50.740
<v Speaker 2>costs of Itch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if he's going to do it</v>

2063
01:42:50.741 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 2>yet or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like this big star in France.</v>

2064
01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:56.170
<v Speaker 2>And thinking about doing a sequel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving me.</v>

2065
01:42:56.171 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He may call Lehane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really talks about these kinds of</v>

2066
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:02.110
<v Speaker 2>things in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>France had very similar hyper</v>

2067
01:43:02.111 --> 01:43:05.200
<v Speaker 2>segregation problems and ghettoization</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>

2068
01:43:05.201 --> 01:43:10.201
<v Speaker 2>And ended up having riots and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did a lot to fix it and that's what</v>

2069
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:13.450
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of doing like a 20 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>reunion of that.</v>

2070
01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:19.260
<v Speaker 2>But getting involved in Baltimore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting everybody I really have been</v>

2071
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:24.631
<v Speaker 2>like in a school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a of understanding of what the</v>

2072
01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:29.600
<v Speaker 2>cities need and what people are trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight for,</v>

2073
01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.800
<v Speaker 2>what the black lives matter movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>really means.</v>

2074
01:43:32.850 --> 01:43:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2075
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had all of those preconceived notions</v>

2076
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.090
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2077
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.570
<v Speaker 2>being a white hero kind of thing where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go and you help and like your</v>

2078
01:43:43.571 --> 01:43:48.190
<v Speaker 2>bringing your skills down and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize the things you're saying and how</v>

2079
01:43:48.191 --> 01:43:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you play into privilege and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2080
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:54.560
<v Speaker 2>And getting them going in there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2081
01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2082
01:43:56.790 --> 01:44:01.340
<v Speaker 2>my walls against Muslims got got torn</v>
<v Speaker 2>down because I ended up meeting Muslim</v>

2083
01:44:01.341 --> 01:44:06.341
<v Speaker 2>activists who were really treat using</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion to do the right things,</v>

2084
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:08.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good things,</v>

2085
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:13.871
<v Speaker 2>the selective of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but getting involved in the movement to</v>

2086
01:44:14.691 --> 01:44:19.310
<v Speaker 2>the point where we're having these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these groups and we're doing things</v>

2087
01:44:19.311 --> 01:44:20.144
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2088
01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.440
<v Speaker 2>having panel discussions.</v>

2089
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.650
<v Speaker 2>And we did like a stop and Frisk for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people so that they would see what it</v>

2090
01:44:24.651 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 2>was like to actually have somebody come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up on you and search through your</v>

2091
01:44:28.401 --> 01:44:31.460
<v Speaker 2>pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've been doing documentaries,</v>

2092
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been doing protesting where</v>

2093
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:38.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a met this lady Twanda Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who her brother was killed by Baltimore</v>

2094
01:44:38.691 --> 01:44:43.160
<v Speaker 2>police officers a couple of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's been protesting every single</v>

2095
01:44:43.161 --> 01:44:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday for two and a half years</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting for her brother,</v>

2096
01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:48.940
<v Speaker 2>tyrone west and I guess why they do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Wednesdays.</v>

2097
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2098
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:54.050
<v Speaker 2>he was beaten to death by Baltimore</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops,</v>

2099
01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:57.470
<v Speaker 2>like literally beaten to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wanted to have things like where</v>

2100
01:44:57.471 --> 01:45:00.470
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we have people protesting</v>

2101
01:45:00.471 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it always got to be like burning</v>

2102
01:45:02.301 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 2>down the cvs or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas all the good people and like I</v>

2103
01:45:05.751 --> 01:45:09.620
<v Speaker 2>was just flabbergasted that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in,</v>

2104
01:45:09.630 --> 01:45:12.260
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what everyone thinks is the worst of</v>

2105
01:45:12.261 --> 01:45:15.410
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just filled with people trying to do</v>

2106
01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:19.520
<v Speaker 2>the right thing and trying to fight for</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice and doing it in the most</v>

2107
01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:20.090
<v Speaker 2>peaceful manner.</v>

2108
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Her brother was beaten to death by cops</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what she does is peacefully protest</v>

2109
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 2>every Wednesday for two and a half years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't get any attention for that</v>

2110
01:45:27.891 --> 01:45:32.450
<v Speaker 2>when they have other cops that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>those same cops beat this guy,</v>

2111
01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Abdul Salaam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2112
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:38.900
<v Speaker 2>in front of his kid doing the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of aggressive enforcement and it.</v>

2113
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.580
<v Speaker 2>But it opens up a kind of winded way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>going about it is I got to see the other</v>

2114
01:45:43.581 --> 01:45:48.581
<v Speaker 2>side and that really has affected me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That being a cop,</v>

2115
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 2>you lock them up and you put them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cell or are you taking the court and</v>

2116
01:45:53.631 --> 01:45:58.631
<v Speaker 2>the case goes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think about what that does on</v>

2117
01:45:58.701 --> 01:46:00.680
<v Speaker 2>the other end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never see.</v>

2118
01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And then I got involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities and I saw the other side.</v>

2119
01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I saw what it was like for a guy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back from being in prison in</v>

2120
01:46:08.781 --> 01:46:13.781
<v Speaker 2>solitary confinement for three years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having no hopes of of resources like not</v>

2121
01:46:14.331 --> 01:46:18.250
<v Speaker 2>getting them jobs and having to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get anything because he had that</v>

2122
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:22.160
<v Speaker 2>that record you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to see that those people you</v>

2123
01:46:22.161 --> 01:46:24.410
<v Speaker 2>locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have families who were</v>

2124
01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 2>profoundly affected by everything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and they're gone for these</v>

2125
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:30.950
<v Speaker 2>years and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a really like</v>

2126
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I get like aggressive and when we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about these conversations about</v>

2127
01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 2>guns and like because those deaths on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other side of that equation,</v>

2128
01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.430
<v Speaker 2>that should became real as compete to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2129
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Like those are people now that I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know the families of the people</v>

2130
01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 2>who were on the other side of that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really pushing that.</v>

2131
01:46:51.721 --> 01:46:53.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2132
01:46:53.031 --> 01:46:55.560
<v Speaker 2>we need to just really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys stop being these tribal</v>

2133
01:46:55.561 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 2>creatures that can only see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fellow humans that are right with</v>

2134
01:46:59.911 --> 01:47:02.100
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we associate as being our team.</v>

2135
01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Like we're all that team and we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to start having empathy.</v>

2136
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 2>For what these things do to other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have to see this.</v>

2137
01:47:08.941 --> 01:47:13.941
<v Speaker 2>Cops don't see what their actions do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to step up and say,</v>

2138
01:47:14.161 --> 01:47:15.630
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't be doing this.</v>

2139
01:47:15.631 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 2>We have to get out of this denial bubble</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being involved in the city has just</v>

2140
01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:24.951
<v Speaker 2>given me this huge check on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on all my privileges and everything that</v>

2141
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:29.940
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand how much advantages</v>

2142
01:47:29.941 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 2>we have in life.</v>

2143
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of factors that people have</v>

2144
01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 2>to fight against that we can't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>register.</v>

2145
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:40.410
<v Speaker 2>And this is all fairly new to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

2146
01:47:40.411 --> 01:47:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it evidentially,</v>

2147
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:47.370
<v Speaker 2>but to see it in person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the work that.</v>

2148
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:49.320
<v Speaker 2>So the photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devin Allen,</v>

2149
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 2>pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devin Allen,</v>

2150
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:56.010
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took a picture of my daughter that's</v>

2151
01:47:56.250 --> 01:48:01.250
<v Speaker 2>from a protest it's going to be in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing this project now where he</v>

2152
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:06.270
<v Speaker 2>took the time magazine cover shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you ever saw the time magazine</v>

2153
01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:10.410
<v Speaker 2>during the uprising or it says 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>68 and it's crossed out and says 2016,</v>

2154
01:48:10.411 --> 01:48:15.330
<v Speaker 2>because he took that picture as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a a young black kid that used to be a</v>

2155
01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:19.620
<v Speaker 2>drug dealer who picked up a camera as</v>
<v Speaker 2>his identity project kind of thing.</v>

2156
01:48:19.621 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what an identity project</v>
<v Speaker 2>was at that time.</v>

2157
01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:23.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what identity project was</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time,</v>

2158
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but he picked up the camera and started</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking pictures and he got that picture</v>

2159
01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:32.720
<v Speaker 2>and he's well known now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he did was he took that and now</v>

2160
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:38.240
<v Speaker 2>he used the publicity from all that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets this Devin Allen.</v>

2161
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:43.980
<v Speaker 2>He gets all these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started this project that this</v>

2162
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:48.981
<v Speaker 2>community development called Penn north</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he collects cameras now for all</v>

2163
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:52.200
<v Speaker 2>these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that he's getting paid.</v>

2164
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 2>He collects cameras from around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2165
01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:58.860
<v Speaker 2>brings it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now he runs a thing going through in</v>

2166
01:48:58.861 --> 01:49:00.840
<v Speaker 2>sandtown winchester where Freddie gray</v>
<v Speaker 2>was killed.</v>

2167
01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 2>He takes the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes those kids in and teach them</v>

2168
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:07.830
<v Speaker 2>photography and gives them that project</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have something they can grip</v>

2169
01:49:07.831 --> 01:49:10.950
<v Speaker 2>upon on and they have some they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>build up on.</v>

2170
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:16.050
<v Speaker 2>What was sad about that is that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devin who has no resources.</v>

2171
01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Who is the kid who was a drug dealer who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has everything bothering him and he is</v>

2172
01:49:21.271 --> 01:49:25.560
<v Speaker 2>investing in those communities and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to provide those things to give</v>

2173
01:49:25.561 --> 01:49:28.590
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that identity where they can climb out</v>

2174
01:49:28.591 --> 01:49:32.580
<v Speaker 2>of it and they can become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can see that vision of being a</v>

2175
01:49:32.581 --> 01:49:36.480
<v Speaker 2>contributing member to society and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we all have to do to give</v>

2176
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:39.540
<v Speaker 2>back these neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the way of fixing it is</v>

2177
01:49:39.541 --> 01:49:43.380
<v Speaker 2>if when people want to help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally have to go down there and</v>

2178
01:49:43.381 --> 01:49:46.140
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I help and do things like that?</v>

2179
01:49:46.141 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Because what revealing is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

2180
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.890
<v Speaker 4>all have a skill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His skill is photography,</v>

2181
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:55.870
<v Speaker 4>but your skill is is hunting or comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>or talking or however you want to go.</v>

2182
01:49:55.871 --> 01:50:00.130
<v Speaker 4>You have these skills that you can teach</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can pass on so other people can</v>

2183
01:50:00.131 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 4>see an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people can,</v>

2184
01:50:01.721 --> 01:50:06.721
<v Speaker 4>so some people can do whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all have these skills and that's how</v>

2185
01:50:07.271 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 4>we help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be somebody that helps</v>

2186
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 4>you cities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go down there and you help supply</v>

2187
01:50:12.521 --> 01:50:16.420
<v Speaker 4>that identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could just see how many white knights</v>

2188
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 4>are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going down to the hood right now and</v>

2189
01:50:19.631 --> 01:50:22.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna help gonna just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2190
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucked up now pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like teeth,</v>

2191
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.630
<v Speaker 4>so at Penn north we created this thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2192
01:50:28.631 --> 01:50:30.880
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they created this thing called the safe</v>

2193
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:34.220
<v Speaker 4>zone and what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was all worked out with everybody.</v>

2194
01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 4>You got to treat everybody like humans.</v>

2195
01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:38.380
<v Speaker 4>They worked out with the with the drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealers and everything is going on and</v>

2196
01:50:38.381 --> 01:50:43.360
<v Speaker 4>they participate in keeping this area of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the city completely safe so that</v>

2197
01:50:43.361 --> 01:50:45.510
<v Speaker 4>everybody can come down there and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>

2198
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:47.500
<v Speaker 4>If you go to Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be a white knight,</v>

2199
01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:50.170
<v Speaker 4>you come down and bought bottom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>reach out to an activist and you want to</v>

2200
01:50:50.171 --> 01:50:52.480
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not dangerous.</v>

2201
01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:56.350
<v Speaker 4>You will be fired and there are plenty</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people that will help you and guide</v>

2202
01:50:56.351 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 4>you through and what you can do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>contribute to make our society a more</v>

2203
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:03.100
<v Speaker 4>whole place will obviously Baltimore's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in another side of the country.</v>

2204
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:05.380
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be places around here</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2205
01:51:05.381 --> 01:51:08.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>need some sort of a similar matter where</v>

2206
01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:10.240
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all the same.</v>

2207
01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:15.300
<v Speaker 4>All these cities are saying they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>facing all the same problems and that</v>

2208
01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 4>has helped me build this reform</v>
<v Speaker 4>measures.</v>

2209
01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 4>So my application for Chicago is</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely up.</v>

2210
01:51:21.401 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 4>If you want to pull up my website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Michael Jr net.</v>

2211
01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had you gotten the position in Chicago?</v>

2212
01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:31.360
<v Speaker 4>You were trying to be the police chief</v>
<v Speaker 4>of police in Chicago,</v>

2213
01:51:31.361 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had gotten that position in</v>

2214
01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you do?</v>

2215
01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.240
<v Speaker 4>What is your idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2216
01:51:37.241 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you have a grand plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's 38 pages of that on this,</v>

2217
01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:44.150
<v Speaker 4>but if you could kind of break it down</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us.</v>

2218
01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing we have to do is we have</v>

2219
01:51:47.651 --> 01:51:52.420
<v Speaker 4>to give that power away and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a condition that I have to have</v>

2220
01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 4>in order to take the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I have a friend,</v>

2221
01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.141
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was,</v>

2222
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:57.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually a driver,</v>

2223
01:51:57.551 --> 01:52:02.551
<v Speaker 4>Warren Chicago who's a cop and he told</v>
<v Speaker 4>me that what's going on in Chicago was</v>

2224
01:52:03.851 --> 01:52:08.170
<v Speaker 4>that they had some pretty high level</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug dealers and gang leaders and then</v>

2225
01:52:08.171 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 4>they caught those guys and imprison them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when they imprison them and created</v>

2226
01:52:11.411 --> 01:52:14.860
<v Speaker 4>a power vacuum and in that power vacuum</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the last few years,</v>

2227
01:52:14.861 --> 01:52:19.690
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing significant ramp up in</v>
<v Speaker 4>crime or people try to take over these</v>

2228
01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:24.610
<v Speaker 4>areas that were under controlled by</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people similar to what happens</v>

2229
01:52:24.611 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 4>when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we take over countries like Libya</v>

2230
01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:32.890
<v Speaker 4>creates this power vacuum and now you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a case to almost you say,</v>

2231
01:52:32.891 --> 01:52:35.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worse without Gadhafi than it was</v>

2232
01:52:35.291 --> 01:52:36.124
<v Speaker 4>with him.</v>

2233
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:40.630
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of what this guy was telling</v>
<v Speaker 4>me about Chicago.</v>

2234
01:52:40.631 --> 01:52:42.760
<v Speaker 4>Is that accurate as possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2235
01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>one of the big problems with policing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think we</v>

2236
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.970
<v Speaker 2>can narrow things down and we can find a</v>
<v Speaker 2>soul causation,</v>

2237
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:52.380
<v Speaker 2>and there just simply isn't any soul</v>
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>

2238
01:52:52.410 --> 01:52:54.080
<v Speaker 2>There has never sold causation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2239
01:52:54.081 --> 01:52:56.090
<v Speaker 2>When you're dealing with a mass amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human beings,</v>

2240
01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has different reasons.</v>

2241
01:52:57.921 --> 01:52:59.840
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything perfectly.</v>

2242
01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:04.460
<v Speaker 2>And those things can happen perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible that it could have happened.</v>

2243
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:09.850
<v Speaker 2>A weird theory that I've started to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize is that actually in this</v>

2244
01:53:11.271 --> 01:53:12.290
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2245
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Stefanie Deluca study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk a lot about how these kids are</v>

2246
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>really more passionate now and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to more and you can see that</v>

2247
01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 2>their work ethic is actually higher than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

2248
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:31.910
<v Speaker 2>We think that they're not working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're achieving things at three to</v>

2249
01:53:31.911 --> 01:53:34.640
<v Speaker 2>400 percent of what their parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>

2250
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 2>So these kids are ambitious and so if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any other options around,</v>

2251
01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:43.760
<v Speaker 2>you have a more ambitious population</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's now doing drug dealing and taking</v>

2252
01:53:43.761 --> 01:53:44.600
<v Speaker 2>over territory.</v>

2253
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:47.870
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by they're achieving</v>
<v Speaker 2>things three to 400 percent more than</v>

2254
01:53:47.871 --> 01:53:49.460
<v Speaker 2>their ranks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have.</v>

2255
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:55.330
<v Speaker 2>So the average in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nineties for,</v>

2256
01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:01.460
<v Speaker 2>for high school diplomas in college for</v>
<v Speaker 2>residents of a neighborhood like</v>

2257
01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:03.890
<v Speaker 2>sandtown or these east and West</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore neighborhoods,</v>

2258
01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:07.940
<v Speaker 2>worst that you can imagine in your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as resources go.</v>

2259
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:13.310
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids are actually achieving a.</v>

2260
01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So say their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their parents got 10 percent high school</v>

2261
01:54:16.641 --> 01:54:19.370
<v Speaker 2>diplomas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are getting 40 percent high</v>

2262
01:54:19.371 --> 01:54:24.371
<v Speaker 2>school diplomas that our parents were</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a two percent college degrees.</v>

2263
01:54:24.621 --> 01:54:27.440
<v Speaker 2>These guys are at like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent college degrees.</v>

2264
01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 2>So they're really excelling but they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not achieving because of all these other</v>

2265
01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 2>barriers as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2266
01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy,</v>

2267
01:54:35.931 --> 01:54:40.931
<v Speaker 2>a black guy with a college degree is</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly less likely to be employed than</v>

2268
01:54:41.211 --> 01:54:43.790
<v Speaker 2>a white guy with a high school diploma</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a criminal record.</v>

2269
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:49.010
<v Speaker 2>So even though they're getting these</v>
<v Speaker 2>promises that if they play by the rules,</v>

2270
01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.690
<v Speaker 2>then they're get these things at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

2271
01:54:50.691 --> 01:54:54.580
<v Speaker 2>just like poor white American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>West Virginia is at.</v>

2272
01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:56.780
<v Speaker 2>And w what happens though is there were</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

2273
01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:00.770
<v Speaker 2>They see these examples of with social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media or whatever,</v>

2274
01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and they're understanding that if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>push hard,</v>

2275
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:07.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the told their push hard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve these things,</v>

2276
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:10.520
<v Speaker 2>then they'll get these rewards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not getting these rewards.</v>

2277
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.400
<v Speaker 2>They're just not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a more ambitious</v>

2278
01:55:13.401 --> 01:55:16.520
<v Speaker 2>population and they're turning to drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing and to crime,</v>

2279
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:21.350
<v Speaker 2>well it's just as likely that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>also more ambitious and dedicated to</v>

2280
01:55:21.351 --> 01:55:24.680
<v Speaker 2>their criminal endeavors as they were to</v>
<v Speaker 2>their college achievement.</v>

2281
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're better criminals because</v>

2282
01:55:27.291 --> 01:55:29.390
<v Speaker 2>they're working hard on schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generation improves,</v>

2283
01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:30.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there.</v>

2285
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Is there any improvement in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime rates?</v>

2286
01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are crime is still</v>

2287
01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.620
<v Speaker 2>dramatically dropping and we are.</v>

2288
01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 2>We live in the safest era in human</v>
<v Speaker 2>history right now.</v>

2289
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:46.680
<v Speaker 2>We get caught up in a lot of this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that made sure that's a guy who can</v>

2290
01:55:46.681 --> 01:55:48.990
<v Speaker 2>say it's a weird argument for the gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are they can just say,</v>

2291
01:55:48.991 --> 01:55:51.240
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in the safest environment time in</v>

2292
01:55:51.241 --> 01:55:54.030
<v Speaker 2>history ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have to not get caught up in the</v>

2293
01:55:54.031 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 2>fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

2294
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.290
<v Speaker 2>the odds of things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially compared to the rest of</v>

2295
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:01.080
<v Speaker 2>history because of the sheer numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with.</v>

2296
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Well it would seem like crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of people taking crime if</v>

2297
01:56:06.031 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 2>probably still are about the same and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then or or the amount or the same,</v>

2298
01:56:10.861 --> 01:56:13.440
<v Speaker 2>but the population has grown so you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>

2299
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:16.890
<v Speaker 2>lot less crime percentage wise when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever have before,</v>

2300
01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:21.000
<v Speaker 2>but if your criminals are that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

2301
01:56:21.250 --> 01:56:24.000
<v Speaker 2>but there's still gonna be ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are they that much better?</v>

2302
01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's so much easier to</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch them doing something now than ever</v>

2303
01:56:27.361 --> 01:56:30.270
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than physically catch them but</v>

2304
01:56:30.271 --> 01:56:33.870
<v Speaker 2>mean so much easier to know that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really contrary to evidence.</v>

2305
01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.890
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean homicide clearance rates from the</v>

2306
01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:39.720
<v Speaker 2>eighties were in 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 percent.</v>

2307
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Now they're down to 30 to 45 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that from?</v>

2308
01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's from a breakdown of</v>
<v Speaker 2>community relations because we think</v>

2309
01:56:47.311 --> 01:56:48.780
<v Speaker 2>that comps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comps,</v>

2310
01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:52.560
<v Speaker 2>comps aren't the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The community is always the answer and</v>

2311
01:56:52.561 --> 01:56:55.500
<v Speaker 2>so if you want to solve a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have these good</v>

2312
01:56:55.501 --> 01:56:59.430
<v Speaker 2>relationships with your communities in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order for them to even trust you.</v>

2313
01:56:59.431 --> 01:57:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise the streets are just going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle it themselves,</v>

2314
01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the police don't provide justice will</v>

2315
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:06.270
<v Speaker 2>then they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he can't turn to the police,</v>

2316
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:09.540
<v Speaker 2>that's another factor you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's tons of factors in here and a</v>

2317
01:57:09.541 --> 01:57:12.090
<v Speaker 2>lot of arguments can be made for what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2318
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:17.390
<v Speaker 2>but the conviction rate has dropped</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically and the homicide clearance</v>

2319
01:57:17.761 --> 01:57:18.990
<v Speaker 2>rate has dropped dramatically.</v>

2320
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Police are not solving crimes at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate they used to.</v>

2321
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Now when you look at an area like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago that has a lot of violence</v>

2322
01:57:25.981 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 2>connected to the drug war or to the drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade,</v>

2323
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I should say illegal drug selling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also resources to those.</v>

2324
01:57:34.501 --> 01:57:38.010
<v Speaker 2>So the drug trade fulfills in for lack</v>
<v Speaker 2>of priests of very good point.</v>

2325
01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's a point that doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed that often.</v>

2326
01:57:39.991 --> 01:57:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

2327
01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:42.540
<v Speaker 2>that's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2328
01:57:42.541 --> 01:57:45.990
<v Speaker 2>what can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you have done had you got</v>

2329
01:57:45.991 --> 01:57:50.660
<v Speaker 2>that position as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I have to do here,</v>

2330
01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:53.540
<v Speaker 2>here's my model and my fundamental model</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2331
01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.760
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you had a business and you</v>

2332
01:57:56.761 --> 01:57:58.380
<v Speaker 2>have a board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2333
01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your board of trustees or</v>

2334
01:58:00.151 --> 01:58:04.590
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a civilian leader of the</v>

2335
01:58:04.591 --> 01:58:07.360
<v Speaker 2>police department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a CEO and I wouldn't have like</v>

2336
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.630
<v Speaker 2>officially 49 percent of the power of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the agency.</v>

2337
01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And then we have like seven people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this panel who come from the city who</v>

2338
01:58:13.831 --> 01:58:15.270
<v Speaker 2>live in these neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2339
01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 2>not sure precisely how we pick them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't appoint them because then they</v>

2340
01:58:19.111 --> 01:58:21.170
<v Speaker 2>just become cronies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2341
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:25.290
<v Speaker 2>we have some issues with voting that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have to work out the details on,</v>

2342
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.510
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate principles that we would</v>

2343
01:58:27.511 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of that board would be from</v>

2344
01:58:29.731 --> 01:58:34.080
<v Speaker 2>the poorest of the neighborhoods around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would create a board and what</v>

2345
01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:37.530
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be the picking criteria to</v>

2346
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:40.230
<v Speaker 2>create this board?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be you and other police</v>

2347
01:58:40.231 --> 01:58:41.320
<v Speaker 2>officers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would be.</v>

2348
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>This should</v>

2349
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 5>be the civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it has to be the peons pick the</v>

2350
01:58:44.471 --> 01:58:45.540
<v Speaker 5>people that are on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2351
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:47.020
<v Speaker 5>I think we would have to pick them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2352
01:58:47.070 --> 01:58:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to have a vote.</v>

2353
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:51.180
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that fault completely</v>

2354
01:58:51.181 --> 01:58:52.014
<v Speaker 2>outright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2355
01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the majority has to come from the</v>

2356
01:58:53.761 --> 01:58:56.820
<v Speaker 2>poor populations covering the base of</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever is good for the weakest among</v>

2357
01:58:56.821 --> 01:59:00.540
<v Speaker 2>us is good for the strongest among us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then those boards,</v>

2358
01:59:00.541 --> 01:59:05.100
<v Speaker 2>while I run the agency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only argue to them they have 51</v>

2359
01:59:05.101 --> 01:59:08.580
<v Speaker 2>percent of the control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all these things I want to argue</v>

2360
01:59:08.581 --> 01:59:12.600
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's fundamentally not my agency.</v>

2361
01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you would almost give most of the</v>

2362
01:59:15.771 --> 01:59:20.771
<v Speaker 5>control to the rest of the people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would work with you.</v>

2363
01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:22.573
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

2364
01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm the CEO there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the board,</v>

2365
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:27.050
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to discuss how we want</v>

2366
01:59:27.051 --> 01:59:30.140
<v Speaker 2>to approach issues and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring my science.</v>

2367
01:59:30.141 --> 01:59:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make my cases as much as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can on the right way to do things.</v>

2368
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:36.230
<v Speaker 2>But if they want to do things another</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2369
01:59:36.231 --> 01:59:39.950
<v Speaker 2>it's their agency and that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would have been done</v>

2370
01:59:39.951 --> 01:59:41.480
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm aware of.</v>

2371
01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:45.510
<v Speaker 5>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your idea is so radical and so way out</v>

2372
01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:49.290
<v Speaker 5>there and that's part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with getting people to accept it.</v>

2373
01:59:49.330 --> 01:59:53.850
<v Speaker 5>So they would have to take a huge chance</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if it failed it would be their</v>

2374
01:59:53.851 --> 01:59:56.970
<v Speaker 5>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if it fails right now,</v>

2375
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:59.100
<v Speaker 5>here's the trick joke.</v>

2376
01:59:59.790 --> 02:00:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Total cop out in a manner because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

2377
02:00:02.250 --> 02:00:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Is it my fault?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2378
02:00:04.450 --> 02:00:08.240
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying you will be the board's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fault because they have the agency so</v>

2379
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:10.340
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people are responsible.</v>

2380
02:00:11.130 --> 02:00:13.620
<v Speaker 2>They can't bitch at the mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2381
02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:16.350
<v Speaker 2>because they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their agency.</v>

2382
02:00:16.351 --> 02:00:19.530
<v Speaker 2>It's my job to serve them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my job to serve a mayor.</v>

2383
02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my job to serve them and carry out</v>

2384
02:00:21.961 --> 02:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to achieve so I will work at</v>

2385
02:00:25.171 --> 02:00:28.170
<v Speaker 2>achieving with they want to achieve and</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishing the milestones and</v>

2386
02:00:28.171 --> 02:00:31.440
<v Speaker 2>incentives that they think are better</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their neighborhood because they may</v>

2387
02:00:31.441 --> 02:00:36.441
<v Speaker 2>do things which could dramatically have</v>
<v Speaker 2>impacts such as hiring like.</v>

2388
02:00:37.681 --> 02:00:41.790
<v Speaker 2>So right now guys won't hire because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a drug complaint or something</v>

2389
02:00:41.791 --> 02:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they have a prior arrest record.</v>

2390
02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you get all those poor</v>

2391
02:00:45.301 --> 02:00:47.280
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say,</v>

2392
02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that's bullcrap.</v>

2393
02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:52.650
<v Speaker 2>The bad arrest doesn't stop you from</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a good cop.</v>

2394
02:00:52.651 --> 02:00:55.260
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can let those people in and they</v>

2395
02:00:55.261 --> 02:00:59.310
<v Speaker 2>can take that risk as a whole community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can decide these things.</v>

2396
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:04.380
<v Speaker 5>So you're saying make former prisoners</v>
<v Speaker 5>or former criminals turned them into</v>

2397
02:01:04.511 --> 02:01:05.344
<v Speaker 5>police officer?</v>

2398
02:01:05.490 --> 02:01:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Not that far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sure.</v>

2399
02:01:06.661 --> 02:01:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the difference between them and me,</v>

2400
02:01:09.271 --> 02:01:11.670
<v Speaker 2>we know as the color of my skin and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neighborhood I grew up in,</v>

2401
02:01:12.210 --> 02:01:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I could have easily had the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 2>record that they have.</v>

2402
02:01:14.161 --> 02:01:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2403
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.170
<v Speaker 5>I think pretty much anybody could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2404
02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.370
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's.</v>

2405
02:01:17.371 --> 02:01:21.370
<v Speaker 5>And that's a hard pill to swallow for</v>
<v Speaker 5>folks who have that pull yourself up by</v>

2406
02:01:21.371 --> 02:01:24.700
<v Speaker 5>your bootstraps mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of who you are and what you</v>

2407
02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:27.400
<v Speaker 5>are is luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2408
02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything important in this country.</v>

2409
02:01:29.630 --> 02:01:31.490
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent shame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Advantage.</v>

2410
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:34.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being born poor in this country is</v>

2411
02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:38.740
<v Speaker 5>really way luckier than being born in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the middle class and a lot of other</v>

2412
02:01:38.741 --> 02:01:40.850
<v Speaker 5>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this board that we have,</v>

2413
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:43.430
<v Speaker 5>how long do you think is going to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>before they end the drug war?</v>

2414
02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 5>It's going to take a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2415
02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:48.020
<v Speaker 5>but they can't do that because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>federal decision.</v>

2416
02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about the city of</v>

2417
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:51.920
<v Speaker 5>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which not even the state of Illinois.</v>

2418
02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:54.950
<v Speaker 5>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can stop you.</v>

2419
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:57.680
<v Speaker 5>The federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't enforce laws.</v>

2420
02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.590
<v Speaker 5>We don't enforce your law period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boy.</v>

2421
02:02:00.650 --> 02:02:02.240
<v Speaker 5>Good luck trying to pull that legal.</v>

2422
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:04.190
<v Speaker 5>The feds have to come in and do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

2423
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:06.890
<v Speaker 5>The feds would have to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>enforce the law.</v>

2424
02:02:07.230 --> 02:02:11.270
<v Speaker 5>They didn't do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were doing in Colorado for a while.</v>

2425
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tried.</v>

2426
02:02:12.351 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 5>That didn't work out well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Colorado is a perfect example where the</v>

2427
02:02:16.191 --> 02:02:21.191
<v Speaker 5>money was so good with the plan that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>initiated where they're making more</v>

2428
02:02:22.071 --> 02:02:25.880
<v Speaker 5>money from taxes with marijuana than</v>
<v Speaker 5>they ever did with alcohol,</v>

2429
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:27.890
<v Speaker 5>which is bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beyond the money.</v>

2430
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 5>You have a reduction in crime and in</v>
<v Speaker 5>juvenile usage of marijuana and in drunk</v>

2431
02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:33.570
<v Speaker 5>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2432
02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:35.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lowest incidences of drunk driving and</v>

2433
02:02:35.961 --> 02:02:38.540
<v Speaker 5>more than a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty interesting.</v>

2434
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:41.030
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty interesting because it just</v>
<v Speaker 5>shows you that it was predictable.</v>

2435
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:42.170
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2436
02:02:42.171 --> 02:02:45.370
<v Speaker 5>for people like you or I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not for the people that were arguing</v>

2437
02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:47.330
<v Speaker 5>against it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they thought it was going to be chaos</v>

2438
02:02:47.331 --> 02:02:50.630
<v Speaker 5>and hippies and they got to like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>town on fire and fuck each other in the</v>

2439
02:02:50.631 --> 02:02:53.060
<v Speaker 5>streets and everybody thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna be horrible,</v>

2440
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:57.080
<v Speaker 5>but you're talking about a different</v>
<v Speaker 5>drug when you're talking about Chicago,</v>

2441
02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:59.700
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about heroin and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about cocaine.</v>

2442
02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:02.380
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about methamphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking to them about MTMA.</v>

2443
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:06.290
<v Speaker 5>These are different drugs and they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>health consequences as well,</v>

2444
02:03:06.650 --> 02:03:11.650
<v Speaker 5>so the legalization or the prohibition</v>
<v Speaker 5>with what they have right now is</v>

2445
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:18.860
<v Speaker 5>obviously not working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem would be if they</v>

2446
02:03:18.861 --> 02:03:23.360
<v Speaker 5>decided to not enforce the drug laws and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they decided to in some way,</v>

2447
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:24.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>air quotes,</v>

2448
02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 5>legalize these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would take places?</v>

2449
02:03:28.130 --> 02:03:33.130
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have some blame be</v>
<v Speaker 5>placed on some deaths on your new laws</v>

2450
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:37.880
<v Speaker 5>and that's going to be paraded out in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you.</v>

2451
02:03:37.881 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 5>This is your responsible for the death</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this young girl.</v>

2452
02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:43.190
<v Speaker 5>She never tried heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because it was available at seven</v>

2453
02:03:43.191 --> 02:03:45.350
<v Speaker 5>slash 11 and she started snorting it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then now she's dead.</v>

2454
02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:49.370
<v Speaker 5>Somebody's going to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get that.</v>

2455
02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not the model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The model.</v>

2456
02:03:52.530 --> 02:03:55.800
<v Speaker 2>So you have prohibition and we were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were saying earlier,</v>

2457
02:03:55.801 --> 02:03:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what prohibition does,</v>

2458
02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:00.420
<v Speaker 2>it's just the terming that they sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2459
02:04:00.421 --> 02:04:02.550
<v Speaker 2>It takes the hands and puts it into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>black market.</v>

2460
02:04:02.610 --> 02:04:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so well yet heroin is a terrible drug,</v>

2461
02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:12.140
<v Speaker 2>but what makes heroin so bad is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of purity and the environment in</v>

2462
02:04:12.361 --> 02:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>which you will you get it.</v>

2463
02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:15.560
<v Speaker 5>Well also the addictive properties of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2464
02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:18.740
<v Speaker 5>which is why Oxycontin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though it's pure and very</v>

2465
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:21.820
<v Speaker 5>measurable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>still has a terrifying effect.</v>

2466
02:04:21.850 --> 02:04:23.570
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what kind of consequences did you</v>

2467
02:04:23.571 --> 02:04:25.520
<v Speaker 5>say that was?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said it was a health consequence.</v>

2468
02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:30.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has a criminal consequences will</v>

2469
02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:32.590
<v Speaker 5>oxycontin's certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that get</v>

2470
02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 5>arrested for illegally possessing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>selling and distributing.</v>

2471
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:36.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2472
02:04:36.650 --> 02:04:37.140
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2473
02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 4>Understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the drugs period of health issue.</v>

2474
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are not a criminal issue.</v>

2475
02:04:42.871 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 4>They're not a prison issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are public health issue,</v>

2476
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:49.410
<v Speaker 4>so we treat that with health</v>
<v Speaker 4>professionals,</v>

2477
02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:54.470
<v Speaker 4>not with jail cells in and police.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So while May,</v>

2478
02:04:54.471 --> 02:04:57.860
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I'm saying that the drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealers can go out there and just deal</v>

2479
02:04:57.870 --> 02:04:58.950
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what I want.</v>

2480
02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:03.870
<v Speaker 4>I want a doctor handling everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it moved into just no different</v>

2481
02:05:03.871 --> 02:05:05.520
<v Speaker 4>than alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2482
02:05:05.521 --> 02:05:09.300
<v Speaker 4>the problem with the doctor handling is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what happened in Florida and what</v>

2483
02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:12.420
<v Speaker 4>happened in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They developed this environment where</v>

2484
02:05:12.421 --> 02:05:17.160
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have a database where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doctors and the pharmaceutical</v>

2485
02:05:17.161 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 4>companies were all in cahoots and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2486
02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:21.240
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just sell the shit out of this.</v>

2487
02:05:21.241 --> 02:05:26.241
<v Speaker 4>And the statistics were staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was more prescriptions for</v>

2488
02:05:26.341 --> 02:05:31.341
<v Speaker 4>Oxycontin's and opiate pain killers in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida than the rest of the United</v>

2489
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:32.390
<v Speaker 4>States combined.</v>

2490
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:35.640
<v Speaker 4>I know that is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what were they doing with it?</v>

2491
02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:38.440
<v Speaker 4>They were selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were taking it or selling it</v>

2492
02:05:38.441 --> 02:05:43.441
<v Speaker 4>illegal around the oxycontin express a</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary that showed that these</v>

2493
02:05:44.761 --> 02:05:49.730
<v Speaker 4>people were bringing it from Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upstate into Georgia and Kentucky,</v>

2494
02:05:49.731 --> 02:05:52.110
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have that market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't have that market in</v>

2495
02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Chicago with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2496
02:05:54.571 --> 02:05:58.590
<v Speaker 4>So Florida couldn't do that because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have a market to sell it in.</v>

2497
02:05:58.650 --> 02:06:02.980
<v Speaker 4>So the only reason that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only reason take away the market.</v>

2498
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:07.140
<v Speaker 4>The only reason that exists is because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can go sell it on the black market.</v>

2499
02:06:08.490 --> 02:06:13.470
<v Speaker 4>So if you take away the black market as</v>
<v Speaker 4>being the distributor then so you would</v>

2500
02:06:13.471 --> 02:06:15.420
<v Speaker 4>allow people to just sell it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2501
02:06:15.421 --> 02:06:15.781
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2502
02:06:15.781 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Only doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only doctors for those certain drugs</v>

2503
02:06:18.811 --> 02:06:20.280
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So cannabis or something like that.</v>

2504
02:06:20.281 --> 02:06:25.281
<v Speaker 4>We need to put in a model similar and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have things in Portugal or what Portugal</v>

2505
02:06:25.501 --> 02:06:28.380
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just decriminalize it so they don't</v>

2506
02:06:28.381 --> 02:06:30.960
<v Speaker 4>put people in prison cells for</v>
<v Speaker 4>possessing it.</v>

2507
02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:34.320
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to still go after the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealers as a half measure,</v>

2508
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 4>that's a half measure I'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>swallow that I don't completely believe</v>

2509
02:06:38.131 --> 02:06:40.890
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can work those things out.</v>

2510
02:06:40.891 --> 02:06:43.710
<v Speaker 4>Me and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're the panel and I'm the CEO,</v>

2511
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:47.850
<v Speaker 4>we can work these things out and come to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a position where we're like,</v>

2512
02:06:47.851 --> 02:06:49.470
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's try this and if you,</v>

2513
02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 4>if you want to go by the incremental</v>
<v Speaker 4>ism,</v>

2514
02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:56.610
<v Speaker 4>then we see that that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like in Colorado already has proven</v>

2515
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 4>that the cannabis model is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2516
02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:03.690
<v Speaker 4>So we can start with the cannabis model</v>
<v Speaker 4>and move that in and then we can say,</v>

2517
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:05.820
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's put cocaine into this model</v>

2518
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:09.390
<v Speaker 4>and then see how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be incremental about it,</v>

2519
02:07:09.391 --> 02:07:12.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cannabis model,</v>

2520
02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.770
<v Speaker 4>the problem is the innocuous negative</v>
<v Speaker 4>effects are just.</v>

2521
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:20.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just really the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's almost nothing.</v>

2522
02:07:20.581 --> 02:07:24.390
<v Speaker 4>There's so little to fall on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't make that case with alcohol</v>

2523
02:07:24.391 --> 02:07:26.460
<v Speaker 4>or tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

2524
02:07:26.461 --> 02:07:28.680
<v Speaker 4>But tobacco is not a good one because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a long,</v>

2525
02:07:28.681 --> 02:07:33.360
<v Speaker 4>slow death as long as it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as it takes a long time.</v>

2526
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can accept me.</v>

2527
02:07:34.421 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 4>And that's how we at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like what</v>

2528
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:40.750
<v Speaker 4>we're doing cost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The costs of tobacco is extraordinary on</v>

2529
02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 4>our healthcare system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no doubt about it.</v>

2530
02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you think about alcohol,</v>

2531
02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:47.890
<v Speaker 4>that's the real argument because alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 4>is one of the easiest drugs to kill</v>

2532
02:07:47.891 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 4>yourself with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a staggering number.</v>

2533
02:07:51.011 --> 02:07:54.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like 10,000 people drink</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to death every year just in</v>

2534
02:07:54.941 --> 02:07:58.600
<v Speaker 4>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really pretty shocking and that</v>

2535
02:07:58.601 --> 02:08:02.770
<v Speaker 4>doesn't count drunk driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol related violence and all the</v>

2536
02:08:02.771 --> 02:08:07.771
<v Speaker 4>other things that go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with making heroin or</v>

2537
02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:12.940
<v Speaker 4>cocaine with decriminalizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then go after going after the</v>

2538
02:08:12.941 --> 02:08:14.350
<v Speaker 4>dealers is then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2539
02:08:14.351 --> 02:08:15.760
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if these people get hooked on it,</v>

2540
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.470
<v Speaker 4>where are they going to get it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then</v>

2541
02:08:19.730 --> 02:08:22.600
<v Speaker 4>they have to go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just the way we have to do</v>

2542
02:08:22.601 --> 02:08:24.010
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it is not treatment,</v>

2543
02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:26.530
<v Speaker 4>but it then becomes exactly like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>

2544
02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:30.850
<v Speaker 4>But remember what we do know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do know that every million spent when</v>

2545
02:08:30.851 --> 02:08:33.940
<v Speaker 4>the demand side reduces by 100</v>
<v Speaker 4>kilograms,</v>

2546
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:36.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have to keep focusing on</v>

2547
02:08:36.101 --> 02:08:39.430
<v Speaker 4>education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't if those people that got hooked</v>

2548
02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:42.970
<v Speaker 4>on oxy became heroin addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they had the education that this was</v>

2549
02:08:42.971 --> 02:08:44.590
<v Speaker 4>the path they were going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2550
02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:48.460
<v Speaker 4>you got to believe that a significant</v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage of them wouldn't have gone</v>

2551
02:08:48.461 --> 02:08:49.600
<v Speaker 4>that path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2552
02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:52.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean now we're all aware of it and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>know plenty of people now that the</v>

2553
02:08:52.421 --> 02:08:54.220
<v Speaker 4>doctor says here's some oxy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

2554
02:08:54.221 --> 02:08:54.671
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2555
02:08:54.671 --> 02:08:55.540
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2556
02:08:55.541 --> 02:08:57.700
<v Speaker 4>give me something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do with people that are so</v>

2557
02:08:57.701 --> 02:08:59.260
<v Speaker 4>fucking dumb?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to party.</v>

2558
02:08:59.261 --> 02:09:01.790
<v Speaker 4>And you got some of those things that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit harder,</v>

2559
02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.120
<v Speaker 4>just like you gotta let them drink</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to death.</v>

2560
02:09:04.210 --> 02:09:05.040
<v Speaker 4>And what are you gonna do?</v>

2561
02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a hard pill for people to</v>

2562
02:09:07.391 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 4>swallow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's better than putting them in a</v>

2563
02:09:09.251 --> 02:09:10.300
<v Speaker 4>prison cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2564
02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:11.590
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have you got going on,</v>

2565
02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:14.230
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drinking too much.</v>

2566
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Excessive alcohol use lead to</v>
<v Speaker 4>approximately 88,000 deaths and two</v>

2567
02:09:19.031 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 4>point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million years of potential life lost.</v>

2568
02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.440
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess like you're saying,</v>

2569
02:09:26.441 --> 02:09:30.400
<v Speaker 4>drunk driving now in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two point 5 million years of people's</v>

2570
02:09:30.401 --> 02:09:34.060
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird fucking statistic from</v>

2571
02:09:34.061 --> 02:09:39.061
<v Speaker 4>2006 to 2010 shortening the lives of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those who died by an average of 30</v>

2572
02:09:41.441 --> 02:09:42.251
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2573
02:09:42.251 --> 02:09:43.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it definitely,</v>

2574
02:09:43.901 --> 02:09:45.340
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's life lost,</v>

2575
02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:46.870
<v Speaker 4>meaning you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2576
02:09:46.890 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 4>you drink yourself into an early grave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird thing to argue,</v>

2577
02:09:51.641 --> 02:09:56.641
<v Speaker 4>but the 88,000 deaths over a period of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years,</v>

2578
02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.690
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's harsh.</v>

2579
02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:02.080
<v Speaker 4>But that's what we were saying in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially a little bit more than</v>

2580
02:10:02.081 --> 02:10:04.210
<v Speaker 4>what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We also know the solution to that or a</v>

2581
02:10:04.211 --> 02:10:06.340
<v Speaker 4>solution to a significant portion of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that education,</v>

2582
02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:09.550
<v Speaker 4>education and legalization of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2583
02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:12.790
<v Speaker 4>Empirically know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know those will improve the</v>

2584
02:10:12.791 --> 02:10:16.510
<v Speaker 4>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instead we continue to do things we</v>

2585
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.160
<v Speaker 4>know don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2586
02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:23.560
<v Speaker 4>So I'm a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am interested in what works.</v>

2587
02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:26.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to argue for what works and</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else can argue against it,</v>

2588
02:10:27.190 --> 02:10:29.500
<v Speaker 4>but that's going to be what I continue</v>
<v Speaker 4>to argue for.</v>

2589
02:10:29.501 --> 02:10:33.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an emotional position on I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2590
02:10:33.730 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

2591
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:35.870
<v Speaker 5>following the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2592
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:38.240
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we literally know these things.</v>

2593
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also a drug that is illegal,</v>

2594
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 5>that has a significant impact on</v>
<v Speaker 5>addiction.</v>

2595
02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:48.800
<v Speaker 5>It's called Ibogaine and Ibogaine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is being used in treatment</v>

2596
02:10:48.801 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 5>facilities all throughout South America</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Mexico with massive positive</v>

2597
02:10:52.821 --> 02:10:54.350
<v Speaker 5>results,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2598
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 5>is illegal in this country for no</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparent reason.</v>

2599
02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.600
<v Speaker 5>And I've heard that the people that do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are just like,</v>

2600
02:10:59.601 --> 02:11:00.950
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as they take it to like,</v>

2601
02:11:00.951 --> 02:11:02.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't want it anymore to carry out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2602
02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:07.940
<v Speaker 5>it rewires the way your brain</v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrates or the way your brain is</v>

2603
02:11:08.631 --> 02:11:11.960
<v Speaker 5>affected by these substances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It rewires addiction.</v>

2604
02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:15.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the one to explain how it works.</v>

2605
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:18.320
<v Speaker 5>Aubrey will be in this week and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably be the best person to do it.</v>

2606
02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.070
<v Speaker 6>Got Another one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is from the Washington Post.</v>

2607
02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:25.510
<v Speaker 6>This statistic of how many Americans</v>
<v Speaker 6>drink every week.</v>

2608
02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:29.470
<v Speaker 6>So he's going to read that one little</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing right here,</v>

2609
02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:34.180
<v Speaker 6>up to 10 drinks per day up to the top 10</v>
<v Speaker 6>percent of American adults.</v>

2610
02:11:34.210 --> 02:11:37.510
<v Speaker 6>Twenty $4 million of them consume an</v>
<v Speaker 6>average of 74 drinks per week.</v>

2611
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:41.170
<v Speaker 6>Or a little more than 10 drinks per day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

2612
02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:43.390
<v Speaker 6>Compared to about 30 percent that don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>drink at all.</v>

2613
02:11:44.110 --> 02:11:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many of them are doing that?</v>

2614
02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:50.260
<v Speaker 5>Because cannabis is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2615
02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:52.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure quite a few,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but quite a few,</v>

2616
02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2617
02:11:53.021 --> 02:11:54.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously,</v>

2618
02:11:55.150 --> 02:11:57.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a marijuana enthusiastic.</v>

2619
02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:59.410
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's awesome.</v>

2620
02:12:00.250 --> 02:12:02.500
<v Speaker 5>I want to spark one up right now</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about it.</v>

2621
02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2622
02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:08.500
<v Speaker 5>but some people don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't like the abrasively</v>

2623
02:12:08.501 --> 02:12:12.070
<v Speaker 5>introspective properties of cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't like the paranoia.</v>

2624
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:15.250
<v Speaker 5>They don't like all the vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings that you get from it.</v>

2625
02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I liked those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are good for me.</v>

2626
02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:23.050
<v Speaker 5>My personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to type a aggressive,</v>

2627
02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:27.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm good with a substance,</v>

2628
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:32.710
<v Speaker 5>a compound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a that sort of like calms that down and</v>

2629
02:12:32.711 --> 02:12:34.870
<v Speaker 5>mellows me out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives me a different perspective.</v>

2630
02:12:34.871 --> 02:12:36.550
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy it and I think it's good for</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2631
02:12:36.551 --> 02:12:38.980
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of the things that people</v>

2632
02:12:38.981 --> 02:12:43.270
<v Speaker 5>associate with a negative aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannabis to particularly the paranoia.</v>

2633
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:45.550
<v Speaker 5>I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

2634
02:12:45.551 --> 02:12:47.590
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we need to feel more vulnerable.</v>

2635
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:52.810
<v Speaker 5>I think more feeling more vulnerable is</v>
<v Speaker 5>better for you because it enhances a</v>

2636
02:12:52.811 --> 02:12:57.060
<v Speaker 5>sense of community and friendship and</v>
<v Speaker 5>love and a lot of ways and it it,</v>

2637
02:12:57.061 --> 02:13:00.400
<v Speaker 5>it bonds people together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this idea that you're an</v>

2638
02:13:00.401 --> 02:13:02.680
<v Speaker 5>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you are a,</v>

2639
02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:03.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were alone,</v>

2640
02:13:03.881 --> 02:13:05.980
<v Speaker 5>rebel out there kicking ass and taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>names.</v>

2641
02:13:05.981 --> 02:13:09.340
<v Speaker 5>You're doing it all by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all eroded instantaneously by</v>

2642
02:13:09.341 --> 02:13:10.330
<v Speaker 5>cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just said,</v>

2643
02:13:10.331 --> 02:13:10.691
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2644
02:13:10.691 --> 02:13:11.230
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2645
02:13:11.230 --> 02:13:15.490
<v Speaker 5>You're a talking monkey on a spinning</v>
<v Speaker 5>ball flying through infinity fuckhead</v>

2646
02:13:15.810 --> 02:13:17.080
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2647
02:13:17.081 --> 02:13:19.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to die some day and I couldn't</v>

2648
02:13:19.901 --> 02:13:22.300
<v Speaker 5>agree with you more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think those are really important</v>

2649
02:13:22.301 --> 02:13:27.190
<v Speaker 5>qualities for our entire race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The human race.</v>

2650
02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 5>I think they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It enhances more community feelings and</v>

2651
02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and I think that's the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 5>of with some drugs like stimulants,</v>

2652
02:13:37.201 --> 02:13:37.890
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

2653
02:13:37.890 --> 02:13:40.110
<v Speaker 5>Stimulants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always avoided stimulants.</v>

2654
02:13:40.111 --> 02:13:43.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a fan other than coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never really tried them,</v>

2655
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:47.130
<v Speaker 5>but I've seen their effect on other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and I've read about their effects</v>

2656
02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:49.320
<v Speaker 5>and it's not what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be cocky.</v>

2657
02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:50.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2658
02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:55.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to fight whatever urges my</v>
<v Speaker 5>body and my personality have to sort of</v>

2659
02:13:56.311 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 5>lean towards that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that people that get</v>

2660
02:13:58.951 --> 02:14:01.770
<v Speaker 5>involved with speed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people to get involved with coke,</v>

2661
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:04.380
<v Speaker 5>those are people that are like unduly</v>
<v Speaker 5>confident.</v>

2662
02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:07.260
<v Speaker 5>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a bad drug for society</v>

2663
02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 5>and it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a drug that is very selfish in its</v>

2664
02:14:11.431 --> 02:14:13.080
<v Speaker 5>effects like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2665
02:14:13.081 --> 02:14:15.120
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the impact that it has on people's.</v>

2666
02:14:15.121 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Speaker 5>They become really selfish and nasty and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into that.</v>

2667
02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:22.410
<v Speaker 5>I think that alcohol for some people is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2668
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:26.820
<v Speaker 5>is an escape from the reality that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>find themselves in and they don't know</v>

2669
02:14:26.821 --> 02:14:29.790
<v Speaker 5>how to get out and I think education</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we were talking about before,</v>

2670
02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:35.540
<v Speaker 5>allowing people to have access to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>stories and the,</v>

2671
02:14:36.170 --> 02:14:36.710
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2672
02:14:36.710 --> 02:14:37.211
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2673
02:14:37.211 --> 02:14:40.740
<v Speaker 5>the consequences that other people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced from taking that drug will</v>

2674
02:14:40.741 --> 02:14:41.490
<v Speaker 5>help them.</v>

2675
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:45.420
<v Speaker 5>What kept me from doing coke when I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>young was having friends that had</v>

2676
02:14:45.421 --> 02:14:48.450
<v Speaker 5>problems with it and that educated me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2677
02:14:48.451 --> 02:14:49.950
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be like that guy.</v>

2678
02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:53.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to have that happen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see what's happening to this person.</v>

2679
02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:57.480
<v Speaker 5>Some people don't get exposed to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and instead before they know it,</v>

2680
02:14:57.481 --> 02:14:59.820
<v Speaker 5>they're already in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying it when they're 15,</v>

2681
02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:01.620
<v Speaker 5>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like it too much.</v>

2682
02:15:01.621 --> 02:15:04.650
<v Speaker 5>Next thing you know they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>forward to doing that because it</v>

2683
02:15:04.651 --> 02:15:09.600
<v Speaker 5>provides some sort of an escape from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure of the consequences of pursuing</v>

2684
02:15:09.601 --> 02:15:12.900
<v Speaker 5>a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of chasing down life or of not having a</v>

2685
02:15:12.901 --> 02:15:14.460
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another one.</v>

2686
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Not having,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you were saying,</v>

2687
02:15:16.021 --> 02:15:18.030
<v Speaker 5>the the identity that you're focusing</v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

2688
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:21.480
<v Speaker 5>whether it's this gentleman that was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>photographer or someone else that wants</v>

2689
02:15:21.481 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 5>to be an athlete or someone else who</v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to be an author.</v>

2690
02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:25.170
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one thing that you're chasing.</v>

2691
02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:27.620
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2692
02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:32.640
<v Speaker 5>this sort of futility of life is very</v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming to some people and they</v>

2693
02:15:32.641 --> 02:15:36.570
<v Speaker 5>want to escape that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pain of not knowing what the fuck</v>

2694
02:15:36.571 --> 02:15:41.190
<v Speaker 5>you're doing and I think some of that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just going to go way out there,</v>

2695
02:15:41.191 --> 02:15:46.191
<v Speaker 5>but I think some of that goes back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hunter gatherer genes that we have</v>

2696
02:15:47.210 --> 02:15:49.170
<v Speaker 5>in our.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In our own bodies,</v>

2697
02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:54.440
<v Speaker 5>I think we're in a lot of ways were a</v>
<v Speaker 5>prisoner to the needs of the past and</v>

2698
02:15:54.601 --> 02:15:57.120
<v Speaker 5>the needs of the past where we were very</v>
<v Speaker 5>goal oriented.</v>

2699
02:15:57.121 --> 02:15:58.650
<v Speaker 5>You have to go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2700
02:15:58.651 --> 02:16:01.350
<v Speaker 5>to pick the right amount of foods that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could eat.</v>

2701
02:16:01.351 --> 02:16:05.370
<v Speaker 5>You have to hunt the animals or catch</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fish and that was the goal and we</v>

2702
02:16:05.371 --> 02:16:07.260
<v Speaker 5>were very goal oriented in that way.</v>

2703
02:16:07.590 --> 02:16:10.170
<v Speaker 5>You had to go out there and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had to work hard and then through</v>

2704
02:16:10.171 --> 02:16:13.980
<v Speaker 5>those goals you get this feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction when you're just getting</v>

2705
02:16:13.981 --> 02:16:16.200
<v Speaker 5>food and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It comes to you.</v>

2706
02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:20.370
<v Speaker 5>When your job involves doing something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not rewarding in any way,</v>

2707
02:16:20.371 --> 02:16:23.280
<v Speaker 5>shape or form and this is what you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do to get that food.</v>

2708
02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 5>You've sort of taken out all the natural</v>
<v Speaker 5>reward systems that our bodies are</v>

2709
02:16:27.031 --> 02:16:32.031
<v Speaker 5>designed to sort of gravitate towards</v>
<v Speaker 5>and unless you find a passion,</v>

2710
02:16:32.501 --> 02:16:37.501
<v Speaker 5>unless you find an art or craft or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>trade or some sort of a thing that</v>

2711
02:16:37.631 --> 02:16:42.550
<v Speaker 5>excites you mentally and stimulates your</v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity and stimulates your ambition,</v>

2712
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:45.910
<v Speaker 5>your left lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot of people that are</v>

2713
02:16:45.911 --> 02:16:50.890
<v Speaker 5>just left last and unfulfilled and</v>
<v Speaker 5>unsatisfied and I think those types of</v>

2714
02:16:50.891 --> 02:16:55.540
<v Speaker 5>people gravitate towards alcohol and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of other drugs as an escape.</v>

2715
02:16:55.930 --> 02:17:00.340
<v Speaker 5>And that's a part of the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 5>society was how we view drugs.</v>

2716
02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:05.020
<v Speaker 5>We view drugs as an escape rather than</v>
<v Speaker 5>an enhancement or rather than a</v>

2717
02:17:05.021 --> 02:17:07.530
<v Speaker 5>perspective and an enhancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2718
02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:09.340
<v Speaker 5>we view them as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2719
02:17:09.341 --> 02:17:11.650
<v Speaker 5>this guy's weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He needs a drug.</v>

2720
02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2721
02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're spot on.</v>

2722
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you could argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

2723
02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:20.810
<v Speaker 2>it ties all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know you sound like liberal.</v>

2724
02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean you plurally sound like liberal</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies when you like start putting all</v>

2725
02:17:25.791 --> 02:17:28.760
<v Speaker 2>these things together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these things really do tie in</v>

2726
02:17:28.761 --> 02:17:32.480
<v Speaker 2>together so you have the alcoholism</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people aren't finding their</v>

2727
02:17:32.481 --> 02:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should be doing things.</v>

2728
02:17:35.121 --> 02:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>So like help people create identities if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want a safer environment.</v>

2729
02:17:39.081 --> 02:17:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not about taking those people</v>

2730
02:17:41.241 --> 02:17:43.650
<v Speaker 2>and put them into prisons as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate it.</v>

2731
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's about finding that passion or</v>
<v Speaker 2>educating them to do something.</v>

2732
02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:50.990
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you want to help or police or</v>

2733
02:17:50.991 --> 02:17:54.530
<v Speaker 2>whoever want to help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be addressing those kinds of</v>

2734
02:17:54.531 --> 02:17:58.220
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think so people,</v>

2735
02:17:58.910 --> 02:18:03.830
<v Speaker 2>one thing we've noticed throughout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout human history is that when</v>

2736
02:18:04.550 --> 02:18:07.670
<v Speaker 2>things are really tough and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

2737
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:11.270
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leaders of the oppressed,</v>

2738
02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:14.740
<v Speaker 2>like so say it's really easy to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2739
02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:17.510
<v Speaker 2>the black segregated neighborhoods right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2740
02:18:17.550 --> 02:18:19.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy example.</v>

2741
02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just easy as an example.</v>

2742
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:25.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very good exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the masculine members of a society</v>

2743
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:30.070
<v Speaker 2>that can't achieve something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turned to making everything about</v>

2744
02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:35.300
<v Speaker 2>masculinity and dominance and accepting</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2745
02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:39.080
<v Speaker 2>of that lower realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they start to treat,</v>

2746
02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:42.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and education as a feminine</v>

2747
02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:43.750
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or weak.</v>

2748
02:18:44.350 --> 02:18:46.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have that,</v>

2749
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:48.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that plays into the culture of where you</v>

2750
02:18:48.831 --> 02:18:52.280
<v Speaker 2>have the guns and everybody has to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disrespecting culture.</v>

2751
02:18:52.281 --> 02:18:57.230
<v Speaker 2>And this is my corner kind of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have those kinds of benefits that</v>

2752
02:18:57.231 --> 02:19:01.070
<v Speaker 2>are a factor also in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in leveling the playing field for</v>

2753
02:19:01.071 --> 02:19:04.670
<v Speaker 2>everybody and contributing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that we're doing</v>

2754
02:19:04.671 --> 02:19:09.671
<v Speaker 2>right now is we're building a studio</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this in Baltimore and it's called a</v>

2755
02:19:10.970 --> 02:19:13.130
<v Speaker 2>radio revolver and that'll be my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shameless plug.</v>

2756
02:19:13.131 --> 02:19:18.110
<v Speaker 2>So go fund me Radio Revolver and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>still need a few more thousand dollars</v>

2757
02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:19.970
<v Speaker 2>to fix everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

2758
02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So we are making it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a video recording,</v>

2759
02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:28.400
<v Speaker 2>like skype session,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the podcasts,</v>

2760
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:31.310
<v Speaker 2>the whole setup like this for with eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike's.</v>

2761
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:34.220
<v Speaker 2>And we're trying to set everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have local artists that are painting</v>

2762
02:19:34.221 --> 02:19:35.420
<v Speaker 2>everything in the inside.</v>

2763
02:19:35.490 --> 02:19:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Let me stop right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A people are going to talk over each</v>

2764
02:19:37.801 --> 02:19:39.480
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never have more than two.</v>

2765
02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2766
02:19:40.530 --> 02:19:44.250
<v Speaker 5>We've made that mistake many times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have these fight companions with four</v>

2767
02:19:44.251 --> 02:19:46.770
<v Speaker 5>and they're my best friends and we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>all fucking yelling over each other.</v>

2768
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:48.450
<v Speaker 5>I try to watch one of those the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>day I was like,</v>

2769
02:19:48.451 --> 02:19:49.740
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting a headache.</v>

2770
02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes those are pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2771
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:53.620
<v Speaker 2>we get hammered,</v>

2772
02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:56.780
<v Speaker 5>they're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm just saying if you have eight</v>

2773
02:19:56.781 --> 02:20:00.620
<v Speaker 5>people to really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you ever heard that expression</v>

2774
02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:01.740
<v Speaker 5>one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2775
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 5>one boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one boys work,</v>

2776
02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:07.910
<v Speaker 5>two boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>half boys work,</v>

2777
02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:11.270
<v Speaker 5>meaning that like if you have two young</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids together and they're working on</v>

2778
02:20:11.271 --> 02:20:12.770
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just going to start talking shit</v>

2779
02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:16.970
<v Speaker 5>and it's not going to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you have one kid that's digging a</v>

2780
02:20:16.971 --> 02:20:18.440
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to actually get that job</v>

2781
02:20:18.441 --> 02:20:20.570
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you have like four people,</v>

2782
02:20:20.571 --> 02:20:23.360
<v Speaker 5>nothing gets done and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really the case.</v>

2783
02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely going to write that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just ate people's to money.</v>

2784
02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So one of the people that I met was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever heard serial podcast,</v>

2785
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know that?</v>

2786
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2787
02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:34.573
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2788
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:35.421
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2789
02:20:35.421 --> 02:20:37.670
<v Speaker 2>but I'm aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first season is about it,</v>

2790
02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.830
<v Speaker 2>not salaried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was wrongfully imprisoned right now</v>

2791
02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:41.870
<v Speaker 2>in Maryland and still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2792
02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So his Bentley wrongfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so w.</v>

2793
02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.270
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So regardless of whether you get a point</v>

2794
02:20:47.271 --> 02:20:50.030
<v Speaker 2>of whether he did or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm honestly unaware of the case.</v>

2795
02:20:50.031 --> 02:20:51.290
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was he accused of?</v>

2796
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.153
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2797
02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:55.360
<v Speaker 2>in high school at 17 of murdering his ex</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>

2798
02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:57.980
<v Speaker 2>a classmate at woodland high high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

2799
02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence,</v>

2800
02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:02.530
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether somebody was to</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue about whether he actually did it</v>

2801
02:21:02.531 --> 02:21:05.660
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence is extremely clear that you</v>

2802
02:21:05.661 --> 02:21:08.210
<v Speaker 2>do not have the evidence to put this</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual in jail,</v>

2803
02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:08.900
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

2804
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:12.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His best friend is the partner with me</v>

2805
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:17.710
<v Speaker 2>for radio revolver and we ended up being</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected for it because I helped out on</v>

2806
02:21:18.201 --> 02:21:20.140
<v Speaker 2>that podcast for awhile and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

2807
02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:21.890
<v Speaker 2>we have this community that we formed</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2808
02:21:21.891 --> 02:21:26.891
<v Speaker 2>so he's helping me with this and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>an example of how you use your privilege</v>

2809
02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:31.220
<v Speaker 2>and sensationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was sensationalized by what I said</v>

2810
02:21:31.221 --> 02:21:32.760
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right by the,</v>

2811
02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:37.310
<v Speaker 2>the cops hitting people and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things they did and probably what I'm</v>

2812
02:21:37.311 --> 02:21:41.570
<v Speaker 2>most proud of is that I instantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>switched from that sensationalism to how</v>

2813
02:21:41.571 --> 02:21:44.120
<v Speaker 2>we fix things and what the reform</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures are.</v>

2814
02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:46.600
<v Speaker 2>And we don't even talk about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensationalism anymore.</v>

2815
02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:49.200
<v Speaker 5>But don't you think the sensationalism</v>
<v Speaker 5>was important because it,</v>

2816
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:50.150
<v Speaker 5>it brought you to people.</v>

2817
02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:51.840
<v Speaker 2>It's critical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2818
02:21:51.900 --> 02:21:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the successfulness of turning that</v>

2819
02:21:54.541 --> 02:21:58.920
<v Speaker 2>around into something productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of that is this radio revolver.</v>

2820
02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:03.180
<v Speaker 2>So if you have privilege and you have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage or something which you have to</v>

2821
02:22:03.181 --> 02:22:06.480
<v Speaker 2>do is you have to build platforms for</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

2822
02:22:06.510 --> 02:22:10.320
<v Speaker 2>build structure so that other people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>rise not just for yourself.</v>

2823
02:22:10.890 --> 02:22:14.260
<v Speaker 2>And the idea behind this is we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have the network.</v>

2824
02:22:14.261 --> 02:22:17.760
<v Speaker 2>So it ended up being turnkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in a room that anybody can come in</v>

2825
02:22:17.761 --> 02:22:21.270
<v Speaker 2>at anytime and if the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the community members,</v>

2826
02:22:21.271 --> 02:22:22.700
<v Speaker 2>we already have them tied in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're,</v>

2827
02:22:22.701 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a problem with who</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cut out versus we're going to let in</v>

2828
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:30.420
<v Speaker 2>and we're in creating the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure under one umbrella for</v>

2829
02:22:30.421 --> 02:22:34.230
<v Speaker 2>them to come in and have their voices</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard and get their message out there.</v>

2830
02:22:34.231 --> 02:22:38.580
<v Speaker 2>They can build a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can build a video like a TV show</v>

2831
02:22:38.581 --> 02:22:42.180
<v Speaker 2>type of thing and none of this is ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to cost any of them anything.</v>

2832
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:45.420
<v Speaker 2>And if they succeed and we ended up</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting to a point where we're in the</v>

2833
02:22:45.421 --> 02:22:47.460
<v Speaker 2>red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we just start taking all the</v>

2834
02:22:47.461 --> 02:22:50.340
<v Speaker 2>profits and distributed out to whoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2835
02:22:50.341 --> 02:22:53.220
<v Speaker 2>proportionately has the podcast that</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the best or whatever.</v>

2836
02:22:53.970 --> 02:22:57.090
<v Speaker 2>But the point of that is if you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2837
02:22:57.091 --> 02:23:02.091
<v Speaker 2>that is gonna enable at least 10 to 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity projects so somebody else has</v>

2838
02:23:03.211 --> 02:23:08.211
<v Speaker 2>to come in and do the other end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take whatever you have and do that same</v>

2839
02:23:08.851 --> 02:23:10.410
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have money,</v>

2840
02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.470
<v Speaker 2>then we can take the money and we can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something good with that.</v>

2841
02:23:13.471 --> 02:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>If you have that skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can come into a place like</v>

2842
02:23:16.141 --> 02:23:18.840
<v Speaker 2>we're building or a place like penn</v>
<v Speaker 2>north and pass that on.</v>

2843
02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:22.050
<v Speaker 2>That is really what we have to do as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual level.</v>

2844
02:23:22.051 --> 02:23:24.120
<v Speaker 2>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would always love it if people would</v>

2845
02:23:24.121 --> 02:23:26.610
<v Speaker 2>help me out with radio revolver so we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get that finished.</v>

2846
02:23:27.090 --> 02:23:28.640
<v Speaker 2>So you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're going to do is</v>

2847
02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:33.860
<v Speaker 5>put together a podcast and through that</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast you're gonna have people tell</v>

2848
02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:38.871
<v Speaker 5>their stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to expose the world to the</v>

2849
02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:44.210
<v Speaker 5>plight of these inner cities and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive stories about people rising out</v>

2850
02:23:44.611 --> 02:23:46.500
<v Speaker 5>of them and your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the photographer,</v>

2851
02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:48.870
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of other people that you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>get exposed to.</v>

2852
02:23:48.871 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 5>So I think one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 5>things for a young person is to believe</v>

2853
02:23:53.791 --> 02:23:56.100
<v Speaker 5>that they can somehow or another be</v>
<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>

2854
02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:59.010
<v Speaker 5>I remember when when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were poor.</v>

2855
02:23:59.310 --> 02:24:02.880
<v Speaker 5>I always identified with being a poor</v>
<v Speaker 5>person and I never thought that I would</v>

2856
02:24:02.881 --> 02:24:05.820
<v Speaker 5>be anything other than a poor person</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I would see people that were</v>

2857
02:24:05.821 --> 02:24:08.940
<v Speaker 5>wealthy and they've always felt so</v>
<v Speaker 5>different than me.</v>

2858
02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:12.120
<v Speaker 5>They always felt so anyone who is</v>
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>

2859
02:24:12.121 --> 02:24:15.890
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't even just say wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a normal person like you know,</v>

2860
02:24:15.891 --> 02:24:20.891
<v Speaker 5>like someone who lives in a normal house</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a garage and that you know,</v>

2861
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:21.691
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2862
02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:24.720
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a person that the America aspires</v>

2863
02:24:24.721 --> 02:24:25.170
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2864
02:24:25.170 --> 02:24:28.470
<v Speaker 5>They feel different than you if you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a broken home,</v>

2865
02:24:28.471 --> 02:24:33.471
<v Speaker 5>if you're from poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in my case obviously was nothing in</v>

2866
02:24:33.481 --> 02:24:37.170
<v Speaker 5>comparison to the extreme poverty that a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of people face,</v>

2867
02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:42.410
<v Speaker 5>but I still remember feeling really</v>
<v Speaker 5>insecure and really I'm disconnected</v>

2868
02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:47.540
<v Speaker 5>from successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that mindset is a very difficult</v>

2869
02:24:48.271 --> 02:24:49.950
<v Speaker 5>to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult.</v>

2870
02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:52.770
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult to believe that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can achieve something.</v>

2871
02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:57.030
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult to believe that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can rise from no matter where you are,</v>

2872
02:24:57.060 --> 02:25:00.750
<v Speaker 5>if you continue to work and you continue</v>
<v Speaker 5>to pursue your goals and you can avoid</v>

2873
02:25:00.751 --> 02:25:04.230
<v Speaker 5>all the pitfalls of the negative aspects</v>
<v Speaker 5>of society,</v>

2874
02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:07.320
<v Speaker 5>you can do better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do better and you can feel</v>

2875
02:25:07.321 --> 02:25:12.321
<v Speaker 5>satisfied in that and to give people</v>
<v Speaker 5>these opportunities to see people who</v>

2876
02:25:12.661 --> 02:25:17.550
<v Speaker 5>have done the very thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>aspiring to do is massively beneficial</v>

2877
02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:20.310
<v Speaker 5>because it gives them sort of a like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit of a blueprint.</v>

2878
02:25:20.850 --> 02:25:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean and that's exactly the point</v>

2879
02:25:22.871 --> 02:25:25.450
<v Speaker 2>would say these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you may as well just be me saying</v>

2880
02:25:25.470 --> 02:25:27.160
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you completely.</v>

2881
02:25:27.161 --> 02:25:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's critically important that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>set these up for people and they can do</v>

2882
02:25:32.141 --> 02:25:35.530
<v Speaker 2>that and they do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just reminds me when you said that,</v>

2883
02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:40.770
<v Speaker 2>like they come up to my house and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like success to them and that's</v>

2884
02:25:42.971 --> 02:25:46.090
<v Speaker 2>what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dude with a single family home in</v>

2885
02:25:46.091 --> 02:25:48.370
<v Speaker 2>a garage and not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:49.204
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any money,</v>

2887
02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:52.590
<v Speaker 5>but it's honestly all anybody ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>really needs and wants.</v>

2888
02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:54.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get a giant ass fucking house,</v>

2889
02:25:54.781 --> 02:25:57.150
<v Speaker 5>but let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>

2890
02:25:57.151 --> 02:25:59.620
<v Speaker 5>it's just your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that.</v>

2891
02:25:59.630 --> 02:26:02.070
<v Speaker 5>It's just where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it comfortable?</v>

2892
02:26:02.071 --> 02:26:03.280
<v Speaker 5>Is it safe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2893
02:26:03.330 --> 02:26:04.740
<v Speaker 5>That's what everybody really wants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2894
02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:07.470
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really what it's all about and</v>

2895
02:26:07.650 --> 02:26:11.130
<v Speaker 5>one of the most positive aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing this podcast is running into</v>

2896
02:26:11.131 --> 02:26:13.200
<v Speaker 5>people that I've met that said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2897
02:26:13.470 --> 02:26:15.690
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing standup comedy for three</v>
<v Speaker 5>years now.</v>

2898
02:26:15.691 --> 02:26:19.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually a working comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did it from listening to your podcast.</v>

2899
02:26:19.531 --> 02:26:22.620
<v Speaker 5>I knew that I could do it because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>told me that anybody can do it if you</v>

2900
02:26:22.621 --> 02:26:23.930
<v Speaker 5>just try that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2901
02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.370
<v Speaker 5>I used to suck and I tell everybody I</v>
<v Speaker 5>always,</v>

2902
02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:29.880
<v Speaker 5>I was fucking terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you keep chipping away at it and</v>

2903
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:31.710
<v Speaker 5>she's listening to your recordings and</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that jazz.</v>

2904
02:26:31.890 --> 02:26:35.670
<v Speaker 5>I've run into a million fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have started doing Jujitsu now.</v>

2905
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:36.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2906
02:26:36.610 --> 02:26:39.090
<v Speaker 5>it's not a million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not countable anymore.</v>

2907
02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I've ran into so many people that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2908
02:26:40.651 --> 02:26:43.170
<v Speaker 5>I just got my purple belt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>started listening to you guys.</v>

2909
02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:45.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I'm competing my lifestyle.</v>

2910
02:26:45.751 --> 02:26:47.670
<v Speaker 5>So much healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat cleaner,</v>

2911
02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:49.350
<v Speaker 5>everything's better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My life is just.</v>

2912
02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I used to be depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so much more positive,</v>

2913
02:26:51.810 --> 02:26:54.670
<v Speaker 5>so I take great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfied.</v>

2914
02:26:54.671 --> 02:26:56.010
<v Speaker 5>I would say private.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the right word.</v>

2915
02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:59.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a great satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels awesome to talk to people that</v>

2916
02:26:59.130 --> 02:27:02.970
<v Speaker 5>have looked at this little sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>blueprint that I've laid out and said,</v>

2917
02:27:02.971 --> 02:27:03.960
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody can do this.</v>

2918
02:27:03.961 --> 02:27:06.750
<v Speaker 5>You can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whatever patterns that you're</v>

2919
02:27:06.751 --> 02:27:09.870
<v Speaker 5>following because the people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>around are in these negative patterns.</v>

2920
02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:13.440
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to follow those patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the beautiful things about</v>

2921
02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:15.990
<v Speaker 5>social media and the beautiful things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the internet.</v>

2922
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:17.850
<v Speaker 5>As you can kind of choose what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow.</v>

2923
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:21.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could go and just follow negative</v>

2924
02:27:21.031 --> 02:27:23.430
<v Speaker 5>stuff all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could concentrate on negative</v>

2925
02:27:23.431 --> 02:27:26.640
<v Speaker 5>bullshit and you could be one of those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who goes on twitter and just</v>

2926
02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:31.380
<v Speaker 5>bombs on people and Shits on people all</v>
<v Speaker 5>day and that's going to be your point of</v>

2927
02:27:31.381 --> 02:27:33.810
<v Speaker 5>focus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not gonna get any better at</v>

2928
02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:36.090
<v Speaker 5>anything doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to have a better life.</v>

2929
02:27:36.091 --> 02:27:38.520
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to be happier.</v>

2930
02:27:38.670 --> 02:27:40.830
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to spread any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

2931
02:27:41.010 --> 02:27:44.700
<v Speaker 5>anything beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything positive to anybody,</v>

2932
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:49.800
<v Speaker 5>but you can take a choice to not do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of times you need to see that</v>

2933
02:27:49.801 --> 02:27:51.750
<v Speaker 5>someone else has done that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 5>help you do it.</v>

2934
02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I hope you're inspiring others because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of inspired me right now</v>

2935
02:27:54.501 --> 02:27:59.501
<v Speaker 2>like thinking about how many identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>projects that you lead even though they</v>

2936
02:28:00.321 --> 02:28:05.321
<v Speaker 2>were maybe not even been obvious to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've gone and use this</v>

2937
02:28:05.331 --> 02:28:08.660
<v Speaker 2>platform to do these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is highly honorable of you that</v>

2938
02:28:08.661 --> 02:28:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you use this platform so that I can talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these things about blm black lives</v>

2939
02:28:12.771 --> 02:28:14.690
<v Speaker 2>matter and about police reform and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2940
02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:19.960
<v Speaker 2>That's like the typical like prototype</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what what we're talking about you,</v>

2941
02:28:20.651 --> 02:28:23.360
<v Speaker 2>you were great work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by doing that,</v>

2942
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:25.460
<v Speaker 5>well it's helping me a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honestly.</v>

2943
02:28:25.461 --> 02:28:28.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think everyone's life is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>constant journey.</v>

2944
02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:29.500
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>

2945
02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:32.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean unless you just stay sedentary</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you don't go anywhere and you don't</v>

2946
02:28:32.961 --> 02:28:34.520
<v Speaker 5>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any new data your,</v>

2947
02:28:34.521 --> 02:28:39.521
<v Speaker 5>your life is all about reevaluating the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way you think or evaluating it or</v>

2948
02:28:39.651 --> 02:28:44.420
<v Speaker 5>enhancing it or adding to it or removing</v>
<v Speaker 5>some negative aspects of the way you</v>

2949
02:28:44.421 --> 02:28:47.900
<v Speaker 5>think and one of the best ways that I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>found to do that as exposed myself to</v>

2950
02:28:47.901 --> 02:28:52.700
<v Speaker 5>interesting people like you or like any</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the other people that I've had the</v>

2951
02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:56.720
<v Speaker 5>pleasure and the opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk to on this podcast.</v>

2952
02:28:56.930 --> 02:29:00.230
<v Speaker 5>You get this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've had three hour conversations</v>

2953
02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:04.820
<v Speaker 5>with 800 fucking will not 800 people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's 800 times.</v>

2954
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:10.450
<v Speaker 5>And having those kinds of conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it forces you to think it forces you to.</v>

2955
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Like.</v>

2956
02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:14.990
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that Eddie Wong was</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that really resonated with me is</v>

2957
02:29:14.991 --> 02:29:17.570
<v Speaker 5>that he likes to write.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes every day and one of the</v>

2958
02:29:17.571 --> 02:29:22.571
<v Speaker 5>things that the reasons why he likes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>write is it makes him solidify his own</v>

2959
02:29:22.761 --> 02:29:24.980
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He thinks about his own thoughts and it</v>

2960
02:29:24.981 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 5>really sort of like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It allows him to really,</v>

2961
02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:33.760
<v Speaker 5>really kind of examined them and go in</v>
<v Speaker 5>depth as to how he really truly feels</v>

2962
02:29:35.001 --> 02:29:38.870
<v Speaker 5>about something and really get a cleaner</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective instead of just,</v>

2963
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:41.690
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me included,</v>

2964
02:29:41.691 --> 02:29:44.210
<v Speaker 5>I've been guilty of this in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We operate on momentum.</v>

2965
02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:47.840
<v Speaker 5>We just get a path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're on it for some whatever reason</v>

2966
02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:51.470
<v Speaker 5>and then just sort of stuck and you just</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of behave that way and think that</v>

2967
02:29:51.471 --> 02:29:56.471
<v Speaker 5>way and you don't ever examine it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing allows you to really pause and</v>

2968
02:29:57.261 --> 02:30:00.260
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Podcasting does the same and a lot of</v>

2969
02:30:00.261 --> 02:30:02.300
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It allows me to pause and really think</v>

2970
02:30:02.301 --> 02:30:05.970
<v Speaker 5>about some of the things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>attached myself to or not attached</v>

2971
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.823
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>

2972
02:30:06.970 --> 02:30:09.290
<v Speaker 2>And it's recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be able to</v>

2973
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.980
<v Speaker 5>recorded the shits live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2974
02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:12.981
<v Speaker 5>So it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whew,</v>

2975
02:30:12.981 --> 02:30:13.900
<v Speaker 5>it is you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's you.</v>

2976
02:30:13.901 --> 02:30:14.960
<v Speaker 5>It's who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2977
02:30:14.961 --> 02:30:18.370
<v Speaker 5>and all for good or for bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get to see negative aspects of</v>

2978
02:30:18.371 --> 02:30:21.490
<v Speaker 5>the way you think and the way you talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you get to see the</v>

2979
02:30:21.491 --> 02:30:23.680
<v Speaker 5>repercussions of those and you get to</v>
<v Speaker 5>consider like,</v>

2980
02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:26.350
<v Speaker 5>why did I think that way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was I just,</v>

2981
02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:31.600
<v Speaker 5>was it just a knee jerk reaction?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it just was tired that day?</v>

2982
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:36.870
<v Speaker 5>Was I not respecting the medium?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was I not respecting the power of these</v>

2983
02:30:37.871 --> 02:30:41.920
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and these conversations?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most likely a combination of all those</v>

2984
02:30:41.921 --> 02:30:46.180
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but through the personal growth that is</v>

2985
02:30:46.181 --> 02:30:51.181
<v Speaker 5>a been afforded me by the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's helped me in as much as it's helped</v>

2986
02:30:53.291 --> 02:30:54.220
<v Speaker 5>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2987
02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:58.150
<v Speaker 5>it's helped me tremendously and having</v>
<v Speaker 5>these kinds of conversations with people</v>

2988
02:30:58.151 --> 02:30:59.470
<v Speaker 5>like you are a giant part of that.</v>

2989
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to take the stuff that</v>

2990
02:31:03.660 --> 02:31:06.620
<v Speaker 2>relates to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2991
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't sing your praises enough for</v>

2992
02:31:08.131 --> 02:31:13.131
<v Speaker 2>having that kind of mentality and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha male that is vulnerable and</v>

2993
02:31:13.381 --> 02:31:15.320
<v Speaker 2>lets other people see that it's okay</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2994
02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Those things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2995
02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:19.020
<v Speaker 2>it's okay for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the tough guys,</v>

2996
02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:23.970
<v Speaker 2>is that to let their guard down and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>introspective and to be people that are</v>

2997
02:31:23.971 --> 02:31:28.230
<v Speaker 2>willing to help and reach out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely admirable.</v>

2998
02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk is another person that I've gotten</v>

2999
02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:34.350
<v Speaker 2>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've had him on here and say his name.</v>

3000
02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that you say right.</v>

3001
02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:36.750
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3002
02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:39.120
<v Speaker 2>he jokes about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How like people that have known him his</v>

3003
02:31:39.121 --> 02:31:40.890
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3004
02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:42.360
<v Speaker 2>It's Jank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3005
02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3006
02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3007
02:31:43.810 --> 02:31:46.990
<v Speaker 5>Well the young Turks with what they've</v>
<v Speaker 5>done is they've developed a sort of</v>

3008
02:31:47.050 --> 02:31:51.550
<v Speaker 5>alternative media platform that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside of the mainstream media,</v>

3009
02:31:51.551 --> 02:31:56.551
<v Speaker 5>but it has arguably as much impact when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at what they've been able to do</v>

3010
02:31:57.071 --> 02:31:59.260
<v Speaker 5>on youtube and they're one of many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3011
02:31:59.261 --> 02:32:03.400
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are pushing</v>
<v Speaker 5>unusual ideas on the internet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And so we went and we participated in</v>

3045
02:33:34.521 --> 02:33:37.910
<v Speaker 2>the march and got arrested in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>DC.</v>

3046
02:33:37.930 --> 02:33:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Why did you get arrested for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the charge?</v>

3047
02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Like loitering or some bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3048
02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>I forget how they completely worded it.</v>

3049
02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:48.720
<v Speaker 5>And so it's because you were protesting</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a public area and blocking traffic or</v>

3050
02:33:48.721 --> 02:33:49.250
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

3051
02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:51.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nobody trying to go into or</v>

3052
02:33:51.951 --> 02:33:53.900
<v Speaker 2>out of the capital and that's where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

3053
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they wouldn't be able to if they did</v>

3054
02:33:56.451 --> 02:33:59.330
<v Speaker 2>want to because you guys were away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3055
02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:00.680
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of loitering,</v>

3056
02:34:00.681 --> 02:34:03.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that does get attention to what</v>

3057
02:34:03.561 --> 02:34:05.840
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The largest mass arrests in DC history.</v>

3058
02:34:05.841 --> 02:34:08.360
<v Speaker 2>It was like a 200 and some of us that</v>
<v Speaker 2>got arrested the first day.</v>

3059
02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like 450 overall.</v>

3060
02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have,</v>

3061
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:16.760
<v Speaker 2>we have some good pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Jamie that website's not working.</v>

3062
02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's maywood photography.</v>

3063
02:34:19.361 --> 02:34:23.740
<v Speaker 2>M a e l w o o d o,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my phone.</v>

3064
02:34:23.741 --> 02:34:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3065
02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:28.590
<v Speaker 2>so what were the cops like when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested him?</v>

3066
02:34:28.591 --> 02:34:29.231
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

3067
02:34:29.231 --> 02:34:31.150
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a restaurant or they're being</v>

3068
02:34:31.151 --> 02:34:34.340
<v Speaker 2>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are still being text,</v>

3069
02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:38.620
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably considering it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see this crowd,</v>

3070
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:42.010
<v Speaker 2>so they were treating you like an actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal even though it's pretty obvious</v>

3071
02:34:42.011 --> 02:34:45.670
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to campaign against</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's something that nobody</v>

3072
02:34:45.671 --> 02:34:48.030
<v Speaker 2>really thinks is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money and politics.</v>

3073
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:49.510
<v Speaker 2>The lieutenant said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3074
02:34:49.511 --> 02:34:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that you guys are out here</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

3075
02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lieutenant said,</v>

3076
02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are capital police.</v>

3077
02:34:56.190 --> 02:34:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've sang their praises before,</v>

3078
02:34:59.350 --> 02:35:02.420
<v Speaker 2>but they don't face a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they hadn't.</v>

3079
02:35:02.421 --> 02:35:03.500
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's jake.</v>

3080
02:35:06.210 --> 02:35:09.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's a captain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray Lewis.</v>

3081
02:35:09.131 --> 02:35:11.800
<v Speaker 2>He also was arrested and he wears his</v>
<v Speaker 2>uniform,</v>

3082
02:35:11.801 --> 02:35:13.390
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a retired Philadelphia,</v>

3083
02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 2>a police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wore his uniform and he got</v>

3084
02:35:17.081 --> 02:35:20.920
<v Speaker 2>arrested in his uniform and they took it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign and threw it away and they charged</v>

3085
02:35:20.921 --> 02:35:21.161
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

3086
02:35:21.161 --> 02:35:25.630
<v Speaker 2>what does the sign say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massive civil scratched out.</v>

3087
02:35:25.930 --> 02:35:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Disobedience is next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warning.</v>

3088
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Massive disobedience is next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

3089
02:35:31.570 --> 02:35:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm assuming what he means by</v>

3090
02:35:35.111 --> 02:35:37.600
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now the disobedience is civil,</v>

3091
02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:39.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're protesting.</v>

3092
02:35:39.451 --> 02:35:44.451
<v Speaker 2>We were doing things like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm flabbergasted that the</v>

3093
02:35:44.741 --> 02:35:48.730
<v Speaker 2>black community in these neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't really said enough,</v>

3094
02:35:48.731 --> 02:35:52.310
<v Speaker 2>is enough yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that we,</v>

3095
02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:55.970
<v Speaker 2>they have children and family members</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying in the streets.</v>

3096
02:35:55.971 --> 02:35:57.430
<v Speaker 2>They're probably scared to get arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3097
02:35:57.500 --> 02:35:58.800
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just,</v>

3098
02:35:59.030 --> 02:36:00.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a breaking point that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

3099
02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's trying to say is.</v>

3100
02:36:02.250 --> 02:36:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And what I've tried to don't scroll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up with the dudes with the nose</v>

3101
02:36:06.431 --> 02:36:08.110
<v Speaker 2>ring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck's going on there?</v>

3102
02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:08.861
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

3103
02:36:08.861 --> 02:36:10.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an actual,</v>

3104
02:36:10.770 --> 02:36:13.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember tribe he's from and he</v>

3105
02:36:13.301 --> 02:36:16.090
<v Speaker 2>participates in a lot of these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what to do with the Musket.</v>

3106
02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>J side.</v>

3107
02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:23.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A musket when I was only seeing the tip</v>

3108
02:36:23.231 --> 02:36:24.310
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3109
02:36:24.850 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 2>The tip of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a just a musket tip.</v>

3110
02:36:28.930 --> 02:36:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Never just a tip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fall.</v>

3111
02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:31.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3112
02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dollars in.</v>

3113
02:36:34.421 --> 02:36:36.580
<v Speaker 2>What does that scroll down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dollars in politics.</v>

3114
02:36:36.610 --> 02:36:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Grass ranch out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's essentially just a bunch of</v>

3115
02:36:40.421 --> 02:36:43.030
<v Speaker 2>people standing in a place where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government didn't think you should be</v>

3116
02:36:43.031 --> 02:36:44.400
<v Speaker 2>able to stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3117
02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And we kinda keep drawing attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this money in politics because I really</v>

3118
02:36:47.621 --> 02:36:49.480
<v Speaker 2>think that's the root.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the root of everything.</v>

3119
02:36:49.481 --> 02:36:51.250
<v Speaker 2>We can't end the drug war because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

3120
02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>We can't move anything forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do police reform because of</v>

3121
02:36:57.281 --> 02:36:59.770
<v Speaker 2>this democracy spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're calling it.</v>

3122
02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the one day.</v>

3123
02:37:00.701 --> 02:37:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Different groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different days.</v>

3124
02:37:01.991 --> 02:37:04.720
<v Speaker 2>So it was a whole week long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the first day was the biggest</v>

3125
02:37:04.721 --> 02:37:08.020
<v Speaker 2>day and you'll have me in handcuffs at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end eventually.</v>

3126
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:12.760
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long did you have to stay in jail</v>

3127
02:37:12.761 --> 02:37:15.860
<v Speaker 2>for the night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no annoying.</v>

3128
02:37:16.270 --> 02:37:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Well it wasn't snoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a real jail.</v>

3129
02:37:17.901 --> 02:37:22.120
<v Speaker 2>There were so many people that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like they were keeping us in like</v>

3130
02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:25.640
<v Speaker 2>animal pens and felt like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we would just be like panned off.</v>

3131
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Like they I think took us to a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and had like a,</v>

3132
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:32.740
<v Speaker 2>like fences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like portable fences and they will punch</v>

3133
02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:35.900
<v Speaker 2>you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you really couldn't get</v>

3134
02:37:35.901 --> 02:37:37.700
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get out if you want it to.</v>

3135
02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I guess I could have if I really wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3136
02:37:39.321 --> 02:37:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going to go for an escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>charge.</v>

3137
02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:47.120
<v Speaker 2>This is so silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but seems like so the dumb way to handle</v>

3138
02:37:47.121 --> 02:37:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's smiling,</v>

3139
02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:52.970
<v Speaker 2>getting handcuffed as you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty white crowd.</v>

3140
02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:54.143
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

3141
02:37:54.210 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 2>So I think that helps on the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>police act.</v>

3142
02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Like some people just psyched to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with Cenk.</v>

3143
02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3144
02:38:02.330 --> 02:38:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an example of another thing.</v>

3145
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can go and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in these things.</v>

3146
02:38:07.530 --> 02:38:12.080
<v Speaker 2>So if that is a passion of yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's another identity thing</v>

3147
02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:13.400
<v Speaker 2>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

3148
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:16.520
<v Speaker 2>you can go and see these groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all these groups out there and</v>

3149
02:38:16.521 --> 02:38:19.970
<v Speaker 2>like you're saying that these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel lost and they're turning to two</v>

3150
02:38:19.971 --> 02:38:22.670
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have all these things out there</v>

3151
02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:26.420
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't have one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create one.</v>

3152
02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:30.110
<v Speaker 2>There are out there like the tyt family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your family,</v>

3153
02:38:30.111 --> 02:38:33.740
<v Speaker 2>like black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have tons of of movements going on</v>

3154
02:38:33.741 --> 02:38:36.110
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do something positive with</v>

3155
02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:37.550
<v Speaker 2>no matter who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3156
02:38:37.551 --> 02:38:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So tell us one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the name of this podcast and when</v>

3157
02:38:41.511 --> 02:38:43.130
<v Speaker 2>do you hope this thing's going to start?</v>

3158
02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.640
<v Speaker 2>So name of the podcast or the radio</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now it's called,</v>

3159
02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:49.040
<v Speaker 2>it's called radio revolver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just the umbrella.</v>

3160
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Why Radio Revolver about guns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3161
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:55.100
<v Speaker 2>we finally had that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I revolving door,</v>

3162
02:38:55.101 --> 02:38:57.080
<v Speaker 2>like a prison cell is how I envisioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3163
02:38:57.081 --> 02:38:58.670
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to use like a gun logo and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

3164
02:38:58.680 --> 02:38:58.941
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3165
02:38:58.941 --> 02:38:59.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3166
02:38:59.181 --> 02:39:01.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that radio revolver,</v>

3167
02:39:01.461 --> 02:39:03.080
<v Speaker 2>podcast network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3168
02:39:03.081 --> 02:39:05.840
<v Speaker 2>So here's some of the friends that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>made that are activists around and</v>

3169
02:39:05.841 --> 02:39:07.340
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely be ones that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3170
02:39:07.341 --> 02:39:10.970
<v Speaker 2>We were doing a serial show and we took</v>
<v Speaker 2>that picture and so the donating is for</v>

3171
02:39:10.971 --> 02:39:15.170
<v Speaker 2>equipment and for rental space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The space was donated by sod.</v>

3172
02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:18.500
<v Speaker 2>It's basement of his house all blocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>off and done.</v>

3173
02:39:18.501 --> 02:39:20.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have that done.</v>

3174
02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you need to.</v>

3175
02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:23.570
<v Speaker 2>We're still just getting the last bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment.</v>

3176
02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:26.570
<v Speaker 2>We have some of the local artists</v>
<v Speaker 2>painting the walls now.</v>

3177
02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're close.</v>

3178
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:31.950
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like maybe $3,000 and I'm a and w</v>

3179
02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:35.630
<v Speaker 2>we're were set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let me know when you guys launch</v>

3180
02:39:35.631 --> 02:39:38.720
<v Speaker 2>and I will absolutely tweeted out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let everybody be aware of it.</v>

3181
02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:42.680
<v Speaker 2>The first one is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

3182
02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:46.010
<v Speaker 2>part of the part of the thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do is we take advantage of,</v>

3183
02:39:46.050 --> 02:39:51.050
<v Speaker 2>of me right in the publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first one is going to be a joint</v>

3184
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:56.290
<v Speaker 2>project with undisclosed who is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliate with serial story and all and</v>

3185
02:39:57.980 --> 02:40:01.520
<v Speaker 2>that one's going to be a misconduct</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to be one of the series</v>

3186
02:40:01.521 --> 02:40:03.380
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's gonna be multiple podcasts.</v>

3187
02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is going to be misconduct</v>

3188
02:40:05.691 --> 02:40:07.620
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll have like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>photography warner,</v>

3189
02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:10.020
<v Speaker 2>you have a public health one like doc</v>
<v Speaker 2>large brown is,</v>

3190
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:11.570
<v Speaker 2>is going to do a public health one.</v>

3191
02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>So you're essentially building a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole station.</v>

3192
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

3193
02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody that wants in,</v>

3194
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:18.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you learn what you're doing</v>

3195
02:40:18.541 --> 02:40:20.040
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be able to have your voice</v>

3196
02:40:20.041 --> 02:40:23.310
<v Speaker 2>heard in whichever manner you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea because you know,</v>

3197
02:40:23.311 --> 02:40:27.460
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the easiest ways to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>message out and the message that you</v>

3198
02:40:27.470 --> 02:40:27.960
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3199
02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:29.940
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear someone talk man,</v>

3200
02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:34.560
<v Speaker 2>and you hear their words and you get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know them through the hours and hours of</v>

3201
02:40:34.561 --> 02:40:37.200
<v Speaker 2>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to know him in a really deep,</v>

3202
02:40:37.201 --> 02:40:39.600
<v Speaker 2>intimate way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're assigning example ivy,</v>

3203
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:42.140
<v Speaker 2>you walk around and everybody to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3204
02:40:42.330 --> 02:40:43.880
<v Speaker 2>People hugged me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know my baby.</v>

3205
02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:45.360
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3206
02:40:45.361 --> 02:40:48.420
<v Speaker 2>So the first one's called misconduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to be a series and I'm</v>

3207
02:40:48.421 --> 02:40:51.690
<v Speaker 2>going to do the first one and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the killing of Freddie Gray.</v>

3208
02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:55.530
<v Speaker 2>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to do for that is go</v>

3209
02:40:55.531 --> 02:40:59.550
<v Speaker 2>through the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we first go through the story,</v>

3210
02:40:59.610 --> 02:41:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the first episode will start and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>start telling what happened.</v>

3211
02:41:03.271 --> 02:41:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these cops are in this neighborhood</v>

3212
02:41:04.921 --> 02:41:06.780
<v Speaker 2>and Freddie gray is in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we go,</v>

3213
02:41:06.781 --> 02:41:08.940
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does it look this way?</v>

3214
02:41:10.050 --> 02:41:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And then so like somebody like doc brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>will come in and we're go over through</v>

3215
02:41:14.131 --> 02:41:17.190
<v Speaker 2>the history of segregation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the neighborhoods are formed,</v>

3216
02:41:17.191 --> 02:41:19.530
<v Speaker 2>the way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the cops were all white,</v>

3217
02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.560
<v Speaker 2>why the citizens are all black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll go explain that story and then</v>

3218
02:41:24.631 --> 02:41:28.710
<v Speaker 2>the next episode I'll start over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start telling the story and when we hit</v>

3219
02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:31.710
<v Speaker 2>the next hurdle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will be something like,</v>

3220
02:41:31.711 --> 02:41:33.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are they going after him for the</v>

3221
02:41:33.721 --> 02:41:36.360
<v Speaker 2>drugs and why are they chasing him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3222
02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 2>so then we're breakdown the history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laws and why the why that is done</v>

3223
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:42.210
<v Speaker 2>the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What policing philosophies of led to</v>

3224
02:41:42.211 --> 02:41:44.610
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until we finish out the entire story and</v>

3225
02:41:44.611 --> 02:41:49.200
<v Speaker 2>everybody can understand the nuance to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened behind the murder of</v>

3226
02:41:49.201 --> 02:41:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Freddie Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right man.</v>
