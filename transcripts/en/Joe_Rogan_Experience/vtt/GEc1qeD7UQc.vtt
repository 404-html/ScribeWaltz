1
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys are banging into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee</v>

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're jumping into swamps and English</v>

3
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>royalties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homes</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>like to be introduced together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get very careful when you get</v>

5
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>into those sort of predicament in</v>
<v Speaker 1>beheading around every corner when she</v>

6
00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>messed with the royal family's private</v>
<v Speaker 1>swamps,</v>

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're doing it for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a psychedelic purpose.</v>

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.300
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to elevate yourself by</v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing yourself in there.</v>

9
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swampy waters,</v>

10
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>freeing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're embarking on a journey of</v>

11
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>personal shamanism on royal territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life's in your hands.</v>

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Your life could shrivel up as quickly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sex organs did in that particular</v>

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>predicament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely an added element.</v>

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>The ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to consider it.</v>

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not a place to go for pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as I like,</v>

17
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I was sort of submerged in</v>

18
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what those.</v>

19
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Because even that is just the.</v>

20
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an example of me,</v>

21
00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>a man simply jumping into cold lake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have a tendency to over poeticize</v>

22
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>the mundane experiences of me everyday</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

23
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>but why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are we going to do while were</v>

24
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did make me think.</v>

25
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.430
<v Speaker 1>We are living on narrow lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow train tracks of existence,</v>

26
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>never to have hurt myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got</v>

27
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>animal nor capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that sort of almost like an anti</v>

28
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:24.790
<v Speaker 1>orgasm like a negative repeat with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would before what you said before you</v>

29
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>got on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it represents the subconscious and</v>

30
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:32.521
<v Speaker 1>that going into the murky depths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That main role is is in fairy stories,</v>

31
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>myths and religion person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not already,</v>

32
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>you reckon you'd world love is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or an American scholar called Joseph</v>

33
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Campbell who was a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologist and he studied various</v>

34
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>religions and folk towels and found</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corolla and comparisons and</v>

35
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>consistencies and and sort of said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are consistencies,</v>

36
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>there's true.</v>

37
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>If there's some Icelandic myth and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling basically at the same story,</v>

38
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>some African story of some native</v>
<v Speaker 1>American story or some daft Celtic folk</v>

39
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are human beings dislocated all over</v>

40
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up the same stories,</v>

41
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>coming up the same experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>often in these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forest is used as the unconscious,</v>

43
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 1>not only the forest represents the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

44
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>often in mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know when a character has to go</v>

45
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 1>into the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you've got to go into</v>

46
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to go into new</v>

47
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:22.411
<v Speaker 1>territory and also under the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly also represents</v>

48
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness and will interest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>baton.</v>

49
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Is like not only ancient mythologies</v>

50
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 1>and old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also personal dreams.</v>

51
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>If you yourself have a drug like this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the work of Joseph Campbell in sex</v>

52
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>with a worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl young dude,</v>

53
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>he like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He noticed that people in their personal</v>

54
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>myths that drives your cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said dreams are private myths.</v>

55
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Myths are public dreams in people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal dreams.</v>

56
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 1>They come up with images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes and stories that can also be</v>

57
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 1>found in fairy tales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>just someone asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

59
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just walking and I went into the</v>

60
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>woods and I met this old woman in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods and she told me that everything</v>

61
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>was going to be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she put up a hood and winch</v>

62
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>took a hood down again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my mother's face.</v>

63
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.910
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are inventing their own myths</v>

64
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>like that because of course all culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>is created by consciousness,</v>

65
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>so on some level it's in us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in US individually.</v>

66
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell's work is amazing and</v>

67
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 1>when you do look at all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and how they coincide and how,</v>

68
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>how many similarities they share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is really interesting to see what are</v>

69
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>people trying to accomplish with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes,</v>

70
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>like what are they trying to sort out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like that has to be</v>

71
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>some things.</v>

72
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Lessons passed down to children than to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass down to other people so they can</v>

73
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>learn things without having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience the woods themselves.</v>

74
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes that they're sort of defining</v>

75
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the reality around them in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar way all over the world.</v>

76
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what I record joe is the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse our culture,</v>

77
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>but like know it's weird isn't because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to live with globalization</v>

78
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>and homogenization were cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corporatism is coming uniform for our</v>

79
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also there are many,</v>

80
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many disparate experiences,</v>

81
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but on some level as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are anatomically as similar as we</v>

82
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's safe to assume that we're</v>

83
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>psychologically comparatively similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

84
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>even though you and I also so different</v>
<v Speaker 1>body types or whatever and look sort of</v>

85
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>at a glance kind of dealing with both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately you've got the same organs</v>

86
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>with running in pretty much the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps we have the same</v>

87
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>psychological Palette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so throughout the world people are.</v>

88
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's having a very similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of being human.</v>

89
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>The anxiety of not being good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of death,</v>

90
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>constantly looking for something in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world that's gonna solve the</v>

91
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>problems that's going to answer your</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and like in a lot of these</v>

92
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>ancient texts that I've mostly got at</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

93
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hinduism for beginners,</v>

94
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>that's normally my entry point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Uma auto didact,</v>

95
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>self taught person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things I love about</v>

96
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:45.840
<v Speaker 1>your podcast is that can you can hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

97
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>This is a person educated themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing to educate themselves through</v>

98
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that are picked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in that.</v>

100
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Indian very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ancient texts.</v>

101
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>There are people that the same way as in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

102
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>like in our our time that's defined by</v>
<v Speaker 1>science and technology.</v>

103
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>There were times where people define</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves through meditation and</v>

104
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>experiences in income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in consciousness.</v>

105
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Like those people that wrote say the</v>
<v Speaker 1>upanishads,</v>

106
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>whoever the hell they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ratios,</v>

107
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>these ancient Indian yogis that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>into deep,</v>

108
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>deep meditative states and came back</v>
<v Speaker 1>with mantras and truves.</v>

109
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Those people are as diligent and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>fastidious as a scientist in a</v>

110
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>laboratory that comes back and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

111
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:23.501
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:24.470
<v Speaker 1>we've broke down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Watson and Crick break it down the DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come back and go,</v>

114
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are going to die.</v>

115
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>You need to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to come to terms with the</v>

116
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>relationship between your contract sale</v>
<v Speaker 1>for new material self.</v>

117
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

118
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the stuff like that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that I'm into and that's</v>

119
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>why whenever I find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it comes from Joseph Campbell</v>

120
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>or young or even checking out this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

121
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of stuff can hancock Graham</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Cox into that.</v>

122
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Always a pressie something deep in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm always looking for,</v>

123
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:52.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

124
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>the moment we think that shutter you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's truth in there,</v>

125
00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Well those pass that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

127
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 2>those paths that are carved in that we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sort of normalize all the experiences</v>

128
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 2>that we have so they look totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally sane.</v>

129
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>If you just straight off those paths and</v>
<v Speaker 2>jump into that Lake and freeze your Dick</v>

130
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 2>off and get out and you just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did I do that?</v>

131
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 2>What are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You broke your little Jane,</v>

132
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>the little chain of programming that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in your brain.</v>

133
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 2>You did something completely unusual and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just little things like that</v>

134
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 2>little deviations off of that path will</v>
<v Speaker 2>take you into a completely different</v>

135
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:27.944
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

136
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Are you still doing that kind of thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your life now?</v>

137
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

138
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.920
<v Speaker 2>That all the time with wherever it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cryo chambers or the isolation tanks or</v>

139
00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:45.241
<v Speaker 2>the experiences with WESCO and ask it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've done a lot of dmt with the more</v>

140
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Speaker 2>potent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shorter lasting form.</v>

141
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I've read accounts on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>

142
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm in recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so allegedly things can be rearranged if</v>

143
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.070
<v Speaker 2>you're in recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with recovery is,</v>

144
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 2>if you want to maintain complete and</v>
<v Speaker 2>total sobriety,</v>

146
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 2>the only way to allegedly have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

147
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and apparently it is possible is through</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kundalini and.</v>

148
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.090
<v Speaker 2>But according to people I know that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>done both,</v>

149
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.970
<v Speaker 2>they've done dmt and they've also done</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kundalini.</v>

150
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 2>It's virtually the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

151
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 2>God can be reaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

152
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.540
<v Speaker 2>You just have to be completely dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Kundalini practice.</v>

153
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to a very specific state</v>

154
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.870
<v Speaker 2>that's achievable once you have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastery.</v>

155
00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Over the meditation and the Yoga</v>
<v Speaker 2>Principles,</v>

156
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I've done a fair bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kundalini Yoga,</v>

157
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Bang into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

158
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:40.591
<v Speaker 3>this toe on my forefinger here is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>illustration by Carl Young of the</v>

159
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Kundalini serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The energy to come rises up.</v>

160
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Your animal energy can become the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coronated serp and bloodier getting that</v>

161
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 3>toe down and I woke up in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the night,</v>

162
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 3>severely regretting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my thing go.</v>

163
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly because Mark Mahoney,</v>

164
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:59.800
<v Speaker 3>the La tattooist that became sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat besotted with him because he</v>

165
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:03.330
<v Speaker 3>would kind of like some sort of living</v>
<v Speaker 3>skeleton Elvis guy.</v>

166
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.670
<v Speaker 3>He mean so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sort of charming and enchanting.</v>

167
00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:09.480
<v Speaker 3>I kept getting myself just silica him</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

168
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.560
<v Speaker 3>He appeared briefly in that film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black mass,</v>

169
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 3>that Johnny Depp Film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw it.</v>

170
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie.</v>

171
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

172
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.740
<v Speaker 3>He has a cameo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the beginning of that you sort of got</v>

173
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 3>blue ringtail was hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of a fascinating guy and a</v>

174
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.110
<v Speaker 3>literal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

175
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 3>art is the proper tattoo artist.</v>

176
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.210
<v Speaker 3>People you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fast at these diode,</v>

177
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 3>like gangster crime overlords</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidents.</v>

178
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's done sort of like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

179
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but he's got a very easy way and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a gentle kindness.</v>

180
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 3>He told me this story once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

181
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you'd mind me repeating this</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the media world when it used to be an</v>

182
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 3>intravenous junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in New York City and then you'd</v>

183
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:47.230
<v Speaker 3>like wandering along on the way to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>party and he saw a homeless fellow doing</v>

184
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 3>paint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia sort of for me and I'll get</v>

185
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.700
<v Speaker 3>those paintings and he bought these</v>
<v Speaker 3>paintings off this homeless guy and then</v>

186
00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 3>he went onto this part and then he went</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shot up in the bathroom and then he</v>

187
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>heard a flurry of excitement at this</v>

188
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 1>New York party because Andy Warhol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Warhol was arriving at the Party</v>

189
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and Warhol came upstairs and he said he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could hear like the acolytes around war,</v>

190
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 1>how and he said he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just banged up and he's getting a hit</v>

191
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>and his eyes are rolling and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling fantastic and here's warhol</v>

192
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>outside the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mark Mahoney had left some of his</v>

193
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>paintings out there along with the works</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that homeless guy.</v>

194
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:17.541
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

195
00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

196
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.350

<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

197
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Like looking at this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:20.941
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mahoney.</v>

200
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying here banging up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smack in a bathroom wall,</v>

201
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>house out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig in my work,</v>

202
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and of course when he went out it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the homeless guy.</v>

203
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Stuff into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>

205
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Your coffee's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate.</v>

206
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm passing my tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know what I'm saying.</v>

207
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>So amazingly powerful for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it because I'm drug free for 13</v>

208
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe and.</v>

209
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as I was saying Kundalini,</v>

210
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't and ever take you to a crazy</v>

211
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic state as I did when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>using drugs.</v>

212
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I did psychedelics and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had that kind of like,</v>

213
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I loved drugs.</v>

214
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>But you never had a breakthrough moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>on psychedelics.</v>

215
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that realization.</v>

216
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>What are considered to be myself was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction and it wasn't real,</v>

217
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but like my memories and my perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my desires are just a conglomeration</v>

218
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>of biochemical impulses that Pew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm merely a conduit of pure</v>

219
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's too heavy to deal with when</v>

220
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you're bloody 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my mates were just doing it at</v>

221
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:23.470
<v Speaker 1>school and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>carrying on like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do psychedelics at the</v>

223
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>hospital where a person monitoring my</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart going to be all right.</v>

224
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it under normal conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

225
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:36.630

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>pretty committed sex addict for a</v>

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 1>You might want to dip your feet back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pond.</v>

232
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So you say this job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is</v>

233
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.910
<v Speaker 1>the problem is with me is I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your experience.</v>

234
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I know where your addictive tendencies</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

235
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have them for sure,</v>

236
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.920
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do they come out?</v>

237
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>games or get addicted really badly to</v>

238
00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>

239
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.060
<v Speaker 2>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted very badly to shooting bows</v>

240
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 2>and arrows and he used to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:13.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoot.</v>

242
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at it.</v>

243
00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Robin Hood Style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

244
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't use a recurve bow or use a</v>
<v Speaker 2>compound bow,</v>

245
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 2>like a very complicated high powered</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparatus.</v>

246
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Shoots very accurately out to 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>

247
00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:27.850
<v Speaker 2>90 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

248
00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I practice it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

249
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.500
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very.</v>

250
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

251
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's something about when you</v>

252
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.160
<v Speaker 2>require so much concentration when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pulling a pullback and anchoring</v>

253
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:41.150
<v Speaker 2>and relaxing and centering the bow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure everything's level and</v>

254
00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and there's no excess movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

255
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:46.910
<v Speaker 2>As you release the Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this very,</v>

256
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:49.940
<v Speaker 2>very difficult little dance of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>synapses that you're doing.</v>

257
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 2>And in that dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no room for any extraneous</v>

258
00:11:52.551 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about your bills,</v>

259
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 2>your bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life death.</v>

260
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't think about anything but no</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

261
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Release that Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely properly watched it sink into</v>

262
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>the Bullseye and when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly satisfying.</v>

263
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 2>It must be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there some visualization involved in</v>

264
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

265
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 2>you definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people who will actually</v>

266
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 2>get better from not even practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get better from visualizing.</v>

267
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>More than practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

268
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 2>That they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just go over the actual physical</v>

269
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 2>mechanics of the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visualize it locking in,</v>

270
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big thing with competitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>target archers,</v>

271
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 2>the visualization aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go to hypnotists and they really</v>

272
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 2>work on like a very specific pattern</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they visualize,</v>

273
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>like a very specific pattern of drawing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bow back,</v>

274
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 2>finding your anchor point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect release Arrow flying perfectly,</v>

275
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 2>and in doing that they sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioned their mind and their body to</v>

276
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 2>make that perfect shot over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over again,</v>

277
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's so difficult to do that.</v>

278
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Even the best people fuck up the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones in the world and the Olympic</v>

279
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 2>archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll occasionally,</v>

280
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the line and get a nine or an</v>

281
00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 2>eight and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know why they'd been doing it</v>

282
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 2>seven hours a day for fucking 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

283
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult that it net you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no mastery.</v>

284
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:09.440
<v Speaker 2>You never totally master it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's variable.</v>

285
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.840
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go into a hypnotist and try to</v>

286
00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 2>hit bullseye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

287
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 2>well imagine if that was your light in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

288
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that was how you made a</v>
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>

289
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.290
<v Speaker 2>how much you make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to be a narrative.</v>

290
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

291
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I know there's the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

292
00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 2>and so you can get sponsors from both</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies like [inaudible] and companies</v>

293
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 2>that sell arrows and things along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>

294
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

295
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a practice that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in,</v>

296
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 2>so I would imagine it's probably more</v>
<v Speaker 2>money than you think there is.</v>

297
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

298
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even at the fairs are towards your</v>

299
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.720
<v Speaker 2>drawers for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the tricky thing is this doesn't.</v>

300
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're.</v>

301
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 2>If you're a professional boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very specific set of skills.</v>

302
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

303
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 2>You know how to box floyd mayweather is</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>

304
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 2>God Damn sure he knows exactly what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck he's doing,</v>

305
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but this isn't like boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anybody.</v>

306
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 2>You can teach anybody to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

307
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:05.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take any ridiculously</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinated athletic movements,</v>

308
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 2>some unusual genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some fast twitch muscle fibers.</v>

309
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Now you just pull the bow back and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>release the Arrow.</v>

310
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 2>So to make a living doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to decide that I'm going to do something</v>

311
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.810
<v Speaker 2>that I could teach anybody to do in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

312
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I can take any regular person and work</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their footwork,</v>

313
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.570
<v Speaker 2>their stance rather and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>positioning and teach them how to shoot</v>

314
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:22.900
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>

315
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breathing out of concentrate and relax.</v>

316
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 2>You can get them shooting fairly</v>
<v Speaker 2>proficiently inside of four or five</v>

317
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine taking that to a level where</v>

318
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you're going to travel the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete and just shoot at Bulls eyes for</v>

319
00:14:35.171 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>your kids food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

320
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of other people that are no</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than you.</v>

321
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of those guys.</v>

322
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I know quite a few of those guys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced me.</v>

323
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.160
<v Speaker 2>I will introduce you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love to meet a professional guy that</v>

324
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll introduce you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy who trained me,</v>

325
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.170
<v Speaker 2>John Dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next time he's in La and you're in La,</v>

326
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>we'll make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a</v>

327
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 1>good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to learn about that madness.</v>

328
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand motivation.</v>

329
00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.911
<v Speaker 1>Jimbo to unravel this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no person who's devoted their life to</v>

330
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:07.241
<v Speaker 1>hitting the bullseye</v>
<v Speaker 1>that led him to this point of mastery.</v>

331
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't make you feel insecure about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnosis session.</v>

332
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you do yoga at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ma'Am?</v>

333
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Do like regular yoga or Kundalini,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often you do it?</v>

334
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I try and do yoga two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my exercise regimen change.</v>

335
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Not entirely unrelated to listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast.</v>

336
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I like now do kickboxing once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do Jujitsu once a week and honestly</v>

337
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>it's influenced me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mate Nick got me into your podcast</v>

338
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people that I hang out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

339
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of in there as you obviously know,</v>

340
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but even in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mixed martial art world,</v>

341
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>this is a very central cultural artifact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it intersects with thinking</v>

342
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:49.890
<v Speaker 1>outside the box and a new vision of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is to be a man and living outside of</v>

343
00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>sort of state ideals and air</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

344
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>

345
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.770
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

346
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm fascinated about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>these new,</v>

347
00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.050
<v Speaker 1>like new ways of being a man like ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having tend to nurse awareness awakeness</v>

348
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.850
<v Speaker 1>but not being afraid or indeed ashamed</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the aspects of masculinity that have</v>

349
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 1>somehow become cleverly maligned over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last few generations.</v>

350
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.700
<v Speaker 1>So like may I say like a shout out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the northwest and Paul busby because</v>

351
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:21.210
<v Speaker 1>they're the people side terminal people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I do like.</v>

352
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a shout out to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt I was ridiculous there for</v>

353
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>English and it was a hate crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw that.</v>

354
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I was giving them a shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

355
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually.</v>

356
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:33.890
<v Speaker 1>That's another great one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no.</v>

357
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:36.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that the English accent</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the greatest accent.</v>

358
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:38.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why I use it for all noble</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

359
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Any time there's a god or any sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

360
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you're speaking in a foreign language</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've translated to English.</v>

361
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 1>They have an English accent or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thrones,</v>

362
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 1>gladiator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody squats revolutions after all</v>

363
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>of your economic success and Global</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dominion when it comes to an authority</v>

364
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:59.380
<v Speaker 1>figure used to come down from on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

365
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 1>you still can't have God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is actually still have a sort of</v>

366
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 1>sense of realness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones,</v>

367
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>reverence for the regal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all.</v>

368
00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>They all speak some strange language</v>
<v Speaker 1>during some place with dragons.</v>

369
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.570
<v Speaker 1>It's all artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

370
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.400
<v Speaker 1>But yet they all speak with an English</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

371
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 1>No reason why they should not be from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Detroit.</v>

372
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

373
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

374
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:22.110
<v Speaker 1>you fucking guys were coming over here</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to fuck our broad</v>

375
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>fucking balls and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

376
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking dragons in Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black in your dragons ask you to leave</v>

377
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 1>the court because you've really loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tone some lot.</v>

378
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the opposite of going off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course.</v>

379
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 1>It's going so deep into the chorus that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's wearing powdered wigs and</v>

380
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 1>they're all aligning with some ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrolls that they've pulled out of a jar</v>

381
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and a fucking cave and come somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it</v>

382
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 2>has been decreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say everything's going to be</v>

383
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:53.420
<v Speaker 2>proper.</v>

384
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting deep.</v>

385
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what I count on you guys for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>English properly and rely on us from now</v>

386
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.200
<v Speaker 3>the time in memorial because he sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>burping during that stuff.</v>

387
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that like I go do Jujitsu once a week</v>

388
00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:08.180
<v Speaker 3>at a level that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't even know if it would</v>

389
00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:10.670
<v Speaker 3>qualify for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the term Jujitsu at that level.</v>

390
00:18:10.671 --> 00:18:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Up and practicing at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've doing kickboxing where I had to go</v>

391
00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:18.080
<v Speaker 3>to what is called a leisure center to</v>
<v Speaker 3>those words exist in nature center,</v>

392
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.410
<v Speaker 3>like a gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a community,</v>

393
00:18:21.411 --> 00:18:25.460
<v Speaker 3>one to do my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like white boy can see why MCA lined up</v>

394
00:18:25.461 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 3>with like 10 year olds do in life to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>my white belt just to get on the ladder.</v>

395
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:31.400
<v Speaker 3>I do know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've done that quite recently and</v>

396
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:34.210
<v Speaker 3>as well as that I do do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm so I'm using this time.</v>

397
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.180
<v Speaker 3>I've stepped out of the madness of Los</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angeles.</v>

398
00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:40.630
<v Speaker 3>The Madness of media that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

399
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.530
<v Speaker 3>the intensity of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

400
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.550
<v Speaker 3>during the time of what was like in</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing that you talks about is</v>

401
00:18:46.551 --> 00:18:47.800
<v Speaker 3>the shadow self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the.</v>

402
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also am.</v>

403
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:52.790
<v Speaker 3>If you think of that as I suppose a</v>
<v Speaker 3>simpler way of saying that is I've lived</v>

404
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 3>this life that's been very focused on</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy and the pursuit of individual</v>

405
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.130
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think what are all the things I've not</v>

406
00:18:58.131 --> 00:19:00.620
<v Speaker 3>done as a result of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was a king and he's shy and</v>

407
00:19:00.621 --> 00:19:03.260
<v Speaker 3>too ashamed to get into sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport type things,</v>

408
00:19:03.261 --> 00:19:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and embarrassed and all that kind of</v>

409
00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:07.500
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to start to do kickboxing or</v>

410
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and even football or soccer as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you call it here,</v>

411
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to do all of those things now to</v>

412
00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:15.710
<v Speaker 3>start to learn about them as an adult</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

413
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a beautiful</v>

414
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.740
<v Speaker 2>thing when you take chances and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>things with other people that are take</v>

415
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 2>chances and chances and doing new things</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you realize that it's really.</v>

416
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is about the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance and the embracing of</v>

417
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you learn a new thing,</v>

418
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 2>it's very important to learn new things</v>

419
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.460
<v Speaker 3>that it is that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I hear you say that and I know</v>

420
00:19:34.461 --> 00:19:36.640
<v Speaker 3>what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the you actually could like I got so</v>

421
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.210
<v Speaker 3>much prejudice is about you as a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black belt.</v>

422
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Martial law is then as someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in the MMA mma world,</v>

423
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.760
<v Speaker 3>you are a person who is happy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>accepting of vulnerability.</v>

424
00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:54.761
<v Speaker 3>Where in your life do you feel that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in embracing that vulnerability in</v>

425
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.870
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you try something new?</v>

426
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like in the archery thing,</v>

427
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I've only been doing it for four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that I really</v>

428
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:05.090
<v Speaker 2>loved about is how fucking terrible I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was when I first started and it was like</v>

429
00:20:05.091 --> 00:20:06.710
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to this that I have to</v>

430
00:20:06.711 --> 00:20:08.360
<v Speaker 2>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga is a big one.</v>

431
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I've been really serious into yoga like</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I go several times a week at least</v>

432
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:16.970
<v Speaker 2>once a week for about a year and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple months,</v>

433
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.800
<v Speaker 2>a year and like two months or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

434
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy about it is that I'm not very good</v>

435
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.910
<v Speaker 2>and I still get nervous before class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

436
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

437
00:20:26.571 --> 00:20:29.330
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those weird places,</v>

438
00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:34.250
<v Speaker 2>like a yoga class is one of those weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>places where there's almost a sacredness</v>

439
00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

440
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:38.030
<v Speaker 2>you go in there and no one can leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the class is over.</v>

441
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Like they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lock the front door and no one</v>

442
00:20:39.951 --> 00:20:42.440
<v Speaker 2>comes in to visit the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's locked in.</v>

443
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.290
<v Speaker 2>No one watches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go in there and we don't talk.</v>

444
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>No one talks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't talk for 90 and you go through</v>

445
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 2>this series of poses that are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

446
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>You're sweating like pounds and pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of water up.</v>

447
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll weigh myself before and after.</v>

448
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:01.741
<v Speaker 2>I'll be down like four or five pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>just from one class and it's very</v>

449
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes me nervous,</v>

450
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do get nervous before I do it because</v>

451
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 2>it has this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult to do.</v>

452
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't necessarily physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it while it's happening,</v>

453
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 2>but I enjoy the effects after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it definitely imparts a</v>

454
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 2>feeling of vulnerability.</v>

455
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I always issue that if you are</v>

456
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.950
<v Speaker 3>really good at this is perhaps you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of where I come from,</v>

457
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I always assumed that if you are date</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at some sort of fight in thing,</v>

458
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 3>that that is a highly transferable skill</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

459
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean in a practical way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're good at kickboxing,</v>

460
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you will also be good at yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just mean if you're good at</v>

461
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give a shit that you're not</v>

462
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:44.071
<v Speaker 3>good at yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My assumption is if you're good at yoga,</v>

463
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Speaker 3>the yoga side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not meant to say you're good at</v>

464
00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But giovan could it</v>

465
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.450
<v Speaker 3>sort of like when I'm in the MMA gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start guiding like,</v>

466
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may be strangling me now,</v>

467
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 3>my man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wait till we get to down with dog.</v>

468
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of feel that.</v>

469
00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:05.950
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Live humility into Jujitsu situation for</v>

470
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:08.850
<v Speaker 3>a beginner is an absolute humility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He recognized,</v>

471
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm dealing with people that are</v>

472
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 3>good and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

473
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Speaker 3>they have to do it like they're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a little kid,</v>

474
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

475
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:15.010
<v Speaker 3>and I'm very aware that they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

476
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.080
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you get really good at</v>

477
00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:20.570
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way to get really good is to be</v>

478
00:22:20.571 --> 00:22:22.580
<v Speaker 2>completely objective about where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

479
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.780
<v Speaker 2>And if you're completely objective about</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are and learning and trying to</v>

480
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:30.320
<v Speaker 2>improve upon your skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you apply that same feeling towards</v>

481
00:22:30.321 --> 00:22:32.720
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the feeling that you get when you</v>

482
00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:35.390
<v Speaker 2>totally vulnerable in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you apply that same feeling when you're</v>

483
00:22:35.391 --> 00:22:37.790
<v Speaker 2>learning yoga because that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to get really good at it.</v>

484
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.340
<v Speaker 2>The only way to really do it to 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent do it.</v>

485
00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:42.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not to sit here and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't mean shit because I could</v>

486
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.040
<v Speaker 2>choke on it,</v>

487
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.150
<v Speaker 3>but in this going to help you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to help you at all.</v>

488
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Matter of fact,</v>

489
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 2>it'll hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll hurt you,</v>

490
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:53.620
<v Speaker 2>and it'll focus more on your own ego</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the ego dissolving.</v>

491
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Beneficial properties of the poses.</v>

492
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drew and the ambience in the yoga</v>

493
00:22:57.651 --> 00:22:59.980
<v Speaker 3>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that out loud doesn't mean</v>

494
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could choke everyone in this room.</v>

495
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Well know I could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So settle down.</v>

496
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Don't get crazy about you're stretching.</v>

497
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've read the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scriptures,</v>

498
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:12.940
<v Speaker 3>but there is no guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite a little foreign.</v>

499
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's usually a metaphor.</v>

500
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.010
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing that Mckenna always</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about that that's really what a lot</v>

501
00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:24.000
<v Speaker 2>of the ancient yogis were about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were about smoking chillums of Hash</v>

502
00:23:24.001 --> 00:23:28.380
<v Speaker 2>and then doing all these poses and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've ever done yoga while intoxicated</v>

503
00:23:28.381 --> 00:23:30.750
<v Speaker 2>on edible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edible variety in particular</v>

504
00:23:30.751 --> 00:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful thing.</v>

505
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I haven't because I only started yoga</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'd stopped in a hash and all</v>

506
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.710
<v Speaker 3>other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know like when the thing is with me</v>

507
00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:46.330
<v Speaker 3>mate is when I was taking drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what I was doing.</v>

508
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't room for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I might pop to yoga.</v>

509
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 3>You were fucking pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a full time dedicated pro 100</v>

510
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

511
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:54.584
<v Speaker 3>Everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

512
00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:55.900
<v Speaker 3>can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the amount.</v>

513
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 3>What was the big drug was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I progressed through an escalation of</v>

514
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:04.140
<v Speaker 3>drug use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be on any republican leaflet</v>

515
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.790
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stone smoke pot or you will become a</v>

516
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 3>heroin addict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what I did.</v>

517
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I started with recreational drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>was unable to properly.</v>

518
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.390
<v Speaker 3>The reason is this because it's not the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fault of the drugs themselves.</v>

519
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a component within me that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking to find a solution that doesn't</v>

520
00:24:24.111 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

521
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 3>You see when you have that perspective</v>
<v Speaker 3>on guy and in a place and being willing</v>

522
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 3>to go in there and be vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of thing.</v>

523
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:31.620
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes me very sort of what are</v>

524
00:24:31.621 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 3>called hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 3>like scared like that or fuck fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiffany drugs were always a thing that I</v>

526
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 3>trusted to make me feel a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>better light and so when I was smoking</v>

527
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:40.881
<v Speaker 3>weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

528
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that thing I've found that makes</v>

529
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 3>me feel relaxed when coke and heroin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack.</v>

530
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 3>It was the same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an attempt to nullify,</v>

531
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.060
<v Speaker 3>medicate and contend with an innocent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnectedness and discontentment,</v>

532
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.880
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a thing that comes up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot on your show in other guys because I</v>

533
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:02.930
<v Speaker 3>think that's in some way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all looking for the sense of</v>

534
00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 3>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sense of completion.</v>

535
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I think in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that led me to be a drug</v>

536
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:10.190
<v Speaker 3>addict or a sex addict gambler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever kind of addict you are,</v>

537
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 3>I think the thing that's driving it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this need for connection.</v>

538
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.870
<v Speaker 3>The sense that if this life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it don't fucking seem right to</v>

539
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:22.871
<v Speaker 3>me now this system like give me the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>

540
00:25:24.071 --> 00:25:25.520
<v Speaker 3>What's the real thing you're not telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

541
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I'm fascinated by people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like terrence Mckenna says,</v>

542
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:30.320
<v Speaker 3>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what he dunks down the</v>

543
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:33.400
<v Speaker 3>pedestrian levels of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this deep,</v>

544
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 3>deep shit down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's fascinating stuff.</v>

545
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 3>There's machine elves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's corridors of kaleidoscopic</v>

546
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 3>wonder to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's union,</v>

547
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:41.080
<v Speaker 3>there's God.</v>

548
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for garlic,</v>

549
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.830
<v Speaker 4>you maybe the best art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be the best argument for</v>

550
00:25:44.831 --> 00:25:47.740
<v Speaker 4>trying to do with the Kundalini way</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have to earn it,</v>

551
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:48.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

552
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I knew it'd be harder for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>

553
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I've got to do it by sort of stretching</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of aggressive breathing.</v>

554
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Instead of hitting that dmt shit</v>

555
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.290
<v Speaker 4>into my leathery old lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just take three.</v>

556
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.190
<v Speaker 4>You just take three and then you sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and tell me what you see at the</v>

557
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.250
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In about 15 minutes.</v>

558
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.000
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

559
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.060
<v Speaker 4>can't be described beyond language to</v>
<v Speaker 4>describe it.</v>

560
00:26:10.061 --> 00:26:15.061
<v Speaker 4>It's just my stubby fucking stupid ape</v>
<v Speaker 4>fingers trying to draw God with a crayon</v>

561
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.560
<v Speaker 4>on a patch of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a proper canvas problem of</v>

562
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:23.440
<v Speaker 4>all religions can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a question.</v>

563
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.470
<v Speaker 4>If you do see what you were actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for,</v>

564
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 4>what do you think is curious once you</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and you discover what,</v>

565
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:33.910
<v Speaker 4>what do you come back and aren't we just</v>
<v Speaker 4>backed all of this</v>

566
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.980
<v Speaker 3>even?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

567
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.400
<v Speaker 3>you're right in waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because I have had moments in both</v>

568
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.220
<v Speaker 3>sobriety recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy in active addiction where I've</v>

569
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.380
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

570
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I feel truly connected now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of those moments in what</v>

571
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I would call unhealthy high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

572
00:26:47.901 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of sexual kind of,</v>

573
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so amazing.</v>

574
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 3>I want to live in this moment forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or moments on drugs where I felt sort of</v>

575
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 3>pure bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nowadays I tend to find it through</v>

576
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 3>bloody altruism and kindness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

577
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes when I think I'm being</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly useful,</v>

578
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel this sense of connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you are right,</v>

579
00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:08.910
<v Speaker 3>it is not sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no Viagra for enlightenment.</v>

580
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 3>You can't sort of stay hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

581
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 3>You sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like,</v>

582
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:12.991
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

583
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:14.780
<v Speaker 3>I understand it right from this moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>for virome,</v>

584
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.623
<v Speaker 3>enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

585
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to be anybody's bitch</v>

586
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to do anything straight</v>

587
00:27:18.841 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 3>for the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to care what other</v>

588
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 3>people think about me ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>

589
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 3>it's behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then someone will say something or</v>

590
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 3>someone will do something enough back</v>
<v Speaker 3>here again,</v>

591
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very hard to capture the</v>
<v Speaker 3>divine.</v>

592
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd get like I've had in my</v>

593
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 3>life moments of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when I do the yoga,</v>

594
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I practice yoga on my own practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga this morning and positions where</v>

595
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:43.830
<v Speaker 3>you go upside down and stuff and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would if he was just determined to</v>

596
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 3>describe things in a material and</v>
<v Speaker 3>secular way,</v>

597
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:46.561
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

598
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 3>you would just dizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

599
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 3>but what I feel is I go upside down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I come up straight again,</v>

600
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I feel my own individual consciousness.</v>

601
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 3>My sense of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel it sort of disappeared.</v>

602
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't remember who I am for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

603
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 3>It all goes away and then I feel this</v>
<v Speaker 3>secondary awareness in the back of my</v>

604
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I sort of a grid and awareness.</v>

605
00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a nice sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a minute,</v>

606
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not me.</v>

607
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 3>There's something else inside of me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that in a might big sort of ax</v>

608
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:12.960
<v Speaker 3>to grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was doing that,</v>

609
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:15.710
<v Speaker 3>that Internet series the truth for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

610
00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 3>That got me into all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting scrapes and challenges over</v>

611
00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 3>the last sort of 18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years.</v>

612
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>It was the idea of someone inside our</v>
<v Speaker 3>own consciousness is not free.</v>

613
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 3>We are not free within our own</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

614
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:30.230
<v Speaker 3>We have been conditioned to the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't know that we're</v>

615
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 3>conditioned anymore and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of,</v>

616
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:33.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's you.</v>

617
00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:38.040
<v Speaker 3>You notice it in lightening rod moments</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there is sort of like an election</v>

618
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

619
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:44.180
<v Speaker 3>people really in his fucking shit what</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going on my rage</v>

620
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.323
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>

621
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Perfect riff to at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much this way.</v>

622
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that rage against the machine?</v>

623
00:28:57.331 --> 00:29:00.770
<v Speaker 4>Is that person smashing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smashing pumpkin.</v>

624
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't limit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I ask you,</v>

625
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.510
<v Speaker 4>since [inaudible] you found your outlet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said you're putting you finding just</v>

626

<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

628
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a question since you've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting it out there and have you</v>

629
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:18.060
<v Speaker 4>noticed this more and more is coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>back or it's like,</v>

630
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm noticing it more always was there.</v>

631
00:29:20.731 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 4>I just chose go the way to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are just questions.</v>

632
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Well my right eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still like if you read any bloody,</v>

633
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.960
<v Speaker 3>when you read this stuff in religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>books like saying the Bible is going to</v>

634
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.290
<v Speaker 3>become good and get to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>even being good,</v>

635
00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 3>you're not even doing it for that reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

636
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:40.870
<v Speaker 3>You've become detached from outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the.</v>

637
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.630
<v Speaker 3>In Buddhist terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like that you're,</v>

638
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.200
<v Speaker 3>you're no longer about fear and desire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You no longer trying to just fulfill</v>

639
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:47.920
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

640
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not bloody there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know me,</v>

641
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 3>even if I do something good like go a</v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless shelter and help out for the</v>

642
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 3>day and all that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of the back of my mind is</v>

643
00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 3>going to helping out at this homeless</v>
<v Speaker 3>shelter</v>

644
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 3>and if someone went by and saw me</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping at the homeless shelter,</v>

645
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.600
<v Speaker 3>been really pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is no one seeing me helping these</v>

646
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.443
<v Speaker 3>fucking ownership.</v>

647
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.840
<v Speaker 3>So I'm still a little bit looking for</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewards now that that's very hard.</v>

648
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 3>But this is the thing is as well about</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a comedian is you can't get to</v>

649
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 3>fucking sincere and earnest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you stop being bloody funny.</v>

650
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.430
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you find that that when you</v>

651
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 3>stuff that you really passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you really believe in because</v>

652
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:31.750
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's constantly ripping down</v>

653
00:30:31.751 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

654
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 3>you sort of set up a premise and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you rip it down again.</v>

655
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 3>I think comedy is the energy of</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly going.</v>

656
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:37.780
<v Speaker 3>None of this is really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

657
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 3>this is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking bullshit.</v>

658
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.190
<v Speaker 3>So when you're sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you please hold on,</v>

659
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop it.</v>

660
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is serious.</v>

661
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 3>That's more kids will care about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you do that,</v>

662
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.330
<v Speaker 2>be able to differentiate between your</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of expression,</v>

663
00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:53.090
<v Speaker 2>like your art form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a piece that you're creating and</v>

664
00:30:53.091 --> 00:30:56.630
<v Speaker 2>you yourself as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I used to think when I was</v>

665
00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:57.464
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

666
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't be fucking around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation or enlightenment because it's</v>

667
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:03.020
<v Speaker 2>going to ruin me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my favorite comedians were junkies</v>

668
00:31:03.021 --> 00:31:08.021
<v Speaker 2>and crazy people like in and prior and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hicks and crazy people and junkies.</v>

669
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.910
<v Speaker 2>You can't get enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta just gotTa fucking</v>

670
00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:12.500
<v Speaker 2>be a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get comedy.</v>

671
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so convinced anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the creating of these memes</v>

672
00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these,</v>

673
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:23.990
<v Speaker 2>these characters that you can mock and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make fun of inside your act is a piece</v>

674
00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:26.390
<v Speaker 2>of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something just like a</v>

675
00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:30.440
<v Speaker 2>painting doesn't make you a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could paint a Frazetta,</v>

676
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Conan the barbarian painting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you a mass murderer.</v>

677
00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.440
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're creating a piece of art</v>

678
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes the more points of view</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've considered,</v>

679
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.590
<v Speaker 2>the more it enhances that work of art.</v>

680
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:47.340
<v Speaker 3>You raise a good point in that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>in certain sectors of the art world that</v>

681
00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:52.341
<v Speaker 3>has always been accepted that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>erroneous Bosch triptych of hell don't</v>

682
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:53.310
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

683
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.800
<v Speaker 3>this guy's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

684
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.970
<v Speaker 3>they may have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know or you know,</v>

685
00:31:56.971 --> 00:31:59.040
<v Speaker 3>but like when in hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 3>like people talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

687
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
<v Speaker 3>popping caps and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's taken a lot more literally and it.</v>

688
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.030
<v Speaker 3>And as a comedic persona like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna comedians get a lot,</v>

689
00:32:11.031 --> 00:32:13.890
<v Speaker 3>but it British comedian as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few sort of like comedians,</v>

690
00:32:13.891 --> 00:32:17.010
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Scottish comedian called Frankie Boyle</v>

691
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.070
<v Speaker 3>like that when people are very shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

692
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can,</v>

693
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I can tell sometimes that comics are</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying things to detonate territory's of</v>

694
00:32:25.651 --> 00:32:28.590
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you knew because it might get</v>

695
00:32:28.591 --> 00:32:29.120
<v Speaker 3>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wakes you up.</v>

696
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks did that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would say things.</v>

697
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.780
<v Speaker 3>You go whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steady and then these smacked you in the</v>

698
00:32:33.781 --> 00:32:36.630
<v Speaker 3>mouth and then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gently tells you that it's just the</v>

699
00:32:36.631 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 3>ride or wherever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

700
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:39.590
<v Speaker 3>like now that you've got you where wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

701
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:44.950
<v Speaker 3>But people like I think we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture now that's very prohibitive</v>

702
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.930
<v Speaker 3>about where we go with those kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

703
00:32:48.931 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 3>So people are very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've myself been on the receiving end of</v>

704
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:57.030
<v Speaker 3>a lot of like what I want to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>judgment and I'm not fucking joking but</v>

705
00:32:57.031 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

706
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 2>That's also because we live in this new</v>
<v Speaker 2>media world of social interaction,</v>

707
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 2>this new social media world where</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can chime in at any point in</v>

708
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 2>time and it's the first time ever that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happened.</v>

709
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be right,</v>

710
00:33:09.641 --> 00:33:14.050
<v Speaker 3>but a friend of mine in England made a</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary about what has happened to</v>

711
00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:16.000
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the great man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

712
00:33:16.001 --> 00:33:17.500
<v Speaker 3>like in American literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

713
00:33:17.501 --> 00:33:20.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saul Bellow Philip Roth or like,</v>

714
00:33:20.171 --> 00:33:21.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed Ali,</v>

715
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest in peace like that.</v>

716
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't rise to that position</v>

717
00:33:27.431 --> 00:33:32.380
<v Speaker 3>anymore because there's thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lilliputians pulling them down as soon</v>

718
00:33:32.381 --> 00:33:35.020
<v Speaker 3>as there is above the parapet and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's allowed to.</v>

719
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

720
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.401
<v Speaker 3>People will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

721
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:38.860
<v Speaker 3>well Martin Luther King had affairs on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm x.</v>

722
00:33:38.861 --> 00:33:40.090
<v Speaker 3>He was inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He done this,</v>

723
00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:40.600
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other.</v>

724
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

725
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

726
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

727
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.700
<v Speaker 3>there were so many good things that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>come from social media.</v>

728
00:33:45.701 --> 00:33:46.810
<v Speaker 3>So many good things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

729
00:33:46.811 --> 00:33:49.270
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that connection and instantaneous,</v>

730
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.620
<v Speaker 3>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is wonderful,</v>

731
00:33:50.621 --> 00:33:53.650
<v Speaker 3>but it does all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all things in the end become an</v>

732
00:33:53.651 --> 00:33:56.230
<v Speaker 3>expression of the dominant</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

733
00:33:56.231 --> 00:33:57.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if people are doubtful,</v>

734
00:33:57.701 --> 00:34:00.010
<v Speaker 3>cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>president mystic in that,</v>

735
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.890
<v Speaker 3>the Palette that she ends up on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>canvas,</v>

736
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.380
<v Speaker 2>it also might be a case of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:34:05.381 --> 00:34:08.950
<v Speaker 2>everybody's always worried about wealth</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality in this world.</v>

738
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.560
<v Speaker 2>There's also a possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

739
00:34:11.561 --> 00:34:15.520
<v Speaker 2>inequality and that these people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have grown up with shitty parents and</v>

740
00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:20.080
<v Speaker 2>shitty neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel left out by even your ability</v>

741
00:34:20.081 --> 00:34:22.900
<v Speaker 2>to seek peace and altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

742
00:34:22.901 --> 00:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>who are you this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you so lucky?</v>

743
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.910
<v Speaker 2>You're financially fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have beautiful genes.</v>

744
00:34:27.911 --> 00:34:30.120
<v Speaker 2>You're handsome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a wonderful magazine,</v>

745
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.160
<v Speaker 2>fucking magazine shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go get your face.</v>

746
00:34:33.161 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love you dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but come on,</v>

747
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Bang and started off this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why is he so happy?</v>

748
00:34:37.781 --> 00:34:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Why is he allowed to have this happiness</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to him so easily?</v>

749
00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:43.900
<v Speaker 2>So there's anger at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same kind of anger that you would</v>

750
00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:47.170
<v Speaker 2>get at the elite upper class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the billionaires in the one</v>

751
00:34:47.171 --> 00:34:50.470
<v Speaker 2>percenters of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will also look at a person like</v>

752
00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:53.200
<v Speaker 2>you and like there's a consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>

753
00:34:53.201 --> 00:34:55.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a starting point.</v>

754
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

755
00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you,</v>

756
00:34:58.121 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying you were insecure</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're young and it was difficult</v>

757
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:04.300
<v Speaker 2>than I certainly was and Jim and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other when we're young and insecure</v>

758
00:35:04.301 --> 00:35:06.580
<v Speaker 2>and starting out as comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been friends forever,</v>

759
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.300
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of this,</v>

760
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.870
<v Speaker 2>this experience where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you now and people look at that and</v>

761
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:14.890
<v Speaker 2>they're upset that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

762
00:35:14.891 --> 00:35:18.310
<v Speaker 2>why is this guy have so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this guy in this place where you</v>

763
00:35:18.311 --> 00:35:22.330
<v Speaker 2>can so conveniently search for truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I have to pay my fucking bills,</v>

764
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.540
<v Speaker 2>student loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in a Shitty neighborhood and my</v>

765
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:27.960
<v Speaker 2>kids are sick and my wife account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

766
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.940
<v Speaker 2>this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they get on twitter and the</v>

767
00:35:30.941 --> 00:35:32.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

768
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.820
<v Speaker 2>you fucking cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope your ponytail chokes you and your</v>

769
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.970
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

770
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it never will because I'll put it into a</v>

771
00:35:39.531 --> 00:35:44.240
<v Speaker 3>button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can actually understand that level of</v>

772
00:35:44.241 --> 00:35:46.100
<v Speaker 3>discontentment because to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

773
00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm subject to jealousy and envy myself.</v>

774
00:35:48.951 --> 00:35:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I spot it when it comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I sort of feel myself go,</v>

775
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that not me?</v>

776
00:35:53.541 --> 00:35:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I should be having that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I try to.</v>

777
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I try not to justify feeling shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know as soon as I start feeling bad,</v>

778
00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:02.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is why I feel bad and I'd like</v>

779
00:36:02.781 --> 00:36:05.950
<v Speaker 3>to stay feeling bad if I try and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on a minute that I,</v>

780
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.890
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you believe that you know,</v>

781
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.030
<v Speaker 3>the external world is an illusion that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's temporary,</v>

782
00:36:11.031 --> 00:36:14.920
<v Speaker 3>it's transient and real is your deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection to your inner self and you</v>

783
00:36:14.921 --> 00:36:17.990
<v Speaker 3>can express that myriad ways and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>here to after this experience as an</v>

784
00:36:17.991 --> 00:36:21.230
<v Speaker 3>animal and I'm fascinated by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>numerous ways that you are into doing it</v>

785
00:36:21.231 --> 00:36:23.990
<v Speaker 3>and it's something that I really want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn more about,</v>

786
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loads of the stuff that goes on on your</v>

787
00:36:25.791 --> 00:36:27.320
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

788
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

789
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.910
<v Speaker 3>I can well appreciate people sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing a.</v>

790
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly as the way it's presented,</v>

791
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.180
<v Speaker 3>seen me on the like on television</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

792
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.490
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy because they don't</v>

793
00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:40.700
<v Speaker 3>automatically know where I came from or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I had to do to get here,</v>

794
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.370
<v Speaker 3>or the fact that I get here and take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a minute.</v>

795
00:36:43.371 --> 00:36:47.420
<v Speaker 3>This isn't why full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be almost as soon as I got those</v>

796
00:36:47.421 --> 00:36:48.141
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

797
00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:50.260
<v Speaker 3>this isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can't make yourself,</v>

798
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

799
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be poor again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be straight about that because I</v>

800
00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:56.870
<v Speaker 3>hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is pretty frightening,</v>

801
00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.040
<v Speaker 3>but like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot resolve those inner issues.</v>

802
00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I now know that empirically for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really lucky and that's why I'm so</v>

803
00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:07.310
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by the addiction model and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm reluctant to smash my</v>

804
00:37:07.311 --> 00:37:09.020
<v Speaker 3>mind's piece of DMT though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does sound fun.</v>

805
00:37:09.021 --> 00:37:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I would really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really love to do it on pier pussy.</v>

806
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

807
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Say I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because I know I've tried fame,</v>

808
00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:21.440
<v Speaker 3>I've tried money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried drugs,</v>

809
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:23.840
<v Speaker 3>I tried sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried all of those things to make</v>

810
00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:27.860
<v Speaker 3>myself feel better and oddly none of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them have worked.</v>

811
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 3>None of them have worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

812
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:29.691
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor me.</v>

813
00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:31.740
<v Speaker 3>Poor me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is fucking refugee crisis?</v>

814
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.370
<v Speaker 3>You just about your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

815
00:37:34.371 --> 00:37:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would like what I am now thinking</v>

816
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Joe is what is the Mo they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.690
<v Speaker 3>happiness is where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the world needs meets what you have</v>

818
00:37:44.691 --> 00:37:46.190
<v Speaker 3>to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we can meet,</v>

819
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.540
<v Speaker 3>well needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet what you have to offer,</v>

820
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>and I think God is there a way that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can communicate some of the things that</v>

821
00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I have learned about connecting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about letting go of my floors,</v>

822
00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.550
<v Speaker 3>taking responsibility for the problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I am creating,</v>

823
00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:59.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like is there anything about that that I</v>

824
00:37:59.331 --> 00:38:02.660
<v Speaker 3>can convey kind of conveyed hopefully as</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in a comedic and accessible way</v>

825
00:38:02.661 --> 00:38:06.230
<v Speaker 3>and that sort of like where my focus is</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning to fall now I'm assuming</v>

826
00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:09.640
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're already doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm attempting.</v>

827
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody is trying to better</v>

828
00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:14.140
<v Speaker 2>themselves as attempting some form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

829
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's also what you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about the criticism</v>

830
00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:18.910
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to define you based on</v>

831
00:38:18.911 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 2>one interview or one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one article or one thing that you said</v>

832
00:38:23.231 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>in response to one piece of current</v>
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

833
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:29.800
<v Speaker 2>so it's real quote mining a lot of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways.</v>

834
00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Looking to have a more concentrated form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

835
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that jealous expression we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like fine,</v>

836
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 1>like it's gotta be something about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy I don't like.</v>

837
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how he went on Fox News and</v>

838
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 1>mocked America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

839
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you mocking the journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

840
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>You think you're better than these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are here and telling the</v>

841
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:48.320
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

842
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the way that works for me is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that is a thing that is called</v>

843
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

844
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>You've already feeling something inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and then you'll sort of</v>

845
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously you're scanning data to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get confirmation of like.</v>

846
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So if I feel insecure because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>super good at MMA and have black bolts</v>

847
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:05.820
<v Speaker 1>in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

848
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.670
<v Speaker 1>instead of dealing with my own feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fuck,</v>

849
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>if this becomes a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have to deal with it.</v>

850
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I would rather go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

851
00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.460
<v Speaker 1>this guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find something to complete the had</v>

852
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 1>advantages that I didn't have if I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I would've been like in.</v>

853
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.780
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really the feeling is in me,</v>

854
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is what might personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of actually getting clean</v>

855
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.810
<v Speaker 1>from drugs has taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

856
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other people think about me is none</v>

857
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:32.860
<v Speaker 1>of my business and it's something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in their own consciousness and</v>

858
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:36.310
<v Speaker 1>they're always looking for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinates upon which to project those</v>

859
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that because I fucking knew</v>

860
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I start getting jealous about,</v>

861
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super awesome,</v>

862
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 1>super successful guy or someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>super good at fighting or whatever,</v>

863
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>that's I'm dealing with something inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

864
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 1>So now I try not to bring that shit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and trying to go.</v>

865
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:50.981
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell,</v>

866
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 1>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deal with this feeling of inadequacy or</v>

867
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 1>this feeling of jealousy or this feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of insecurity because what was just</v>

868
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.820
<v Speaker 1>going to ruin your experience of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>human instead of going,</v>

869
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is this guy or that guy or</v>

870
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 1>this person having a successful podcast.</v>

871
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I tried to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of Russell connect with yourself,</v>

872
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying not to blame the outside</v>

873
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:11.710
<v Speaker 1>world for my shit and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are really complicated thoughts</v>

874
00:40:11.711 --> 00:40:16.711
<v Speaker 1>that we have and in many ways we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a victim of this constant need to</v>

875
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:21.880
<v Speaker 1>evolve like the body and the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up to constantly be comparing</v>

876
00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to others and to feed off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

877
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:27.880
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through jealousy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to try to achieve higher and</v>

878
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:32.140
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of competency at anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop more social credibility,</v>

879
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 1>to develop more clout in the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

880
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.280
<v Speaker 1>to feel better about your own existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like what we're dealing with</v>

881
00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:44.281
<v Speaker 1>is some sort of a programming that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly set up to innovate and to</v>

882
00:40:44.411 --> 00:40:46.300
<v Speaker 1>continue to get better and better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

883
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:48.790
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I see you in some movie,</v>

884
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 1>am I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Am I?</v>

885
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.520
<v Speaker 1>How come I'm not in these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies?</v>

886
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't even get these auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a farmland manager.</v>

887
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.110
<v Speaker 1>These ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

888
00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.290
<v Speaker 1>They motivate movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they motivate momentum and yes you could</v>

889
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 1>use them or not using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't.</v>

890
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:04.490
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to handle them and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's telling us in.</v>

891
00:41:04.491 --> 00:41:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Our parents didn't tell us and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents didn't tell them shit.</v>

892
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Back to the slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all just tribal and at the end of</v>

893
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.960
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you supposed to do is help others.</v>

894
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no better feeling in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>then encouraging another human to live</v>

895
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:26.190
<v Speaker 1>right and they live right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are moments you remember live good</v>

896
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.900
<v Speaker 1>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your Dick Sucked and the lyrics</v>

897
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.130
<v Speaker 1>while you're pouring champagne on both</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>

898
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is relaxing</v>

899
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.593
<v Speaker 1>background</v>

900
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.570
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's quicker.</v>

901
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.680
<v Speaker 3>If you can't get a learjet</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate,</v>

902
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 3>I am going to take that out of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

903
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean a good point because what</v>

904
00:41:48.141 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 3>you're doing right there is how</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological imperatives,</v>

905
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 3>wherever that force was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that made us divide from one cell to two</v>

906
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:57.620
<v Speaker 3>cells to 10 sales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the frog,</v>

907
00:41:57.621 --> 00:42:01.090
<v Speaker 3>to Malmo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cities to woolies and wonders.</v>

908
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 3>That falls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

909
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:03.740
<v Speaker 3>still in us now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

910
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 3>these imperatives to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

911
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 3>you know that as a you sign an agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as if you're living in a tribal</v>

912
00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a necessary function,</v>

913
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:12.340
<v Speaker 3>but what's happened to our species?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know that father,</v>

914
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.340
<v Speaker 3>that cliche you are what you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what it means.</v>

915

<v Speaker 3>you'll be shit and I hundred percent</v>

916
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.930
<v Speaker 3>agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on a,</v>

917
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 3>on a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a different way.</v>

918
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 3>You are what you eat.</v>

919
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 3>If you look at what we eat now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we mono cultural foods.</v>

920
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:27.710
<v Speaker 3>You know like we're in a suedes endless</v>
<v Speaker 3>fields of wheat across again.</v>

921
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drove what state would that have been?</v>

922
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Drove fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's one of your crazy Iowa,</v>

923
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nebraska,</v>

924
00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like the whole country was</v>

925
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.390
<v Speaker 3>made of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just know what else is there.</v>

926
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Go on Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

927
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's guilty,</v>

928
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 3>but do you understand what he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying?</v>

929
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 3>The May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main thing that I think he was</v>

930
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 3>saying was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be gay.</v>

931
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

932
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:56.130
<v Speaker 3>just be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said</v>

933
00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.013
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

934
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have missed the point,</v>

935
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:02.470
<v Speaker 3>but this big cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's done again.</v>

936
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.480
<v Speaker 3>It's focused down on not big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then of course the way that the meat</v>

937
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 3>is consumed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endless apa towards and slaughter houses</v>

938
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:18.620
<v Speaker 3>have condensed animals not consumed as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be tribally picked off here</v>

939
00:43:18.621 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 3>and there even once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a vegetarian myself,</v>

940
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have fields full of wheat.</v>

941
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Abbotts was full of meat and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves are similarly what we eat.</v>

942
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 3>We have become cells of energy trapped</v>
<v Speaker 3>in cities.</v>

943
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Not Free to be tribal beings anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've become so disconnected from what</v>

944
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be to be this primate</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now these biological imperative,</v>

945
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 3>the desire to procreate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desire to have status,</v>

946
00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desire to even get high,</v>

947
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.730
<v Speaker 3>all these things have become permutate</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because they're no longer anchored in</v>

948
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 3>the reality for which we were design.</v>

949
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I imagine your position where you are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a completely unique position,</v>

950
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.940
<v Speaker 2>even in the Western world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become a media superstar.</v>

951
00:43:59.941 --> 00:44:03.180
<v Speaker 2>You become a movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He becomes someone when you show up,</v>

952
00:44:03.181 --> 00:44:06.370
<v Speaker 2>people have cameras and you walk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take photos of you.</v>

953
00:44:06.371 --> 00:44:08.130
<v Speaker 2>You get out of a car and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheers.</v>

954
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:13.131
<v Speaker 2>It becomes this really unusual event</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you just arrived somewhere.</v>

955
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 2>So it sets you up for an incredibly high</v>
<v Speaker 2>dose of this sort of toxic celebrity</v>

956
00:44:19.831 --> 00:44:23.130
<v Speaker 2>feeling that you have to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate and you have to navigate it</v>

957
00:44:23.131 --> 00:44:26.610
<v Speaker 2>based on the other people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly unsuccessfully navigated it</v>

958
00:44:26.611 --> 00:44:30.210
<v Speaker 2>before you start and think about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many fucking movie stars wind up in a</v>

959
00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 2>pool their own or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered in whatever the fuck they're</v>

960
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:34.970
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

961
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a large number of famous people</v>

962
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:40.460
<v Speaker 2>wind up fucking it all up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't handle it anymore.</v>

963
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's ledger or a million different ways,</v>

964
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pills are just fucking implosion or</v>

965
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to feed my giraffe?</v>

966
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 2>This is the podcast for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start losing your mind</v>

967
00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.240
<v Speaker 3>in the van.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For anyone that's listening to this</v>

968
00:44:56.241 --> 00:44:58.610
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I'm on it and I can't</v>

969
00:44:58.611 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 3>imagine there's very many of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reference there to a giraffe</v>

970
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:02.470
<v Speaker 3>that even I'm struggling.</v>

971
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.600
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that your unique</v>

972
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 2>perspective and it's a very unique</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because not a lot of people</v>

973
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:14.400
<v Speaker 2>get to become movie stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's something that the average</v>

974
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are trying to put it into</v>

975
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 2>perspective where they can grasp the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of pressure and the weird way</v>

976
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 2>that you have to interface with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world where people worship you and</v>

977
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you go people love you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know them.</v>

978
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a very strange thing.</v>

979
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.400
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to think of problems.</v>

980
00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I think in terms of their essence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not of their scale,</v>

981
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you see like because if you like how I</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped myself,</v>

982
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

983
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.970
<v Speaker 3>when I was more immersed in Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fame and stuff,</v>

984
00:45:43.971 --> 00:45:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't like you walk in a room and</v>

985
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.230
<v Speaker 3>like when I was single and a lots of</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention from women,</v>

986
00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:52.160
<v Speaker 3>obviously that that's a short circuit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because you do tend to fulfill that</v>

987
00:45:52.161 --> 00:45:52.630
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said,</v>

988
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to have sex with.</v>

989
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's dig sense.</v>

990
00:45:55.761 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

991
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.970
<v Speaker 2>how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

992
00:45:58.971 --> 00:46:01.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hurting of the natural process.</v>

993
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Matrix is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

994
00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

995
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I lost my wonder why you're an addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normal,</v>

996
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.600
<v Speaker 2>but every look it's called pussy is</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

997
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.860
<v Speaker 2>That is a difficult problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To overwhelmed.</v>

998
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.900
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to avoid the pool.</v>

999
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talking about the gravity of</v>

1000
00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sucks and asteroids.</v>

1001
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1002
00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.760
<v Speaker 2>It's just too goddamn strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The compulsion to breed and the</v>

1003
00:46:25.761 --> 00:46:29.420
<v Speaker 2>compulsion to be special so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>breed more than anyone else and you can</v>

1004
00:46:29.421 --> 00:46:31.730
<v Speaker 2>have the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what your DNA calls,</v>

1005
00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.980
<v Speaker 2>but can we overcome our nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

1006
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a</v>

1007
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.310
<v Speaker 2>podcast I've ever been in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing,</v>

1008
00:46:43.311 --> 00:46:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you've decided to step away from all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>

1009
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:50.801
<v Speaker 2>move away from Hollywood and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a break while you can financially</v>

1010
00:46:50.811 --> 00:46:54.620
<v Speaker 2>and you can with your position in life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just relax and get a look at this</v>

1011
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 2>because it don't look at it from afar.</v>

1012
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the ego thing of like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving you those attention.</v>

1013
00:46:58.331 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Why used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1014
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.540
<v Speaker 3>like quite quickly after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to get a lot of fame</v>

1015
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:03.880
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think if someone else more</v>

1016
00:47:03.881 --> 00:47:06.790
<v Speaker 3>famous than me came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all these attention would go there.</v>

1017
00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.730
<v Speaker 3>So what is it really well is it really</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not it.</v>

1018
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't feed on that and even if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that,</v>

1019
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.810
<v Speaker 3>even if I don't literally have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of being of basking in a</v>

1020
00:47:16.811 --> 00:47:19.870
<v Speaker 3>spotlight and then Justin timberlake</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking in and seeing the light</v>

1021
00:47:19.871 --> 00:47:23.110
<v Speaker 3>disappear from my face and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>punished once again into the shadows of</v>

1022
00:47:23.111 --> 00:47:25.540
<v Speaker 3>my youth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if I don't have to actually have</v>

1023
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:28.060
<v Speaker 3>that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that when I get home,</v>

1024
00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm still just that none of it is real</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't.</v>

1025
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.550
<v Speaker 3>There's no nutrition in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing we ended.</v>

1026
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 3>You can't get any.</v>

1027
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:36.363
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1028
00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this amount of fame hasn't worked.</v>

1029
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll try and get even more famous is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the essence is the thing.</v>

1030
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 3>The essence is the thing is to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>connect what I am doing or what you are</v>

1031
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 3>doing or what one is doing to something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is connected that feels beautiful</v>

1032
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:54.550
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fills nutritional to you and that.</v>

1033
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 3>For me that is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really odd because it's very hard to</v>

1034
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:01.270
<v Speaker 3>enjoy those pat on the back things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly if you know,</v>

1035
00:48:01.271 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 3>like if you felt inadequate and insecure</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Adelaide,</v>

1036
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to break off of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>track course and I'll feel lucky,</v>

1037
00:48:08.321 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's not something that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>over for me.</v>

1038
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Speaker 3>If feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel lucky to be awakening from that</v>

1039
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:14.230
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel lucky to be awakening for her,</v>

1040
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's not over for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still feel it.</v>

1041
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still feel if someone,</v>

1042
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 3>if another English committee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Ricky Gervais' came in,</v>

1043
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.220
<v Speaker 3>now I'd have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1044
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ricky,</v>

1045
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 3>JCC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sacha Baron Cohen.</v>

1046
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Right now this is happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware that in this moment I have a</v>

1047
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.630
<v Speaker 3>cache of being the only English person</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the West was,</v>

1048
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1049
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.900
<v Speaker 3>if those are the things I'm using a prop</v>
<v Speaker 3>up my identity,</v>

1050
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked.</v>

1051
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.290
<v Speaker 2>But you being aware of those facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of the fact that you're constantly</v>

1052
00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:41.420
<v Speaker 2>struggling in this is what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help you.</v>

1053
00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you can avoid the,</v>

1054
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.530
<v Speaker 2>the sound of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the harpies one of those things</v>

1055
00:48:48.531 --> 00:48:52.400
<v Speaker 2>and pull the sirens that call the boats</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the rocks.</v>

1056
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1057
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.180
<v Speaker 2>it's compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely compelling,</v>

1058
00:48:56.181 --> 00:48:59.000
<v Speaker 2>but you understand what it is now so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to do it.</v>

1059
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.370
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to gravitate towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know you can.</v>

1060
00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:05.300
<v Speaker 2>You know that if you just went and got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of hookers and some coke and hold</v>

1061
00:49:05.301 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 2>yourself up in a hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be some moments.</v>

1062
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:09.920
<v Speaker 2>It'd be pretty God damn good about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also,</v>

1063
00:49:09.921 --> 00:49:14.240
<v Speaker 2>there'd be the repercussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you've slid back towards</v>

1064
00:49:14.241 --> 00:49:15.380
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>

1065
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.590
<v Speaker 2>so you avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the pool is always going to be</v>

1066
00:49:18.591 --> 00:49:20.690
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when the girls have big tits</v>

1067
00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:24.740
<v Speaker 2>and little waist bigger ashes and put a</v>
<v Speaker 2>secret.</v>

1068
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.013
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1069
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

1070
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 3>That's why I live in the abstinence</v>
<v Speaker 3>model that's.</v>

1071
00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I tried to press those buttons because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's stuff is,</v>

1072
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't miss route the cage.</v>

1073
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Don't wake that guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leave him alone like hulk in it.</v>

1074
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Don't make me angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learned Lot and whenever I agree,</v>

1075
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 3>just let me be a little hole.</v>

1076
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let me chill.</v>

1077
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

1078
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:49.750
<v Speaker 2>as we've gone over your navigating some</v>
<v Speaker 2>waters that very few people get to go</v>

1079
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 2>through and there's no books written</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1080
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 2>No one has gone through what you've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>and achieved some sort of a yogic state</v>

1081
00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:58.690
<v Speaker 2>of enlightenment where they've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed it to everybody else and said,</v>

1082
00:49:58.691 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the roadmap.</v>

1083
00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Speaker 2>This is the path</v>

1084
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.720
<v Speaker 4>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to just say,</v>

1085
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:07.750
<v Speaker 4>just knowing some addicts to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is more powerful than</v>

1086
00:50:08.901 --> 00:50:10.970
<v Speaker 4>when you were the ultimate ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 4>star.</v>

1087
00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm telling this guy sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1088
00:50:13.851 --> 00:50:17.090
<v Speaker 4>we all feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get really far for a little bit.</v>

1089
00:50:17.091 --> 00:50:17.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1090
00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.230
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to do this,</v>

1091
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.820
<v Speaker 4>and that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1092
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I think he's 15 years now and he'll turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>

1093
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim,</v>

1094
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 4>I've been to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have so much more.</v>

1095
00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.700
<v Speaker 4>You have so much more in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want.</v>

1096
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 4>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want that.</v>

1097
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he says that,</v>

1098
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:40.661
<v Speaker 4>those statements are so powerful to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>as he can see that that vanity and</v>

1099
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:44.560
<v Speaker 4>wanting to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I said the draft,</v>

1100
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 4>because that defines my success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1101
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.440
<v Speaker 4>success with I board the draft shipped</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That shit is worse than heroin.</v>

1103
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 4>It's worse than her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine his ladder was.</v>

<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot to live.</v>

1106
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tip my hat to you,</v>

1107
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 4>but you would go through a tornado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's done it.</v>

1108
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.680
<v Speaker 4>You've done in a similar way as well in</v>
<v Speaker 4>some his love,</v>

<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

1114
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 4>He decided a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to live in New Jersey.</v>

1116
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do gigs and I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to worry about nothing.</v>

1117
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to have a good time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>perform and not worry about fame at all.</v>

1118
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:39.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to step the fuck away and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just work on my act.</v>

1119
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Work on performing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a good time of trying to enjoy my</v>

1120
00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 4>life and that's a very admirable thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what you've done is a very admirable</v>

1121
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:48.890
<v Speaker 4>thing and a lot of ways I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you first walked in here,</v>

1122
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you just kind of mentioned that and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1123
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suburbanized.</v>

<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.400
<v Speaker 4>cheering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheer you on.</v>

1143
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.170
<v Speaker 4>Big Time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know this is Corny,</v>

1144
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 4>but I saw you on a couple of interviews</v>
<v Speaker 4>soon as you were.</v>

1145
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were all over the place and I could</v>

1146
00:52:57.561 --> 00:53:00.420
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see you in that room trying to</v>

1147
00:53:00.421 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 4>find who you were while everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 4>was trying to throw out a completely</v>

1148
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:05.640
<v Speaker 4>different character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1149
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:07.870
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm crazy and I'm going right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1150
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 4>I would see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1151
00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.710
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you had the awareness to say this</v>

1152
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:15.470
<v Speaker 4>is all weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feel weird.</v>

1153
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.690
<v Speaker 4>It's the weirdest way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haired.</v>

1154
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:18.140
<v Speaker 4>How could it not be weird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a movie star.</v>

1155
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:22.220
<v Speaker 4>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in a very unusual experience</v>

1156
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 4>because it's like you were saying about</v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to and sort of saying that,</v>

1157
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1158
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.700
<v Speaker 3>What I'm going to do is my job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do comedy and I do the</v>

1159
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 3>comedy to get the money to pay for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

1160
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:34.350
<v Speaker 3>to feed my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take care of my life and I love doing</v>

1161
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 3>it and I can bring joy to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1162
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1163
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 3>if I'm honest about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always had the ingredients for</v>

1164
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 3>obsessive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was because like the more I look at</v>

1165
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:47.800
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to resolve something.</v>

1166
00:53:47.801 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I've thought if I get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll be worth something.</v>

1167
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I can get that thing and they know when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got there thought,</v>

1168
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't eight reeve and real.</v>

1169
00:53:57.031 --> 00:54:00.470
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel right and that's not</v>

1170
00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:00.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1171
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 3>there are people sort of I think very</v>
<v Speaker 3>high profile,</v>

1172
00:54:02.941 --> 00:54:05.890
<v Speaker 3>high level people that are making big</v>
<v Speaker 3>contributions.</v>

1173
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Can you sweep away all of mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture?</v>

1174
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Can you say the sole function of pop</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture is to keep people but wilderness</v>

1175
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 3>and distracted and intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the political elite in conjunction</v>

1176
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 3>with the corporate powers can saps the</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy of the great and powerful people</v>

1177
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 3>of this planet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1178
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:28.470
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I do think that that's a</v>

1179
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 3>conscious decision by the cultural elite</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is that a conscious decision by the</v>

1180
00:54:32.221 --> 00:54:36.760
<v Speaker 3>people to avoid reality itself and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>distracted by Goofy television?</v>

1181
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 3>It must've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be sort of both components must</v>

1182
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 3>be both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you said,</v>

1183
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 3>implied or said even earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are still evolving.</v>

1184
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Evolution is still happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not over easy and like so what I</v>

1185
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:58.310
<v Speaker 3>feel like it's what I feel like is at</v>
<v Speaker 3>what information can we impart,</v>

1186
00:54:58.471 --> 00:54:59.304
<v Speaker 3>how can we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1187
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 3>this is extremely successful as I said</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1188
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:06.000
<v Speaker 3>cultural artifact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just keep pumping alternative</v>

1189
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 3>ideas in people's head.</v>

1190
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 3>If people start to hear it again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1191
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.140
<v Speaker 3>you're being lied to about civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been brought to older.</v>

1192
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 3>You're being lied to about the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

1193
00:55:13.771 --> 00:55:15.150
<v Speaker 3>You're being lied to about your options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1194
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:17.060
<v Speaker 3>like on a very simple level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had got,</v>

1195
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 3>as you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I've gathered quite a lot of</v>

1196
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 3>therapy over the course of my life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a result of their substance misuse,</v>

1197
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 3>addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just out of ongoing bloody</v>

1198
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:26.230
<v Speaker 3>curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>

1199
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:30.630
<v Speaker 3>the function of therapy is to increase</v>
<v Speaker 3>your choices in life because none of us</v>

1200
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 3>lives in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who's bloodied and the empty,</v>

1201
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 3>we'll know we don't live in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in a narrow,</v>

1202
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.900
<v Speaker 3>tiny bandwidth of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you just live in a model of</v>

1203
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not reality itself,</v>

1204
00:55:41.251 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 3>then you should take responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>remodeling your reality,</v>

1205
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:45.660
<v Speaker 3>particularly the not bloody api in it.</v>

1206
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 3>You can change it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can change your consciousness.</v>

1207
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 3>And for me at the moment that means</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite mundane things.</v>

1208
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:52.890
<v Speaker 3>It means that when I arrive here and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>suitcases don't arrive,</v>

1209
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll have the choices of do I now become</v>
<v Speaker 3>account and make people's lives fucking</v>

1210
00:55:56.761 --> 00:55:59.070
<v Speaker 3>miserable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do I just accept the cases are not</v>

1211
00:55:59.071 --> 00:55:59.790
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1212
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.490
<v Speaker 3>this is the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or when I arrive at the airport and I</v>

1213
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 3>ain't got my green card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really miss the flight like all,</v>

1214
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.620
<v Speaker 3>all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought,</v>

1215
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is happening right now.</v>

1216
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 3>The only choice I have in that moment is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the choice of whether or not to stop</v>

1217
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:12.750
<v Speaker 3>being a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1218
00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.900
<v Speaker 3>and I tried not to now and in the past I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1219
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited.</v>

1220
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 3>It is fairly well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to just get absorbed in it.</v>

1221
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.090
<v Speaker 3>My friend Tony Visa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this once.</v>

1222
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I know I've repeated this on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1223
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.880
<v Speaker 2>but my friend Tony v C drive from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Tony Vee,</v>

1224
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.140
<v Speaker 2>stand up comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1225
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Boston guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious guy.</v>

1226
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>He used to drive from New York to Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>

1227
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 2>like almost every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was constantly driving.</v>

1228
00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a pain in the ass like two and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half hours of two and a half hours back,</v>

1229
00:56:38.591 --> 00:56:40.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York to Boston.</v>

1230
00:56:40.181 --> 00:56:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And what does it thrive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1231
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.330
<v Speaker 2>that's a good foreign like a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schatz.</v>

1232
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of PBA cars are saying</v>

1233
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:53.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not that far for fucking hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1234
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I would say three at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1235
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 2>he drove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drove it all the time and,</v>

1236
00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 2>and he was talking about what he did was</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just went and zen and he said,</v>

1237
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he dealt with it.</v>

1238
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.340
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm driving like there's no,</v>

1239
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 2>there's no upset is known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm doing,</v>

1240
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this and if the cars are all</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and we're all going five miles</v>

1241
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're doing.</v>

1242
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's perfect.</v>

1243
00:57:13.441 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 3>That is literally then isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this is not to resist your reality</v>

1244
00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.280
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think that means becoming</v>
<v Speaker 3>some doormat that people can walk all</v>

1245
00:57:20.281 --> 00:57:22.170
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you are in a traffic jam is the</v>

1246
00:57:22.171 --> 00:57:25.170
<v Speaker 3>perfect example of a situation over</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you have no control in this</v>

1247
00:57:25.171 --> 00:57:27.630
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get an angry cannot influence or</v>

1248
00:57:27.631 --> 00:57:30.600
<v Speaker 3>determine that situation in any way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I think that if you can,</v>

1249
00:57:30.601 --> 00:57:34.140
<v Speaker 3>once you've realized it on a mundane</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of traffic jam our far,</v>

1250
00:57:34.141 --> 00:57:36.270
<v Speaker 3>can you extrapolate that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when someone goes,</v>

1251
00:57:36.271 --> 00:57:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm in love with someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaving you.</v>

1252
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:39.023
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1253
00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:41.690
<v Speaker 3>How long have you speak to that tolle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that guy got tall,</v>

1254
00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:46.691
<v Speaker 3>we wrote know he speaks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a German person Auntie so</v>

1255
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:52.041
<v Speaker 3>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can barely talk to some mistakes,</v>

1256
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.800
<v Speaker 3>some glitch in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I managed to get his phone number right.</v>

1257
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.753
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>

1258
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:07.600
<v Speaker 3>I have to ask you to stop calling me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm changing my</v>

1259
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:10.890
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was meant to be for one</v>

1260
00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:11.701
<v Speaker 3>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I thought,</v>

1261
00:58:11.701 --> 00:58:13.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got access to this Buddhist guy.</v>

1262
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pisses me off.</v>

1263
00:58:18.001 --> 00:58:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I call it go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I know?</v>

1264
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.290
<v Speaker 3>You're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've started to lot,</v>

1265
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:27.030
<v Speaker 3>but beyond</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's nothing that can be done</v>

1266
00:58:27.031 --> 00:58:28.170
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really.</v>

1267
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.280
<v Speaker 3>It was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Told you because I was like,</v>

1268
00:58:29.281 --> 00:58:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I was having a hard time with a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was seen and am I going to do and</v>

1269
00:58:33.361 --> 00:58:34.530
<v Speaker 3>she's done listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's done that and he goes,</v>

1270
00:58:34.531 --> 00:58:37.560
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you would resolve this conflict</v>

1271
00:58:37.561 --> 00:58:41.730
<v Speaker 3>and you will become married and you will</v>
<v Speaker 3>have children and then both of you will</v>

1272
00:58:41.731 --> 00:58:43.470
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was just like,</v>

1273
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.140
<v Speaker 3>you're just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he knows that actually you are.</v>

1274
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:49.260
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end point really.</v>

1275
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.500
<v Speaker 3>So like an hour over wherever you invest</v>
<v Speaker 3>your energy,</v>

1276
00:58:52.501 --> 00:58:55.860
<v Speaker 3>be fully well aware that at some point</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be really good.</v>

1277
00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might work out or death,</v>

1278
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but definitely death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Death.</v>

1279
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:01.670
<v Speaker 2>How many hours does it take to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston?</v>

1280
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:04.490
<v Speaker 2>A up three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes or so.</v>

1281
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.320
<v Speaker 2>So we're in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the middle.</v>

1282
00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:11.300
<v Speaker 2>It depends where you lead from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle and if you don't drive like my</v>

1283
00:59:11.301 --> 00:59:14.720
<v Speaker 2>mother and father would make me aware</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to be dead.</v>

1284
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.210
<v Speaker 2>How'd you man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my mom.</v>

1285
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:19.160
<v Speaker 2>My mom would always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be dead one day,</v>

1286
00:59:19.161 --> 00:59:20.150
<v Speaker 2>so you need to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1287
00:59:20.151 --> 00:59:20.984
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it would,</v>

1288
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:22.603
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>

1289
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She made,</v>

1290
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I want to say I was still alive</v>

1291
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 3>five to seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1292
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:31.780
<v Speaker 3>five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She introduced Jim to the concept of</v>

1293
00:59:31.781 --> 00:59:33.280
<v Speaker 3>mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five to seven.</v>

1294
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I was still struggling with a goldfish</v>
<v Speaker 3>concept that goldfish gone,</v>

1295
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.393
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry.</v>

1296
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To start those thoughts off?</v>

1297
00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's accept this and get over these</v>

1298
00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:45.230
<v Speaker 4>goddamn things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's figure out what the fuck.</v>

1299
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:48.500
<v Speaker 4>We're so terrified above that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>create a land in the clouds that were</v>

1300
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 4>definitely all going to go to a meet up</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the fucking show,</v>

1301
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:51.943
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1302
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 4>that put me in check of the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it.</v>

1303
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:54.960
<v Speaker 4>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

1304
00:59:54.961 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made me sob.</v>

1305
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Just the thought of where we going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are we going?</v>

1306
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.990
<v Speaker 4>What happens is just are we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it just blackness like gluten and my</v>

1307
01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 4>and my father towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just.</v>

1308
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Lily went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1309
01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.970
<v Speaker 4>He said your dad and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1310
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:13.790
<v Speaker 4>show goes on and it's simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Evelyn.</v>

1311
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about that past</v>

1312
01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:17.650
<v Speaker 3>blake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not down with that one.</v>

1313
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean like listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cloud kingdom.</v>

1314
01:00:19.331 --> 01:00:20.510
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1315
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.350
<v Speaker 3>before we moved to Oakland about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt experiences in new said,</v>

1316
01:00:23.351 --> 01:00:26.340
<v Speaker 3>it will be like a sort of a cave man</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a cran trying to draw,</v>

1317
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.030
<v Speaker 3>draw God right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even on campus or maybe very</v>

1318
01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.810
<v Speaker 3>specifically said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can rewind the podcast.</v>

1319
01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:33.350
<v Speaker 3>You can listen to it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what Joe said,</v>

1320
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said your fingers were</v>

1321
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:39.090
<v Speaker 3>stubby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be in that particular.</v>

1322
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like it when people talk about,</v>

1323
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when like,</v>

1324
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:46.500
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kingdom of Heaven is within or you</v>

1325
01:00:46.501 --> 01:00:48.880
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the afterlife there'll be 72 virgins.</v>

1326
01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Me Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see these things,</v>

1327
01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:53.590
<v Speaker 3>his metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be as if you will be in such a</v>

1328
01:00:53.591 --> 01:00:57.100
<v Speaker 3>blissful state when you are free of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shackles of the material realm when you</v>

1329
01:00:57.101 --> 01:00:58.600
<v Speaker 3>are liberated from your body.</v>

1330
01:00:59.020 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 3>I spent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1331
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:03.340
<v Speaker 3>how's this is this isn't nothing sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes me look good and maybe it makes me</v>

1332
01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:05.590
<v Speaker 3>look sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing one of my base of altruism.</v>

1333
01:01:05.591 --> 01:01:06.401
<v Speaker 3>Never Day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1334
01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:08.050
<v Speaker 3>like our doll out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bits of altruism.</v>

1335
01:01:08.051 --> 01:01:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I told you I already mentioned going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a homeless place today if you're picking</v>

1336
01:01:10.691 --> 01:01:11.830
<v Speaker 3>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pretty nice guy.</v>

1337
01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.300
<v Speaker 3>I was at this other place that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a adult learning difficulties</v>

1338
01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:17.134
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1339
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:22.690
<v Speaker 3>And for me the term learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulties was polite because these</v>

1340
01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:23.730
<v Speaker 3>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1341
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.540
<v Speaker 3>fucking seriously mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1342
01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:27.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1343
01:01:27.561 --> 01:01:29.620
<v Speaker 3>That was beautiful human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1344
01:01:29.621 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well anyway,</v>

1345
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 3>there was not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a really fantastic time there and</v>

1346
01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:34.990
<v Speaker 3>of course it made me feel incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful for my own life and all the</v>

1347
01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:37.660
<v Speaker 3>things one would imagine that you'd feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>in such a situation most and now</v>

1348
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:40.240
<v Speaker 3>chatting to the people and one person</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1349
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.820
<v Speaker 3>people get very certificates for various</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of achievements,</v>

1350
01:01:42.821 --> 01:01:46.210
<v Speaker 3>whether it was in the art art doing some</v>
<v Speaker 3>joins or whether it was doing some</v>

1351
01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:47.044
<v Speaker 3>cooking or whatever.</v>

1352
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:51.730
<v Speaker 3>And like I started to feel the impulse</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sort of a bit of patronizing this of</v>

1353
01:01:51.731 --> 01:01:52.241
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1354
01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.560
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that certificate.</v>

1355
01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I for a minute,</v>

1356
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.640
<v Speaker 3>this ain't no fucking different from</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's doing a full year.</v>

1357
01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:00.550
<v Speaker 3>I in religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in global politics really.</v>

1358
01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can imagine supreme</v>

1359
01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:04.170
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could imagine the realms</v>

1360
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.120
<v Speaker 3>experienced on dmt or the realms that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been described with people that</v>

1361
01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.790
<v Speaker 3>have dedicated themselves to meditation</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Kundalini of Datasat,</v>

1362
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.780
<v Speaker 3>cade themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1363
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna get into them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super states of consciousness accessible</v>

1364
01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.410
<v Speaker 3>to individuals and our birth right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people say that our little</v>

1365
01:02:17.411 --> 01:02:19.560
<v Speaker 3>achievements have I got myself a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giraffe,</v>

1366
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.230
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new car or the things that I'm proud</v>

1367
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:25.620
<v Speaker 3>of today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We similarly over on this little</v>

1368
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 3>pedestrian level in a lot with sweet</v>
<v Speaker 3>little darling things.</v>

1369
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Really with our material achievements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our accolades and awards and it,</v>

1370
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.050
<v Speaker 3>it changed my perspective of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like bloody hell.</v>

1371
01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:39.280
<v Speaker 3>The difference between me and someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not in the.</v>

1372
01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 3>What would you consider being the normal</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straw of the mental health field?</v>

1373
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.050
<v Speaker 3>It's no real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that bloody different.</v>

1374
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Not In infinite space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not with Jupiter sucking in meet yours.</v>

1375
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit going on right now.</v>

1376
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.400
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that's,</v>

1377
01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is confined to sort of cooking</v>

1378
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 3>projects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not hugely significant except I'm</v>

1379
01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:01.170
<v Speaker 3>not that good at cooking in a way there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never got asked.</v>

1380
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be hugely significant in</v>

1381
01:03:03.791 --> 01:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>your perspective when you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>

1382
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's very significant in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two of you are relating to each</v>

1383
01:03:08.921 --> 01:03:13.450
<v Speaker 2>other and trying to work this life out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to be sort of a compatible</v>

1384
01:03:13.451 --> 01:03:15.760
<v Speaker 2>try to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to be friendly with each other and</v>

1385
01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:19.840
<v Speaker 2>work out all the weird cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between everybody and try to</v>

1386
01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:22.900
<v Speaker 2>get to the essence of what it means to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a person and we're all going through</v>

1387
01:03:22.901 --> 01:03:24.940
<v Speaker 2>some weird sort of struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one escapes the struggle.</v>

1388
01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Not even Johnny Depp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even Johnny Depp.</v>

1389
01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Even jade time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in Johnny.</v>

1390
01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp got dragged into the Golden</v>
<v Speaker 2>Triangle of pussy problems and he's in</v>

1391
01:03:36.101 --> 01:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1392
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't care.</v>

1393
01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:41.500
<v Speaker 2>He did the rock star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did this happen during the rock store?</v>

1394
01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you hear this recently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's getting.</v>

1395
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>His girlfriend said he beat her and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying he's saying his girlfriend,</v>

1396
01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:50.470
<v Speaker 2>his fucking Doug standups getting sued</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he wrote a whole article saying</v>

1397
01:03:50.471 --> 01:03:53.230
<v Speaker 2>that he's really good friends with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp and Doug Stanhope wrote an</v>

1398
01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>article about how the woman is a been</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackmailing johnny and threatening him</v>

1399
01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>and he brought it up before the.</v>

1400
01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing came out in the news</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she had certain demands.</v>

1401
01:04:02.861 --> 01:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't reach UNOS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's fucking right and who's wrong?</v>

1402
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>

1403
01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether Johnny telling them the truth or</v>

1404
01:04:09.491 --> 01:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

1405
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>even Johnny Depp can escape to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy problems.</v>

1406
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.210
<v Speaker 2>The reality of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1407
01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:18.200
<v Speaker 2>he's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said he's,</v>

1408
01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I think for the first time in life he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said he would,</v>

1409
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>you would see him with images of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rockstars and he loved.</v>

1410
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>But now he's touring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's doing what?</v>

1411
01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.390

<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

1412
01:04:28.391 --> 01:04:31.720
<v Speaker 2>he went on a rock tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm telling you,</v>

1413
01:04:31.721 --> 01:04:34.420
<v Speaker 2>it's cooper selling hot dogs in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Dude,</v>

1414

<v Speaker 2>of a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that's it,</v>

1421
01:04:48.011 --> 01:04:50.080
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think Johnny Depp is just being</v>

1422
01:04:50.081 --> 01:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good God damn time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>exemplary life.</v>

1431
01:05:10.931 --> 01:05:13.480

<v Speaker 2>He had a radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's addicted.</v>

1436
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>He got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes to movies and he only sees</v>

1437
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He only sees the premieres and then he</v>

1438
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>goes on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like this is the first time he</v>

1439
01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.060
<v Speaker 2>sort of like hundreds of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big difference between.</v>

1440
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're trying to say that he isn't</v>

1441
01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:56.500
<v Speaker 2>doing shows is this brought him to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high heat and he pried it?</v>

1442
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably having a ball,</v>

1443
01:05:57.881 --> 01:06:01.150
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not saying that this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it could be that simple.</v>

1444
01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:02.630
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Ah,</v>

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a big high boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just stood on the stage.</v>

1446
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:07.810
<v Speaker 2>You'd go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1447
01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 2>the only time that you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dress like that.</v>

1448
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:16.200
<v Speaker 2>You can't dress like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really you have to go on stage to</v>

1449
01:06:16.201 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 2>dress up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

1450
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 2>go to those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those photos.</v>

1451
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.740
<v Speaker 2>If you come over my house with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking leather pants on and a shirt</v>

1452
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:21.730
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking choke.</v>

1453
01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 2>You can't come in my house like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing man?</v>

1454
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Why are you dressing like you just came</v>
<v Speaker 2>over on a boat from Spain?</v>

1455
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Some Cell Toro risks being taken that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got laser on his wrists,</v>

1456
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 2>but you can pull that off if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>band.</v>

1457
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he always dresses like that.</v>

1458
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's wearing his regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>

1459
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Like for Johnny Depp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing regular clothes,</v>

1460
01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:53.110
<v Speaker 2>but he does have his sleeves rolled up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see what I mean.</v>

1461
01:06:53.111 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Sort of expectation for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely working on that image.</v>

1462
01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he must've hair up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose?</v>

1463
01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Like not Masiya enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1464
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.920

<v Speaker 2>Just wanting to go to Germany just like</v>

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Paik I think can just go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

1469
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just do that too.</v>

1470
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no one wants to stage and</v>

1471
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:20.830
<v Speaker 2>entering gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him value freight to go it tied in lace</v>

<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1473
01:07:23.941 --> 01:07:24.630
<v Speaker 2>in his.</v>

1474
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:27.850
<v Speaker 2>His situation is whether he's navigating</v>
<v Speaker 2>it successfully or not.</v>

1475
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely in a strange path of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>river.</v>

1476
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in a strange,</v>

1477
01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 2>really deep wide channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would incredible rapids and he's riding</v>

1478
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:40.210
<v Speaker 2>on a fucking inner tube down the stretch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of river that nobody gets to ride.</v>

1479
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:44.810
<v Speaker 2>The Johnny Depp stretches like Tom</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruise stretch or the Samuel Jackson</v>

1480
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:45.251
<v Speaker 2>stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1481
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these motherfuckers can't go</v>

1482
01:07:47.741 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1484
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Hangs around with Johnny Depp and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't go anywhere.</v>

1485
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>They have dudes with earpieces</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1486
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.390
<v Speaker 2>There's people constantly circling him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure he's okay and he'll go into</v>

1487
01:07:58.391 --> 01:08:00.430
<v Speaker 2>a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are guarding the</v>

1488
01:08:00.431 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 2>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're watching the.</v>

1489
01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:03.730
<v Speaker 2>They're making sure people don't go in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room.</v>

1490
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different than even regular fame.</v>

1491
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>He's in that pirates of the Caribbean</v>
<v Speaker 2>fame where it's just can't go anywhere.</v>

1492
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:14.290
<v Speaker 2>That's an expensive product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

1493
01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I need to protect that product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1494
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:18.170
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's super vulnerable,</v>

1495
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>like people lose their fucking minds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're around a certain level of</v>

1496
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.490
<v Speaker 2>celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>

1497
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise can't go to the movies.</v>

1498
01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:27.610
<v Speaker 2>He's get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you went to the movies,</v>

1499
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 2>he would leave the movie theater and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will be trying to grab him as he</v>

1500
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:34.310
<v Speaker 2>was walking in the theater just to touch</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and take pictures with them and it's</v>

1501
01:08:34.311 --> 01:08:36.140
<v Speaker 2>not like you can't just interact with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1502
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:36.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1503
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Identify only Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an intense experience.</v>

1504
01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:41.050
<v Speaker 3>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do?</v>

1505
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.440
<v Speaker 3>It was a film called rock of ages that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baldwin,</v>

1506
01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.470
<v Speaker 3>lots of freely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freely famous people were in it and the</v>

1507
01:08:50.471 --> 01:08:55.471
<v Speaker 3>monkey and the monkey when already where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no monkey in it and at some</v>

1508
01:08:55.601 --> 01:08:58.180
<v Speaker 3>point Tom Cruise said there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a monkey in his film,</v>

1509
01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.880
<v Speaker 3>and from that point there was a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey in the film.</v>

1510
01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Even Mass Ada monkey was in scenes that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom cruise weren't in one with me and</v>

1511
01:09:04.931 --> 01:09:08.860
<v Speaker 3>the monkey was an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was wearing a nappy that was tied on</v>

1512
01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:10.540
<v Speaker 3>with electric tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very aggressive.</v>

1513
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.600
<v Speaker 3>It jumped off of the shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy that was meant to be looking</v>

1514
01:09:13.601 --> 01:09:15.790
<v Speaker 3>after the monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkey had a trailer with five other</v>

1515
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 3>monkeys in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could fuck in its time off was</v>

1516
01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.980
<v Speaker 3>getting the monkeys fucking contract.</v>

1517
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.910
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't have to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say there's a scene with the</v>

1518
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.590
<v Speaker 3>monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know acting at.</v>

1519
01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.380
<v Speaker 3>All I'm doing is he's just a man</v>
<v Speaker 3>nervously looking at.</v>

1520
01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking that thing down off</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shoulder at any point now.</v>

1521
01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could fuck.</v>

1522
01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Well Thomas Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes traveling king,</v>

1523
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's got many,</v>

1524
01:09:39.521 --> 01:09:44.521
<v Speaker 3>many trailers like and like so like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you arrive in a situation you think</v>

1525
01:09:44.831 --> 01:09:46.900
<v Speaker 3>rock era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My prejudices about Tom Cruise,</v>

1526
01:09:46.901 --> 01:09:49.540
<v Speaker 3>all the things I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things I've heard go prejudice.</v>

1527
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Like we meet him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he blasted me.</v>

1528
01:09:51.761 --> 01:09:55.990
<v Speaker 3>We've searched affability and charm that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they melt it away.</v>

1529
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Ice cones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the pure hate of the man.</v>

1530
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Sweetness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gave a lock on the sofa.</v>

1531
01:10:00.601 --> 01:10:03.010
<v Speaker 3>It was my birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>During that film I got a big basket full</v>

1532
01:10:03.011 --> 01:10:05.910
<v Speaker 3>of black yoga related things and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1533
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.740
<v Speaker 3>They sort of fought for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember?</v>

1534
01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:08.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake your hand.</v>

01:10:08.681 --> 01:10:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Remembers your name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of remembers details about eggs.</v>

1536
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I could brief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned you're on a or something</v>

1537
01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:15.070
<v Speaker 3>into compensation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next conversation.</v>

1538
01:10:15.071 --> 01:10:16.780
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned that on A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went round.</v>

1539
01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:19.090
<v Speaker 3>His house for dinner was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really late because of that fucking</v>

1540
01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:20.560
<v Speaker 3>monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually it was playing up.</v>

1541
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.530
<v Speaker 3>A lucky was not working that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back,</v>

1542
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.430
<v Speaker 3>went mandy's affidavit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said when he'd been married,</v>

1543
01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Katie Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's that little famous Tom</v>

1544
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Siri Cruz was.</v>

1545
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.030
<v Speaker 3>They're all lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went there.</v>

1546
01:10:30.031 --> 01:10:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very late and they'd like the Ada wheat</v>

1547
01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.120
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1548
01:10:34.121 --> 01:10:36.040
<v Speaker 3>well do you want to still eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

1549
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:36.401
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1550
01:10:36.401 --> 01:10:38.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wait and I had to sat like I'm sitting</v>

1551
01:10:38.731 --> 01:10:41.620
<v Speaker 3>with you now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Opposite Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes</v>

1552
01:10:41.621 --> 01:10:46.360
<v Speaker 3>and the little dial in one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking in spaghetti like and it's</v>

1553
01:10:46.361 --> 01:10:49.680
<v Speaker 3>as a complicated thing to eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1554
01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:50.370
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1555
01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I was telling me that a lady and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tramp shoving that shit in and then the</v>

1556
01:10:53.321 --> 01:10:56.200
<v Speaker 3>next course I think was the signer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was weird because that's to pass</v>

1557
01:10:56.201 --> 01:10:58.110
<v Speaker 3>the courses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I think there was like sort of</v>

1558
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.280
<v Speaker 3>cupcakes and stuff involved all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1559
01:11:00.281 --> 01:11:03.400
<v Speaker 3>It just sat opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise silicon about communism,</v>

1560
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.340
<v Speaker 3>which I brought up as a topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in retrospect was a mistake.</v>

1561
01:11:06.341 --> 01:11:07.091
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1562
01:11:07.091 --> 01:11:10.930
<v Speaker 3>because don't bring up communism because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like what I said was our goes,</v>

1563
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm down with fairness where I goes,</v>

1564
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>communism.</v>

1565
01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surely it went a bit.</v>

1566
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.940
<v Speaker 3>It got a bit out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's arguing with that.</v>

1567
01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Went a bit hectic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not down with massacres.</v>

1568
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Genocides under one flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fairness and justice I'm fully up</v>

1569
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Tom Cruise goes out.</v>

1570
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Data about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The communism.</v>

1571
01:11:28.641 --> 01:11:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Marco's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 3>But Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were born with this thing.</v>

1573
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.950
<v Speaker 3>You've been born with this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's like being born an Irish.</v>

1574
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.711
<v Speaker 3>The crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1575
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 3>like the thing that you've got that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive or wherever,</v>

1576
01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1577
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 3>like people aren't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to explain it to Tom,</v>

1578
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hard for him to take me</v>

1579
01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:44.900
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speaker eight,</v>

1580
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:49.170
<v Speaker 3>amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had a good go of saying it's</v>

1581
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.890
<v Speaker 3>probably different to be Tom cruise than</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1582
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1583
01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1584
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.320
<v Speaker 3>what was he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the communism is a bad idea.</v>

1585
01:11:55.321 --> 01:11:56.520
<v Speaker 3>And you were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1586
01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:01.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe sharing more would be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it weird that communism is</v>

1587
01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 3>connected to dictatorships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of the opposite of</v>

1588
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:04.410
<v Speaker 3>communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

1589
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as people start to implement</v>

1590
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.430
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets in fucking trouble,</v>

1591
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:10.570
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people started.</v>

1592
01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:11.483
<v Speaker 3>People put Lauer.</v>

1593
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.001
<v Speaker 3>Nicole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1594
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 3>the power of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because all of these political ideas and</v>

1595
01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:17.100
<v Speaker 3>religious art is exposed to just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here,</v>

1596
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:18.870
<v Speaker 3>we're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or should we try and make it as nice as</v>

1597
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:20.880
<v Speaker 3>possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like part of that is going to be not</v>

1598
01:12:20.881 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 3>been out of order to each other and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sort of like and buy all of them</v>

1599
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.730
<v Speaker 3>interface with our problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problems.</v>

1600
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 3>We have described those biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanical drive.</v>

1601
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I said is like the communism there</v>

1602
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 3>is socialism and communism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>communism.</v>

1603
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 3>That's different from the depiction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communism that a lot of Americans and</v>

1604
01:12:39.811 --> 01:12:42.010
<v Speaker 3>English people would have because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

1605
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 3>We were on the other side of the Cold</v>
<v Speaker 3>War.</v>

1606
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:46.080
<v Speaker 3>So we got a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very negative impact.</v>

1607
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:48.080
<v Speaker 3>And of course that was a version of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communism.</v>

1608
01:12:48.081 --> 01:12:50.580
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty fucking brutal in places</v>
<v Speaker 3>as is capitalism,</v>

1609
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:51.120
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1610
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sort of like trying to kick</v>
<v Speaker 3>around these.</v>

1611
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:53.431
<v Speaker 3>I was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1612
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 3>but really all communism is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a sort of a version of Christianity</v>

1613
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 3>in that it's saying we are all brothers</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and all of us have riots and we</v>

1614
01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:03.450
<v Speaker 3>should be trying to build a society</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we love each other.</v>

1615
01:13:03.451 --> 01:13:04.750
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1616
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.281
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1617
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.400
<v Speaker 3>where it goes wrong is it doesn't allow</v>
<v Speaker 3>room for individualism and the many</v>

1618
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:11.910
<v Speaker 3>myriad distinctions between different</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings by one concentrate on that,</v>

1619
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really communism or that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really more of dictatorships.</v>

1620
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.000
<v Speaker 3>That was dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can dress it up.</v>

1621
01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:18.841
<v Speaker 3>It won't because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1622
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:19.541
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:20.311
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

1624
01:13:20.311 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a scholar in communism,</v>

1625
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:24.240
<v Speaker 3>otherwise I'm going to do a degree in</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and global politics.</v>

1626
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.700
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to spend the next three years</v>

1627
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1628
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Part time you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to pop in a day and that week.</v>

1629
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 3>And actually have not done it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go go for the interview next week.</v>

1630
01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping they're going to let me in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just on the basis of.</v>

1631
01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.090
<v Speaker 3>C'Mon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me in the fucking Tele.</v>

1632
01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Give us a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1633
01:13:37.771 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 3>so I'm there anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point,</v>

1634
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 3>my point I was trying to make is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>things get convoluted and complicated</v>

1635
01:13:43.471 --> 01:13:44.220
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1636
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.190
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology and demagoguery.</v>

1637
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.340
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately we're just meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing and sort as bloody community.</v>

1638
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dictatorship aspect of it is almost</v>

1639
01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:58.170
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like that same inescapable</v>

1640
01:13:58.171 --> 01:14:02.070
<v Speaker 3>drive that causes someone to want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkey with the five monkeys did a</v>

1641
01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 3>good fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only so long going,</v>

1642
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking fine.</v>

1643
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Wherever it's like any sort of religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism,</v>

1644
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:12.030
<v Speaker 3>there's always some guy at the end of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and I'm going to</v>

1645
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 1>be fucking five monkeys in my trailer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that person's ruining it for</v>

1646
01:14:15.491 --> 01:14:17.310
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like whenever you see like about</v>

1647
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.970
<v Speaker 1>religious coal in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1648
01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I've started a religious cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1649
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 1>we all live here together and we grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>around vegetables.</v>

1650
01:14:23.531 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Everything's organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:14:24.401 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lovely mate.</v>

1652
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking everyone.</v>

1653
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I done against that a little bit.</v>

1654
01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1655
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I've got a monkey trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else's wives.</v>

1656
01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:35.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1657
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inescapable things about being a person</v>

1658
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:42.340
<v Speaker 1>who did these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These drives that you have to figure out</v>

1659
01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>how to hold them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think communism would work.</v>

1660
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this was a community,</v>

1661
01:14:46.631 --> 01:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were the only four people on an</v>

1662
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:49.560
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just us four,</v>

1663
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.980
<v Speaker 1>we would be communists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would all just get together and we</v>

1664
01:14:52.981 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 1>would talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you guys want to handle this?</v>

1665
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we gather this?</v>

1666
01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:14:58.901 --> 01:14:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1668
01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good at climbing trees under</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the coconuts are.</v>

1669
01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:02.291
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

1670
01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And we'd figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Share poems cause only provide those,</v>

1671
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 1>but we will lose our share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1672
01:15:08.681 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Speaker 1>And if we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to have a conversation.</v>

1673
01:15:10.511 --> 01:15:11.830
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

1674
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:14.830
<v Speaker 1>you're not fucking digging enough holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you don't catch enough fish.</v>

1675
01:15:14.831 --> 01:15:16.600
<v Speaker 1>We gotta we gotta work this out</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1676
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 1>So we all contributed in equal amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be lazy and exist off the</v>

1677
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 1>fruits of your brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labor.</v>

1678
01:15:21.841 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all contribute.</v>

1679
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:25.280
<v Speaker 1>What's difference between that and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal?</v>

1680
01:15:25.281 --> 01:15:26.700
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

1681
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inner chimpanzee societies,</v>

1682
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:33.390
<v Speaker 1>they have about 75 chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan,</v>

1683
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 1>once it gets to about eight or nine a</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get edgy and they normally break</v>

1684
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:42.481
<v Speaker 1>off and go a breakaway chimp community</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is getting too heavy over</v>

1685
01:15:42.561 --> 01:15:45.940
<v Speaker 1>here and so the assumption is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1686
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 1>great apes ourselves similarly should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in manageable communities.</v>

1687
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.470
<v Speaker 1>We serve over stimulate new exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1688
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.540
<v Speaker 1>when you were sort of joking about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of women and femininity,</v>

1689
01:15:57.790 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not meant to be exposed to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

1690
01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not meant to meet that exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of imagery that is present in</v>

1691
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:05.620
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't mean to be exposed to that</v>

1692
01:16:05.621 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 1>kind of that kind of variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women to be like,</v>

1693
01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:09.230
<v Speaker 1>there's 50 or 60 of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1694
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.420
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good warriors.</v>

1695
01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:12.680
<v Speaker 1>These people are good fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people look at it.</v>

1696
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean mysticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you find little roles in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1698
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>since we've lived in this mono culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are like little cells,</v>

1699
01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:22.840
<v Speaker 1>batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sort of stacked up together in</v>

1700
01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 1>cities and suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like how do you access that we're</v>

1701
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 1>not having an authentic human</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1702
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 1>so that's why there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do I want to say?</v>

1703
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's an authentic human experience,</v>

1704
01:16:32.471 --> 01:16:35.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different thing and I've,</v>

1705
01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to figure out what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually doing,</v>

1706
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.510
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting more and more connected.</v>

1707
01:16:40.511 --> 01:16:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're doing when these cities is</v>

1708
01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:46.570
<v Speaker 1>we're connecting 20 million people into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this massive buildings and then we're</v>

1709
01:16:46.571 --> 01:16:49.180
<v Speaker 1>connecting them all with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't connecting those 20</v>

1710
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 1>million people with 10 million people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this state and 5 million people in that</v>

1711
01:16:52.751 --> 01:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're,</v>

1712
01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.240
<v Speaker 1>we're all becoming one sort of weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic group that's very,</v>

1713
01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:03.100
<v Speaker 1>very dissimilar from the original tribal</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups that allowed one alpha male to</v>

1714
01:17:03.101 --> 01:17:05.770
<v Speaker 1>run things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Alpha female community.</v>

1715
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knowing and understanding each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1716
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk like archeologists</v>

1717
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 2>and have you ever read sex at dawn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Chris Ryan,</v>

1718
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>really interesting book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he maintains is that this idea,</v>

1719
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>even of monogamy that didn't exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tribal cultures,</v>

1720
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:24.420
<v Speaker 2>they shared sexuality like everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>swapped around and people banged</v>

1721
01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>everybody and that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they stayed intimate is that they</v>

1722
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:31.040
<v Speaker 2>all probably were polyamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamorous,</v>

1723
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.920
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't understand they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal.</v>

1724
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 2>It speaks to our nature because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be monogamous.</v>

1725
01:17:37.881 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the polyamorous thing also speaks to</v>

1726
01:17:41.331 --> 01:17:44.750
<v Speaker 2>this idea that before we understood</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics and we understood DNA,</v>

1727
01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.300
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know whose children they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you had a child,</v>

1728
01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 2>if a woman had a child and I fucked her</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you fucked her and you fucked her,</v>

1729
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:52.610
<v Speaker 2>we'll assume it's our kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>

1730
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:54.140
<v Speaker 2>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand it.</v>

1731
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:57.640
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will mail and clues along the way.</v>

1732
01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely people get it.</v>

1733
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:03.280
<v Speaker 2>They figured it out after a while that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids struggling a little paypal.</v>

1734
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 2>But that's a weird thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how children maintain some sort of</v>

1735
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:13.610
<v Speaker 2>talent traits that their parents have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's things that get passed on</v>

1736
01:18:13.611 --> 01:18:17.620
<v Speaker 2>through children to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through DNA of obsessive behaviors come</v>

1737
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:21.920
<v Speaker 2>like a desire to grow and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like have kids that are very</v>

1738
01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:26.450
<v Speaker 2>similar in personality that seemed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like inherent to the child that seems to</v>

1739
01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 2>come through the DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it wouldn't,</v>

1740
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.790
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't that be a little bit to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid that's only knows growing up and</v>

1741
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's watching maybe a parent that's</v>

1742
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:38.390
<v Speaker 2>obsessive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's either going to not be in that or</v>

1743
01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's possible.</v>

1744
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also like a pattern that</v>

1745
01:18:44.301 --> 01:18:45.200
<v Speaker 2>they follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>

1746
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:48.230
<v Speaker 2>my middle daughter is obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1747
01:18:48.231 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 2>She gets obsessed with things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she's read six Harry Potter books.</v>

1748
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:52.460
<v Speaker 2>She's eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's keeps reading them.</v>

1749
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.190
<v Speaker 2>She'll read hours and hours every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she also wants to talk about</v>

1750
01:18:55.191 --> 01:18:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's all fucking totally.</v>

1751
01:18:56.991 --> 01:18:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Harry Potter it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all day long she will explain</v>

1752
01:18:59.361 --> 01:18:59.780
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1753
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that Harry Potter thing?</v>

1754
01:19:00.921 --> 01:19:01.760
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>

1755
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:03.260
<v Speaker 2>And then she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll,</v>

1756
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:06.380
<v Speaker 2>she's just obsessed with Harry Potter or</v>
<v Speaker 2>gymnastics or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1757
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:09.170
<v Speaker 2>She's very much like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she gets something,</v>

1758
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.550
<v Speaker 2>she just doing cartwheels in the living</v>
<v Speaker 2>room all day long and fucking backhand</v>

1759
01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:13.460
<v Speaker 2>springs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never stops.</v>

1760
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 2>She's just obsessed and she gets on</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and just ride them out and</v>

1761
01:19:17.601 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't even necessarily know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I am.</v>

1762
01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she sees that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like that when I'm around her.</v>

1763
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you observing her and it's the same</v>

1764
01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:27.501
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1765
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 2>She's got my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see she's exhibiting traits.</v>

1766
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.440
<v Speaker 2>She's not been taught.</v>

1767
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.660
<v Speaker 2>They're very extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very extreme.</v>

1768
01:19:35.661 --> 01:19:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1769
01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:40.250
<v Speaker 2>it's similar because my youngest</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter is just silly.</v>

1770
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>She's not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1771
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.330
<v Speaker 2>she's not obsessive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just a fun little kid.</v>

1772
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 2>But the middle one is kind of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1773
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:47.803
<v Speaker 2>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that,</v>

1774
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.550
<v Speaker 2>does that make you feel like different</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of connection?</v>

1775
01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:53.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1776
01:19:53.731 --> 01:19:54.380
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1777
01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:54.921
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1778
01:19:54.921 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>This is the connection with all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting thing about having</v>

1779
01:19:57.681 --> 01:19:59.330
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The connection with all of them is just</v>

1780
01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:01.680
<v Speaker 2>so spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

1781
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.490
<v Speaker 2>there's not like I connect with this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that one,</v>

1782
01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>connect with all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1783
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.550
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to observe your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre personality traits manifesting</v>

1784
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 2>themselves almost in a genetic level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kid.</v>

1785
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1786
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:16.623
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1787
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.020
<v Speaker 2>my middle one's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My middle one is identical twin.</v>

1788
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Me and I sometimes I like it.</v>

1789
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I love it and sometimes they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1790
01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:24.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

1791
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 2>How old is she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's 14.</v>

1792
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 2>So she's really blossoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

1793
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:32.730
<v Speaker 2>The one that does all the gymnastics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

1794
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I noticed too with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they express happiness in different</v>

1795
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My oldest one,</v>

1796
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>the only time I know she's truly happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's 17 now,</v>

1797
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>is when she's bouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>singing,</v>

1798
01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 2>doing a cartwheel outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kind of instrument.</v>

1799
01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:48.300
<v Speaker 2>That's when she's silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1800
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's up.</v>

1801
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.950
<v Speaker 2>This kid's been silenced or turned dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So expressive.</v>

1802
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also when you think about it,</v>

1803
01:20:54.331 --> 01:20:57.090
<v Speaker 2>like who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like more expressive than you,</v>

1804
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:01.190
<v Speaker 2>like you're this like joyful guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>always get this crazy laugh and you</v>

1805
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.120
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by now at 14,</v>

1806
01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 2>she's super aware that you play these</v>
<v Speaker 2>places all over the world.</v>

1807
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 2>People come to see you and laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1808
01:21:09.151 --> 01:21:10.750
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be bizarre to what does it</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>

1809
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:11.810
<v Speaker 2>What does your dad do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1810
01:21:11.811 --> 01:21:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I fixed the pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about your dad just talks shit in</v>

1811
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.570
<v Speaker 2>front of people and they left their dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1812
01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very bizarre thing for a kid to</v>

1813
01:21:17.731 --> 01:21:18.211
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1814
01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:18.631
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1815
01:21:18.631 --> 01:21:20.580
<v Speaker 2>You can do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1816
01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they see that and then you know,</v>

1817
01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.730
<v Speaker 2>and also I'm sure you're not restrictive</v>
<v Speaker 2>in how they express themselves.</v>

1818
01:21:26.731 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 2>You probably want them to have fun and</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh and joke around a lot.</v>

1819
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1820
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.810
<v Speaker 2>so that gets encouraged and then I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>

1821
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.690
<v Speaker 2>like self reflection and all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1822
01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.653
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1823
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 2>these are muscles and you can work on</v>
<v Speaker 2>those muscles.</v>

1824
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:41.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

1825
01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:42.120
<v Speaker 2>you can develop them.</v>

1826
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I think you're absolutely right about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1827
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:44.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1828
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1829
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I've been using these circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leather,</v>

1830
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.530
<v Speaker 3>if you login,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it must be neurologically.</v>

1831
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm speculating about</v>
<v Speaker 3>neurology,</v>

1832
01:21:51.211 --> 01:21:53.540
<v Speaker 3>which is probably not something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who knows nothing about you,</v>

1833
01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 2>none of us do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll just follow you on</v>

1834
01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.560
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1835
01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:01.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're continually activate in</v>

1836
01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:03.960
<v Speaker 3>certain neurological pathways or</v>
<v Speaker 3>creating relationships,</v>

1837
01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.810
<v Speaker 3>synaptic relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that,</v>

1838
01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.320
<v Speaker 3>that's going to fire up more readily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1839
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:09.510
<v Speaker 3>I notice it with some of these new</v>
<v Speaker 3>things I'm doing,</v>

1840
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 3>like initially when people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining stuff about getting out of</v>

1841
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.260
<v Speaker 3>off guard and lighten how even to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shuffle on the floor,</v>

1842
01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:17.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shrimp is.</v>

1843
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:19.640
<v Speaker 3>I said I ain't ever going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do this sooner.</v>

1844
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.960
<v Speaker 3>So flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's making its way</v>

1845
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 3>behaviorally into a different aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my consciousness.</v>

1846
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose if there's like in a wind</v>
<v Speaker 3>to happiness or misery or addiction,</v>

1847
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 3>if you're continually living in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>circuit,</v>

1848
01:22:31.801 --> 01:22:32.710
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1849
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people talk about programming I feel</v>

1850
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:36.870
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm aware of my programming,</v>

1851
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:38.910
<v Speaker 3>is there certain things that if people</v>
<v Speaker 3>say them to me,</v>

1852
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:41.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't help the reaction that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1853
01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 3>obvious ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a citizen.</v>

1854
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.170
<v Speaker 3>If I'm exposed to certain sexual images,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1855
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1856
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel all those feelings before I make</v>

1857
01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 3>any decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone makes me feel insecure or say</v>

1858
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:52.260
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to really watch that moment</v>

1859
01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:55.800
<v Speaker 3>before because otherwise before now I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone down a path of behavior and I think</v>

1860
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:59.760
<v Speaker 3>that what the perhaps what we can do on</v>
<v Speaker 3>an individual level is learn.</v>

1861
01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:02.310
<v Speaker 3>And this is not hard for people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in total fucking crisis and</v>

1862
01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.550
<v Speaker 3>dreadful poverty in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said before,</v>

1863
01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a privileged position where I can</v>

1864
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 3>begin to bring my consciousness to those</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of things,</v>

1865
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to live on that circuit.</v>

1866
01:23:11.921 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to always have Nikki</v>

1867
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.781
<v Speaker 3>judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1868
01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm always want to feel fearful when</v>
<v Speaker 3>these moments,</v>

1869
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:21.940
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn to plow that</v>
<v Speaker 3>neurological pathway so that it's easier</v>

1870
01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:25.540
<v Speaker 3>for me to stay there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know programming is necessary</v>

1871
01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:28.330
<v Speaker 3>and like if you're not living on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>program that you've taken control of</v>

1872
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:30.340
<v Speaker 3>individually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living on someone else's program,</v>

1873
01:23:30.341 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 3>you're living on that program that's out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1874
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:36.760
<v Speaker 3>that constant bombardment of negativity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fear and anxiety and division and</v>

1875
01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:39.940
<v Speaker 3>you're different from paypal and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not good enough and by this otherwise</v>

1876
01:23:39.941 --> 01:23:41.170
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be good enough.</v>

1877
01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:44.560
<v Speaker 3>You know that you're going to need</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty strong defenses.</v>

1878
01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why with the diminished</v>
<v Speaker 3>role of religion in our life with the</v>

1879
01:23:48.851 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 3>diminished role of sort of political</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies that we can trust.</v>

1880
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:57.280
<v Speaker 3>What are people supposed to do about</v>
<v Speaker 3>being alive and not feeling good or who</v>

1881
01:23:57.281 --> 01:23:58.360
<v Speaker 3>do you go to now</v>

1882
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 2>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you were part of it.</v>

1883
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing it too.</v>

1884
01:24:02.651 --> 01:24:05.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying to reexamine the</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns that you're stuck in and how</v>

1885
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:08.440
<v Speaker 2>many of these patterns that you or I or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim or anybody here,</v>

1886
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.100
<v Speaker 2>it's created for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've created a lot of your own prison</v>

1887
01:24:12.101 --> 01:24:14.950
<v Speaker 2>bars and that's a really common thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people.</v>

1888
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these whatever defenses that you've put</v>

1889
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:20.500
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the patterns that you've</v>

1890
01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:24.760
<v Speaker 2>instinctively followed because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jealousy or fear of inadequacy or any</v>

1891
01:24:24.761 --> 01:24:27.650
<v Speaker 2>weird feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've set these neurological patterns</v>

1892
01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:29.860
<v Speaker 2>and they're very difficult to break once</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've set them yourself.</v>

1893
01:24:29.861 --> 01:24:33.310
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you've built your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison and now you're complaining about</v>

1894
01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:33.710
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1895
01:24:33.710 --> 01:24:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with this.</v>

1896
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Now that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think we could introduce to that,</v>

1897
01:24:37.811 --> 01:24:39.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a compassion because,</v>

1898
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're earlier on,</v>

1899
01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.410
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about like we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand people who sort of jealousy</v>

1900
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.330
<v Speaker 3>or irritation like people being famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>or rich because I,</v>

1901
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.950
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt there's too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>

1902
01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.010
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much injustice.</v>

1903
01:24:49.011 --> 01:24:50.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that can really be</v>
<v Speaker 3>questioned.</v>

1904
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:53.960
<v Speaker 3>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to do is bring bloody</v>

1905
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.820
<v Speaker 3>compassion and tolerance to places where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it odd today someone was like,</v>

1906
01:24:58.821 --> 01:25:00.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you I didn't bring no club.</v>

1907
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I left my suitcase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up,</v>

1908
01:25:02.301 --> 01:25:03.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's going in the shop and this is</v>

1909
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.320
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem of great privilege.</v>

1910
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I went along to a pretty cool shop in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles and their security fellow at</v>

1911
01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.820
<v Speaker 3>goes shopping open yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he recognized me and he goes,</v>

1912
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:14.930
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1913
01:25:14.931 --> 01:25:16.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their shop is open.</v>

1914
01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:16.661
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>

1915
01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:17.210
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1916
01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:19.250
<v Speaker 3>thank you mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt all special for a moment.</v>

1917
01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Then we got to the doorway to shop and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy that was inside the shop,</v>

1918
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.040
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1919
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.680
<v Speaker 3>he's having a bad day or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1920
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.281
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1921
01:25:25.281 --> 01:25:26.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can't come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1922
01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.730
<v Speaker 3>And I made it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking like the reaction.</v>

1923
01:25:28.731 --> 01:25:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I feel like rage actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the security guy to his eternal</v>

1924
01:25:33.111 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 3>credit overrode the guy in the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1925
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:36.690
<v Speaker 3>And just let him in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let him in,</v>

1926
01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:39.470
<v Speaker 3>in Laos got in the shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt sort of like I felt better</v>

1927
01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.170
<v Speaker 3>about myself in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1928
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm so special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm allowed.</v>

1929
01:25:43.251 --> 01:25:47.450
<v Speaker 3>It had so many little things sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>triggered in me in that sort of short</v>

1930
01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.700
<v Speaker 3>momentary interaction and feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1931
01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:51.440
<v Speaker 3>oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The security guy recognizes me.</v>

1932
01:25:51.441 --> 01:25:52.131
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1933
01:25:52.131 --> 01:25:53.780
<v Speaker 3>they let me in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very hard for me actually.</v>

1934
01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:56.790
<v Speaker 3>It says I'm still in my mind judging</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy that they wouldn't let me in</v>

1935
01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:00.680
<v Speaker 3>and around in my consciousness fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>pumps.</v>

1936
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 3>You still have an argument in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should say</v>

1937
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.190
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have destroyed him.</v>

1938
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.160
<v Speaker 1>That guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>told the perfect thing like a silver</v>

1939
01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:15.710
<v Speaker 1>bullet and then you get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1940
01:26:15.711 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sorry if I was rude earlier,</v>

1941
01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1942
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:21.840
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend broke up with the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1943
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And then you will go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support guys working retail girlfriends.</v>

1944
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Fucking some football player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor bastard,</v>

1945
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your mom is too?</v>

1946
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to club and you're so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking rude.</v>

1947
01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I thought in my mad success I'd reached</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where I can walk to a place</v>

1948
01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 1>in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed in here and I turn</v>

1949
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:47.110
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going fucking,</v>

1950
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy this fucking place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to fire.</v>

1951
01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.350
<v Speaker 1>That's how fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Tom Cruise does.</v>

1952
01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.120
<v Speaker 1>So Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new</v>

1953
01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>place said a lot of admin just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize net.</v>

1954
01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.560
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1955
01:27:03.561 --> 01:27:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The surveyors are coming on Monday</v>

1956
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:06.650
<v Speaker 1>gauge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1957
01:27:06.651 --> 01:27:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 people coming to check right now.</v>

1958
01:27:11.121 --> 01:27:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Could you bring a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly we can't bring in Dave because</v>

1959
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>he's a chemotherapy session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we might have some weird laws or who</v>

1960
01:27:16.981 --> 01:27:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you could fire and not foreign.</v>

1961
01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Imagine now you buy the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fuck has to keep working for you.</v>

1962
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're stuck with him and then he</v>

1963
01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:33.830
<v Speaker 1>sues you for discrimination or</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment or something like that.</v>

1964
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Dave was missing a tone when I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sack him.</v>

1965
01:27:36.771 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 1>That was a misstep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't mistake in retrospect.</v>

1966
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So did anybody from the Tom Cruise camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to convert?</v>

1967
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:44.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one might even the remote is the effort</v>

1968
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:49.120
<v Speaker 1>to convert me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have made it more clear that</v>

1969
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:54.130
<v Speaker 1>was desperately in need of an ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets funded.</v>

1970
01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>It was something to believe in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1971
01:27:57.661 --> 01:28:01.860
<v Speaker 1>so just for Fuck Sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me that dialectics book,</v>

1972
01:28:01.861 --> 01:28:03.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1973
01:28:03.051 --> 01:28:04.180
<v Speaker 1>there should be a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1974
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I was not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Joe,</v>

1975
01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they felt that I would ruin so</v>

1976
01:28:08.151 --> 01:28:09.530
<v Speaker 1>until the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they did.</v>

1977
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.450
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>

1978
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:15.640
<v Speaker 1>There was no invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one said,</v>

1979
01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:17.690
<v Speaker 1>come on mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a biff l,</v>

1980
01:28:17.691 --> 01:28:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Ron Hubbard in your life.</v>

1981
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no interest.</v>

1982
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:21.820
<v Speaker 1>They might have been an expansionist</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

1983
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:25.170
<v Speaker 1>No one up at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if ever there was a candidate for a</v>

1984
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:27.590
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they tread very carefully on</v>

1985
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 1>those waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to start asking questions</v>

1986
01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:34.130
<v Speaker 1>yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's certain levels.</v>

1987
01:28:34.131 --> 01:28:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps this is also possibly where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily really want anybody</v>

1988
01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1989
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't qualify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to that fucking slippery</v>

1990
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:44.280
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kick the bloody door and</v>

1991
01:28:44.290 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1992
01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I think type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother had been burned too many times</v>

1993
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very careful about who they</v>

1994
01:28:51.231 --> 01:28:52.570
<v Speaker 1>allow in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they don't allow,</v>

1995
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:55.310
<v Speaker 1>and I would imagine that pillorying of</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

1996
01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm always feel sorry for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1997
01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.030
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying their hardest to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make up a religion.</v>

1998
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:01.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1999
01:29:01.591 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I just see going clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2000
01:29:03.181 --> 01:29:05.040
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll stop feeling sorry for him.</v>

2001
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.360
<v Speaker 1>When you watch going clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

2002
01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:10.160
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that Guy Paul Haggis who went</v>

2003
01:29:10.161 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 1>like when they showed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2004
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:14.460
<v Speaker 1>This is your scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2005
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.730
<v Speaker 1>he looked around for the outcome and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the test right to people.</v>

2006
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.180
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

2007
01:29:19.181 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking market.</v>

2008
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:22.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You immediate get out.</v>

2009
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a madman.</v>

2010
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean l Ron Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he's correct about</v>

2011
01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:30.240
<v Speaker 1>scientology wrote more fiction than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that's ever lived.</v>

2012
01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Even if that was his only qualification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just making stuff and making</v>

2013
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:37.590
<v Speaker 1>stuff up and then he wrote this and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>red flags.</v>

2014
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one goes,</v>

2015
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe made this up to no fucking chance.</v>

2016
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:46.110
<v Speaker 1>On Monday is in Guinness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>World Records for making shit up on</v>

2017
01:29:46.111 --> 01:29:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Tuesdays he starts to religion and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one goes,</v>

2018
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:50.550
<v Speaker 1>is this connected to Monday's activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way?</v>

2019
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a chronic liar.</v>

2020
01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Just his whole life was just full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2021
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't like.</v>

2022
01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>He's rubbery wet lips like Ronald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald mouth.</v>

2023
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It was a little bit of a global sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of wet slobbery guy on those</v>

2024
01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:06.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking cruise ships dressing people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2025
01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan of dudes with captains</v>
<v Speaker 1>outfits on him and</v>

2026
01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:15.660
<v Speaker 1>what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in the navy and he did command</v>

2027
01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:18.010
<v Speaker 1>ships apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was apparently a pretty good at</v>

2028
01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was removed from his duty.</v>

2029
01:30:20.311 --> 01:30:23.520
<v Speaker 1>But the point is after he got out</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided I'm still rocking this captain's</v>

2030
01:30:23.521 --> 01:30:25.620
<v Speaker 1>outfit go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2031
01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:30.120
<v Speaker 1>They will believe anything's how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossed me.</v>

2032
01:30:30.210 --> 01:30:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I got a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make some shit up and I'll</v>

2033
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:38.541
<v Speaker 1>have them for quite a and make a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>business of watch me areas.</v>

2034
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I skipper madman,</v>

2035
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.750
<v Speaker 1>look it at fascinating and the liquid</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the mouth,</v>

2036
01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I suppose people that are scientologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>was say,</v>

2037
01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:50.210
<v Speaker 1>this is our religion and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking the piss out of our</v>

2038
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:50.690
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

2039
01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:55.550
<v Speaker 2>It's an ideology that is also a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive one in the sense that it's</v>

2040
01:30:55.551 --> 01:30:59.570
<v Speaker 2>dedicated towards self improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And eliminating all these psychological</v>

2041
01:30:59.571 --> 01:31:03.410
<v Speaker 2>barriers that are holding you back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way people find a lot of benefit</v>

2042
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:06.650
<v Speaker 2>in being a part of that religion and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think when they find a lot of benefit</v>

2043
01:31:06.651 --> 01:31:09.770
<v Speaker 2>and being a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know they can justify all the</v>

2044
01:31:09.771 --> 01:31:12.980
<v Speaker 2>other nonsense and just sort of ignore</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because what l Ron Hubbard,</v>

2045
01:31:12.981 --> 01:31:17.720
<v Speaker 2>according to the going clear book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Krauss Book was trying to do</v>

2046
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.540
<v Speaker 2>with self medicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would he?</v>

2047
01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:23.120
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot of psychological issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself and he was trying to cure his</v>

2048
01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:28.121
<v Speaker 2>own issues and in using these methods to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure his own religion or the zone,</v>

2049
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:32.300
<v Speaker 2>his own issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he translated them into a religion.</v>

2050
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Like this was a big part of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology initially was,</v>

2051
01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.850
<v Speaker 2>was his own attempts to self diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 2>and treat his own psychological</v>

2052
01:31:40.851 --> 01:31:41.440
<v Speaker 2>ailments.</v>

2053
01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Quite a good idea really works really</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2054
01:31:45.731 --> 01:31:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And there are so I suppose people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's working for all right.</v>

2055
01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Like a quote I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be quick to see where</v>

2056
01:31:53.171 --> 01:31:54.550
<v Speaker 1>religious people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2057
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:56.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all really August where religious</v>

2058
01:31:56.471 --> 01:31:59.440
<v Speaker 1>people are wrong because we sort of hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it on news,</v>

2059
01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:00.020
<v Speaker 1>but like</v>

2060
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:01.600
<v Speaker 3>w we're religious people are right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2061
01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:04.960
<v Speaker 3>sort of togetherness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selfless nurse relationship with a</v>

2062
01:32:04.961 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 3>deeper self acceptance of death and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of transcendence of the</v>

2063
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 3>human primal self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things are all really beautiful</v>

2064
01:32:12.641 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 3>ideas that they've kind of lost their</v>
<v Speaker 3>way in a science,</v>

2065
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:16.580
<v Speaker 3>a science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2066
01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 3>that term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientism,</v>

2067
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:20.620
<v Speaker 3>the idea that sort of science has got</v>
<v Speaker 3>into territories that science can really</v>

2068
01:32:20.621 --> 01:32:23.530
<v Speaker 3>handle because we come to a judging full</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop at certain points.</v>

2069
01:32:23.531 --> 01:32:25.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what happened on the Tuesday before</v>

2070
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:26.830
<v Speaker 3>the Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2071
01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:30.920
<v Speaker 2>serialism</v>
<v Speaker 2>materialism,</v>

2072
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.330
<v Speaker 2>individualism</v>

2073
01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.690
<v Speaker 3>are hard things to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If like,</v>

2074
01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.491
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people,</v>

2075
01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:38.800
<v Speaker 3>if we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we have as our dominant mindset,</v>

2076
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm only gonna believe shit that I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>prove.</v>

2077
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Then you are just an individual and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>may as well just.</v>

2078
01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Why not just spend your life fuck as</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people as you can and accumulating</v>

2079
01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 3>as much material as you can because</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing exists.</v>

2080
01:32:51.551 --> 01:32:52.840
<v Speaker 3>Unless you can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure it,</v>

2081
01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:54.760
<v Speaker 3>why it contain it and fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2082
01:32:54.761 --> 01:32:58.660
<v Speaker 3>if that is the dominant belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was sort of materialism,</v>

2083
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 3>consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism,</v>

2084
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I think all dovetail on that premise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all real.</v>

2085
01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.580
<v Speaker 3>That's how you can have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chronic ecological disrespect is</v>

2086
01:33:09.581 --> 01:33:12.820
<v Speaker 3>because it really doesn't matter what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens after you're dead.</v>

2087
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:13.391
<v Speaker 3>There you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2088
01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:16.780
<v Speaker 3>what about my fucking children?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even just not a practical level of</v>

2089
01:33:16.781 --> 01:33:19.930
<v Speaker 3>called live on this fucking pebble in</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite space.</v>

2090
01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.490
<v Speaker 3>But if you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2091
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.790
<v Speaker 3>not really thought about that in a sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an inability to accept,</v>

2092
01:33:24.791 --> 01:33:26.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like certain.</v>

2093
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I know that you're sort of like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wholesale by any dominant theory,</v>

2094
01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:34.450
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's clear to me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>

2095
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in on an individual level and</v>

2096
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:37.600
<v Speaker 3>on a cultural level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something is possible,</v>

2097
01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:40.090
<v Speaker 3>you should be trying to fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as people realize,</v>

2098
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.520
<v Speaker 3>hold on a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's having a negative impact,</v>

2099
01:33:42.521 --> 01:33:44.560
<v Speaker 3>or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a better way of using our</v>

2100
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now utilities,</v>

2101
01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:48.670
<v Speaker 3>soon as you realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be moving towards it.</v>

2102
01:33:48.671 --> 01:33:51.610
<v Speaker 3>They say wisdom is acting on knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you recognize,</v>

2103
01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:53.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuels are running out so right</v>

2104
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:55.840
<v Speaker 3>fucking hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd better start working on the basis</v>

2105
01:33:55.841 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We better start looking at alternative</v>

2106
01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:00.670
<v Speaker 3>energy sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at different alliances</v>

2107
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 3>like knowing those things and not doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2108
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.120
<v Speaker 3>It makes me very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very uneasy because it makes me think</v>

2109
01:34:07.121 --> 01:34:11.770
<v Speaker 3>who benefits from ignoring this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's running this show?</v>

2110
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 3>If he's having all of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's creating all this rage,</v>

2111
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.290
<v Speaker 3>all this unease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this fear in your country and in my</v>

2112
01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:22.170
<v Speaker 3>country now times of great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great disease and uncertainty for people</v>

2113
01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:27.180
<v Speaker 3>really looking for something and know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these institutions are just saying,</v>

2114
01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:30.520
<v Speaker 3>just united carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no sort of alternative.</v>

2115
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to let you know is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see himself as part of a religious</v>

2116
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:37.450
<v Speaker 3>community in the same way or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the dead ideologies of the last</v>

2117
01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:41.830
<v Speaker 3>century and meanwhile we're in this sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of peculiar style of looming crisis.</v>

2118
01:34:41.850 --> 01:34:43.810
<v Speaker 3>It feels kind of fucking mad</v>

2119
01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:47.130
<v Speaker 2>in a state of looming crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to unpack this whole thing,</v>

2120
01:34:47.131 --> 01:34:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you started off with this idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang</v>

2121
01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.080
<v Speaker 2>and how science can't really answer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2122
01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.880
<v Speaker 2>they can't answer it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the problem is once they gather</v>

2123
01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.480
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be 100 years now or a thousand</v>

2124
01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can say,</v>

2125
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here we've done the calculations</v>

2126
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 2>and we understand now that it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite cycle of birth and death and</v>

2127
01:35:05.931 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 2>the universe is constantly expanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>contracting and this is the process that</v>

2128
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:12.020
<v Speaker 2>we're a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's infinite and it's never started.</v>

2129
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:14.480
<v Speaker 2>It is never ending and it goes on and on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on.</v>

2130
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll probably bloody right</v>
<v Speaker 3>mate.</v>

2131
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I like that idea that you just espoused</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in 5,000 year old fucking document</v>

2132
01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.830
<v Speaker 3>called the upanishads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those ideas,</v>

2133
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:28.000
<v Speaker 3>those ideas are there already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we fucked off religion a hundred</v>

2134
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.020
<v Speaker 3>years ago because it was causing too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

2135
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.480
<v Speaker 3>you know our sake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got.</v>

2136
01:35:31.481 --> 01:35:34.470
<v Speaker 3>We kicked out of some of the ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are only now just being</v>

2137
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.271
<v Speaker 2>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2138
01:35:35.271 --> 01:35:37.970
<v Speaker 2>But those ideas are just to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplated right now and to be</v>

2139
01:35:37.971 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 2>considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas science is trying to find</v>

2140
01:35:40.341 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 2>definitive evidence that they do or</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't represent the reality of our</v>

2141
01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:46.010
<v Speaker 2>timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once they do,</v>

2142
01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:48.710
<v Speaker 2>then there'll be able to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now what they're doing is</v>

2143
01:35:48.711 --> 01:35:51.800
<v Speaker 2>they're examining the evidence that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big bang exists and what could have</v>

2144
01:35:51.801 --> 01:35:53.270
<v Speaker 2>possibly caused that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:35:53.271 --> 01:35:54.070
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2146
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 3>See what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where what,</v>

2147
01:35:55.150 --> 01:36:00.150
<v Speaker 3>what my difficulty is is that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is when any ideology behaves</v>

2148
01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.920
<v Speaker 3>dogmatically and prohibitively prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent further exploration,</v>

2149
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.240
<v Speaker 3>like whatever that would like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of.</v>

2150
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:12.730
<v Speaker 3>What's an example of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nature of consciousness.</v>

2151
01:36:12.731 --> 01:36:17.660
<v Speaker 3>No one knows why consciousness impact</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter in the way it does in the sub</v>

2152
01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:19.470
<v Speaker 3>quantum world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can't fucking.</v>

2153
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:21.370
<v Speaker 3>We've come to a point where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

2154
01:36:21.371 --> 01:36:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you were like that,</v>

2155
01:36:22.691 --> 01:36:25.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the famous double Slit Theory and</v>

2156
01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 3>observed particle behaves differently</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the end of the park.</v>

2157
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:31.390
<v Speaker 3>One way you can change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the central nature depending on</v>

2158
01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:32.530
<v Speaker 3>where he's been obsessed</v>

2159
01:36:32.730 --> 01:36:36.060
<v Speaker 2>presented though when it's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to me by people actually</v>

2160
01:36:36.061 --> 01:36:38.700
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it really is is that we're</v>

2161
01:36:38.701 --> 01:36:41.850
<v Speaker 2>measuring these particles and in the act</v>
<v Speaker 2>of measuring,</v>

2162
01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you're changing the results because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using something to measure it.</v>

2163
01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2164
01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:51.840
<v Speaker 2>but it gets represented as all this woo</v>
<v Speaker 2>woo craziness,</v>

2165
01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.720
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think is interesting,</v>

2166
01:36:54.721 --> 01:36:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is somewhere between this woo craziness</v>

2167
01:36:57.870 --> 01:37:01.170
<v Speaker 3>and they're kind of a flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mundane,</v>

2168
01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:02.490
<v Speaker 3>low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is life.</v>

2169
01:37:02.491 --> 01:37:03.420
<v Speaker 3>You're born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you die,</v>

2170
01:37:03.421 --> 01:37:05.790
<v Speaker 3>you eat food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit comes out your ass old territory,</v>

2171
01:37:05.791 --> 01:37:10.791
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in there is a mystery that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're behind your eyes buying Jimbo,</v>

2172
01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's eyes and my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a constant.</v>

2173
01:37:14.341 --> 01:37:16.410
<v Speaker 3>There is this consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is this awareness.</v>

2174
01:37:16.411 --> 01:37:20.670
<v Speaker 3>There's this inexplicably experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've add on dmt experiences that</v>

2175
01:37:20.671 --> 01:37:25.671
<v Speaker 3>I've had through yoga and through lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That suggests to me that consciousness</v>

2176
01:37:26.041 --> 01:37:30.030
<v Speaker 3>itself is the dominant force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness is not just one more</v>

2177
01:37:30.031 --> 01:37:33.480
<v Speaker 3>phenomena is the seat of all phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when people are saying,</v>

2178
01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:34.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing,</v>

2179
01:37:34.351 --> 01:37:36.600
<v Speaker 3>that's God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they are saying is there is an</v>

2180
01:37:36.630 --> 01:37:40.800
<v Speaker 3>absolute consciousness and all is</v>
<v Speaker 3>contained within it all matter at some</v>

2181
01:37:40.801 --> 01:37:43.620
<v Speaker 3>point has come from consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These realms,</v>

2182
01:37:43.621 --> 01:37:46.920
<v Speaker 3>they're experienced true psychedelic or</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme extreme,</v>

2183
01:37:46.921 --> 01:37:48.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal experiments like if cryogenic</v>

2184
01:37:48.691 --> 01:37:53.590
<v Speaker 3>things or your flotation tanks all</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest a phenomenon beyond the</v>

2185
01:37:53.591 --> 01:37:54.870
<v Speaker 3>individual consciousness.</v>

2186
01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:59.130
<v Speaker 3>They something else say and the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that you know that it's in for the</v>

2187
01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even by the process of measuring,</v>

2188
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.890
<v Speaker 3>even by the process of measuring is</v>
<v Speaker 3>influencing and impacting rally.</v>

2189
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:05.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2190
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking that to the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

2191
01:38:07.551 --> 01:38:08.311
<v Speaker 3>Make some people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2192
01:38:08.311 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 3>that means your mind can control shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I think it means that,</v>

2193
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:15.720
<v Speaker 3>it means that reality is only reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at it,</v>

2194
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:18.550
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's kind of getting towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bloody good book.</v>

2195
01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:22.650
<v Speaker 3>I reckon your listeners will be banging</v>
<v Speaker 3>into his Kumbaya centuries in by a man</v>

2196
01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:27.480
<v Speaker 3>called Robert Lanza who he did the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>breakdown I've ever read of that double</v>

2197
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 3>slit experiment and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have the,</v>

2198
01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.301
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2199
01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:30.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2200
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>made me understand for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reality is happening within your</v>

2201
01:38:34.471 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 3>own consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an external phenomena at all</v>

2202
01:38:37.351 --> 01:38:39.630
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he explained it very wisely.</v>

2203
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.480
<v Speaker 3>I could understand of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went,</v>

2204
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:44.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sort of think I'm totally mundane.</v>

2205
01:38:44.341 --> 01:38:46.440
<v Speaker 3>He went like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the experience of going in your</v>

2206
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:48.120
<v Speaker 3>kitchen in the nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning the light on.</v>

2207
01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Is your kitchen fridge still there when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back downstairs?</v>

2208
01:38:51.001 --> 01:38:53.520
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I guess when you do go into your</v>

2209
01:38:53.521 --> 01:38:56.160
<v Speaker 3>kitchen and turn the light on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes to your Foa on parcels of</v>

2210
01:38:56.161 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 3>photons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come down,</v>

2211
01:38:57.151 --> 01:38:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I'd interact with the optic nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a trans law.</v>

2212
01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.140
<v Speaker 3>They invert it in your consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

2213
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:04.350
<v Speaker 3>so whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's in your kitchen when you're not</v>

2214
01:39:04.351 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 3>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ain't the same as when you are</v>

2215
01:39:06.931 --> 01:39:10.590
<v Speaker 3>looking at is an interpretive reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways that I've sort of</v>

2216
01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 3>reduced this down for my own simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding is this,</v>

2217
01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:16.080
<v Speaker 3>that if none of us had a sense of smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't,</v>

2218
01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 3>I'd been Jamie didn't.</v>

2219
01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:20.010
<v Speaker 3>And then how would the concept of smell</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense?</v>

2220
01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:22.590
<v Speaker 3>How would you go out with a pint and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bike and with none of us would have</v>

2221
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:25.710
<v Speaker 3>the instrument to receive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that whole thing will be off the</v>

2222
01:39:25.711 --> 01:39:29.010
<v Speaker 3>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that there are streams of</v>

2223
01:39:29.011 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 3>energy streams of data for which we do</v>
<v Speaker 3>not have the instruments to receive,</v>

2224
01:39:32.581 --> 01:39:36.180
<v Speaker 3>so we totally discount it because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>simply don't have the instruments to</v>

2225
01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:38.570
<v Speaker 3>receive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said once in my standup,</v>

2226
01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:41.460
<v Speaker 3>as a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my cat doesn't know there's an</v>

2227
01:39:41.461 --> 01:39:44.370
<v Speaker 3>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the internet does not enter the realm of</v>

2228
01:39:44.371 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 3>my cats consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fucking internet is out there.</v>

2229
01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.880
<v Speaker 3>We're out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having with these fucking experiences</v>

2230
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 3>and like all those realms that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing in these various sort of</v>

2231
01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:55.470
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic states or however they</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieved is an indication to me there's</v>

2232
01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:56.304
<v Speaker 3>another reality now.</v>

2233
01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Where does that become fucking relevant</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what we're talking about?</v>

2234
01:39:58.861 --> 01:39:59.760
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it does,</v>

2235
01:39:59.761 --> 01:40:04.410
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the continual ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps reemerging to connect us back to</v>

2236
01:40:04.411 --> 01:40:07.950
<v Speaker 3>where we were with Joe Campbell at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning is there is this fucking sense</v>

2237
01:40:07.951 --> 01:40:11.850
<v Speaker 3>of oneness and believing ourselves to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual and believing that the</v>

2238
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.220
<v Speaker 3>dominant thing in our lives to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>material that fucks us up because people</v>

2239
01:40:16.221 --> 01:40:20.760
<v Speaker 3>will kill each other over that material</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once we realized no with the true</v>

2240
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 3>thing about us is the consciousness is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inner self.</v>

2241
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:25.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the roofing they we're all out</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2242
01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:27.000
<v Speaker 3>We're all in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do shit and we're all</v>

2243
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:30.570
<v Speaker 3>gonna make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not have the material idea as</v>

2244
01:40:30.571 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 3>the dominant social idea because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's agreed with that.</v>

2245
01:40:34.201 --> 01:40:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Whether they're communist or capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fascist,</v>

2246
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:39.300
<v Speaker 3>wherever everyone's saying now the main</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is they ship this out here and</v>

2247
01:40:39.301 --> 01:40:42.320
<v Speaker 3>it's like that connects to those primal</v>
<v Speaker 3>drives because we know that if that's</v>

2248
01:40:42.321 --> 01:40:44.640
<v Speaker 3>happening to your sexual drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can never have enough pussy.</v>

2249
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.640
<v Speaker 3>If that gets into your state test drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can never have enough status and</v>

2250
01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:48.510
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2251
01:40:48.511 --> 01:40:50.580
<v Speaker 3>so like we're all going to still feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

2252
01:40:50.581 --> 01:40:52.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm still going to be a camp 25 times a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2253
01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.660
<v Speaker 3>but it'd be nice if the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>ambiance was,</v>

2254
01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:56.421
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who,</v>

2255
01:40:56.421 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be back to your normal self in a</v>

2256
01:40:58.601 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 3>minute of feeling that we're all one and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all connected.</v>

2257
01:41:01.631 --> 01:41:02.201
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2258
01:41:02.201 --> 01:41:04.100
<v Speaker 3>well of course I'd feel right that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2259
01:41:04.101 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what frightens me about the</v>

2260
01:41:06.251 --> 01:41:10.750
<v Speaker 3>culture of our countries at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's endorsing the worst aspects of</v>

2261
01:41:10.751 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 3>our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's acculturating the worst aspects of</v>

2262
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 3>our nature instead of the best aspects</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our nature and that for me then I'm</v>

2263
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking difference between left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the current political sphere</v>

2264
01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 3>because they're all making the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

2265
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:24.580
<v Speaker 3>They're all saying come and live out</v>
<v Speaker 3>here in the material world.</v>

2266
01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the material world</v>

2267
01:41:27.841 --> 01:41:32.160
<v Speaker 2>and this idea that we should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulating possessions and status and</v>

2268
01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:35.790
<v Speaker 2>all these different things is universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like it's a natural</v>

2269
01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:40.791
<v Speaker 2>progression from ancient tribal</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization life to this weird city</v>

2270
01:41:40.891 --> 01:41:43.680
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this integration of electronics and</v>

2271
01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:47.190
<v Speaker 2>our life in this symbiotic relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have two computers and the</v>

2272
01:41:47.191 --> 01:41:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Internet and information itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like this is one of the things</v>

2273
01:41:51.031 --> 01:41:53.220
<v Speaker 2>that drives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is this desire for material</v>

2274
01:41:53.221 --> 01:41:55.440
<v Speaker 2>possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you have a desire for</v>

2275
01:41:55.441 --> 01:41:58.650
<v Speaker 2>material possessions and ensures that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to continue to innovate and</v>

2276
01:41:58.651 --> 01:42:01.200
<v Speaker 2>come up with newer and greater and</v>
<v Speaker 2>better because you always want to keep</v>

2277
01:42:01.201 --> 01:42:03.300
<v Speaker 2>up with the Joneses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always want to have the newest tesla</v>

2278
01:42:03.301 --> 01:42:06.480
<v Speaker 2>because it goes zero to 60 in two</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and you want to have the coolest</v>

2279
01:42:06.481 --> 01:42:09.240
<v Speaker 2>fucking house with the biggest TV and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fastest internet and all those</v>

2280
01:42:09.241 --> 01:42:13.560
<v Speaker 2>things sort of compound this</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation cycle that</v>

2281
01:42:13.561 --> 01:42:14.250
<v Speaker 2>we're on.</v>

2282
01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:18.480
<v Speaker 2>So my thought has been for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we are is some sort of</v>

2283
01:42:18.481 --> 01:42:22.800
<v Speaker 2>electronic caterpillar that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give birth some artificial life and that</v>

2284
01:42:22.801 --> 01:42:25.980
<v Speaker 2>all of our desire for material</v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions and status and all these</v>

2285
01:42:25.981 --> 01:42:30.981
<v Speaker 2>different things is really just us</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing forth this electronic agenda and</v>

2286
01:42:31.381 --> 01:42:35.910
<v Speaker 2>that this innovation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction of artificial intelligence</v>

2287
01:42:35.911 --> 01:42:39.570
<v Speaker 2>that's inevitable is eventually going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the next stage of life and that weird</v>

2288
01:42:39.571 --> 01:42:44.571
<v Speaker 2>like huddling ourselves up in this sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of civilization cocoon and that boom out</v>

2289
01:42:44.911 --> 01:42:48.450
<v Speaker 2>of that cocoon is gonna pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of a god being and that this</v>

2290
01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:51.110
<v Speaker 2>is what we're here for and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been doing since we're monkeys</v>

2291
01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:54.300
<v Speaker 2>flinging shit at each other and flipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>over cow patties,</v>

2292
01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:57.870
<v Speaker 2>looking for mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we are a part of a process.</v>

2293
01:42:57.990 --> 01:43:02.520
<v Speaker 2>And then if you look at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these traps that you or I or Tom</v>

2294
01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Cruise or Jim breuer been caught up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>when whether it's traps of Eagle or</v>

2295
01:43:05.761 --> 01:43:06.330
<v Speaker 2>jealousy.</v>

2296
01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:08.460
<v Speaker 2>All these things sort of ensure</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

2297
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:11.430
<v Speaker 2>They insure movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure interactivity,</v>

2298
01:43:11.431 --> 01:43:15.330
<v Speaker 2>and that is going to ensure innovation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and progress and competition.</v>

2299
01:43:15.570 --> 01:43:17.460
<v Speaker 2>And all those things that even we look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>

2300
01:43:17.461 --> 01:43:18.540
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so pointless,</v>

2301
01:43:18.541 --> 01:43:22.350
<v Speaker 2>this is so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So but yet it's so incredibly prevalent.</v>

2302
01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Not Glorifying it or saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely the way to go,</v>

2303
01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:27.750
<v Speaker 2>but objective Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you weren't a human and you're</v>

2304
01:43:27.751 --> 01:43:29.910
<v Speaker 2>stepping outside of this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it from a distance,</v>

2305
01:43:29.911 --> 01:43:32.670
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fuckers are making something they</v>

2306
01:43:32.671 --> 01:43:34.260
<v Speaker 2>might not even know they're making</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2307
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 2>but they're making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand</v>

2308
01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.520
<v Speaker 3>that the same way that bees or ants may</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be aware of their hive</v>

2309
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:41.230
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and the and the common</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive.</v>

2310
01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 3>But where I disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2311
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:49.220
<v Speaker 3>is that you see the end point as being</v>
<v Speaker 3>the materialization of a super</v>

2312
01:43:49.221 --> 01:43:54.221
<v Speaker 3>consciousness through technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the end point is being a</v>

2313
01:43:54.351 --> 01:43:58.360
<v Speaker 3>realization amongst us as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I know that they're both could be</v>

2314
01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:00.430
<v Speaker 3>both and there is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a reason to,</v>

2315
01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all just another fucking,</v>

2316
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:03.980
<v Speaker 3>oh we just another species on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

2317
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will know better than dogs and cows</v>

2318
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:06.580
<v Speaker 3>and monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2319
01:44:06.581 --> 01:44:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2320
01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:07.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2321
01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:11.430
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the sun that heats us up as a</v>

2322
01:44:11.431 --> 01:44:13.710
<v Speaker 2>lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are their inventions as well?</v>

2323
01:44:13.711 --> 01:44:17.190
<v Speaker 2>The cats and the monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's I'm fucking invented being cute.</v>

2324
01:44:17.191 --> 01:44:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're so real dollar in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>lap.</v>

2325
01:44:19.831 --> 01:44:21.340
<v Speaker 2>You pet them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like it.</v>

2326
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:24.090
<v Speaker 2>They need to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're contributing.</v>

2327
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Take the dog for a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come up with ideas.</v>

2328
01:44:26.490 --> 01:44:29.930
<v Speaker 2>You're not spelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do love my dog,</v>

2329
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:33.720
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my.</v>

2330
01:44:33.721 --> 01:44:35.390
<v Speaker 3>What was my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was my point in that?</v>

2331
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you want to pump the brakes.</v>

2332
01:44:37.890 --> 01:44:39.540
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying is we should pump the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brakes.</v>

2333
01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:42.340
<v Speaker 2>We should pump the brakes of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>possession in this.</v>

2334
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:45.750
<v Speaker 2>This idea that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish these great things by</v>

2335
01:44:45.751 --> 01:44:49.530
<v Speaker 2>accumulating things and status and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all bullshit and it's really about</v>

2336
01:44:49.531 --> 01:44:50.670
<v Speaker 2>consciousness more than anything.</v>

2337
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:51.730
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks,</v>

2338
01:44:51.731 --> 01:44:53.350
<v Speaker 3>I think already said it when he said</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2339
01:44:53.351 --> 01:44:55.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can be explored.</v>

2340
01:44:55.450 --> 01:44:58.520
<v Speaker 3>We can explore space in an hour together</v>
<v Speaker 3>in peace.</v>

2341
01:44:58.690 --> 01:45:02.260
<v Speaker 3>That that idea that if we look to our</v>
<v Speaker 3>common drives,</v>

2342
01:45:02.261 --> 01:45:03.580
<v Speaker 3>it's like ended up at Hancock all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2343
01:45:03.581 --> 01:45:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I've heard him on your show saying like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2344
01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Know what really what's happened is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bias towards a particular aspect of our</v>

2345
01:45:09.641 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 3>own consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem solving brain and let you</v>

2346
01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.850
<v Speaker 3>know that those drives are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those drugs they're trying to get</v>

2347
01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:18.100
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technology is amazing.</v>

2348
01:45:18.101 --> 01:45:19.970
<v Speaker 3>We would like you to at the very fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people in bloody here is,</v>

2349
01:45:19.971 --> 01:45:22.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand any event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking wonderful,</v>

2350
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:27.510
<v Speaker 3>but the dominant idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of profit that dominating idea and</v>

2351
01:45:28.630 --> 01:45:32.500
<v Speaker 3>the profit in itself is not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative but profit at all cost,</v>

2352
01:45:32.501 --> 01:45:35.950
<v Speaker 3>profit at any cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really I'm not saying we should as a</v>

2353
01:45:35.951 --> 01:45:38.590
<v Speaker 3>species fucking slow down and dressing</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell and fucking,</v>

2354
01:45:38.591 --> 01:45:39.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like grab and vegetables.</v>

2355
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.980
<v Speaker 3>It's funny now I want human beings to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>glorious,</v>

2356
01:45:41.981 --> 01:45:44.770
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is that our bias</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards this one particular item,</v>

2357
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:47.350
<v Speaker 3>materialistic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is preventing us from realizing that</v>

2358
01:45:47.351 --> 01:45:50.050
<v Speaker 3>glory because part of our consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been ignored.</v>

2359
01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.460
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you from the time you want to say</v>

2360
01:45:54.461 --> 01:45:55.500
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

2361
01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:56.403
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2362
01:45:56.850 --> 01:46:00.970
<v Speaker 4>I think we all agree on that and I hate</v>
<v Speaker 4>to dumb it.</v>

2363
01:46:00.971 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So dumb it down and I go back to pink</v>

2364
01:46:04.301 --> 01:46:07.690
<v Speaker 4>floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need no education.</v>

2365
01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.730
<v Speaker 4>It all we all aware you don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chance where you check your back is</v>

2366
01:46:12.731 --> 01:46:17.731
<v Speaker 4>against the wall from the time you come</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the womb because you're saturated</v>

2367
01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:22.300
<v Speaker 4>with false images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saturated in our society.</v>

2368
01:46:23.290 --> 01:46:27.880
<v Speaker 4>God is money and success and there is no</v>
<v Speaker 4>soul.</v>

2369
01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:30.760
<v Speaker 4>They're in a too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes people like you and I to go</v>

2370
01:46:30.761 --> 01:46:33.520
<v Speaker 4>there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing doesn't fucking matter</v>

2371
01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.640
<v Speaker 4>because it's so oversaturated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the Kardashians are huge and</v>

2372
01:46:38.981 --> 01:46:43.981
<v Speaker 4>this person's huge and because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost laughable because the more you</v>

2373
01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:47.230
<v Speaker 4>put it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the harder they have to hit them on</v>

2374
01:46:47.231 --> 01:46:48.400
<v Speaker 4>their cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2375
01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 4>here's phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kids</v>

2376
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.460
<v Speaker 2>are going to be on a 24 slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2377
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 2>it's massive overload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the more your brain goes this way,</v>

2378
01:46:57.421 --> 01:47:00.460
<v Speaker 2>the more they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2379
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.090
<v Speaker 2>we're not designed for this amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information coming in and that's for</v>

2380
01:47:03.091 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're not designed to be connected</v>

2381
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:07.110
<v Speaker 2>with 7 billion people all over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2382
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.350
<v Speaker 2>We're not designed to seeing a camera</v>
<v Speaker 2>placed on someone that doesn't have</v>

2383
01:47:10.351 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 2>anything good to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2384
01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2385
01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.780
<v Speaker 2>but they're constantly on camera and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're editing it in a way that you're</v>

2386
01:47:15.781 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 2>short attention span is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to this thing because every 15</v>

2387
01:47:18.571 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>seconds of given you a new camera angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's by design.</v>

2388
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like an interface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to do these reality</v>

2389
01:47:25.051 --> 01:47:28.350
<v Speaker 2>shows where they edit the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like a music video where you're</v>

2390
01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 2>constantly changing the angle so you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly stimulated.</v>

2391
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:37.050
<v Speaker 2>If you just had Kim Kardashians sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the table from her mom and they</v>

2392
01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 2>were just sitting there for like three</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours talking like a podcast,</v>

2393
01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:44.220
<v Speaker 2>you would want a fucking mediator to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from Jupiter and slam right into</v>

2394
01:47:44.221 --> 01:47:49.050
<v Speaker 2>that God damn house and this now stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>this before it spreads.</v>

2395
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:53.010
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you keep them going back and</v>

2396
01:47:53.011 --> 01:47:55.680
<v Speaker 2>forth and then you cut to a single of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them by themselves.</v>

2397
01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Bitching about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom has always been about blah,</v>

2398
01:47:57.421 --> 01:47:57.930
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2399
01:47:57.930 --> 01:47:59.310
<v Speaker 2>and then go back to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2400
01:47:59.311 --> 01:48:02.510
<v Speaker 2>she thinks that she can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what am I shooting was,</v>

2401
01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.271
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

2402
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:08.271
<v Speaker 2>Watch premier cameras and constant</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing of angles and it's constant</v>

2403
01:48:09.061 --> 01:48:12.510
<v Speaker 2>fucking introducing of a new thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to.</v>

2404
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a stupid small note on a tiny,</v>

2405
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:20.790
<v Speaker 2>tiny note of how powerful and how far my</v>
<v Speaker 2>oldest daughter and I,</v>

2406
01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I hate to admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sat there and her lips.</v>

2407
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:26.190
<v Speaker 2>She came in the room and I told it 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

2408
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She saw something on the Internet,</v>

2409
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.680
<v Speaker 2>sticking her lips in the bottle and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows her lips up and for three days and</v>

2410
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:36.570
<v Speaker 2>everyone's doing it and who wasn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was mad at her.</v>

2411
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2412
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:41.700
<v Speaker 2>this is how many my kids part of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>banana land.</v>

2413
01:48:41.701 --> 01:48:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they're laughing at us</v>

2414
01:48:44.161 --> 01:48:45.760
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't make them do.</v>

2415
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:52.580
<v Speaker 2>No one's pulling those strings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're pulling strings.</v>

2416
01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2417
01:48:56.041 --> 01:48:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I see it and that's what I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2418
01:48:57.870 --> 01:49:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Look at that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how many women want them in like</v>

2419
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:03.750
<v Speaker 2>that shot into the Ras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they look like Kim Kardashian.</v>

2420
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:08.010
<v Speaker 2>There's like a whole trend where women</v>
<v Speaker 2>are waist training where they're wearing</v>

2421
01:49:08.011 --> 01:49:11.700
<v Speaker 2>these corsets and tightening down there</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking organs and then they're having</v>

2422
01:49:11.701 --> 01:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>fat shoved into their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're extracting fat from areas of</v>

2423
01:49:15.271 --> 01:49:20.271
<v Speaker 2>their body and then reintroducing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into their ass in order to develop this</v>

2424
01:49:20.701 --> 01:49:24.720
<v Speaker 2>round ridiculous thing that looks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wearing a fucking diaper to be</v>

2425
01:49:24.721 --> 01:49:29.460
<v Speaker 2>relevant in to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to imitate the same way.</v>

2426
01:49:29.461 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Siri women have fucking plates in</v>

2427
01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:34.590
<v Speaker 2>their lips were imitating patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see.</v>

2428
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.480
<v Speaker 2>They don't necessarily have to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

2429
01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 2>but we're this weird animal that's sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of imitates what our surroundings are.</v>

2430
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.010
<v Speaker 2>We imitate our atmosphere and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange way and we can.</v>

2431
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:47.020
<v Speaker 2>We can sort of create our own hell that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2432
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reproduce this thing around us that's</v>

2433
01:49:50.770 --> 01:49:53.410
<v Speaker 2>not just unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so unsatisfying.</v>

2434
01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.160
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's depressing and we do the Goddamn</v>

2435
01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've become too good adaptations of</v>

2436
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:02.580
<v Speaker 2>mutate state and that's what was trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say earlier with the.</v>

2437
01:50:02.590 --> 01:50:05.950
<v Speaker 2>They influences the paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the template that we're moving towards</v>

2438
01:50:05.951 --> 01:50:08.890
<v Speaker 2>these two predicated on the material to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where yeah,</v>

2439
01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>it's ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things I think like you joined the</v>

2440
01:50:10.541 --> 01:50:14.170
<v Speaker 2>comparison between the neck things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing things in the condition that</v>

2441
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:19.330
<v Speaker 2>that power that we're harnessing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to center around innovation when</v>

2442
01:50:20.321 --> 01:50:25.321
<v Speaker 2>we're pursuing material possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're pursuing physical items,</v>

2443
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about like vintage</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like I'm really into handmade</v>

2444
01:50:29.351 --> 01:50:33.370
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love a handmade bag or handmade knife.</v>

2445
01:50:33.371 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that someone created</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2446
01:50:35.591 --> 01:50:38.410
<v Speaker 2>crafted something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those things are the same.</v>

2447
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Like if you buy a knife that some guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>made hammering in a,</v>

2448
01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those vats of fucking fire and</v>

2449
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:46.091
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

2450
01:50:46.091 --> 01:50:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

2451
01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have done it for hundreds if not</v>

2452
01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:52.060
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something fascinating about that</v>

2453
01:50:52.061 --> 01:50:56.050
<v Speaker 2>and interesting about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like progression and</v>

2454
01:50:56.051 --> 01:50:58.240
<v Speaker 2>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can't compete with these</v>

2455
01:50:58.241 --> 01:51:00.580
<v Speaker 2>God damn laptops or phones or any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

2456
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting better and better at</v>

2457
01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:07.540
<v Speaker 2>this staggering exponential rate and at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of that line,</v>

2458
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.860
<v Speaker 2>see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've,</v>

2459
01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.140
<v Speaker 2>if you extrapolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it from a distance,</v>

2460
01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you pull yourself away from culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and look down what is this</v>

2461
01:51:15.610 --> 01:51:17.650
<v Speaker 2>super being called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human race?</v>

2462
01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:21.760
<v Speaker 2>What is the super organism doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which creating better and better things?</v>

2463
01:51:21.970 --> 01:51:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it doing that?</v>

2464
01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Why is it ignoring the very ocean that</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounds it?</v>

2465
01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Why is it sucking all the fish out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean and shitting all the fucking</v>

2466
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 2>dirt and dust up into the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ignoring that while concentrating on</v>

2467
01:51:34.181 --> 01:51:37.840
<v Speaker 2>the possession and the innovation of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these electronic gadgets?</v>

2468
01:51:37.841 --> 01:51:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be something to do with</v>

2469
01:51:39.281 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pole and Mckenna used to</v>

2470
01:51:41.711 --> 01:51:46.711
<v Speaker 2>call it an attractor that we're being</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled towards some future attract or</v>

2471
01:51:46.751 --> 01:51:51.070
<v Speaker 2>some singularity event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some moment that we are creating,</v>

2472
01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 2>whether we're aware of it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that part of all of our ridiculous</v>

2473
01:51:55.241 --> 01:52:00.241
<v Speaker 2>behavior in terms of our ego and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive for success and attention and love</v>

2474
01:52:00.761 --> 01:52:03.400
<v Speaker 2>and affection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these different things is really</v>

2475
01:52:03.401 --> 01:52:07.410
<v Speaker 2>sort of pushing this innovation further</v>
<v Speaker 2>and further and quicker and quicker and</v>

2476
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:10.450
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely interesting idea what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels thinking when you're saying that.</v>

2477
01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:11.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2478
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:16.530
<v Speaker 2>every time that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creativity you'll put where all of</v>

2479
01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:20.290
<v Speaker 2>these things before the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>things exist in this unrealized realm,</v>

2480
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:23.750
<v Speaker 2>will play over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refer to as the realm of ideas that</v>

2481
01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.460
<v Speaker 2>there's an idealized form of all things</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they are realized in the material</v>

2482
01:52:27.461 --> 01:52:29.440
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone designing a knife has to</v>

2483
01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 2>consciously conceive of the knife before</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing it into the material world.</v>

2484
01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:37.780
<v Speaker 2>That there's this constant need to pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this unrealized like whenever I see</v>

2485
01:52:37.781 --> 01:52:39.230
<v Speaker 2>babies now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get him.</v>

2486
01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Where were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your countries?</v>

2487
01:52:42.801 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>That's telling me what it's like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully still am</v>

2488
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:47.600
<v Speaker 1>friendly with David Lynch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film maker,</v>

2489
01:52:47.601 --> 01:52:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and he told me that a friend of his over</v>
<v Speaker 1>were outside their kids' nursery and</v>

2490
01:52:50.721 --> 01:52:53.390
<v Speaker 1>they had a three year old kid in a six</v>
<v Speaker 1>month year old,</v>

2491
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:57.520
<v Speaker 1>can't don't say years after my six month</v>
<v Speaker 1>old kid and they heard the free route</v>

2492
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:59.030
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The six month kid,</v>

2493
01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I need you to tell me about heaven again</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm beginning to forget</v>

2494
01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:08.000
<v Speaker 1>David Lynch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blew my mind.</v>

2495
01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Where is consciousness before I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2496
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:15.030
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jim,</v>

2497
01:53:15.031 --> 01:53:17.220
<v Speaker 2>you can back me up on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a person who has kids,</v>

2498
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.400
<v Speaker 2>one of the most bizarre aspects of child</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising is that when you have them in</v>

2499
01:53:22.651 --> 01:53:25.650
<v Speaker 2>their babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these moments when they're little and</v>

2500
01:53:25.651 --> 01:53:26.401
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

2501
01:53:26.401 --> 01:53:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I will never gonna forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most powerful moment of my</v>

2502
01:53:29.371 --> 01:53:30.870
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.</v>

2503
01:53:30.871 --> 01:53:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Being around them when they're so little</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their first words,</v>

2504
01:53:33.271 --> 01:53:35.550
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you fucking forget it.</v>

2505
01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:38.640
<v Speaker 2>You forget it all because you know them</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the them.</v>

2506
01:53:38.641 --> 01:53:41.820
<v Speaker 2>They are now at six or at eight or at 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at 14,</v>

2507
01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:45.960
<v Speaker 2>and those incredibly powerful moment you</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget,</v>

2508
01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:50.100
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember some cut you off in traffic</v>

2509
01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:53.460
<v Speaker 2>14 years ago and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have kicked out fucking guys as</v>

2510
01:53:53.610 --> 01:53:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw him at the red light and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of my car and it haunts me to</v>

2511
01:53:56.461 --> 01:53:59.580
<v Speaker 2>this day on a drag him out of his car</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feed him his fucking teeth.</v>

2512
01:53:59.910 --> 01:54:03.180
<v Speaker 2>You remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you won't remember your daughter</v>

2513
01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 2>being to dancing to some music that's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television and everybody laughing and</v>

2514
01:54:09.421 --> 01:54:11.070
<v Speaker 2>cheering along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to see it.</v>

2515
01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at a fucking video that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saved on your iphone and watch it</v>

2516
01:54:14.241 --> 01:54:15.090
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2517
01:54:15.091 --> 01:54:16.800
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2518
01:54:16.801 --> 01:54:21.150
<v Speaker 2>what an amazing moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another almost like dreams,</v>

2519
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 2>those ideas are erased from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible memory in some strange way or</v>

2520
01:54:26.461 --> 01:54:29.450
<v Speaker 2>many of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you hear a three year old st do</v>

2521
01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:33.120
<v Speaker 2>a six month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is fucking crazy because it makes</v>

2522
01:54:33.121 --> 01:54:35.480
<v Speaker 2>you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that one of them?</v>

2523
01:54:35.490 --> 01:54:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Because that's one of the properties of</v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT by the way in which is the</v>

2524
01:54:37.921 --> 01:54:39.660
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic that's created by your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

2525
01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:45.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the major properties of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream is how profound the visions are.</v>

2526
01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Incredibly powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they slip through your hands.</v>

2527
01:54:48.810 --> 01:54:50.520
<v Speaker 2>They are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gone.</v>

2528
01:54:50.521 --> 01:54:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Just like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you wake up from a dream and you</v>

2529
01:54:53.311 --> 01:54:56.550
<v Speaker 2>try to explain it to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very small window.</v>

2530
01:54:56.551 --> 01:54:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Will</v>

2531
01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:00.380
<v Speaker 1>you explain that dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness?</v>

2532
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's powerful moments.</v>

2533
01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Does eraser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2534
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good moments that I've had with</v>

2535
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:11.950
<v Speaker 1>each one of my kids and I can literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>at of all the monster.</v>

2536
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember this.</v>

2537
01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You still let them in the museum of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

2538
01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I have forgotten most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a handful that I remember.</v>

2539
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say if it was yesterday,</v>

2540
01:55:21.531 --> 01:55:26.531
<v Speaker 1>that was on a deeper spiritual conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>level where we just locked eyes and it</v>

2541
01:55:27.681 --> 01:55:30.620
<v Speaker 1>was a moment and we just knew everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>about each other.</v>

2542
01:55:30.621 --> 01:55:31.700
<v Speaker 1>That Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2543
01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I wanted that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it felt and I can count</v>

2544
01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:39.170
<v Speaker 1>that with each one of my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I always go back to going,</v>

2545
01:55:39.230 --> 01:55:41.930
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really know who you really are and I'm</v>

2546
01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.660
<v Speaker 1>trying to get you back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it make sense?</v>

2547
01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Does I think that we have an accessible</v>
<v Speaker 1>database,</v>

2548
01:55:46.981 --> 01:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>we have a hard drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a certain amount of space and</v>

2549
01:55:49.081 --> 01:55:52.910
<v Speaker 1>that's been proven when it comes to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people you can know and keeping</v>

2550
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:55.620
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that you could keep about 150</v>

2551
01:55:55.621 --> 01:56:00.621
<v Speaker 1>people in your life and you can sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember these people and you can you</v>

2552
01:56:01.570 --> 01:56:05.580
<v Speaker 1>hold these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you go past 1:50 it gets</v>

2553
01:56:05.581 --> 01:56:08.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking slippery as shit and you must</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that because you're</v>

2554
01:56:08.551 --> 01:56:11.580
<v Speaker 1>constantly meeting people and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who you are and you don't remember</v>

2555
01:56:11.581 --> 01:56:14.340
<v Speaker 1>them and after awhile you can go nice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet you and they go.</v>

2556
01:56:14.341 --> 01:56:15.830
<v Speaker 1>We already met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We met three years ago.</v>

2557
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:16.913
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

2558
01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot maintain this many connections.</v>

2559
01:56:19.450 --> 01:56:23.190
<v Speaker 1>The same basis drive issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a literal hard drive issue.</v>

2560
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I forget what is the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it's not bodes laws the size</v>

2561
01:56:26.761 --> 01:56:27.594
<v Speaker 1>of planets.</v>

2562
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the principal,</v>

2563
01:56:29.551 --> 01:56:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but the principal is a 100 or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word is.</v>

2564
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It's 150 people and you keep those</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred 50 people in your head and</v>

2565
01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It correlates to what we were talking</v>

2566
01:56:36.961 --> 01:56:40.270
<v Speaker 1>about with chimpanzees and anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a,</v>

2567
01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.410
<v Speaker 1>there isn't an ideal size for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>community before it becomes a disease to</v>

2568
01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:46.540
<v Speaker 1>know to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those things you were talking about,</v>

2569
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.160
<v Speaker 1>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are like a transcendent moment.</v>

2570
01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar's number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2571
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try and like you're talking about</v>

2572
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:55.980
<v Speaker 1>moments where it didn't matter that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual way and that's individual,</v>

2573
01:56:55.981 --> 01:56:57.990
<v Speaker 1>be that there's a clear connection that</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2574
01:56:57.991 --> 01:57:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Parsley is between us and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was overpowering and beautiful just</v>

2575
01:57:02.611 --> 01:57:06.480
<v Speaker 1>for that moment and that keeps me going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain moments of time,</v>

2576
01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm 15 years later in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I I know know could describe it to me.</v>

2577
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I just know that on some level that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be broken down I'm sure to sort of oxy</v>

2578
01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.070
<v Speaker 1>toast in and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2579
01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.490
<v Speaker 1>this is the shoreline was triggered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2580
01:57:20.491 --> 01:57:23.700
<v Speaker 1>There is a sort of a mechanical or</v>
<v Speaker 1>material component to even the most</v>

2581
01:57:23.701 --> 01:57:26.730
<v Speaker 1>beautiful experiences of a sunset away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2582
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to return to what you were saying</v>

2583
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.620
<v Speaker 1>before of like how we have five or</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative information,</v>

2584
01:57:31.621 --> 01:57:34.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a clear evolutionary bias for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like negative information has to be</v>

2585
01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:36.820
<v Speaker 1>stored because you know he's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

2586
01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Is that line you better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2587
01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:40.300
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's alliance.</v>

2588
01:57:40.710 --> 01:57:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Negative information does have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>priority,</v>

2589
01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:48.120
<v Speaker 1>but what were you saying about like sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this continued technological</v>

2590
01:57:48.121 --> 01:57:49.140
<v Speaker 1>evolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I.</v>

2591
01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:53.130
<v Speaker 1>What I think is that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative to have a comparable</v>

2592
01:57:53.131 --> 01:57:58.120
<v Speaker 1>spiritual evolution revolution and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can occur is like the mortar.</v>

2593
01:57:58.150 --> 01:58:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I meditate and spent time doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stuff.</v>

2594
01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a more of an awareness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of phenomenon you're talking</v>

2595
01:58:03.811 --> 01:58:05.650
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the positive things and I'm like,</v>

2596
01:58:05.651 --> 01:58:06.451
<v Speaker 1>you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2597
01:58:06.451 --> 01:58:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I must hold this moment in my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment where my dog done now or the</v>

2598
01:58:09.661 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 1>moment I found out my girlfriend was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>

2599
01:58:11.191 --> 01:58:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking let this go this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go make this part of who you are as a</v>

2600
01:58:15.211 --> 01:58:19.440
<v Speaker 1>character and try to prioritize it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative things or when someone hurts,</v>

2601
01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2602
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and I think that one has more</v>
<v Speaker 1>determination over that more or 40 over</v>

2603
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:27.930
<v Speaker 1>that if you have meditation as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Life,</v>

2604
01:58:27.931 --> 01:58:31.310
<v Speaker 1>if you have a spiritual component to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was when I was a teenager and</v>

2605
01:58:31.311 --> 01:58:33.570
<v Speaker 1>noticed that my mates were all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2606
01:58:33.571 --> 01:58:35.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd hang out with my mates were smoking</v>

2607
01:58:35.521 --> 01:58:36.330
<v Speaker 1>loads to draw.</v>

2608
01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Then we get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go out,</v>

2609
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:40.410
<v Speaker 1>they go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mate would lucky worked in a car</v>

2610
01:58:40.411 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 1>factory and then he would go and work</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors to insecurity and I fought this</v>

2611
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:46.460
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never ever is like Justin.</v>

2612
01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never still,</v>

2613
01:58:47.951 --> 01:58:50.320
<v Speaker 1>he's never in reflection is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged with some extent,</v>

2614
01:58:50.321 --> 01:58:52.600
<v Speaker 1>for as a really lovely guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact he was.</v>

2615
01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:55.750
<v Speaker 1>But like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became aware then,</v>

2616
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was part of my addiction was</v>

2617
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:04.080
<v Speaker 1>these uncontrolled drives always want in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something approval sex that I was unable</v>

2618
01:59:04.241 --> 01:59:06.820
<v Speaker 1>to be still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being so unlike so many fucking</v>

2619
01:59:06.821 --> 01:59:07.631
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2620
01:59:07.631 --> 01:59:09.880
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so many things,</v>

2621
01:59:09.881 --> 01:59:11.040
<v Speaker 1>biblical things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2622
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon the</v>

2623
01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:15.460
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man sees it not the Kingdom of</v>

2624
01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Heaven is within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be still and know that I am God,</v>

2625
01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:19.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2626
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like for me,</v>

2627
01:59:20.041 --> 01:59:22.930
<v Speaker 1>all that fuzzy fucking rapture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud kingdom bullshit.</v>

2628
01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:23.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2629
01:59:23.321 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no use to anybody.</v>

2630
01:59:24.491 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 1>But when people are saying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in there,</v>

2631
01:59:26.441 --> 01:59:28.390
<v Speaker 1>it's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there already,</v>

2632
01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there is no,</v>

2633
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:32.950
<v Speaker 1>of course we are also living in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>material world and I'm a material girl.</v>

2634
01:59:32.951 --> 01:59:37.951
<v Speaker 1>So because we can't drop the drive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to create these great</v>

2635
01:59:38.201 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 1>achievements as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a part of it has got to be you learn</v>

2636
01:59:42.881 --> 01:59:44.980
<v Speaker 1>how to conduct yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to connect your emotions,</v>

2637
01:59:45.070 --> 01:59:48.940
<v Speaker 1>learn how to store positive experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn how to let go of negative</v>

2638
01:59:48.941 --> 01:59:49.440
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2639
01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.460
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that day originality with people.</v>

2640
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all got our paths,</v>

2641
01:59:52.571 --> 01:59:55.270
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all got our individual attributes</v>

2642
01:59:55.271 --> 01:59:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

2643
01:59:56.291 --> 01:59:58.270
<v Speaker 1>if we were on communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island,</v>

2644
01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need people like to people to be</v>

2645
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:03.250
<v Speaker 1>realizing what is their part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>divine,</v>

2646
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:06.250
<v Speaker 1>what is the little part of you that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to realize itself,</v>

2647
02:00:06.251 --> 02:00:08.020
<v Speaker 1>but life's kept fucking knocking you</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in.</v>

2648
02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>The systems kept breaking you down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've not got to realize that thing</v>

2649
02:00:11.501 --> 02:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>that you can feel like a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to grow into your.</v>

2650
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the part of it I think can only</v>

2651
02:00:17.471 --> 02:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>happen as part of a spiritual evolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can even.</v>

2652
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>You can only get the ticket to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual evolution if you learn to deal</v>

2653
02:00:23.711 --> 02:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>with this fucking Matt stimulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit that we're jacked up on.</v>

2654
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>What's what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate.</v>

2655
02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You turn it all off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>

2656
02:00:30.431 --> 02:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I got turn it all off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing and your mind will have a chance</v>

2657
02:00:35.021 --> 02:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that that's where the</v>

2658
02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:42.940
<v Speaker 1>compelling feeling to gravitate towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from a dissatisfaction with</v>

2659
02:00:42.941 --> 02:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction with this idea of</v>

2660
02:00:45.581 --> 02:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>possessions and that there is some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a weird ebb and flow and a Yin and</v>

2661
02:00:49.151 --> 02:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Yang to the world and sometimes you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see the fucking disastrous effects of</v>

2662
02:00:54.131 --> 02:00:59.131
<v Speaker 1>just giving in to material possessions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the compelling feeling of wanting</v>

2663
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>attention and nonsense and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering up items and living in the</v>

2664
02:01:03.551 --> 02:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>biggest house.</v>

2665
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to almost feel the emptiness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to gravitate towards a spiritual</v>

2666
02:01:08.471 --> 02:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>approach and I think that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why those things are there.</v>

2667
02:01:11.411 --> 02:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like people do horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2668
02:01:14.050 --> 02:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I feel like horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things when they're manifested by the</v>

2669
02:01:17.651 --> 02:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of,</v>

2670
02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2671
02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can give birth to a lot of positive</v>

2672
02:01:22.691 --> 02:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>reactions because people don't ever want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like that and they see that and</v>

2673
02:01:26.741 --> 02:01:26.981
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2674
02:01:26.981 --> 02:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely not the way to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're kind of all going through</v>

2675
02:01:29.471 --> 02:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about the human mind</v>

2676
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>and the human experience like being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious human is we assume that we're</v>

2677
02:01:36.281 --> 02:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>this static thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile we're,</v>

2678
02:01:38.401 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>we're very well aware that evolution</v>

2679
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.840
<v Speaker 2>exists all throughout the natural world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're also aware,</v>

2680
02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>well aware that we've only really been</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing for like what a half,</v>

2681
02:01:47.121 --> 02:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>a million quarter of a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not been that long that you could</v>

2682
02:01:50.571 --> 02:01:54.860
<v Speaker 2>go back and find a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ancient human and they look like you</v>

2683
02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:57.500
<v Speaker 2>could put it in your clothes and put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a movie theater and we wouldn't freak</v>

2684
02:01:57.501 --> 02:01:59.090
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that long.</v>

2685
02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about the fact that we</v>

2686
02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:06.800
<v Speaker 2>know that these animals and these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are constantly evolving and</v>

2687
02:02:06.801 --> 02:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>changing and adapting all around us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we assume that we're in some</v>

2688
02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>sort of a static state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2689
02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that our own gravitation towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>material possessions in our own use of</v>

2690
02:02:18.021 --> 02:02:22.220
<v Speaker 2>this new form of interacting with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other through social media and the</v>

2691
02:02:22.221 --> 02:02:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Internet and and movies and all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are new.</v>

2692
02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>We have to understand that mass media is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking knew as shit.</v>

2693
02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:31.450
<v Speaker 2>All of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Newspapers are new as fuck everything.</v>

2694
02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Everything's a couple hundred years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oldest shit is a couple hundred</v>

2695
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.900
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>photographs,</v>

2696
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>couple hundred years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're dealing with really,</v>

2697
02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really new influences on the mind and</v>

2698
02:02:40.911 --> 02:02:45.911
<v Speaker 2>the mind is developing and expanding and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting to all these new things and</v>

2699
02:02:47.061 --> 02:02:50.450
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it reacts in a very negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>way like it gravitates towards the</v>

2700
02:02:50.451 --> 02:02:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Kardashians and it goes towards fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions and it wants the shiniest</v>

2701
02:02:54.231 --> 02:02:57.530
<v Speaker 2>new thing to show everybody that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrived and it's.</v>

2702
02:02:57.610 --> 02:03:02.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of a cog in unconscious cog</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this machine that's just producing</v>

2703
02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:07.880
<v Speaker 2>new items and then sometimes there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like you who sees that and goes,</v>

2704
02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 2>there is no soul to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jump in the fucking lake</v>

2705
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:14.690
<v Speaker 2>near these royals house and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience what it's like to freeze my</v>

2706
02:03:14.691 --> 02:03:18.170
<v Speaker 2>dick off and I'm going to carve a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>path and I'm going to separate and I'm</v>

2707
02:03:18.171 --> 02:03:21.470
<v Speaker 2>going to try domesticity and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try abstinence and I'm going to try</v>

2708
02:03:21.471 --> 02:03:26.471
<v Speaker 2>to find some sort of a new way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing my dissatisfaction with the</v>

2709
02:03:26.481 --> 02:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>current state of the world that I find</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself in that that was fucking good.</v>

2710
02:03:30.230 --> 02:03:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed a date.</v>

2711
02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2712
02:03:33.801 --> 02:03:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does that,</v>

2713
02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 2>but there's a part of that and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2714
02:03:38.541 --> 02:03:40.040
<v Speaker 2>We're all just going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ain't it?</v>

2715
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does it in it.</v>

2716
02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's scientology.</v>

2717
02:03:43.221 --> 02:03:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's being a moonie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's this.</v>

2718
02:03:45.170 --> 02:03:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's maybe this fucking chick is</v>

2719

<v Speaker 2>outfit now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We wanted to live out of my car and</v>

2723

<v Speaker 2>travel around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put a bed in the back seat</v>

2724
02:04:03.231 --> 02:04:06.290
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this fax faction which has</v>

<v Speaker 2>been happening forever.</v>

2727
02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:16.010

<v Speaker 2>Can I do it time?</v>

2728
02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me to be in another room.</v>

2729
02:04:20.121 --> 02:04:24.590
<v Speaker 2>They ain't got used lots of voices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We drank three waters.</v>

2730
02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I've drank two in one and I got to Piss</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a horse and I can hold this shit in</v>

2731
02:04:28.251 --> 02:04:32.570
<v Speaker 2>for another day</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it takes a strong bladder to do a</v>

2732
02:04:32.571 --> 02:04:33.404
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>

2733
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just say what we're doing this.</v>

2734
02:04:36.081 --> 02:04:38.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why I really got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a podcast,</v>

2735
02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:42.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a opie and anthony were a big one,</v>

2736
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 2>but you're fucking show was a big one</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2737
02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>When I did your show and we did it at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that joke place,</v>

2738
02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:50.400
<v Speaker 2>that joke place on Ventura Boulevard</v>
<v Speaker 2>member.</v>

2739
02:04:50.401 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>You were in La and you were in town and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had done your show like calling in</v>

2740
02:04:54.721 --> 02:04:55.890
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd never like.</v>

2741
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:56.970
<v Speaker 2>We've never done together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2742
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.940
<v Speaker 2>this is so fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just hanging.</v>

2743
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I loved about that one too is you.</v>

2744
02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:07.180
<v Speaker 4>It what that thing allowed me to do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe,</v>

2745
02:05:07.330 --> 02:05:08.620
<v Speaker 4>believing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not thought provoking.</v>

2746
02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Let other people to one that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the greatest moments ever was you</v>

2747
02:05:13.011 --> 02:05:17.750
<v Speaker 4>called in and we wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all sitting there and I fuck</v>

2748
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:20.150
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went into this whole thing of these are</v>

2749
02:05:20.151 --> 02:05:25.040
<v Speaker 4>the Times of truth and this and that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you spoke for 45 minutes</v>

2750
02:05:25.041 --> 02:05:27.490
<v Speaker 4>straight and I just kept looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone going,</v>

2751
02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:30.290
<v Speaker 4>don't just let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2752
02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.120
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fascinating.</v>

2753
02:05:32.121 --> 02:05:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Let him go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where else can you have this?</v>

2754
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:40.030
<v Speaker 4>And one of my guys made like this whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>pink floyd music and he put it on the</v>

2755
02:05:40.161 --> 02:05:40.821
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2756
02:05:40.821 --> 02:05:44.100
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get that in the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think I remember calling your</v>

2757
02:05:44.150 --> 02:05:48.560
<v Speaker 4>telling you go and show this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the most fascinating thing ever</v>

2758
02:05:48.561 --> 02:05:49.394
<v Speaker 4>heard in my life.</v>

2759
02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:52.670
<v Speaker 4>So I thought I was going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't.</v>

2760
02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:57.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you never were allowed to even think</v>

2761
02:05:58.161 --> 02:06:01.030
<v Speaker 4>like that on radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things you said too,</v>

2762
02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 4>it's my favorite part was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again I end up fear in it because I</v>

2763
02:06:04.581 --> 02:06:07.280
<v Speaker 4>didn't want people thinking it was our</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening song,</v>

2764
02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:10.340
<v Speaker 4>which just explained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just four of us.</v>

2765
02:06:10.341 --> 02:06:11.380
<v Speaker 4>We came out to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2766
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:12.830
<v Speaker 4>get musicians that you came and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2767
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:15.230
<v Speaker 4>drill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the,</v>

2768
02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:19.040
<v Speaker 4>that is the greatest theme song I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever heard in my life.</v>

2769
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:20.210
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

2770
02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was you,</v>

2771
02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.610
<v Speaker 4>what was me and the guys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were just really just talking and</v>

2772
02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:26.630
<v Speaker 4>we've ripped it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

2773
02:06:26.631 --> 02:06:28.730
<v Speaker 4>don't even don't even change it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just do that.</v>

2774
02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:30.770
<v Speaker 4>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was real.</v>

2775
02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I knew I,</v>

2776
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I knew when I heard you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2777
02:06:38.170 --> 02:06:40.640
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be in this world.</v>

2778
02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:41.640
<v Speaker 4>It's great to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2779
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:46.100
<v Speaker 4>it's great to have you in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's refreshing.</v>

2780
02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:48.740
<v Speaker 4>It's thought provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's powerful.</v>

2781
02:06:49.330 --> 02:06:50.240
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it,</v>

2782
02:06:50.241 --> 02:06:51.320
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very,</v>

2783
02:06:51.321 --> 02:06:53.150
<v Speaker 4>very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

2784
02:06:53.590 --> 02:06:53.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2785
02:06:53.981 --> 02:06:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I love it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2786
02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:58.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a unique time that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can have something like this.</v>

2787
02:06:58.841 --> 02:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And when I was on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2788
02:07:01.271 --> 02:07:02.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get one of these satellite</v>

2789
02:07:02.561 --> 02:07:04.650
<v Speaker 2>radio shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the shit I didn't know that</v>

2790
02:07:04.651 --> 02:07:07.210
<v Speaker 2>there was going to be an Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of that where you don't have any</v>

2791
02:07:07.211 --> 02:07:10.600
<v Speaker 2>bosses and it reaches even more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

2792
02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Who's somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a path has been carved through the</v>

2793
02:07:14.501 --> 02:07:17.680
<v Speaker 2>information highways that people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been on before.</v>

2794
02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:20.890
<v Speaker 2>It's only like 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And through that path you reach</v>

2795
02:07:20.891 --> 02:07:23.460
<v Speaker 2>everybody and it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2796
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:26.740
<v Speaker 2>it violates all the ideas of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to pay for it.</v>

2797
02:07:26.741 --> 02:07:31.741
<v Speaker 2>It's massively successful and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>500,000 of them and it lives forever,</v>

2798
02:07:33.850 --> 02:07:34.900
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

2799
02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So people can constantly discover a.</v>

2800
02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Did you allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>

2801
02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:40.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

2802
02:07:40.091 --> 02:07:43.580
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might not make it an asteroid hits</v>

2803
02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 2>whatever until that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is be nice to know that someone that's</v>

2804
02:07:48.401 --> 02:07:50.200
<v Speaker 2>never even heard of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2805
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:53.860
<v Speaker 2>In 20 years down the road they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to listen to this conversation.</v>

2806
02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell brand was in there and this day</v>

2807
02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>did he listened to that 20 years from</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're going,</v>

2808
02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes.</v>

2809
02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:03.460
<v Speaker 2>That makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty awesome.</v>

2810
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.160
<v Speaker 2>This is the great part of social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2811
02:08:06.161 --> 02:08:08.610
<v Speaker 2>the grapevine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also that it's all free and that</v>

2812
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:11.470
<v Speaker 2>they're all available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get 800 plus episodes of this</v>

2813
02:08:11.471 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 2>thing anytime you want it and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are free,</v>

2814
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:18.280
<v Speaker 2>you can be more honest and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate about what you put out there</v>

2815
02:08:18.281 --> 02:08:20.970
<v Speaker 2>because no one's paying you to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2816
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:23.500
<v Speaker 2>did you ever get any pressure when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing the satellite show that ever?</v>

2817
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Did anybody ever come to you and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead,</v>

2818
02:08:24.751 --> 02:08:25.261
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2819
02:08:25.261 --> 02:08:26.890
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we listen to that show and you guys are.</v>

2820
02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:29.440
<v Speaker 2>You got to tone it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

2821
02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:32.530
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never say never.</v>

2822
02:08:32.531 --> 02:08:33.161
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

2823
02:08:33.161 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because opie and Anthony got suspended a</v>

2824
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:37.060
<v Speaker 2>couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even from satellite radio.</v>

2825
02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:40.270
<v Speaker 2>They were getting A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2826
02:08:40.271 --> 02:08:42.400
<v Speaker 2>they were getting a lot of commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2827
02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2828
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:48.930
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly where they rubbed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong side of the madness.</v>

2829
02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:52.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all over Fox News.</v>

2830
02:08:52.811 --> 02:08:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to,</v>

2831
02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were kind of compromised in some</v>

2832
02:08:56.081 --> 02:08:59.470
<v Speaker 2>sort of a weird way whether they want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be or not because they were making a</v>

2833
02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:03.190
<v Speaker 2>fuck load of money and as soon as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company is paying you x amount of money</v>

2834
02:09:03.191 --> 02:09:06.380
<v Speaker 2>every year and they get upset about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something or they feel it,</v>

2835
02:09:06.381 --> 02:09:09.550
<v Speaker 2>feel like the Rav advertising revenue is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to dry up because you guys said</v>

2836
02:09:09.551 --> 02:09:12.070
<v Speaker 2>something crazy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember when they had that homeless</v>

2837
02:09:12.071 --> 02:09:15.070
<v Speaker 2>guy on who said some crazy shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Condoleezza Rice?</v>

2838
02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:16.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2839
02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.550
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got suspended for like a year or</v>

2840
02:09:18.551 --> 02:09:20.650
<v Speaker 2>like a month or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had,</v>

2841
02:09:20.651 --> 02:09:21.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some might be a week.</v>

2842
02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm making up numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They um,</v>

2843
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:27.610
<v Speaker 2>had some homeless guy on it came on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said he wanted a rape Condoleeza Rice or</v>

2844
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:28.860
<v Speaker 2>something and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2845
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:31.840
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just had some crazy guy off the</v>

2846
02:09:31.841 --> 02:09:36.080
<v Speaker 2>street and he talked to all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy nonsense and he left and you know,</v>

2847
02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:38.980
<v Speaker 2>it's all alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's nothing you could do about it.</v>

2848
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:40.240
<v Speaker 2>This guy in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2849
02:09:40.241 --> 02:09:42.170
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are they going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>lp?</v>

2850
02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony didn't say Norton didn't say it,</v>

2851
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:48.580
<v Speaker 2>but because it was on their show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pulled the show and it was probably</v>

2852
02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:52.240
<v Speaker 2>because of political pressure or pull up</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure from the Bush administration.</v>

2853
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:55.120
<v Speaker 2>This is also coincidentally during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time where,</v>

2854
02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just after the time of Howard</v>

2855
02:09:57.701 --> 02:10:00.820
<v Speaker 2>stern getting sued over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the government.</v>

2856
02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Remember they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would give these massive lawsuits</v>

2857
02:10:03.521 --> 02:10:06.280
<v Speaker 2>and that drove him to satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2858
02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.410
<v Speaker 2>and even in satellite radio they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>

2859
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.720
<v Speaker 2>so even in satellite radio he moved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite radio.</v>

2860
02:10:10.721 --> 02:10:14.140
<v Speaker 2>He moved to Sirius Xm at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was before the merge of</v>

2861
02:10:14.141 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Sirius Xm or maybe right afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way they.</v>

2862
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:21.730
<v Speaker 2>They weren't free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even under the banner of this free thing</v>

2863
02:10:21.731 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 2>on satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The political machine still had</v>

2864
02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:26.800
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2865
02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:28.450
<v Speaker 2>We'd never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never were told,</v>

2866
02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:30.670
<v Speaker 2>don't say this amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

2867
02:10:30.730 --> 02:10:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Because you had some wild fucking shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do.</v>

2868
02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>They would</v>

2869
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.611
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2870
02:10:34.611 --> 02:10:37.340
<v Speaker 4>lisinopril ratings time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks good.</v>

2871
02:10:37.341 --> 02:10:42.341
<v Speaker 4>If you guys were to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>biggie kind of entertaining show that</v>

2872
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:46.670
<v Speaker 4>would like that we can get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the uh,</v>

2873
02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:49.700
<v Speaker 4>did you get to choose guests?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2874
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:52.040
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to get.</v>

2875
02:10:52.041 --> 02:10:53.660
<v Speaker 4>They weren't running to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trust me.</v>

2876
02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:57.730
<v Speaker 4>You get to veto anybody usually I</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't tell you who it was.</v>

2877
02:10:57.731 --> 02:10:59.620
<v Speaker 4>A million guys suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything about this guy.</v>

2878
02:10:59.630 --> 02:11:01.700
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I getting out of that?</v>

2879
02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 4>So they bring the politician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to be a dick.</v>

2880
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2881
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 4>that's a beautiful thing about the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were involved in it too because</v>

2882
02:11:09.021 --> 02:11:11.870
<v Speaker 4>you were involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back when I was on fear factor because</v>

2883
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:14.390
<v Speaker 4>the stunt guys fucking loved your show</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2884
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.850
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to do this thing where I got in</v>

2885
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:17.270
<v Speaker 4>the truck.</v>

2886
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:20.750
<v Speaker 4>We had to drive to some location,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was hanging out with the stunt guys and</v>

2887
02:11:20.751 --> 02:11:25.190
<v Speaker 4>they were playing your show when it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>on raw dog and they loved it and they</v>

2888
02:11:25.191 --> 02:11:26.001
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2889
02:11:26.001 --> 02:11:30.620
<v Speaker 4>brewers show is the fucking best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was really wild and raw and I was</v>

2890
02:11:30.621 --> 02:11:33.230
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you maybe couldn't even do that today.</v>

2891
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:37.550
<v Speaker 4>Well those are my best friends growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and my best friends was Jimmy Shaka</v>

2892
02:11:37.551 --> 02:11:41.960
<v Speaker 4>who was deep and we would have these</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations for hours.</v>

2893
02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:46.100
<v Speaker 4>And it really bothered me that there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>no outlet for this anywhere.</v>

2894
02:11:46.101 --> 02:11:49.430
<v Speaker 4>You had to be a freak or widow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hippie or or whatever.</v>

2895
02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:54.230
<v Speaker 4>And then I had another best friend on</v>
<v Speaker 4>there who works for Fedex.</v>

2896
02:11:54.231 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had the blue collar.</v>

2897
02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.780
<v Speaker 4>He stuck in that blue collar</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>

2898
02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:05.150
<v Speaker 4>Little Ray says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he won't really just two years and</v>

2899
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:06.680
<v Speaker 4>and the nucleus.</v>

2900
02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:10.460
<v Speaker 4>And then you had core Yeley who's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll say whatever he was,</v>

2901
02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.370
<v Speaker 4>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll just go and say whatever and do</v>

2902
02:12:13.371 --> 02:12:16.280
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was great to have all these</v>

2903
02:12:16.281 --> 02:12:18.530
<v Speaker 4>different views,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honest views.</v>

2904
02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:21.770
<v Speaker 4>And if some days we just fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The big rule was no news,</v>

2905
02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:25.100
<v Speaker 4>no pop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you bring pop culture on the show,</v>

2906
02:12:25.101 --> 02:12:28.370
<v Speaker 4>your route with were antipop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're out,</v>

2907
02:12:28.371 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 4>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get that name,</v>

2908
02:12:30.081 --> 02:12:32.270
<v Speaker 4>your band forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Less beautiful.</v>

2909
02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:34.270
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was saying too,</v>

2910
02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:38.530
<v Speaker 4>it's just as a hang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to get it back to tribal is</v>

2911
02:12:38.531 --> 02:12:41.300
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the day isn't some of the</v>

2912
02:12:41.301 --> 02:12:45.440
<v Speaker 4>best times you have conversations like</v>
<v Speaker 4>these or when you're with the people you</v>

2913
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:47.650
<v Speaker 4>trust the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be the kid you grew up with.</v>

2914
02:12:47.651 --> 02:12:48.940
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can Be anyone,</v>

2915
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:51.950
<v Speaker 4>a family member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone you just met and you're just</v>

2916
02:12:51.951 --> 02:12:53.210
<v Speaker 4>hanging out at the end of the night.</v>

2917
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't care if this one's dylan or</v>
<v Speaker 4>that window.</v>

2918
02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:58.370
<v Speaker 4>You're just hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a fire,</v>

2919
02:12:58.371 --> 02:12:59.390
<v Speaker 4>you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the day,</v>

2920
02:12:59.391 --> 02:13:01.280
<v Speaker 4>it's all the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's out there?</v>

2921
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Who really knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's this?</v>

2922
02:13:03.710 --> 02:13:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Who really fucking knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about and try to figure out</v>

2923
02:13:07.161 --> 02:13:08.870
<v Speaker 4>for three hours and what we get out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2924
02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really fucking know it's time for bed,</v>

2925
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:16.460
<v Speaker 4>but kids get now you have six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if feel great that you're all doing</v>

2926
02:13:16.461 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 4>it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You trust each other.</v>

2927
02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:21.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I crazy for saying this?</v>

2928
02:13:21.201 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 4>I might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll tell me,</v>

2929
02:13:22.911 --> 02:13:24.170
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking crazy.</v>

2930
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Why would you say that's stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's stupid.</v>

2931
02:13:26.991 --> 02:13:31.890
<v Speaker 4>Why is that stupid and just that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was pretty with each other and</v>

2932
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 2>they make more sense that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I trust you and your instincts in</v>

2933
02:13:35.161 --> 02:13:37.230
<v Speaker 2>your mind that I'll tell you something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I believe in you,</v>

2934
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:39.000
<v Speaker 2>you refused it and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2935
02:13:39.001 --> 02:13:40.530
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to consider his point of view</v>

2936
02:13:40.890 --> 02:13:43.380
<v Speaker 2>because if I trust your point of view</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your point of view differs from</v>

2937
02:13:43.381 --> 02:13:45.040
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how did he come to this conclusion</v>

2938
02:13:45.041 --> 02:13:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and why is it so different than my own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by absorbing a bunch of different</v>

2939
02:13:48.511 --> 02:13:50.610
<v Speaker 2>points of view like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a much more nuanced</v>

2940
02:13:50.611 --> 02:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>perspective of this existence and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be open.</v>

2941
02:13:53.550 --> 02:13:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm not out to win the conversation on</v>
<v Speaker 2>just we're just here to learn from it</v>

2942
02:13:57.421 --> 02:13:58.530
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's important.</v>

2943
02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:00.680
<v Speaker 2>People have to be open with that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think we're.</v>

2944
02:14:00.681 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 2>We've all been guilty of not being open</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that before wanting to be right,</v>

2945
02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:07.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's important to not just embrace</v>
<v Speaker 2>being wrong,</v>

2946
02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:09.870
<v Speaker 2>but try to understand why you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

2947
02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Trying to understand like what it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not be connected in some weird ego</v>

2948
02:14:13.621 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 2>way to your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get just a joe fuck yeah,</v>

2949
02:14:17.101 --> 02:14:18.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's like all those other things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're talking about.</v>

2950
02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you saying that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2951
02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:26.100
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gravitation towards a expelling all</v>

2952
02:14:26.101 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 2>of these ridiculous notions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is just sort of accepted as</v>

2953
02:14:29.551 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 2>fact and truth and trying to connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a much more spiritual as well.</v>

2954
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:36.480
<v Speaker 2>That means you've got to think about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be a conscious thing and the</v>

2955
02:14:36.481 --> 02:14:41.481
<v Speaker 2>same thing with not holding onto your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and not being married to them and</v>

2956
02:14:41.551 --> 02:14:45.720
<v Speaker 2>not not being invested in being correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>or incorrect,</v>

2957
02:14:45.721 --> 02:14:49.170
<v Speaker 2>but just sort of accepting them as just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and be able to go,</v>

2958
02:14:49.171 --> 02:14:50.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

2959
02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Why was I thinking that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's hard for people to do.</v>

2960
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I know this is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw a statement was in someone</v>

2961
02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:01.650
<v Speaker 2>went and it was a tourist spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I pass the tourist spot and went in</v>

2962
02:15:01.651 --> 02:15:02.484
<v Speaker 2>the house</v>

2963
02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:06.410
<v Speaker 4>and there was a statement in there and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>know it just.</v>

2964
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:08.790
<v Speaker 4>It's simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just blew my mind.</v>

2965
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:13.810
<v Speaker 4>It said one person could change the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole world for a better as long as they</v>

2966
02:15:14.911 --> 02:15:19.911
<v Speaker 4>don't give a damn who gets that credit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that and I,</v>

2967
02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:22.830
<v Speaker 4>and I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really don't,</v>

2968
02:15:22.831 --> 02:15:26.280
<v Speaker 4>if you just want to sit back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just want to see things better and</v>

2969
02:15:26.281 --> 02:15:29.940
<v Speaker 4>you really can change for the better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to worry about going,</v>

2970
02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so and so said that or someone so set</v>

2971
02:15:33.211 --> 02:15:36.420
<v Speaker 4>that up was so and so did that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you're doing it for different</v>

2972
02:15:36.421 --> 02:15:37.254
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

2973
02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had that before.</v>

2974
02:15:40.511 --> 02:15:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard that before until like</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday I saw like I saw that quote</v>

2975
02:15:44.661 --> 02:15:45.080
<v Speaker 3>intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can.</v>

2976
02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.080
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem that I continually have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to almost ideas.</v>

2977
02:15:51.071 --> 02:15:55.090
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of what's excellent about</v>

2978
02:15:55.091 --> 02:16:00.091
<v Speaker 3>this medium and particularly the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been executed by you look,</v>

2979
02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:03.700
<v Speaker 3>is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's discourse,</v>

2980
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:04.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let these kind of things.</v>

2981
02:16:04.931 --> 02:16:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2982
02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:09.000
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fast moving fast cut sound bite tv,</v>

2983
02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:12.490
<v Speaker 3>just bombarding with an artillery of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly erroneous information.</v>

2984
02:16:12.491 --> 02:16:14.860
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to people here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People our,</v>

2985
02:16:14.861 --> 02:16:18.850
<v Speaker 3>after our talk in examining this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guarding as you said,</v>

2986
02:16:18.851 --> 02:16:21.190
<v Speaker 3>who really knows and returning to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

2987
02:16:21.191 --> 02:16:23.560
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of encouraging because I've</v>

2988
02:16:23.561 --> 02:16:24.910
<v Speaker 3>had like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2989
02:16:24.911 --> 02:16:27.760
<v Speaker 3>like as I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always felt like an I don't like</v>

2990
02:16:27.761 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 3>agree with like a bill o'reilly</v>

2991
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 1>or Sean Hannity or those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always kind fall apart.</v>

2992
02:16:32.930 --> 02:16:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I think they were right if I hung out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

2993
02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:38.660
<v Speaker 1>There's something about Bill O'Reilly</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camacho carve.</v>

2994
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2995
02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was kind of okay.</v>

2996
02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I think you would joke around with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys probably start laughing</v>

2997
02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:48.610
<v Speaker 1>about some things and that's kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reassuring thing,</v>

2998
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to not be kind of like once you get</v>

2999
02:16:52.061 --> 02:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>a Ta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think that's what's kind of ugly</v>

3000
02:16:54.311 --> 02:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>about both liberalism and neoliberalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you can see it as people just forcing</v>

3001
02:16:58.781 --> 02:17:02.230
<v Speaker 1>their idea and they've lost touch with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do it all the fucking time.</v>

3002
02:17:02.231 --> 02:17:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with what is it that we're</v>

3003
02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:06.610
<v Speaker 1>genuinely here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that thing you said of like you can</v>

3004
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:09.790
<v Speaker 1>change the world if you know no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're willing to do,</v>

3005
02:17:09.791 --> 02:17:11.320
<v Speaker 1>if no one knowing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

3006
02:17:11.350 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3007
02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pangs I feel in my gut shows me how</v>

3008
02:17:14.411 --> 02:17:16.930
<v Speaker 1>much my ego is still involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit I do.</v>

3009
02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw it.</v>

3010
02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lack of discourse,</v>

3011
02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:26.860
<v Speaker 1>like what we were talking about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the more important things about</v>

3012
02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:29.260
<v Speaker 1>podcasts or one of the best things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

3013
02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:30.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3014
02:17:30.271 --> 02:17:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping that that's the trend</v>

3015
02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:34.060
<v Speaker 1>of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people understand that there's,</v>

3016
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>this might not be a right way or a wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to do a lot of these things and that</v>

3017
02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 1>your point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you strongly believe it or not</v>

3018
02:17:41.210 --> 02:17:43.570
<v Speaker 1>might not really work for the way I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

3019
02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:46.210
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that your right or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong or it doesn't.</v>

3020
02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some certain truths like,</v>

3021
02:17:48.731 --> 02:17:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't rape people.</v>

3022
02:17:49.631 --> 02:17:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't murder people.</v>

3023
02:17:50.501 --> 02:17:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Those things are obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some other things that</v>

3024
02:17:53.621 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 1>aren't obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3025
02:17:54.671 --> 02:17:55.630
<v Speaker 1>there's other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rob,</v>

3026
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:57.910
<v Speaker 1>not obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you shouldn't hurt people's</v>

3027
02:17:57.911 --> 02:17:58.240
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

3028
02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should them because what</v>

3029
02:18:00.761 --> 02:18:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is preposterous and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting their feelings,</v>

3030
02:18:03.101 --> 02:18:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you actually elevate all of us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize the humor in their folly and I'm</v>

3031
02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:09.940
<v Speaker 1>a big fan of folly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy human folly.</v>

3032
02:18:09.941 --> 02:18:11.650
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things I enjoy most</v>
<v Speaker 1>about humans.</v>

3033
02:18:11.651 --> 02:18:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm the quickest to make fun of my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

3034
02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:17.680
<v Speaker 1>so if I can't make fun of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a fucking goofy ass world</v>

3035
02:18:17.681 --> 02:18:20.530
<v Speaker 1>that we run and we run into some super</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive world where everyone's a</v>

3036
02:18:20.531 --> 02:18:22.750
<v Speaker 1>perfect snowflake and we can't shit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3037
02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Like nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need humility.</v>

3038
02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Humility is also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humor is really important to unpackage</v>

3039
02:18:29.231 --> 02:18:32.680
<v Speaker 1>things like because there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are going on right now in</v>

3040
02:18:32.681 --> 02:18:36.010
<v Speaker 1>this world that are a little fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird and one of the reasons why they're</v>

3041
02:18:36.011 --> 02:18:39.010
<v Speaker 1>weird is because humor hasn't had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to dissect them.</v>

3042
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that A.</v>

3043
02:18:43.510 --> 02:18:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Please talking about comedy and he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people talk about like the people</v>

3044
02:18:48.581 --> 02:18:52.300
<v Speaker 1>are very and humor because they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's powerful and they often use the</v>

3045
02:18:52.301 --> 02:18:53.890
<v Speaker 1>idea that tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk,</v>

3046
02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.030
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't joke around.</v>

3047
02:18:55.031 --> 02:18:58.430
<v Speaker 1>This is serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to joke around about things</v>

3048
02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:01.450
<v Speaker 1>serious and he they have mistaken</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriousness for solemnity,</v>

3049
02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason they want to be all</v>

3050
02:19:03.461 --> 02:19:06.610
<v Speaker 1>solid about stuff because they know it</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents people that have got that</v>

3051
02:19:06.611 --> 02:19:09.520
<v Speaker 1>comedic switchblade from getting into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument.</v>

3052
02:19:09.521 --> 02:19:13.890
<v Speaker 1>We can exactly taking that seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not playing by those rules and</v>

3053
02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:18.780
<v Speaker 1>they've also taken away your special</v>
<v Speaker 1>power special power habit.</v>

3054
02:19:18.930 --> 02:19:21.010
<v Speaker 1>This special power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of you guys have it like they don't</v>

3055
02:19:21.011 --> 02:19:24.310
<v Speaker 1>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you come in and you deflate their</v>

3056
02:19:24.311 --> 02:19:26.220
<v Speaker 1>argument with a quick switchblade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3057
02:19:26.310 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 1>a piece of shit while you're joking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around</v>

3058
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:31.010
<v Speaker 2>about something really important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe your white privilege is showing.</v>

3059
02:19:31.130 --> 02:19:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should consider the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your humor is offensive to people and</v>

3060
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:37.580
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit and it's not helping.</v>

3061
02:19:37.581 --> 02:19:40.660
<v Speaker 2>It's very regressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to</v>

3062
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:47.530
<v Speaker 2>stitch it into political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the real problems with the left</v>

3063
02:19:48.741 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>and especially the regressive left and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the PR people that think that they're</v>

3064
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:55.790
<v Speaker 2>going to change things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking unbelievably mean when</v>

3065
02:19:55.791 --> 02:19:58.820
<v Speaker 2>they're mocking the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're talking about compassion,</v>

3066
02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:02.090
<v Speaker 2>like I've seen some of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the least compassion,</v>

3067
02:20:02.091 --> 02:20:04.400
<v Speaker 2>meanest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angriest shit come out of people that</v>

3068
02:20:04.401 --> 02:20:08.600
<v Speaker 2>consider themselves to be liberal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive and their ideas to close</v>

3069
02:20:08.601 --> 02:20:12.650
<v Speaker 2>down discourse where they're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to shit on you and insult you</v>

3070
02:20:12.651 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 2>and then gang up and some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird bully pulpit to attack all the</v>

3071
02:20:17.121 --> 02:20:18.110
<v Speaker 2>people that don't agree with them.</v>

3072
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>We're not going involved in politics in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my country doing that thing.</v>

3073
02:20:21.001 --> 02:20:26.001
<v Speaker 3>The truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most number of book as well called</v>

3074
02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that book I talked about it.</v>

3075
02:20:28.330 --> 02:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>It was basically a book those meant to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be for younger people and it was like,</v>

3076
02:20:32.311 --> 02:20:35.280
<v Speaker 3>this is my perspective on why I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in this stuff and why I believe</v>

3077
02:20:35.281 --> 02:20:35.911
<v Speaker 3>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was really,</v>

3078
02:20:35.911 --> 02:20:36.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was relatively simple.</v>

3079
02:20:36.931 --> 02:20:39.330
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a self taught person.</v>

3080
02:20:39.331 --> 02:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a book by fucking academic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3081
02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:45.630
<v Speaker 3>The worst vitriol and their worst</v>
<v Speaker 3>condemnation came from the kind of</v>

3082
02:20:45.631 --> 02:20:49.830
<v Speaker 3>newspapers and liberal organizations</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would think would be supportive of</v>

3083
02:20:49.831 --> 02:20:51.900
<v Speaker 3>such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's good that he's guy from the</v>

3084
02:20:51.901 --> 02:20:55.260
<v Speaker 3>world of popular entertainment who's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>a classically educated.</v>

3085
02:20:55.430 --> 02:20:56.970
<v Speaker 3>It's trying to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3086
02:20:57.090 --> 02:20:59.610
<v Speaker 3>they came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they came in like get the fuck out of</v>

3087
02:20:59.660 --> 02:20:59.900
<v Speaker 3>our</v>

3088
02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:03.270
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think</v>

3089
02:21:03.810 --> 02:21:08.430
<v Speaker 3>more than any kind of like a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing organization that they almost</v>

3090
02:21:08.431 --> 02:21:10.130
<v Speaker 3>see it has gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jolly good.</v>

3091
02:21:11.460 --> 02:21:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really like.</v>

3092
02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I was very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people that I thought might be</v>

3093
02:21:14.341 --> 02:21:16.020
<v Speaker 3>allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations I thought might be</v>

3094
02:21:16.021 --> 02:21:18.180
<v Speaker 3>encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're very condemnatory.</v>

3095
02:21:18.310 --> 02:21:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you going to realize the what is the</v>

3096
02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:24.130
<v Speaker 2>mechanism that they're distributing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>information with?</v>

3097
02:21:24.250 --> 02:21:27.160
<v Speaker 2>You know what they're doing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're writing their own stories.</v>

3098
02:21:27.161 --> 02:21:31.510
<v Speaker 2>They're promoting their own blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing their own radio shows and</v>

3099
02:21:31.570 --> 02:21:34.450
<v Speaker 2>in fact feeding their own ego like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about before,</v>

3100
02:21:34.750 --> 02:21:38.230
<v Speaker 2>that green monster of envy that sees</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking guy with beautiful bone</v>

3101
02:21:38.231 --> 02:21:42.540
<v Speaker 2>structure and the beautiful accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm philosophizing this piece of</v>

3102
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:45.910
<v Speaker 2>shit he had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the wherewithal and the power to</v>

3103
02:21:45.911 --> 02:21:49.910
<v Speaker 2>go on a sexual rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chose to back off of it and realize like</v>

3104
02:21:49.930 --> 02:21:52.270
<v Speaker 2>all these fucking goddamn things he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got going for him.</v>

3105
02:21:52.271 --> 02:21:54.700
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this guy.</v>

3106
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling him I'm tearing them down,</v>

3107
02:21:58.151 --> 02:21:59.630
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's sitting there with his pot</v>

3108
02:21:59.631 --> 02:22:04.631
<v Speaker 2>belly fucking taken his antidepressants</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tap tapping away mean shit on the</v>

3109
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:09.830
<v Speaker 2>keyboard hoping and hoping that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean words hit your mind and they enter</v>

3110
02:22:10.661 --> 02:22:13.510
<v Speaker 2>into your consciousness and he can</v>
<v Speaker 2>affect you in some sort of a horrible</v>

3111
02:22:13.511 --> 02:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3112
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lack of extreme lack of compassion</v>

3113
02:22:17.471 --> 02:22:22.471
<v Speaker 2>from some people on the left and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>green light to attack this fact that,</v>

3114
02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:24.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this guy and I don't agree with</v>

3115
02:22:24.731 --> 02:22:29.731
<v Speaker 2>him and I think that what he's doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist and it's massage and nearest dick</v>

3116
02:22:29.911 --> 02:22:32.450
<v Speaker 2>and it's enabling and let's get them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3120
02:22:37.561 --> 02:22:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be involved in this press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3121
02:22:40.231 --> 02:22:45.231
<v Speaker 2>Throw my hat into the ring as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbiter of intelligent ideas to dismay</v>

3122
02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:49.830
<v Speaker 2>or dismantle rather all these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid thoughts at this shit head with</v>

3123
02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:52.280
<v Speaker 2>his perfect bone structure and men bonds</v>
<v Speaker 2>pumping out.</v>

3124
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>

3125
02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Professional wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3126
02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:58.420
<v Speaker 2>professional wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3127
02:22:58.800 --> 02:22:59.580
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3128
02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:03.900
<v Speaker 2>people jockeying for their own little</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shining moment in the darkness.</v>

3129
02:23:04.290 --> 02:23:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Pizza Front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3130
02:23:05.301 --> 02:23:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I go conspiracy pizza front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3131
02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Here's what our magazines and bend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yours.</v>

3132
02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it conspiracy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a thought.</v>

3133
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have to be cold conspiracy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the word conspiracy is a</v>

3134
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:21.411
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy best at this through the</v>

3135
02:23:26.911 --> 02:23:30.060
<v Speaker 2>looking glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now conspiracy in itself is a</v>

3136
02:23:30.061 --> 02:23:32.070
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him.</v>

3137
02:23:32.071 --> 02:23:33.330
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking shut it all down.</v>

3138
02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3139
02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's definitely some real</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies,</v>

3140
02:23:39.930 --> 02:23:43.050
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's just an unnatural</v>

3141
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:47.040
<v Speaker 2>emphasis of our natural inclination to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit on people that are doing better</v>

3142
02:23:47.041 --> 02:23:49.020
<v Speaker 2>than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit on people that have something good</v>

3143
02:23:49.021 --> 02:23:51.150
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also when you're writing a story</v>

3144
02:23:51.151 --> 02:23:53.940
<v Speaker 2>about something w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much fun is it running a story</v>

3145
02:23:53.941 --> 02:23:58.890
<v Speaker 2>that's positive and how much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfying is it to unhappy people to</v>

3146
02:23:58.891 --> 02:24:02.070
<v Speaker 2>write a negative review about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much more exciting?</v>

3147
02:24:02.490 --> 02:24:05.700
<v Speaker 2>It's much more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people distort people's ideas</v>

3148
02:24:05.701 --> 02:24:09.450
<v Speaker 2>and really horrific ways because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old way because the old way you</v>

3149
02:24:09.451 --> 02:24:12.480
<v Speaker 2>could write a blog about something or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>article in a magazine or whatever about</v>

3150
02:24:12.481 --> 02:24:15.300
<v Speaker 2>someone and distort it in horrible ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they really didn't have any</v>

3151
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:18.450
<v Speaker 2>recourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that old way doesn't really work</v>

3152
02:24:18.451 --> 02:24:22.210
<v Speaker 2>anymore because it's direct access</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of media like this.</v>

3153
02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking that I would like to</v>

3154
02:24:24.601 --> 02:24:27.440
<v Speaker 2>start a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking you should definitely have</v>

3155
02:24:27.441 --> 02:24:30.510
<v Speaker 2>never done a podcast in my games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went in my country.</v>

3156
02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it anywhere you go.</v>

3157
02:24:32.370 --> 02:24:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3158
02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:36.780
<v Speaker 2>you can bring them whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have done them in Australia.</v>

3159
02:24:36.781 --> 02:24:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I've done them all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3160
02:24:37.781 --> 02:24:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you do it anywhere you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to have a phone.</v>

3161
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:42.330
<v Speaker 2>You do it into your iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3162
02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I just talk on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just talk on my phone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know it's on your phone,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your desire.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

3168
02:24:54.570 --> 02:24:57.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to have a guest you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

3169
02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:00.000
<v Speaker 2>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have a guest on if you want,</v>

3170
02:25:00.001 --> 02:25:02.310
<v Speaker 2>but like bill burrs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best podcasts in the world,</v>

3171
02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:04.680
<v Speaker 2>and Bill Burgess rants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

3172
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:07.620
<v Speaker 2>He rants for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll just sit down for a fucking hour</v>

3173
02:25:07.621 --> 02:25:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and a half and just go off about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

3174
02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And it's a stream of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it goes from football to his wife or</v>

3175
02:25:14.071 --> 02:25:17.490
<v Speaker 2>his fucking dog and baking and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet socks and he's tired of</v>

3176
02:25:17.610 --> 02:25:21.000
<v Speaker 2>construction workers and his driveway is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of shit and he just,</v>

3177
02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:22.850
<v Speaker 2>he'll go on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that too.</v>

3178
02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:25.390
<v Speaker 2>What main things you've learned from</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this?</v>

3179
02:25:25.391 --> 02:25:26.650
<v Speaker 2>What are the main things you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3180
02:25:26.651 --> 02:25:31.540
<v Speaker 2>This is how you do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that the rules,</v>

3181
02:25:31.541 --> 02:25:33.910
<v Speaker 2>the structures that you have learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3182
02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:35.270
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost.</v>

3183
02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I've learned so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned how other people perceive</v>

3184
02:25:40.001 --> 02:25:41.950
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned how I perceive other</v>

3185
02:25:41.951 --> 02:25:43.390
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned what my,</v>

3186
02:25:43.391 --> 02:25:45.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe my own problems and perception</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

3187
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3188
02:25:46.810 --> 02:25:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I've sort of tried to examine as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>things as possible.</v>

3189
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a master course in human</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction for me.</v>

3190
02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:55.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had 800 plus podcasts where</v>

3191
02:25:55.461 --> 02:25:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm interacting with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>

3192
02:25:58.121 --> 02:26:02.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating way to understand how</v>

3193
02:26:02.981 --> 02:26:07.981
<v Speaker 2>people think and to just chunk data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just chunk data about how people react</v>

3194
02:26:08.021 --> 02:26:11.800
<v Speaker 2>and talk and communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has it evolved from your original</v>

3195
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:15.130
<v Speaker 2>vision of doing a hook costing to how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now?</v>

3196
02:26:15.131 --> 02:26:18.580
<v Speaker 2>If you become more free with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less formulated?</v>

3197
02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was ever formulated,</v>

3198
02:26:20.861 --> 02:26:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but I've been better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just better at it.</v>

3199
02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:24.880
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the podcast started out,</v>

3200
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to figure out a way to do</v>

3201
02:26:27.521 --> 02:26:32.521
<v Speaker 2>something like something free where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just doing it with a camera or</v>

3202
02:26:33.701 --> 02:26:36.700
<v Speaker 2>you're responding to twitter questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to trying to out.</v>

3203
02:26:36.730 --> 02:26:40.450
<v Speaker 2>My thought was I've done a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio shows everywhere I go everywhere I</v>

3204
02:26:40.451 --> 02:26:41.860
<v Speaker 2>go and promote a comedy gig.</v>

3205
02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I do a morning show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great time.</v>

3206
02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to do one of those,</v>

3207
02:26:45.010 --> 02:26:46.990
<v Speaker 2>but that was so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love a radio show,</v>

3208
02:26:46.991 --> 02:26:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want a boss and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how the fuck can I</v>

3209
02:26:49.721 --> 02:26:52.330
<v Speaker 2>do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then doing Jim's show and doing the</v>

3210
02:26:52.331 --> 02:26:53.870
<v Speaker 2>opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Show opiod,</v>

3211
02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:56.650
<v Speaker 2>not it was the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the greatest because when they</v>

3212
02:26:56.651 --> 02:26:58.970
<v Speaker 2>were together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their show was a hang on.</v>

3213
02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:01.660
<v Speaker 2>If I could call Jim and I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3214
02:27:01.661 --> 02:27:03.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing opie and Anthony tomorrow</v>

3215
02:27:03.191 --> 02:27:03.641
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3216
02:27:03.641 --> 02:27:04.660
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it too.</v>

3217
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:05.371
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3218
02:27:05.371 --> 02:27:07.660
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we would see each other and get a</v>

3219
02:27:07.661 --> 02:27:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Bagel in the morning and high five and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up there and just laugh.</v>

3220
02:27:11.770 --> 02:27:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're able to do your own thing.</v>

3221
02:27:13.661 --> 02:27:15.130
<v Speaker 2>No one's trying to out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3222
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.520
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3223
02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That place taught me everything.</v>

3224
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping it was a hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the original Shang.</v>

3225
02:27:22.301 --> 02:27:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3226
02:27:23.730 --> 02:27:26.260
<v Speaker 2>it was the only radio show that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hang where you go in there and</v>

3227
02:27:26.261 --> 02:27:29.350
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Jim started doing his show,</v>

3228
02:27:29.351 --> 02:27:31.300
<v Speaker 2>which is very similar when I could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

3229
02:27:31.301 --> 02:27:32.560
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your show was a hang too.</v>

3230
02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It was a hand because I wanted that</v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

3231
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I loved going into Opie and Anthony and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting down and they're like,</v>

3232
02:27:38.711 --> 02:27:41.080
<v Speaker 2>what's up night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to be on.</v>

3233
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

3234
02:27:41.621 --> 02:27:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Like if you did bits come in and do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

3235
02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:46.540
<v Speaker 2>a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do a bit.</v>

3236
02:27:46.541 --> 02:27:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:52.580
<v Speaker 2>We want to know that that goes probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you went through to get where you</v>

3238
02:27:52.581 --> 02:27:55.810
<v Speaker 2>can say Russell authenticity about</v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

3239
02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:59.130
<v Speaker 2>trying to be in normal and being who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

3240
02:27:59.190 --> 02:28:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No imposing.</v>

3241
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Like come in and write up in five</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

3242
02:28:02.201 --> 02:28:05.120
<v Speaker 2>We got lucky with all of those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like having a boss and having structure</v>

3243
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and having that commercial interests</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly and you're an intelligent</v>

3244
02:28:10.361 --> 02:28:14.800
<v Speaker 2>person and people like listening to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real you and you don't get that</v>

3245
02:28:14.801 --> 02:28:18.010
<v Speaker 2>opportunity a whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave you that opportunity like,</v>

3246
02:28:18.011 --> 02:28:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a whole different.</v>

3247
02:28:19.421 --> 02:28:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I never knew this existed from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

3248
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this person's calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people hate my book.</v>

3249
02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.900
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like what he's like when he talks</v>

3250
02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that opens up,</v>

3251
02:28:32.390 --> 02:28:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it opens up the opportunity for all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3252
02:28:34.370 --> 02:28:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to say it was like a</v>

3253
02:28:36.981 --> 02:28:38.240
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty.</v>

3254
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:41.330
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty intense and I can see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean.</v>

3255
02:28:41.331 --> 02:28:45.300
<v Speaker 2>That that was sort of pop the transition</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how it actually works as well.</v>

3256
02:28:45.330 --> 02:28:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Like someone that someone that was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>pi.</v>

3257
02:28:49.530 --> 02:28:52.730
<v Speaker 2>He is absolutely the original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's absolutely,</v>

3258
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.130
<v Speaker 2>he's the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the most important guy in the</v>

3259
02:28:55.131 --> 02:28:59.600
<v Speaker 2>history of radio because he was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first guy that got arrested or a find</v>

3260
02:28:59.601 --> 02:29:02.930
<v Speaker 2>rather he got in some serious legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems because of the things that he</v>

3261
02:29:02.931 --> 02:29:06.580
<v Speaker 2>was saying on the air and kept doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was the original guy,</v>

3262
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:11.630
<v Speaker 2>just be blatantly honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was the first real reality show.</v>

3263
02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:15.350
<v Speaker 2>He'd call his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>

3264
02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh the guys working on the light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me talk to him.</v>

3265
02:29:17.930 --> 02:29:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Let me talk to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said like he's getting took,</v>

3266
02:29:19.890 --> 02:29:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did all this on regular radio,</v>

3267
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:26.060
<v Speaker 2>right when no one was doing that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was playing music.</v>

3268
02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:27.910
<v Speaker 2>So they were all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have like these little things</v>

3269
02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:30.710
<v Speaker 2>they would do and then they would play a</v>
<v Speaker 2>song and he had to do that in the</v>

3270
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:31.290
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

3271
02:29:31.290 --> 02:29:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would make his humor in between the</v>

3272
02:29:33.501 --> 02:29:35.780
<v Speaker 2>songs but eventually was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck these songs,</v>

3273
02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna I'm just going to be me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have a good time and talk shit.</v>

3274
02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:42.290
<v Speaker 2>And he figured out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was more rigid and structured.</v>

3275
02:29:42.470 --> 02:29:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Whereas opie and Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they would have guests on,</v>

3276
02:29:44.691 --> 02:29:47.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like brewer and I would be on maybe</v>

3277
02:29:47.481 --> 02:29:50.400
<v Speaker 2>burwood beyond or some other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>would beyond and we'd all beyond</v>

3278
02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:54.260
<v Speaker 2>together and would just go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd hang out and it was literally like,</v>

3279
02:29:54.261 --> 02:29:56.410
<v Speaker 2>the time would fly so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>

3280
02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:59.150
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a matter of not having enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>

3281
02:29:59.151 --> 02:30:01.370
<v Speaker 2>It was like too much content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough time.</v>

3282
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:04.470
<v Speaker 2>And Howard didn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like they wouldn't.</v>

3283
02:30:04.850 --> 02:30:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Howard didn't have that opportunity at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time or he just came out in a</v>

3284
02:30:08.671 --> 02:30:12.200
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once he went to the Internet,</v>

3285
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that blew up to another hole at</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew him up to and everyone said,</v>

3286
02:30:17.721 --> 02:30:18.150
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3287
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.650
<v Speaker 2>where's he now?</v>

3288
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I think he's 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred times bigger and more powerful.</v>

3289
02:30:22.191 --> 02:30:25.100
<v Speaker 2>And it became a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He evolved in terms of content or do you</v>

3290
02:30:25.101 --> 02:30:27.020
<v Speaker 2>mean every for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

3291
02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:29.240
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conversation thought.</v>

3292
02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as things get on the Internet,</v>

3293
02:30:31.161 --> 02:30:34.610
<v Speaker 2>then they can spread freely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the merit of the conversation.</v>

3294
02:30:34.611 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation?</v>

3295
02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Then it just gets passed around and as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as things just get passed around</v>

3296
02:30:39.861 --> 02:30:41.040
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then someone calls him,</v>

3297
02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to hear Jim Brewer who was on</v>

3298
02:30:43.161 --> 02:30:44.360

<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3299
02:30:44.361 --> 02:30:45.290

<v Speaker 2>And Bam.</v>

3301
02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:50.150

<v Speaker 2>is someone can tell me,</v>

3302
02:30:50.330 --> 02:30:51.920
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3307
02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>seconds you're in your car and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing it and it's free.</v>

<v Speaker 2>first ones where he wasn't even ready.</v>

3311
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:11.450
<v Speaker 2>He know what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta listen where it went from here</v>

3312
02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 2>to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3313
02:31:12.810 --> 02:31:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Once they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in.</v>

3314
02:31:14.810 --> 02:31:16.190
<v Speaker 2>They love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know you.</v>

3315
02:31:16.191 --> 02:31:20.670
<v Speaker 2>They feel like they're all exposed will</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you add that you liked were hard or</v>

3316
02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:21.290
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3317
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:22.770
<v Speaker 2>like see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've not got bosses or</v>

3318
02:31:22.771 --> 02:31:24.390
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there ever times you are going to.</v>

3319
02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:27.040
<v Speaker 2>We should never read that guy on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a mistake.</v>

3320
02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:30.090
<v Speaker 2>A couple minor ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing serious.</v>

3321
02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Just weird conversations where you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda learn better about how to handle</v>

3322
02:31:35.401 --> 02:31:36.234
<v Speaker 2>those moments.</v>

3323
02:31:36.450 --> 02:31:37.283
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3324
02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:39.900
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you're learning on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

3325
02:31:39.930 --> 02:31:41.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I never did a radio show</v>

3326
02:31:41.911 --> 02:31:46.320
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never spoke open as a form of</v>

3327
02:31:46.321 --> 02:31:47.880
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Arrogant.</v>

3328
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Not just to think that you should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to speak.</v>

3329
02:31:50.041 --> 02:31:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course everyone should be able to</v>

3330
02:31:51.051 --> 02:31:52.860
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you think that your</v>

3331
02:31:52.861 --> 02:31:56.050
<v Speaker 2>words are so interesting that other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna listen to them and</v>

3332
02:31:56.051 --> 02:31:58.140
<v Speaker 2>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of talking to themselves,</v>

3333
02:31:58.141 --> 02:32:00.390
<v Speaker 2>they can just listen to your talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck would they do that?</v>

3334
02:32:00.391 --> 02:32:01.960
<v Speaker 2>They're not even there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3335
02:32:01.961 --> 02:32:04.820
<v Speaker 2>like it's not like someone's right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you and you're talking to me</v>

3336
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:06.290
<v Speaker 2>trying to be polite so you'll let them</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

3337
02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:07.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3338
02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:09.840
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're downloading their shit so you can</v>

3339
02:32:09.841 --> 02:32:12.030
<v Speaker 2>listen to them talk and then you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna talk while they're talking.</v>

3340
02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

3341
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:13.880
<v Speaker 2>This is madness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3342
02:32:14.010 --> 02:32:17.700
<v Speaker 2>So in learning how to broad broadcast in</v>
<v Speaker 2>air quotes,</v>

3343
02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:20.550
<v Speaker 2>learning how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of learning by,</v>

3344
02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:23.850
<v Speaker 2>by feedback and also by listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and listening to other people's</v>

3345
02:32:23.851 --> 02:32:26.310
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see other things that great on</v>

3346
02:32:26.311 --> 02:32:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you about what other people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like talking over people.</v>

3347
02:32:30.481 --> 02:32:31.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all do it,</v>

3348
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:34.650
<v Speaker 2>which we all shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all have an idea that we want to</v>

3349
02:32:34.651 --> 02:32:36.930
<v Speaker 2>get out and we don't know when to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's hard to figure out because</v>

3350
02:32:36.931 --> 02:32:39.180
<v Speaker 2>we're all free ball and when to jump in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when not to.</v>

3351
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people don't listen to the things</v>

3352
02:32:42.001 --> 02:32:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that other people say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just wait for their turn to talk.</v>

3353
02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:47.190
<v Speaker 2>That is a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant issue because then you</v>

3354
02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:49.200
<v Speaker 2>ask them about what you just said and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3355
02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:50.034
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't listening.</v>

3356
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Like how can you not be listening when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking like this is okay.</v>

3357
02:32:53.441 --> 02:32:54.750
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then now we're not really having a</v>

3358
02:32:54.751 --> 02:32:57.840
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just exchanging rants,</v>

3359
02:32:58.040 --> 02:33:00.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm waiting for you to get your</v>

3360
02:33:00.541 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 2>completely nonsequitor rant in and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to impress people with your</v>

3361
02:33:05.341 --> 02:33:07.770
<v Speaker 2>quotes and home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know about this guy or that</v>

3362
02:33:07.771 --> 02:33:09.780
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real common thing is like</v>

3363
02:33:09.781 --> 02:33:14.781
<v Speaker 2>using it as an ego springboard instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of looking at it in the podcast is</v>

3364
02:33:14.821 --> 02:33:19.821
<v Speaker 2>really essentially a piece of art in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandiose term,</v>

3365
02:33:19.921 --> 02:33:22.200
<v Speaker 2>but you're creating something and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to create it.</v>

3366
02:33:22.201 --> 02:33:25.770
<v Speaker 2>The best way you can and you could fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up by being loud and stupid and</v>

3367
02:33:25.771 --> 02:33:28.730
<v Speaker 2>saying a bunch of dumb shit that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel good to anybody here.</v>

3368
02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say some cool shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they listen to this podcast,</v>

3369
02:33:32.581 --> 02:33:33.301
<v Speaker 2>after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

3370
02:33:33.301 --> 02:33:36.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck at Russell brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said something that's going to change</v>

3371
02:33:36.241 --> 02:33:39.030
<v Speaker 2>the way I look at the rest of my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and that's,</v>

3372
02:33:39.170 --> 02:33:40.410
<v Speaker 2>that's possible.</v>

3373
02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:44.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the bases entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do you think then this is entirely</v>

3374
02:33:44.251 --> 02:33:49.050
<v Speaker 2>authentic self that you don't like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuff that you withhold when you're in</v>

3375
02:33:49.051 --> 02:33:51.030
<v Speaker 2>this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've come from more conventional</v>

3376
02:33:51.031 --> 02:33:54.720
<v Speaker 2>media and information about loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3377
02:33:54.810 --> 02:33:55.531
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3378
02:33:55.531 --> 02:33:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hurt any.</v>

3379
02:33:57.871 --> 02:34:01.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody of anybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings get hurt or you know,</v>

3380
02:34:01.351 --> 02:34:05.610
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've made those mistakes smart just</v>

3381
02:34:07.100 --> 02:34:09.140
<v Speaker 2>because it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny team there.</v>

3382
02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not their choice,</v>

3383
02:34:11.010 --> 02:34:11.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to,</v>

3384
02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:14.660
<v Speaker 2>you have to withhold certain things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3385
02:34:14.860 --> 02:34:16.680
<v Speaker 2>some people just want to be private</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3386
02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to have any part of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking parade.</v>

3387
02:34:18.701 --> 02:34:21.880
<v Speaker 2>You weirdo out there talking to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world everyday.</v>

3388
02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Have you had any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had any negative consequences</v>

3389
02:34:26.561 --> 02:34:28.560
<v Speaker 2>as a result of it?</v>

3390
02:34:28.590 --> 02:34:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Because you have to work in other</v>
<v Speaker 2>industries and all of that.</v>

3391
02:34:30.701 --> 02:34:34.360
<v Speaker 2>It's only positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck,</v>

3392
02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:38.110
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have fuck you money,</v>

3393
02:34:38.111 --> 02:34:40.300
<v Speaker 2>you don't say fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wasting fuck you money.</v>

3394
02:34:40.810 --> 02:34:44.380
<v Speaker 2>So if I have some real thoughts and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't express them because I'm worried</v>

3395
02:34:44.381 --> 02:34:47.080
<v Speaker 2>about job opportunities like I'm already</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prison,</v>

3396
02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:50.410
<v Speaker 2>whether I like it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's something important that I</v>

3397
02:34:50.411 --> 02:34:53.460
<v Speaker 2>have to say and then the jobs that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do get or the employment opportunities</v>

3398
02:34:53.461 --> 02:34:56.500
<v Speaker 2>that you do get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be looking for your authentic</v>

3399
02:34:56.501 --> 02:35:00.460
<v Speaker 2>self and let's say it's some like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same sort of situation with some crazy</v>

3400
02:35:00.461 --> 02:35:02.330
<v Speaker 2>woman likes to take some guy and change</v>
<v Speaker 2>them all.</v>

3401
02:35:02.350 --> 02:35:04.940
<v Speaker 2>He's a fixer upper like they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to grab you and go,</v>

3402
02:35:04.970 --> 02:35:07.380
<v Speaker 2>this Russell brand's talking a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy revolution.</v>

3403
02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Once we get them in the network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a nice suit.</v>

3404
02:35:11.650 --> 02:35:14.110
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna be the best talk show host</v>

3405
02:35:14.111 --> 02:35:16.030
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the future Jimmy Fallon.</v>

3406
02:35:16.270 --> 02:35:18.170
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3407
02:35:18.210 --> 02:35:20.200
<v Speaker 2>If it comes to entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your number.</v>

3408
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:22.660
<v Speaker 2>So does he matter what you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe it or not.</v>

3409
02:35:22.661 --> 02:35:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Believe it and you get these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

3410
02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should put him in this movie</v>

3411
02:35:26.561 --> 02:35:31.561
<v Speaker 2>because he's worth this much and think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of will make this much this many people</v>

3412
02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:35.920
<v Speaker 2>automatically buy tickets because his</v>
<v Speaker 2>following is interview.</v>

3413
02:35:35.970 --> 02:35:39.640
<v Speaker 2>You almost start controlling your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny that happened as a result.</v>

3414
02:35:40.610 --> 02:35:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Things happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awful.</v>

3415
02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what do you mean not having someone</v>

3416
02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:50.760
<v Speaker 2>gone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we put fucking Joe Rogan in</v>

3417
02:35:50.761 --> 02:35:53.500
<v Speaker 2>this action movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got fucking massive,</v>

3418
02:35:54.130 --> 02:35:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3419
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in doing less things.</v>

3420
02:35:58.570 --> 02:36:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do any movies.</v>

3421
02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I like doing stuff that has nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with work.</v>

3422
02:36:04.481 --> 02:36:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I like doing yoga and I like doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>archery.</v>

3423
02:36:06.761 --> 02:36:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I like writing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like performing standup.</v>

3424
02:36:09.810 --> 02:36:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I liked to on podcasts I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like just doing stuff.</v>

3425
02:36:13.211 --> 02:36:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do someone else's stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3426
02:36:15.881 --> 02:36:19.540
<v Speaker 2>some movie came along and it was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and for whatever reason it</v>

3427
02:36:19.541 --> 02:36:21.220
<v Speaker 2>was a short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to work,</v>

3428
02:36:21.250 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I would consider it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've passed on a lot of stuff.</v>

3429
02:36:23.651 --> 02:36:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have any interest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's taking control of your life through</v>

3430
02:36:26.691 --> 02:36:27.310
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3431
02:36:27.310 --> 02:36:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Well I've been doing what I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do instead of when you know,</v>

3432
02:36:31.450 --> 02:36:36.450
<v Speaker 2>and Jim and I were in a pilot for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>very first TV show that I did in 1993</v>

3433
02:36:37.300 --> 02:36:39.640
<v Speaker 2>and we've been friends for longer before</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3434
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:40.630
<v Speaker 2>way long before that.</v>

3435
02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:45.440
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come here and you think I've now I'm</v>

3436
02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:47.620
<v Speaker 2>going to do this project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

3437
02:36:47.621 --> 02:36:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a TV show and you and then you</v>

3438
02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:51.840
<v Speaker 2>get on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show you up.</v>

3439
02:36:51.860 --> 02:36:53.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like this that much.</v>

3440
02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I liked doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>

3441
02:36:55.061 --> 02:36:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing this because they keep</v>

3442
02:36:57.191 --> 02:36:58.120
<v Speaker 2>coming to you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3443
02:36:58.121 --> 02:37:00.610
<v Speaker 2>we've got a game show and they're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat animal dicks and you're going to</v>

3444
02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.630
<v Speaker 2>shoot them out of a rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you know?</v>

3445
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>

3446
02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:04.780
<v Speaker 2>it's on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>

3447
02:37:04.810 --> 02:37:07.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm here for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the money is real fucking good.</v>

3448
02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:08.440
<v Speaker 2>You do it after a while and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3449
02:37:08.441 --> 02:37:10.180
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I enjoy doing.</v>

3450
02:37:10.181 --> 02:37:12.130
<v Speaker 2>What do I actually enjoy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3451
02:37:12.131 --> 02:37:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to do the things I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3452
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:15.680
<v Speaker 2>What I enjoy doing.</v>

3453
02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I like doing podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like doing standup.</v>

3454
02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:21.590
<v Speaker 2>I like and doing all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>extracurricular things that I do,</v>

3455
02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:25.430
<v Speaker 2>the things that I do that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in life and then I don't want</v>

3456
02:37:25.431 --> 02:37:28.940
<v Speaker 2>to differentiate between interests that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do for financial gain or interest to</v>

3457
02:37:28.941 --> 02:37:32.960
<v Speaker 2>it that I do for mental exercises or for</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual growth or whatever.</v>

3458
02:37:32.961 --> 02:37:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I just want to do things that I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3459
02:37:35.090 --> 02:37:36.320
<v Speaker 2>That's really important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3460
02:37:36.321 --> 02:37:40.490
<v Speaker 2>You guys sound fair enough and so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't have that kind of freedom</v>

3461
02:37:40.491 --> 02:37:42.500
<v Speaker 2>creatively on any level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The freedom of it.</v>

3462
02:37:42.501 --> 02:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I just want the that should be part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people's experience of life.</v>

3463
02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me like.</v>

3464
02:37:50.481 --> 02:37:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It's really beautiful to hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you're led by his joy because</v>

3465
02:37:53.661 --> 02:37:56.120
<v Speaker 2>that is another Joseph Campbell thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow your bliss.</v>

3466
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Find the thing that you're connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>and follow it,</v>

3467
02:37:58.460 --> 02:38:00.330
<v Speaker 2>and when I think of how many times in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life I've got,</v>

3468
02:38:00.350 --> 02:38:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I've lived out other people's ideas as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

3469
02:38:03.621 --> 02:38:03.951
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3470
02:38:03.951 --> 02:38:04.590
<v Speaker 2>right now this is.</v>

3471
02:38:04.590 --> 02:38:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm.</v>

3472
02:38:06.250 --> 02:38:07.490
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like again,</v>

3473
02:38:07.491 --> 02:38:09.680
<v Speaker 2>like Bill Hicks says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just look at my money.</v>

3474
02:38:09.681 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 2>This has to be real to be real because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bombarded with it and then you</v>

3475
02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:15.440
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3476
02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:18.830
<v Speaker 2>so if you are lucky enough to get to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>position where you can just do things</v>

3477
02:38:18.831 --> 02:38:20.240
<v Speaker 2>that you enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you.</v>

3478
02:38:20.241 --> 02:38:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that idea that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>applied to your own creative lives can</v>

3479
02:38:24.381 --> 02:38:28.490
<v Speaker 2>be applied?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're fucking living a normal life</v>

3480
02:38:28.491 --> 02:38:30.890
<v Speaker 2>and you're trapped in a job that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking like,</v>

3481
02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:33.080
<v Speaker 2>how do you think you'd get out of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation?</v>

3482
02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:37.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes small baby steps to move out,</v>

3483
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to move towards that</v>

3484
02:38:39.981 --> 02:38:42.080
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have an absolute game plan</v>

3485
02:38:42.081 --> 02:38:44.390
<v Speaker 2>and you have to have an actual thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you enjoy doing.</v>

3486
02:38:44.810 --> 02:38:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you're some guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in some job but you know,</v>

3487
02:38:47.850 --> 02:38:48.900
<v Speaker 2>to bring up something we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

3488
02:38:48.901 --> 02:38:51.980
<v Speaker 2>what you enjoy making homemade knives</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think you're like,</v>

3489
02:38:51.981 --> 02:38:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to just be able to make</v>

3490
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:57.210
<v Speaker 2>arts and crafts to be able to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that people bond,</v>

3491
02:38:57.211 --> 02:39:01.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe pottery or something along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines that really feel like spiritually</v>

3492
02:39:01.821 --> 02:39:06.190
<v Speaker 2>and creatively satisfying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be able to express myself in it,</v>

3493
02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.800
<v Speaker 2>an art form that to do that for a living</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be amazing.</v>

3494
02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:13.190
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of people that start</v>
<v Speaker 2>off in regular jobs and they figure out</v>

3495
02:39:13.191 --> 02:39:17.000
<v Speaker 2>a way to get to that place and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy and people will fucking bitch and</v>

3496
02:39:17.001 --> 02:39:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Moan at you and tell you how not easy it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3497
02:39:19.071 --> 02:39:21.230
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it's making it seem like</v>

3498
02:39:21.231 --> 02:39:22.520
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>

3499
02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of us have problems and we got</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortgages and children and I need a</v>

3500
02:39:26.061 --> 02:39:30.290
<v Speaker 2>healthcare packaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has resistance.</v>

3501
02:39:30.291 --> 02:39:32.900
<v Speaker 2>There's always resistance to anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're trying to achieve in life</v>

3502
02:39:32.901 --> 02:39:35.030
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's set up might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

3503
02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's needs and requirements might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be different.</v>

3504
02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:42.680
<v Speaker 2>They're all different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you find whatever the fuck it is</v>

3505
02:39:42.770 --> 02:39:44.660
<v Speaker 2>that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you,</v>

3506
02:39:44.661 --> 02:39:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you have some time in your day that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can dedicate towards making that a</v>

3507
02:39:48.951 --> 02:39:51.470
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of making that time a</v>

3508
02:39:51.471 --> 02:39:55.610
<v Speaker 2>priority to try to change your current</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of existence.</v>

3509
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:57.050
<v Speaker 2>How do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3510
02:39:57.051 --> 02:40:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your existence is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you anyway because what the</v>

3511
02:40:00.801 --> 02:40:03.860
<v Speaker 2>way I do things and the way you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>things is fucking totally different.</v>

3512
02:40:03.861 --> 02:40:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's going to do things different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kamikaze person.</v>

3513
02:40:06.681 --> 02:40:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's fucking cut ties,</v>

3514
02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Polish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot,</v>

3515
02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:10.213
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>

3516
02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:11.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get outta here.</v>

3517
02:40:11.691 --> 02:40:12.441
<v Speaker 2>Let's quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3518
02:40:12.441 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've always like that.</v>

3519
02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I've always been the burn the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>house down.</v>

3520
02:40:15.970 --> 02:40:17.280
<v Speaker 2>You got to make another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3521
02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:20.430
<v Speaker 2>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thought has been just abandoned ship.</v>

3522
02:40:20.431 --> 02:40:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's get Outta here and find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking new thing,</v>

3523
02:40:23.371 --> 02:40:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do that when you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and children and now luckily for me</v>

3524
02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.470
<v Speaker 2>when I was young and taking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances and moving towards a career and</v>

3525
02:40:31.471 --> 02:40:34.790
<v Speaker 2>doing something I actually wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anybody else that I had</v>

3526
02:40:34.810 --> 02:40:36.630
<v Speaker 2>that counted on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you do,</v>

3527
02:40:36.631 --> 02:40:39.900
<v Speaker 2>it becomes much more difficult but not</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurmountable.</v>

3528
02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:43.140
<v Speaker 2>It didn't completely dependent upon what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is you're trying to achieve.</v>

3529
02:40:43.141 --> 02:40:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I like that we can start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3530
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Well going to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3531
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:47.543
<v Speaker 2>sort of</v>

3532
02:40:48.270 --> 02:40:50.890
<v Speaker 3>how do you bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You aren't going to,</v>

3533
02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:52.410
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing to Tom Cruise,</v>

3534
02:40:52.411 --> 02:40:56.570
<v Speaker 3>that time of being born with that drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being born with that knowledge of I'm</v>

3535
02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.580
<v Speaker 3>going to do this because I identify with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that crash and burn thing and it's been</v>

3536
02:40:59.581 --> 02:41:01.560
<v Speaker 3>problematic in my life with</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships and stuff.</v>

3537
02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I've got a survival instinct in me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3538
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:06.390
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>

3539
02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's good.</v>

3540
02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:13.230
<v Speaker 2>How many people fucking stay and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>tortured</v>

3541
02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:17.870
<v Speaker 2>sophie when that hard tech comes finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going away from this con.</v>

3542
02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope your head,</v>

3543
02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:26.010
<v Speaker 2>but if see my fingers,</v>

3544
02:41:26.290 --> 02:41:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I would like more people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it will be like Jesus for more</v>

3545
02:41:30.381 --> 02:41:33.950
<v Speaker 3>people to have that opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it makes me sad so that people will</v>

3546
02:41:33.951 --> 02:41:35.480
<v Speaker 3>be listening to this thinking I fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>won.</v>

3547
02:41:35.481 --> 02:41:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Now I want to make my fucking art and</v>
<v Speaker 3>craft knives.</v>

3548
02:41:37.851 --> 02:41:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

3549
02:41:38.931 --> 02:41:40.700
<v Speaker 3>if you've not got place for that in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

3550
02:41:40.701 --> 02:41:42.170
<v Speaker 3>then you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were saying when you were in</v>

3551
02:41:42.171 --> 02:41:44.520
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have your fucking fucked anyway and</v>

3552
02:41:44.521 --> 02:41:47.550
<v Speaker 3>let you know and there are certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic changes that could be bought</v>

3553
02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.120
<v Speaker 3>back that would mean that more people</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have that opportunity.</v>

3554
02:41:50.121 --> 02:41:51.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing that makes me</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad.</v>

3555
02:41:51.271 --> 02:41:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Systemic changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3556
02:41:52.371 --> 02:41:53.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

3557
02:41:53.081 --> 02:41:57.530
<v Speaker 3>But if we didn't have a culture that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely dominated by one economic idea,</v>

3558
02:41:57.710 --> 02:42:00.170
<v Speaker 3>that more people would be able to sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>around making art and crafts,</v>

3559
02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:02.280
<v Speaker 3>not the finger of the things that keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up again and again.</v>

3560
02:42:02.290 --> 02:42:04.310
<v Speaker 3>This conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people should live in small tribes.</v>

3561
02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3562
02:42:04.700 --> 02:42:07.040
<v Speaker 3>So why the fuck are we not trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit now?</v>

3563
02:42:07.041 --> 02:42:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Why are we not going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know why we don't go in,</v>

3564
02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:11.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try another word for tribes.</v>

3565
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Soviet and people did ever go</v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly,</v>

3566
02:42:15.111 --> 02:42:16.610
<v Speaker 3>terribly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying,</v>

3567
02:42:16.611 --> 02:42:18.890
<v Speaker 3>they start doing these kind of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3568
02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:20.360
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'd be like,</v>

3569
02:42:20.361 --> 02:42:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3570
02:42:21.570 --> 02:42:24.200
<v Speaker 3>that's the template.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the next level of this is like,</v>

3571
02:42:24.201 --> 02:42:26.150
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's try and work on that.</v>

3572
02:42:26.151 --> 02:42:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Then they try and bring some of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas like you have as an individual,</v>

3573
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:34.310
<v Speaker 3>like can this be collectivized?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can this be brought forward so that more</v>

3574
02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:35.300
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3575
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:37.340
<v Speaker 3>do you take that leap of faith that fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

3576
02:42:37.341 --> 02:42:39.890
<v Speaker 3>if we do get hundred 50 people together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's going to be problems,</v>

3577
02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:41.510
<v Speaker 3>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and fucking challenges.</v>

3578
02:42:41.511 --> 02:42:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Now we're not competing with perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We compete with a defunct system that's</v>

3579
02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:48.260
<v Speaker 3>really causing a great deal of</v>
<v Speaker 3>negativity and problems.</v>

3580
02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:51.590
<v Speaker 3>What would happen if people did start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try and create alternatives are to what</v>

3581
02:42:51.591 --> 02:42:53.000
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be killed.</v>

3582
02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:54.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

3583
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:57.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No code right out.</v>

3584
02:42:57.751 --> 02:42:59.050
<v Speaker 3>If you end right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're setting up a system,</v>

3585
02:42:59.070 --> 02:43:01.850
<v Speaker 3>hundred 50 people where this is our new</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast experiment.</v>

3586
02:43:01.851 --> 02:43:03.260
<v Speaker 3>We're setting up a utopia.</v>

3587
02:43:03.470 --> 02:43:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Only when you become a threat and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to become a threat financially or</v>

3588
02:43:07.381 --> 02:43:10.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to become a threat militarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about these fucking</v>

3589
02:43:10.381 --> 02:43:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Waco type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always gathered guns did fuck</v>

3590
02:43:14.471 --> 02:43:15.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody's wives and they have a</v>

3591
02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:19.890
<v Speaker 4>pile of ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you become a threat,</v>

3592
02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:22.320
<v Speaker 4>David.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the stockpile of guns in the</v>

3593
02:43:22.321 --> 02:43:23.670
<v Speaker 4>fucking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's saying,</v>

3594
02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:25.470
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just focused on Jesus,</v>

3595
02:43:25.770 --> 02:43:27.930
<v Speaker 4>so Jesus rose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3596
02:43:28.050 --> 02:43:30.960
<v Speaker 4>Once you become a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the only way violence is the</v>

3597
02:43:30.961 --> 02:43:35.961
<v Speaker 4>only real threat</v>
<v Speaker 4>to expound on those ideas and spread</v>

3598
02:43:36.811 --> 02:43:39.720
<v Speaker 4>those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's controversial,</v>

3599
02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:41.880
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think anybody looks at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

3600
02:43:41.881 --> 02:43:43.830
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This motherfucker is going to take money</v>

3601
02:43:43.831 --> 02:43:47.010
<v Speaker 4>out of my bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people were so engrossed in</v>

3602
02:43:47.011 --> 02:43:51.360
<v Speaker 4>their own life and their own progress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own path of conquering.</v>

3603
02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they think about it that</v>
<v Speaker 4>way unless you crossed them and unless</v>

3604
02:43:55.021 --> 02:43:55.831
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you say,</v>

3605
02:43:55.831 --> 02:43:57.720
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit this Rupert Murdoch is</v>

3606
02:43:57.721 --> 02:44:00.270
<v Speaker 4>fucking up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I'm going to expose him and I'm</v>

3607
02:44:00.271 --> 02:44:02.370
<v Speaker 4>going to let the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you've created an issue.</v>

3608
02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Then you've gone into battle with a man</v>
<v Speaker 4>with unfathomable resources that tried.</v>

3609
02:44:08.530 --> 02:44:13.530
<v Speaker 4>That</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't work out.</v>

3610
02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Done</v>
<v Speaker 4>bloody sick of all this.</v>

3611
02:44:25.801 --> 02:44:27.180
<v Speaker 4>You see his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a hot wife.</v>

3612
02:44:27.210 --> 02:44:28.043
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CIS.</v>

3613
02:44:28.110 --> 02:44:30.120
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love how stereotypes just play</v>

3614
02:44:30.121 --> 02:44:32.820
<v Speaker 4>themselves out over and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump's wife.</v>

3615
02:44:32.821 --> 02:44:36.900
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I like to see the same thing</v>

3616
02:44:36.901 --> 02:44:38.610
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tapping.</v>

3617
02:44:38.611 --> 02:44:39.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to pee.</v>

3618
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No worries.</v>

3619
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3620
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:43.950
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3621
02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:47.550
<v Speaker 4>one of the things Mckenna said that</v>
<v Speaker 4>always resonated with me is that so many</v>

3622
02:44:47.551 --> 02:44:52.050
<v Speaker 4>people do the man's work for the man and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so worried about the</v>

3623
02:44:52.051 --> 02:44:55.170
<v Speaker 4>repercussions of being free or</v>
<v Speaker 4>expressing themselves or discussing</v>

3624
02:44:55.171 --> 02:44:57.840
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do the man's work for the man</v>

3625
02:44:58.830 --> 02:45:03.830
<v Speaker 2>by not by being scared and shackling</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and expressing yourself in a</v>

3626
02:45:04.651 --> 02:45:06.480
<v Speaker 2>way that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3627
02:45:06.481 --> 02:45:09.960
<v Speaker 2>like I think one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>most interesting about Mckenna's</v>

3628
02:45:09.961 --> 02:45:13.470
<v Speaker 2>lectures where he was in sort of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infancy of the Internet where you did a</v>

3629
02:45:13.471 --> 02:45:16.850
<v Speaker 2>lot of them is he expressed himself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3630
02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:20.220
<v Speaker 2>in a way that's kind of really similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like podcasts rants,</v>

3631
02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:23.760
<v Speaker 2>but way before their time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was doing it in front of these groups</v>

3632
02:45:23.761 --> 02:45:26.880
<v Speaker 2>of people and someone recorded it so he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have these meetings,</v>

3633
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people come to hear him speak and</v>

3634
02:45:29.761 --> 02:45:31.010
<v Speaker 2>he would have these meetings and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

3635
02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:34.290
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you would open up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room for questions and he would just</v>

3636
02:45:34.410 --> 02:45:38.520
<v Speaker 2>sort of rant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a consummate consumer of cannabis,</v>

3637
02:45:38.700 --> 02:45:42.690
<v Speaker 2>so he's high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's having these bizarre</v>

3638
02:45:42.691 --> 02:45:45.720
<v Speaker 2>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these rants rigs exploring these ideas</v>

3639
02:45:45.721 --> 02:45:48.990
<v Speaker 2>and he got better and better and better</v>
<v Speaker 2>at them all throughout these rants.</v>

3640
02:45:48.991 --> 02:45:52.860
<v Speaker 2>And when he's doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's essentially doing a podcast.</v>

3641
02:45:52.861 --> 02:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time to hear.</v>

3642
02:45:54.990 --> 02:45:57.600
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think of him just sort of a</v>

3643
02:45:57.660 --> 02:46:00.410
<v Speaker 4>modern secular profit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you sort of like,</v>

3644
02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:03.720
<v Speaker 4>if you've been into the comedy of Bill</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hicks and then you listen to terrence</v>

3645
02:46:03.721 --> 02:46:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see like,</v>

3646
02:46:04.530 --> 02:46:07.230
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's clearly influenced.</v>

3647
02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:10.400
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found out about Mckenna</v>

3648
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:15.020
<v Speaker 2>was to Hicks bit [inaudible] Hicks had</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bit about what he,</v>

3649
02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.700
<v Speaker 2>he said what Terence Mckenna would</v>
<v Speaker 2>describe as a heroic dose of mushrooms.</v>

3650
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:21.440
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is Terence Mckenna?</v>

3651
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:22.820
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3652
02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:28.000
<v Speaker 2>the nineties when I heard this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had seen Hicks live a couple times</v>

3653
02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:29.780
<v Speaker 2>for three or four times I guess in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>

3654
02:46:30.290 --> 02:46:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

3655
02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time I saw him,</v>

3656
02:46:33.890 --> 02:46:38.890
<v Speaker 2>it was an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time I saw him I went to see some</v>

3657
02:46:39.411 --> 02:46:44.411
<v Speaker 2>comedians that were like local Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and Hicks had come in from out of</v>

3658
02:46:45.921 --> 02:46:50.210
<v Speaker 2>town and I don't know if he was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be there the next night or what it</v>

3659
02:46:50.211 --> 02:46:51.560
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one was there to see him.</v>

3660
02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:56.740
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went up on stage and was just so</v>

3661
02:46:58.371 --> 02:47:00.950
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was doing this bit about tiffany</v>

3662
02:47:00.951 --> 02:47:02.210
<v Speaker 2>meeting Jimmy Hendrix.</v>

3663
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:03.590
<v Speaker 2>At the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3664
02:47:03.591 --> 02:47:05.710
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this music that they're promoting</v>

3665
02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:08.200
<v Speaker 2>is pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit music and,</v>

3666
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:12.260
<v Speaker 2>and he was at the comedy connection in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>

3667
02:47:12.261 --> 02:47:15.290
<v Speaker 2>I saw him think I saw him there first</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw him at Nick's and a couple</v>

3668
02:47:15.291 --> 02:47:17.030
<v Speaker 2>other places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

3669
02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:18.950
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing some new thing.</v>

3670
02:47:19.070 --> 02:47:19.551
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3671
02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:23.060
<v Speaker 2>this is a new kind of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like Sam Kinison,</v>

3672
02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:28.300
<v Speaker 2>but with much more of an emphasis on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realization that the patterns were all</v>

3673
02:47:29.721 --> 02:47:34.670
<v Speaker 2>falling into whether it's pop culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns or at these things are actually</v>

3674
02:47:34.671 --> 02:47:38.060
<v Speaker 2>detrimental that these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're foolish way to approach this</v>

3675
02:47:38.061 --> 02:47:40.010
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This world is incredibly complex and we</v>

3676
02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:42.410
<v Speaker 2>could all look at it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3677
02:47:42.411 --> 02:47:42.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3678
02:47:42.711 --> 02:47:46.540
<v Speaker 2>this is a new kind of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is he going down in the booth?</v>

3679
02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Really good and really bad.</v>

3680
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I saw him bomb horribly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bomb with grace that I've never</v>

3681
02:47:53.061 --> 02:47:54.550
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3682
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:57.080
<v Speaker 2>he bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't give a fuck about bombing.</v>

3683
02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.800
<v Speaker 2>I've never been able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3684
02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.790
<v Speaker 2>he bombed like a guy who almost knew the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

3685
02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:04.940
<v Speaker 2>knew he was going to have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an impact on the culture and knew that</v>

3686
02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:09.290
<v Speaker 2>this was just a footnote in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly impactful experience on the</v>

3687
02:48:09.291 --> 02:48:12.440
<v Speaker 2>art form of standup comedy and also knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>that eventually he'd find his own</v>

3688
02:48:12.441 --> 02:48:14.090
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he did not have at the time</v>

3689
02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:17.990
<v Speaker 2>because he was at a small comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick's comedy stop in Boston,</v>

3690
02:48:17.991 --> 02:48:20.650
<v Speaker 2>which is a couple hundred people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3691
02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:23.360
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy who went on before him</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a real hack,</v>

3692
02:48:23.630 --> 02:48:25.450
<v Speaker 2>nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just hacky,</v>

3693
02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.610
<v Speaker 2>hacky bullshit cop donut jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of shit.</v>

3694
02:48:28.990 --> 02:48:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Just everything you've already heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

3695
02:48:30.531 --> 02:48:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Nothing original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was killing,</v>

3696
02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:33.940
<v Speaker 2>killing with others.</v>

3697
02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Simple stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Hicks went on afterwards with</v>

3698
02:48:37.161 --> 02:48:40.190
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really bizarre interpretation of</v>

3699
02:48:40.191 --> 02:48:42.920
<v Speaker 2>modern civilization ever is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy.</v>

3700
02:48:43.310 --> 02:48:46.710
<v Speaker 2>And people were getting up and leaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>in droves and uh,</v>

3701
02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:50.300
<v Speaker 2>kept going through the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And me and Greg Fitzsimmons was there</v>

3702
02:48:50.301 --> 02:48:52.210
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of other comedians watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>them bomb.</v>

3703
02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:55.520
<v Speaker 2>We were laughing our asses off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was playing to the back of the</v>

3704
02:48:55.521 --> 02:48:57.380
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedians that were still there</v>

3705
02:48:57.381 --> 02:48:59.690
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're laughing hard and support,</v>

3706
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but people are getting up and giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunks and leaving at the end of the</v>

3707
02:49:03.650 --> 02:49:04.400
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3708
02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:09.240
<v Speaker 2>the show was whittled down from like 250</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to like 40 people in 15 or 20</v>

3709
02:49:09.241 --> 02:49:11.550
<v Speaker 2>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was all that was left and we were</v>

3710
02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:14.340
<v Speaker 2>howling laughing and he got offstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing happened.</v>

3711
02:49:14.730 --> 02:49:17.670
<v Speaker 2>He would not compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's an interesting guy.</v>

3712
02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:20.970
<v Speaker 3>So then go on and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he kicks you off into the</v>

3713
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.983
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna realm.</v>

3714
02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3715
02:49:22.570 --> 02:49:25.380
<v Speaker 2>he's one introduced me to Mckenna by</v>
<v Speaker 2>that joke.</v>

3716
02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Just by saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in hearing Hicks's references,</v>

3717
02:49:30.570 --> 02:49:31.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

3718
02:49:31.351 --> 02:49:34.200
<v Speaker 2>there was a few other guys that he sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of referenced their ideas.</v>

3719
02:49:34.201 --> 02:49:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Like Noam Chomsky was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that Hicks was</v>

3720
02:49:37.291 --> 02:49:41.910
<v Speaker 2>famous for saying was actually a chomsky</v>
<v Speaker 2>line was that about the Iraq war,</v>

3721
02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:45.030
<v Speaker 2>that it's only really in a war when two</v>
<v Speaker 2>armies are fighting,</v>

3722
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:46.111
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

3723
02:49:46.111 --> 02:49:47.450
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct Chmielowski quote.</v>

3724
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:49.650
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a hicks.</v>

3725
02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Well He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3726
02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:52.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

3727
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say it's plagiarism</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I bet if you asked him,</v>

3728
02:49:55.621 --> 02:49:57.000
<v Speaker 2>he would tell you it's a noam chomsky</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>

3729
02:49:57.001 --> 02:50:01.740
<v Speaker 2>but he was introducing that concept and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea to these people through the</v>

3730
02:50:02.010 --> 02:50:06.510
<v Speaker 2>world of standup comedy and then from</v>
<v Speaker 2>there he expanded on that with all of</v>

3731
02:50:06.511 --> 02:50:10.380
<v Speaker 2>his material about the Iraq war and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the new weapons that they're doing</v>

3732
02:50:10.381 --> 02:50:12.360
<v Speaker 2>and forming equipment.</v>

3733
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:15.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting that shame bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3734
02:50:15.381 --> 02:50:18.410
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you give him that because</v>

3735
02:50:18.470 --> 02:50:22.800
<v Speaker 3>it's so like the stuff he was doing was</v>
<v Speaker 3>so innovative and incredible and funny.</v>

3736
02:50:22.810 --> 02:50:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I sort of say you look to and say</v>

3737
02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:28.100
<v Speaker 3>you said Kennison or lenny bruce before</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3738
02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:31.810
<v Speaker 3>like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've experienced of them and I'm</v>

3739
02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:36.230
<v Speaker 3>not by any means and authority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did like Bill Hicks did make it more</v>

3740
02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:39.170
<v Speaker 3>densely humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not when you see him live on that,</v>

3741
02:50:39.171 --> 02:50:41.290
<v Speaker 3>but by the time he was recording</v>
<v Speaker 3>specialist and stuff.</v>

3742
02:50:41.291 --> 02:50:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also live A.</v>

3743
02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought that Bill Hicks was</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely refined and honed.</v>

3744
02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:48.110
<v Speaker 3>What was neat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3745
02:50:48.111 --> 02:50:50.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can see incarnations of the</v>

3746
02:50:50.631 --> 02:50:54.770
<v Speaker 3>same content many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times with him where he,</v>

3747
02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:57.770
<v Speaker 3>at least in the stuff that I saw because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only ever seen him know,</v>

3748
02:50:57.860 --> 02:50:59.540
<v Speaker 3>recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't going out.</v>

3749
02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:02.270
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't like doing lots of spontaneity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and lots of luck.</v>

3750
02:51:02.271 --> 02:51:06.680
<v Speaker 3>It was like they were like beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very articular pieces of.</v>

3751
02:51:06.810 --> 02:51:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes they didn't even make</v>

3752
02:51:09.151 --> 02:51:10.110
<v Speaker 2>people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3753
02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I watched it with his girl I was dating</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time in like 19 or 23 ish,</v>

3754
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:16.050
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

3755
02:51:16.051 --> 02:51:18.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not really funny,</v>

3756
02:51:18.241 --> 02:51:20.730
<v Speaker 2>but he's really fascinating to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

3757
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Like she didn't find like some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things he was saying were funny,</v>

3758
02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but I think that was also the revelation</v>
<v Speaker 2>show which you filmed in London,</v>

3759
02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:31.620
<v Speaker 2>which was one of those weird shows where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing an hbo special and you have</v>

3760
02:51:31.621 --> 02:51:36.621
<v Speaker 2>one show ready go and there's some weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure that's involved with that and</v>

3761
02:51:36.781 --> 02:51:41.760
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't necessarily always come off</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose and like the feeling that you see</v>

3762
02:51:41.761 --> 02:51:46.170
<v Speaker 2>him when he's at a club where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing himself in a much more</v>

3763
02:51:46.290 --> 02:51:47.160
<v Speaker 2>freeway.</v>

3764
02:51:47.710 --> 02:51:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I felt that he's a lot of his comedy as</v>
<v Speaker 3>high points.</v>

3765
02:51:51.341 --> 02:51:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Of course he's content came from his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to do characterization that you</v>

3766
02:51:55.480 --> 02:51:57.600
<v Speaker 3>do like a sort of a long bit that used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like,</v>

3767
02:51:57.610 --> 02:51:59.530
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is just hitting me with data.</v>

3768
02:51:59.710 --> 02:52:02.770
<v Speaker 3>But like when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh believe God created a in one day.</v>

3769
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:03.783
<v Speaker 3>But those things,</v>

3770
02:52:04.470 --> 02:52:09.470
<v Speaker 1>it looks like he rushed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rafiki doesn't let you off and then.</v>

3771
02:52:11.290 --> 02:52:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And then as well that the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

3772
02:52:12.680 --> 02:52:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that revelations was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that I ever saw of.</v>

3773
02:52:15.401 --> 02:52:20.401
<v Speaker 1>He's like when I was like was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he does the market in France,</v>

3774
02:52:20.951 --> 02:52:22.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in one advertising mock and Kudos,</v>

3775
02:52:23.230 --> 02:52:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3776
02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe his sincerity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that someone would</v>

3777
02:52:27.491 --> 02:52:30.160
<v Speaker 1>hit you with that much heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quit putting a dollar sign and every</v>

3778
02:52:30.161 --> 02:52:32.740
<v Speaker 1>damn thing on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something like that.</v>

3779
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was from the heart,</v>

3780
02:52:36.131 --> 02:52:36.964
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3781
02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Resonated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever someone,</v>

3782
02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:41.620
<v Speaker 2>something resonates and stays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3783
02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:43.990
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much mythology involved in</v>

3784
02:52:43.991 --> 02:52:47.950
<v Speaker 2>him now because he's passed on and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died young and we always sit back and</v>

3785
02:52:47.951 --> 02:52:48.880
<v Speaker 2>wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it be?</v>

3786
02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I liked that guy was alive today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have the outlet then where</v>

3787
02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:56.500
<v Speaker 1>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you can go back and look at a guy</v>

3788
02:52:56.501 --> 02:53:00.670
<v Speaker 1>like that because it's there and back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you weren't ready to handle that.</v>

3789
02:53:01.210 --> 02:53:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Who's talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming to comedy club.</v>

3790
02:53:03.041 --> 02:53:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to laugh.</v>

3791
02:53:04.830 --> 02:53:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to think tonight will Hicks Hicks was,</v>

3792
02:53:10.530 --> 02:53:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

3793
02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:16.110
<v Speaker 2>So kennison opened the door for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was one of the outlaws and</v>

3794
02:53:16.111 --> 02:53:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Kennison had a lot of bits that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

3795
02:53:18.661 --> 02:53:23.580
<v Speaker 2>but they were more humor based than</v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view based like he had points</v>

3796
02:53:23.581 --> 02:53:25.260
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point of view had to be really</v>

3797
02:53:25.261 --> 02:53:28.140
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Hicks had a lot of points of</v>

3798
02:53:28.141 --> 02:53:30.090
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like there's gotta be a way to</v>

3799
02:53:30.091 --> 02:53:34.080
<v Speaker 2>introduce these ideas into people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of standup comedy that maybe not</v>

3800
02:53:34.081 --> 02:53:36.210
<v Speaker 2>even aren't that funny but are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

3801
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Kennison was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was,</v>

3802
02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had some ridiculously funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>bits and he did it in this totally</v>

3803
02:53:43.471 --> 02:53:48.090
<v Speaker 2>unapologetic way that I think Hicks kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of absorbed and when I first saw Hicks</v>

3804
02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:50.730
<v Speaker 2>is one of the things he had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison in him,</v>

3805
02:53:50.970 --> 02:53:55.970
<v Speaker 2>like we all have influences and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're starting out we like to hear other</v>

3806
02:53:56.701 --> 02:53:59.820
<v Speaker 2>comedians that you really love come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your own mouth,</v>

3807
02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:04.880
<v Speaker 2>almost like with the intonations and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflections and you almost kind of mimic</v>

3808
02:54:05.011 --> 02:54:06.330
<v Speaker 2>them in your delivery.</v>

3809
02:54:06.690 --> 02:54:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And Hicks did a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first saw him,</v>

3810
02:54:09.481 --> 02:54:12.990
<v Speaker 2>he was doing a lot of Kennison and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was interesting.</v>

3811
02:54:12.991 --> 02:54:15.300
<v Speaker 2>It was like this guy is clearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced and.</v>

3812
02:54:15.301 --> 02:54:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the.</v>

3813
02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know whether or not he was</v>

3814
02:54:17.851 --> 02:54:20.180
<v Speaker 2>influenced by Kinesin or kinison was</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by Hex,</v>

3815
02:54:20.190 --> 02:54:22.530
<v Speaker 2>but most likely it's probably a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of both,</v>

3816
02:54:22.531 --> 02:54:26.820
<v Speaker 2>but more Kennison than anything because</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison was much more successful</v>

3817
02:54:26.850 --> 02:54:30.240
<v Speaker 2>earlier on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like several years before Hicks really</v>

3818
02:54:30.241 --> 02:54:34.290
<v Speaker 2>took off and was revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Kennison came on the scene.</v>

3819
02:54:34.291 --> 02:54:38.520
<v Speaker 2>He was completely revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think him taking Hicks with him,</v>

3820
02:54:38.670 --> 02:54:40.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were a part of that Houston</v>

3821
02:54:40.411 --> 02:54:43.290
<v Speaker 2>group that originally expanded and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to la.</v>

3822
02:54:43.650 --> 02:54:47.820
<v Speaker 2>I think he just showed that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just some unbilled undeniable</v>

3823
02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:51.270
<v Speaker 2>power and being that controversial but</v>
<v Speaker 2>on point</v>

3824
02:54:51.910 --> 02:54:56.270
<v Speaker 1>what startup is one of the original</v>
<v Speaker 1>American art form,</v>

3825
02:54:56.271 --> 02:54:58.670
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there is precedent prior to</v>

3826
02:54:58.671 --> 02:55:01.370
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proprietor being in the United States</v>

3827
02:55:01.371 --> 02:55:04.150
<v Speaker 1>was not like that art form exist in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

3828
02:55:04.170 --> 02:55:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's go gestures or just as Rava or</v>
<v Speaker 1>music call.</v>

3829
02:55:07.551 --> 02:55:09.590
<v Speaker 1>It didn't exist in that kind of way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a,</v>

3830
02:55:09.770 --> 02:55:14.150
<v Speaker 1>in a manner like it's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Podcasting is very natural medium for a</v>

3831
02:55:14.151 --> 02:55:17.240
<v Speaker 1>comedian because it grants you that long</v>
<v Speaker 1>form because I've always thought like</v>

3832
02:55:17.241 --> 02:55:17.841
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3833
02:55:17.841 --> 02:55:20.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it can be that the more</v>

3834
02:55:20.391 --> 02:55:22.670
<v Speaker 1>truthful you are and the more articulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>

3835
02:55:22.671 --> 02:55:25.130
<v Speaker 1>the more you reduce your audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3836
02:55:25.131 --> 02:55:29.360
<v Speaker 1>when you think of like he liked hitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up rooms have 2,500 people or 5,000,</v>

3837
02:55:29.370 --> 02:55:30.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arena gigs.</v>

3838
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to go in the white in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with fucking Noam Chomsky,</v>

3839
02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:39.260
<v Speaker 1>bloody quotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished.</v>

3840
02:55:39.460 --> 02:55:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3841
02:55:40.611 --> 02:55:44.030
<v Speaker 1>You got to have some way to connect</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things with humor bound.</v>

3842
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Almost like scaffolding in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

3843
02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:47.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3844
02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:50.210
<v Speaker 1>because you've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing I think about sort of</v>

3845
02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:53.690
<v Speaker 1>like keeping the ball above a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>level and in a way this medium,</v>

3846
02:55:53.691 --> 02:55:55.340
<v Speaker 1>your are relief that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are allowed.</v>

3847
02:55:55.350 --> 02:55:56.183
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3848
02:55:56.570 --> 02:55:58.980
<v Speaker 1>sit back for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen for ages.</v>

3849
02:55:59.050 --> 02:56:00.020
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3850
02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the aspect of comedy that I think is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important of authenticity,</v>

3851
02:56:03.501 --> 02:56:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you know when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you are a startup comic,</v>

3852
02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:05.991
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3853
02:56:05.991 --> 02:56:08.030
<v Speaker 1>you got to find your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to find your authenticity in</v>

3854
02:56:08.031 --> 02:56:12.430
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying that you hear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicality of Comedians you admire in</v>

3855
02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:15.910
<v Speaker 1>your voice that like when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes or or 10,</v>

3856
02:56:16.390 --> 02:56:18.500
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3857
02:56:18.501 --> 02:56:23.210
<v Speaker 1>To become robust enough with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here I guess you get to really</v>

3858
02:56:23.211 --> 02:56:27.800
<v Speaker 1>explore what you are authentically in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a long safe form,</v>

3859
02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:28.980
<v Speaker 1>especially 10 minutes.</v>

3860
02:56:28.980 --> 02:56:31.260
<v Speaker 1>That's those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little short sets you do it.</v>

3861
02:56:31.261 --> 02:56:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So those are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3862
02:56:32.170 --> 02:56:34.400
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a bid out or a series of</v>

3863
02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:38.270
<v Speaker 1>funny things that you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like any real depth and</v>

3864
02:56:38.271 --> 02:56:41.510
<v Speaker 1>part of what comes out that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny is like if you watch someone like</v>

3865
02:56:41.511 --> 02:56:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of like what his comedy is like,</v>

3866
02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll understand after you see him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 or 20 minutes,</v>

3867
02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:50.540
<v Speaker 1>this is how he makes fun of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his personality.</v>

3868
02:56:50.541 --> 02:56:54.770
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of get his vibe and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>another subject comes up and you're</v>

3869
02:56:54.771 --> 02:56:57.290
<v Speaker 1>laughing before he even starts talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you're kind of</v>

3870
02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:00.350
<v Speaker 1>following where he's going to take this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3871
02:57:00.351 --> 02:57:03.280
<v Speaker 1>You've signed up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll enjoy this now.</v>

3872
02:57:03.390 --> 02:57:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're tuned into his perspective.</v>

3873
02:57:05.270 --> 02:57:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Kinison was a huge influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3874
02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I loved Kennison.</v>

3875
02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:15.010
<v Speaker 4>He was the hands down and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary.</v>

3876
02:57:15.011 --> 02:57:16.990
<v Speaker 4>It was like seeing Metallica for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time.</v>

3877
02:57:17.020 --> 02:57:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Like what would lead the way these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people reacting?</v>

3878
02:57:20.770 --> 02:57:22.600
<v Speaker 4>I never saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3879
02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:25.990
<v Speaker 4>an audience of comedy audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made them.</v>

3880
02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:31.380
<v Speaker 4>He made them almost want to go in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>marsh pit and to,</v>

3881
02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:32.081
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3882
02:57:32.081 --> 02:57:37.081
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Carlin would dance around</v>
<v Speaker 4>being Catholic and and kind of expose</v>

3883
02:57:39.041 --> 02:57:43.840
<v Speaker 4>things but not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Kennison comes out and he just in</v>

3884
02:57:43.841 --> 02:57:45.590
<v Speaker 4>a biblical way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it.</v>

3885
02:57:45.940 --> 02:57:49.030
<v Speaker 4>My mom tried to make me go to church and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made me a good person.</v>

3886
02:57:49.330 --> 02:57:54.330
<v Speaker 4>I learned more about biblical to and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just how common sense wise listening to</v>

3887
02:57:55.061 --> 02:57:57.200
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made me think about it.</v>

3888
02:57:57.201 --> 02:57:59.620
<v Speaker 4>He come out and yet Jesus was never</v>
<v Speaker 4>married.</v>

3889
02:57:59.621 --> 02:58:04.621
<v Speaker 4>No wife is going to buy the and he'd go</v>
<v Speaker 4>into this whole thing about he leaves on</v>

3890
02:58:04.951 --> 02:58:06.840
<v Speaker 4>a Fridays with 10 of his friends.</v>

3891
02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:09.570
<v Speaker 4>His wife has passed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know where's the,</v>

3892
02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:12.480
<v Speaker 4>where's all those losers that call</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves disciples?</v>

3893
02:58:12.481 --> 02:58:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Everyone that says I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe we put up feed.</v>

3894
02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I had sat down with hopefully do the</v>
<v Speaker 4>common sense of this is why doesn't</v>

3895
02:58:21.241 --> 02:58:22.920
<v Speaker 4>anyone talk about the common sense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

3896
02:58:23.130 --> 02:58:27.360
<v Speaker 4>He just put it balls out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can get away with it because he was a</v>

3897
02:58:27.361 --> 02:58:31.770
<v Speaker 4>preacher and he knew the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew everything about it and he would</v>

3898
02:58:31.771 --> 02:58:36.510
<v Speaker 4>sit there and he comes home on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like shit is dirt all over his</v>

3899

<v Speaker 4>face and he sees his cross out on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lawn and she's like way Mr</v>

3903
02:58:52.770 --> 02:58:54.720
<v Speaker 4>and then he went on this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

3906

<v Speaker 4>he introduced rock and roll</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensibilities to cry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have to travel this far.</v>

3961
03:01:34.090 --> 03:01:34.923
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

3962

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3966
03:01:55.381 --> 03:01:57.630
<v Speaker 2>people always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fucking trend now,</v>

3967
03:01:57.631 --> 03:02:01.200
<v Speaker 2>but good comedy should always punch up a</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nonsense.</v>

3970
03:02:04.591 --> 03:02:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Comedy should be comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like rap music or fucking</v>

3972
03:02:10.771 --> 03:02:13.140
<v Speaker 2>You cannot decide what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's not funny,</v>

3973
03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:15.350
<v Speaker 2>and that is one of the best examples of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3974
03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.520
<v Speaker 2>That African bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

3987
03:02:47.090 --> 03:02:50.330
<v Speaker 2>a great bit if it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone did it in 2016,</v>

3988
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:55.750
<v Speaker 2>but in the 84 revolutionary yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 maybe.</v>

3989
03:02:57.620 --> 03:03:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be fucking revolutionary.</v>

3990
03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:03.440
<v Speaker 3>It's releasing you from the sanctimony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two.</v>

3991
03:03:03.441 --> 03:03:06.110

<v Speaker 3>that again through tend to architects</v>

3994
03:03:13.761 --> 03:03:15.050
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

3995
03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Trickster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the role of the tricks that I like that</v>

3996
03:03:17.721 --> 03:03:22.190

<v Speaker 3>that like even Christ is a tricks there</v>
<v Speaker 3>in moments in the bottle of these people</v>

3998
03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:28.430
<v Speaker 3>that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not reality anymore,</v>

3999
03:03:28.570 --> 03:03:30.870
<v Speaker 3>other than that's a tricks the function</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go like,</v>

4000
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:33.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that there's a prescribed way</v>

4001
03:03:33.171 --> 03:03:35.810
<v Speaker 3>that you're supposed to respond to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4002
03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:38.120
<v Speaker 3>African commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

4003
03:03:38.121 --> 03:03:41.720
<v Speaker 3>there's this alternative way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>responding to it and to present it</v>

4004
03:03:41.721 --> 03:03:44.770
<v Speaker 3>comedically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so freed me.</v>

4005
03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:48.070
<v Speaker 3>You freed me from reality is like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>unchanging.</v>

4006
03:03:48.130 --> 03:03:49.240
<v Speaker 2>And you know what's interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>him?</v>

4007
03:03:49.241 --> 03:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever read his brother's book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brother Sam.</v>

4008
03:03:52.300 --> 03:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>His brother wrote a great book of Mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

4009
03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:59.640
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that he said is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam's like emergence of who he is.</v>

4010
03:03:59.671 --> 03:04:02.810
<v Speaker 2>He came out of a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got hit by a truck when he was a</v>

4011
03:04:02.811 --> 03:04:05.420
<v Speaker 2>little kid and it changed his</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

4012
03:04:05.421 --> 03:04:10.370
<v Speaker 2>radically hit a serious head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got knocked the fuck out and came</v>

4013
03:04:10.371 --> 03:04:12.440
<v Speaker 2>back fearless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a.</v>

4014
03:04:12.441 --> 03:04:14.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impulsiveness,</v>

4015
03:04:15.020 --> 03:04:18.770
<v Speaker 2>fearlessness and rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are con,</v>

4016
03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:21.470
<v Speaker 2>the constant themes that come out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>head trauma,</v>

4017
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:25.070
<v Speaker 2>so it's interesting like one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important figures in the history of</v>

4018
03:04:25.071 --> 03:04:29.270
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy might have literally been</v>
<v Speaker 2>birthed because of trauma,</v>

4019
03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:33.050
<v Speaker 2>like physical brain trauma that's barely</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I never heard the</v>

4020
03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:38.420
<v Speaker 2>brain damaged pioneer for that head</v>
<v Speaker 2>injury.</v>

4021
03:04:38.920 --> 03:04:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Same would never have been discussed.</v>

4022
03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:44.240
<v Speaker 2>City was a different person like before</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was like quiet and shy and a</v>

4023
03:04:44.241 --> 03:04:47.030
<v Speaker 2>normal kid and then Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets hit by a car,</v>

4024
03:04:47.031 --> 03:04:48.710
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in the hospital.</v>

4025
03:04:48.711 --> 03:04:51.890
<v Speaker 2>The whole deal comes out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

4026
03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.260
<v Speaker 2>He just tastes deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's it.</v>

4027
03:04:54.330 --> 03:04:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I still think it's a steal because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty chat,</v>

4028
03:04:56.930 --> 03:04:57.763
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4029
03:04:57.980 --> 03:04:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

4030
03:04:59.991 --> 03:05:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I had trauma drew in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was.</v>

4031
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:05.880
<v Speaker 2>That was how we deliver</v>
<v Speaker 2>up</v>

4032
03:05:07.390 --> 03:05:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this explosive dynamic delivery</v>

4033
03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:15.380
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I don't want to attribute all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it to to the head trauma because</v>

4034
03:05:15.381 --> 03:05:18.370
<v Speaker 2>obviously there was some genius</v>
<v Speaker 2>involvement is creativity.</v>

4035
03:05:18.450 --> 03:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>You definitely blew my I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

4036
03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:20.511
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4037
03:05:20.511 --> 03:05:20.781
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4038
03:05:20.781 --> 03:05:22.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a negative thing.</v>

4039
03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

4040
03:05:23.890 --> 03:05:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I've dealt with a lot of brain trauma</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know a lot of people that have</v>

4041
03:05:27.771 --> 03:05:29.930
<v Speaker 2>gotten fucked up from fighting.</v>

4042
03:05:30.170 --> 03:05:32.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there's a real thing that happens</v>

4043
03:05:32.451 --> 03:05:34.850
<v Speaker 2>to people and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about all the time when they do</v>

4044
03:05:34.851 --> 03:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>these shows on nfl players who become</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive and they,</v>

4045
03:05:38.551 --> 03:05:42.890
<v Speaker 2>they get crazy and impulsive and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get very violent and some of that has to</v>

4046
03:05:42.891 --> 03:05:45.710
<v Speaker 2>do with repeated trauma to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4047
03:05:45.711 --> 03:05:48.440
<v Speaker 2>just one event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one car accident,</v>

4048
03:05:48.470 --> 03:05:52.790
<v Speaker 2>one thing like that can literally change</v>
<v Speaker 2>your personality because it's a very</v>

4049
03:05:52.791 --> 03:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>fragile dynamic of synapses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

4050
03:05:57.500 --> 03:06:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Neurochemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain's actual like the flow of</v>

4051
03:06:02.751 --> 03:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>chemicals of neurochemistry and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical body itself and the way your</v>

4052
03:06:07.161 --> 03:06:11.030
<v Speaker 2>personality manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those things are directly connected</v>

4053
03:06:11.240 --> 03:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>and an event like what happened to Sam</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison literally reshaped in art form.</v>

4054
03:06:16.670 --> 03:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 10 people to get head trauma and</v>

4055
03:06:18.321 --> 03:06:21.200
<v Speaker 2>suddenly can speak perfect French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen them on the Internet a</v>

4056
03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:22.460
<v Speaker 2>lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4057
03:06:22.461 --> 03:06:24.070
<v Speaker 2>They knocked over the nuts.</v>

4058
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Come back with perfect French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a common phenomenon and it can be</v>

4059
03:06:27.321 --> 03:06:29.540
<v Speaker 2>checked out online anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

4060
03:06:30.130 --> 03:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>They get really good at math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only speak French.</v>

4061
03:06:33.171 --> 03:06:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Does someone have to teach them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>mice with the risk little head trauma.</v>

4062
03:06:38.390 --> 03:06:40.550
<v Speaker 2>The downside is you've said he might</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back to the stream and the</v>

4063
03:06:40.551 --> 03:06:42.650
<v Speaker 2>aggressive or you might have a headache</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

4064
03:06:42.860 --> 03:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>It's also possible to set a lot easier</v>
<v Speaker 2>and quicker.</v>

4065
03:06:46.041 --> 03:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>It's much quicker satisfaction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting them stupid books.</v>

4066
03:06:49.490 --> 03:06:50.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't have patience for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Books,</v>

4067
03:06:50.961 --> 03:06:53.320
<v Speaker 2>foreign accent syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Accent.</v>

4068
03:06:53.460 --> 03:06:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm a rare creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Develop appears to</v>

4069
03:06:56.010 --> 03:06:58.740
<v Speaker 1>be a foreign accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese teacher stroke.</v>
