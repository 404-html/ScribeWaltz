00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>is there anything in this episode or this issue that deals with a very</v>

4
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>controversial issue of antidepressants and their effect on the human mind?</v>

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>People asking about about that?</v>

6
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.800
<v Speaker 1>anti psychotics,</v>

9
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>here's one thing that I'll say about or Ssri or not anti psychotics,</v>

10
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.700
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>not Ssri.</v>

12
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't have good informed opinion on antidepressant,</v>

13
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.881
<v Speaker 1>on antidepressants.</v>

14
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know enough about it.</v>

15
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

16
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know how to comment on that intelligently.</v>

17
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I will say that,</v>

18
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>anti psychotics,</v>

20
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>which are a sort of,</v>

21
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.391
<v Speaker 1>an extreme thing,</v>

23
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:35.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.374
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of,</v>

25
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

26
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>incredible research being done,</v>

28
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>but we're still,</v>

29
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>it's still very early days in our understanding of what drugs do to the brain</v>

30
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>and what happens here and there.</v>

31
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:47.774
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

32
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.453
<v Speaker 1>anti psychotics,</v>

34
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

35
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>there was a statistically significant group of people in a,</v>

36
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I think God,</v>

37
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to miss represent this,</v>

38
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

39
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>basically I was talking to a university professor who had done this study about,</v>

40
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>she was a clinical psychologist who had done a study about people taking out our</v>

42
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>psychotics and a certain number of,</v>

43
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.383
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

44
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>the patients were so transformed by this new generation of anti psychotics that</v>

46
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>

47
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>that they voluntarily went off them to go back to the hallucinations that they'd</v>

48
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>had before.</v>

49
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

50
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not a lot of people.</v>

51
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to necessarily represent the number,</v>

52
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but it was a statistically significant group of people,</v>

53
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>which means that there are people who,</v>

54
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.081
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

55
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>their reaction is I would rather.</v>

56
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>So in one of the cases that you described was a,</v>

57
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.691
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>

59
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:34.691
<v Speaker 1>a homeless man who believed that he was being pursued by the Russians,</v>

60
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 1>and was living in stark terror in this kind of cold war nightmare every waking</v>

62
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

63
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>And he was homeless and Dorothy but just ruined guy.</v>

64
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>He goes and he gets begins to get this anti psychotic medication and these,</v>

65
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and it turns off not just your hallucinations,</v>

66
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>but it also maintains your ability to reason and function.</v>

67
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>it can be very helpful sometimes if it,</v>

69
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.371
<v Speaker 1>if it works,</v>

70
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like to point out that's not always true.</v>

71
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>but he was so destabilized by discovering that nobody wanted him.</v>

73
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>The Russians didn't want him,</v>

74
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:11.374
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted them.</v>

75
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Right now he's just a bum dude.</v>

76
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

77
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>he was bummed out because,</v>

78
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>because he wasn't special anymore.</v>

79
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

80
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>He was the star of his own action movie for so long,</v>

81
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and add more guy and he and he voluntarily went back to,</v>

83
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 1>to being,</v>

84
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>to living that life,</v>

85
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>he took the blue pill and then whatever it was and then wished you hadn't.</v>

87
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see what he saw before I made any sort of a judgment on them</v>

89
00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:36.401
<v Speaker 1>because who knows,</v>

90
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>he might have been living in an awesome world like a winnie the Pooh ride.</v>

91
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Totally neon colors everywhere and fucking Russian agents hiding behind two</v>

92
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>dimensional trees.</v>

93
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Marriage driving a convertible.</v>

94
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

95
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

96
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>who knows what he actually saw a,</v>

97
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 1>there was this conversation on,</v>

98
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.030
<v Speaker 1>on the board recently where I brought up the thing about,</v>

99
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 1>if you had a thousand monkeys on typewriters,</v>

101
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>eventually they would write the works of,</v>

102
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>given an infinite number of time or amount of time.</v>

103
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's horseshit.</v>

104
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>But it is true because an infinite number of time.</v>

105
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Speaker 1>because if you had like,</v>

107
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>let's just take out the monkeys and say you have one computer program,</v>

108
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>did you imagine that a monkey really did?</v>

109
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

110
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Like Romeo and Juliet,</v>

111
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you just left this monkey in a fucking room at a typewriter and most of it was</v>

112
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.963
<v Speaker 1>dog shit.</v>

113
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Most of them will say,</v>

114
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

115
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

116
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But one day that monkey just got it right and his little fucking eyes rolled in</v>

117
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.730
<v Speaker 1>the back of his head like a slot machine.</v>

118
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.593
<v Speaker 1>He starts typing.</v>

119
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even notice it.</v>

120
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>It just can't even right at the end of midsummer night's dream Romeo but not.</v>

121
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

122
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.791
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

123
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>like say you,</v>

125
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you're randomly selecting characters.</v>

126
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Each character is randomly selected and you do this for an infinite string of</v>

127
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.694
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

128
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Then not only would you get the entire works of Shakespeare,</v>

129
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>but you would get an infinite number of times.</v>

130
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You would get it backwards and infinite number of times you would get every</v>

131
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>chapter in every order,</v>

132
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>an infinite number of times you would get everything that's ever been written in</v>

133
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>every single order that you could ever think to put it in an infinite number of</v>

134
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>times by my sweat.</v>

135
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Infinite that monkeys.</v>

136
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>why would he is on a typewriter with chimps?</v>

138
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

139
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>there they wouldn't hurt the little fingers.</v>

140
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Monkeys.</v>

141
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.823
<v Speaker 1>They're little tiny.</v>

142
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

143
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

144
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the word in it.</v>

145
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Even that doesn't even begin to describe it in that,</v>

147
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>that that word is a real problem where we don't really.</v>

148
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't register with me when I say infinite on my face.</v>

149
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It's goes until I can think about it and then it keeps going.</v>

150
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean even just like when you see those videos of like they sent a probe,</v>

151
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>like an artificial prob like to show you what it looks like when they leave</v>

152
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>earth and then it sees the moon,</v>

153
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>then it sees the other outer planets and then it sees,</v>

154
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:50.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

156
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy from a distance and it keeps going and going.</v>

157
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>

158
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get in there.</v>

159
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get in there.</v>

160
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are so fucking far away when you have to start thinking about the</v>

161
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.334
<v Speaker 1>speed of light.</v>

162
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the fact that the son is eight light minutes away.</v>

163
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Mars is like 30 light minutes away.</v>

164
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Pluto is like 18 hours away in terms of lights.</v>

165
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Will Dr. Greer is going to let us know,</v>

166
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>goodness,</v>

167
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>how big the universe is when he reveals what the aliens have been telling him.</v>

168
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Garth brooks is slowly becoming some classics.</v>

169
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

170
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you have classic rock.</v>

172
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I got friends in low places.</v>

173
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Could be a classes that you saw.</v>

174
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's weird you say that because I was at the capital records building a while</v>

175
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>ago just to get a friend to work there and they had this place,</v>

176
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>these plaques on the wall and like every album that sold 10 million copies,</v>

177
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

178
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Which is not that many.</v>

179
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>So you go to the capitol records,</v>

180
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>there were like four Beatles records,</v>

181
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>dark side of the moon and just a wall of Garth Brooks,</v>

182
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>like you don't realize how many fucking albums and he had like six albums that</v>

183
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 1>sold 10.</v>

184
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Like you wonder why you don't hear from anymore because he's got more fucking</v>

185
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>money than indie music doing vegas now.</v>

186
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I think he started doing the concerts in Vegas,</v>

187
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but just with an acoustic guitar I think really like it's just him with a</v>

188
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:04.731
<v Speaker 1>guitar.</v>

189
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

191
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>he's a weird fuck,</v>

192
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's undeniably talented.</v>

193
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't sell that many records and not have something going on.</v>

194
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I've got friends in low places is a great fucking song.</v>

195
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>If you got a buzz on and that song comes on and you don't get happy your</v>

196
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

197
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

198
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:20.174
<v Speaker 1>if you're that,</v>

199
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a little harsh,</v>

200
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

201
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>

202
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.391
<v Speaker 1>but now where I'm from,</v>

203
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

204
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're drinking and somebody doesn't put that on the Jukebox,</v>

205
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.483
<v Speaker 1>like something's wrong,</v>

206
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I cannot take that,</v>

207
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.074
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

208
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.140
<v Speaker 1>of course he can't.</v>

209
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.781
<v Speaker 1>You're from Ohio.</v>

210
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You probably heard it every day.</v>

211
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.663
<v Speaker 1>Your life,</v>

212
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>your alarm clock,</v>

213
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.183
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

214
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 1>You remember when he did that weird thing garth brooks did where he put on a wig</v>

215
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>and pretend to be a different dude.</v>

216
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>He was Chris.</v>

217
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Chris Gaines was that.</v>

218
00:06:45.161 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It was God.</v>

219
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>That was the weirdest thing ever.</v>

220
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck was that about when I see those plaques on the wall at capital records,</v>

221
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:52.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

222
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>no wonder he did that.</v>

223
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.433
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

224
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

225
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.523
<v Speaker 1>Who Let.</v>

226
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Who let you do that?</v>

227
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.134
<v Speaker 1>Garth Brooks,</v>

228
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and he grew a little flavor.</v>

229
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Savor a little flavor saver onto the lower lip.</v>

230
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

231
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>total emo,</v>

232
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Weirdo brooding.</v>

233
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>That looks like he was in an argument with his label.</v>

234
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:11.481
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

235
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:11.751
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

236
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:12.261
<v Speaker 1>you fuckers,</v>

237
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I could sell albums doing anything.</v>

238
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:13.881
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck.</v>

239
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I want to change my name.</v>

240
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Put a goat,</v>

241
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and then that's what he thought.</v>

242
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>He really did believe that.</v>

243
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that was.</v>

244
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Was that his last album?</v>

245
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.481
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

246
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a shitty way to go out.</v>

247
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:25.410
<v Speaker 1>If that's his last.</v>

248
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 1>That was like the pictures of them all with the hair.</v>

249
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Just perfectly fine.</v>

250
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 1>If we don't know it's a fucking wig man.</v>

251
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't just wear a wig.</v>

252
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

253
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

254
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.540
<v Speaker 1>That looks member for a while and snl.</v>

255
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:42.970
<v Speaker 1>That was like the Goto joke was on weekend update with every joke because like</v>

256

<v Speaker 1>Chris gave gaines fucking silly.</v>

257
00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:50.931
<v Speaker 1>He is the idea that he thought that he could pretend to be someone different,</v>

258
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.710
<v Speaker 1>a different personality.</v>

259
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the happy country guy anymore even though it's the same guy inside my</v>

260
00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:57.870
<v Speaker 1>heart when I'm Chris Gaines.</v>

261
00:07:57.871 --> 00:07:58.830

266
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't think about that.</v>

267
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't think about the wig,</v>

268
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:10.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

269
