1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.553
Okay.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.410
<v 1>And we live John,
Donna her.
Thank you very much sir.
Very nice to see you.</v>

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.390
It's my pleasure Joe.
Thank you for having me here.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.640
A nice to be with a fellow fanny pack proponent as well and a now you have one

5
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.360
of the beautiful higher primate leather bags like that.
Huh?

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
Joe Rogan has just given me one of the most beautiful fanny pics than I've ever

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.030
seen in my life.
Um,

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.370
I wear a very cheap fanny pack and this,

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.450
this is a thing of beauty.

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.630
I was just telling Joe About my student Gordon Ryan was recently given a Gucci,

11
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.600
a fanny pack.
It's literally the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.600
When he wears it around me,
I get insanely jealous.

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.800
And which you buy one of those.
It's like an $800 just on the principle.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.990
Just on principle.
I account buy an $800 fanny pack,

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
but I could definitely stab Gordon Ryan in the back with a knife and steal it

16
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.520
from a and blame it on Nicky Ryan.
I could do that.
Easily blame on his brother.

17
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.710
Absolutely.
Great TV series.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.250
The fanny pack is making a comeback.

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.260
It's a slow comeback that a lot of people are reluctant to join there.

20
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:11.520
They're scared.
They,

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.350
they worry about their position in the sexual food chain with good reason.

22
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.670
By the way,
I don't know why.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.820
I feel like anybody that won't fuck you because you have a fanny pack.

24
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:25.530
You don't want to fuck them.
They're too much work.
Strong point.
Essentially.

25
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.430
It's always a battle of a appearance versus function.

26
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
Fanny packs cold.
Very,
very low on a parents,
but very high on function.

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
I feel like that one bucks the trend.

28
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.400
I think you're right between this and the Gucci,
we've got something going on.

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.190
Yeah.
There's a video that I put up the other day of my,
uh,

30
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.030
archery game is techno hunt thing,
which is this big crazy elaborate thing.

31
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.440
I got more comments on the fact that I was wearing a fanny pack in the video

32
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.820
than anything.
Were they positive or negative comments?
Negative.
Yeah,

33
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.090
but that's my experience.
But that's just the internet.
The Internet is,

34
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:01.950
the Internet is extremely angry.

35
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.820
That's the first thing you learned about the Internet.
They you can,

36
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.940
you could literally save a baby's life [inaudible] and the 80% of the Internet

37
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.220
we'll call you an asshole for doing so.
It's a,

38
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.920
it doesn't matter what you do at the Internet is very angry.
Well,

39
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.780
what the Internet is is it shows what people are like when there's no social

40
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.820
cues.
When they're not in front of you,

41
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
they don't have to deal with like looking you in the eye and what weird little

42
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:33.351
hidden demons of jealousy and anger and resentment and it's a pretty sad stories

43
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.040
and that's what we're really like.
It's a,

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.700
it's not looking good for the human rights.

45
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.340
The kind of people that comment in general and what it shows you is that 99% of

46
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:48.540
what we call human goodness and politeness really comes out of fear of

47
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:49.410
consequences.

48
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.540
There's a lot of that for sure because there's no consequences when you talk on

49
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:53.010
the line,

50
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.710
but I think it's the quality of the people that are making those kinds of

51
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:56.131
comments.

52
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.890
Like I would say like if you look at Youtube comments like Michael Jordan is not

53
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.210
leaving youtube comments.

54
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.200
The people that leave Youtube comments and bitch and complain about things.

55
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.260
Usually everything's not going so fantastic in their own life.

56
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.690
But they have this forum now when they feel like if there's a video that has 3

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.640
million downloads,
they also are on that video.
They are at the,

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.570
they're there in the comments section.
You go to them,

59
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.390
they're a part of that unqualified.
No one asked him to be there.

60
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.520
Literally all you have to do is make an account.

61
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.780
No one has to know anything about your education,
the way your mind works,

62
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.050
what you've done with your life,
what mistakes you've made,
doesn't matter.

63
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.070
You are old fuck 66 and that's your name.

64
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.370
And you can say whatever you want and you'll,
your,

65
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.950
your comments are right there with everything else.
Yes.
It's,

66
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.990
it's fascinating to watch.
It's very galatarian,
but in a lot of ways it's also,

67
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.880
it's like,
boy,
um,
I don't know if that's the best way to get your information.

68
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.860
Yeah,
I think there's a lot of truth to that.
Yeah.
So John,
um,

69
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.040
you are one of the most fascinating characters in the world of Jujitsu.

70
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.660
And the world of martial arts.

71
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.130
And for people who are not aware of your background,
you started out,

72
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:16.840
correct me if I'm wrong,
you started out,
um,
a philosophy student.
That's correct.

73
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.980
Yes.
And you were working as a bouncer and you were jacked,
right?

74
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.400
You're a power lifter at the time.
Yes.

75
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.180
And you wanted to figure out a way to defend yourself.
Um,

76
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.870
it wasn't really a question of wanting to figure out.
It was,
it was,

77
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.871
it was a pretty simple design that I had when I grew up in New Zealand.

78
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.680
Martial arts was almost entirely based around.
A striking pro is,

79
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.540
you'll back me up on this joke.
Um,
we're similar age.
Uh,
when we grew up,

80
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.853
uh,
the,

81
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.230
it's no exaggeration to say that the study of martial arts in English speaking

82
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.360
countries and North America,
western Europe,
et Cetera,

83
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.470
was absolutely dominated by the striking thoughts.
And,
um,

84
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.290
if you ask the average person who was the best fighter in the world,

85
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.230
they would typically say whoever was the best boxer in the world.

86
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.290
So in the 1980s,
Mike Tyson and wasn't just the best boxer in the world,

87
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.790
he was the best fighter in the world.

88
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.090
People always equated prowess and fighting with the ability to strike.

89
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.520
Um,
I grew up in that time period and so,
um,
I grew up doing,

90
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.210
uh,
setting kickbox.
He said as a teenager in New Zealand,

91
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.030
I came to the United States and for the first time,

92
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:29.800
and there's no wrestling culture in my country.

93
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.180
New Zealand has no wrestling culture.

94
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.670
It's one of the few countries where there's no indigenous Raceland culture.

95
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:38.380
There's,
there were,
but it was kind of lost in the sands of time.
Um,

96
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.540
when I grew up wrestling with something I saw once every four years,

97
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.070
the Olympics on TV.
And,
um,
I didn't even associate it with fighting,

98
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:48.880
to be honest with you.

99
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.990
I just Sorta as these strange sport with two guys tackled each other.
And,
um,

100
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:56.290
so I came to the United States and I was working as a bouncer.
Um,

101
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.160
America has much,

102
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.330
<v 2>much more of a wrestling culture in it.
In,
in New Zealand when I grew up,</v>

103
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.081
when you fought,

104
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.940
you were expected to fight with fists and if it went to the ground,

105
00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:07.510
the two guys stood up and there was in fighting.

106
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.960
You stood up and he fought like a man.
That was the idea.
And um,
uh,

107
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.000
in the United States when I was bouncing,

108
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:19.001
I was absolutely shocked and impressed by the prowess of judo players and

109
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.350
wrestlers in street fighting,
working as a bounce.

110
00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:25.780
I worked alongside them and I was massively impressed.
What year was this?

111
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.280
This isn't the early 1990s.
I ride the United States in 1991.
Um,

112
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.240
so I started working late night,
late 1991.
Um,
in New York City.

113
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.470
Um,
New York is a very,
very,
very different city back then.
It's,

114
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.690
it's like,
uh,
um,

115
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.900
it's almost like two different cities from what it is to be amazing.

116
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.990
How much it's chicken does.
The transformation is night and day.

117
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.600
It's become like a giant Tgi Fridays now is,

118
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:55.590
that's pretty much what New York City is.
Yeah.
Um,
did,
to give you an example,
uh,

119
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.190
I used to live on West End Avenue on the upper west side.

120
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.350
When I would come home from working in nightclubs at five 30 in the morning to

121
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:04.184
go to sleep,

122
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.490
there would be large numbers of street walking prostitutes on my block.

123
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.110
My Avenue,
if that,

124
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.040
if you saw even a single street walking prostitute in that area,

125
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.940
today would be front page news of the New York Times.

126
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:25.250
It would be so shocking.

127
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:30.251
So completely out of would literally just people's minds score is the best

128
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:33.400
example.
I'm square.

129
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:38.240
It was an extreme example because time square used to be all CD peep shows,

130
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.400
nothing but peep shows.
And now it's like Guy Fieri restaurants.
It's,

131
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.580
it's all television.
So the transformation is huge.

132
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.640
So that was the New York that I went into and uh,
it was a,

133
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.810
it was a violent New York.
Uh,

134
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:55.280
1991 I believe was the year with the highest murder rate in recorded history of

135
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.520
New York City.
So,
um,
it was a very,
very different New York City.

136
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.460
It's not what you see today.
So I came into this environment,

137
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:05.300
I saw all these people were incredibly adept and finding,
they were using grant,

138
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:09.050
linkedin,
nick to do to.
So this impressed me a lot.
Um,
at,
uh,

139
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.890
shortly after that time,
uh,
has always working.
Um,
I started to hear,

140
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:15.680
talk about this show,
this ultimate fighting show.

141
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.840
And there was this Brazilian guy who had beaten everyone,

142
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.580
he was wrestling people and strangling them and locking their arms,

143
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:25.480
things like desk people that the things that I'd never heard of.
So I,

144
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.520
I'd heard this and um,
uh,

145
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.210
one day I was teaching at Columbia University and a close friend of mine who was

146
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.600
also in the phd program came into my office.
It was office hours and he said,

147
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:40.100
John,
you know,
I know you work as a bounce them and I know,
uh,

148
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.660
you look at night and,
um,
I started doing this,
this marsh a lot.

149
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:48.260
It's called Brazilian Jujitsu and uh,

150
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.910
it's mostly fall on the ground.

151
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:53.750
I remember you said most of the flights you get into people that put down on the

152
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.560
ground and they wrestle.
And,
uh,

153
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.710
I was wondering if you would be interested in doing it.

154
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.790
And I was like Brazilian Jujitsu and yet I never associated Marshawn's with

155
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:07.090
Brazil for me,
martial arts,
you know,
Japan,
Korea,
Brazil.

156
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.070
Like what do they got capital wearing,
you know?
Right.
Who is this guy?

157
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.940
So I'm like Brazilian Jujitsu.
It isn't you to see like Japanese,

158
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.990
like what does it,
isn't it like a contradiction of terms like Brazil,
Jujitsu?

159
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.210
Um,
so this,
at the time I was around 230 pounds and this guy was,

160
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.280
couldn't be more than 140 and he don't have been training two weeks.
So,

161
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.910
um,
he goes to me,
you know,
we go in the ground and,

162
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.300
and we wrestle on the ground and I was like,
okay,

163
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.120
let me put you in a headlock and let's see what you can do.

164
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.110
So I shut the door of the office,
I cleared out the furniture,

165
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.180
this poor kid on the ground.
Now.
Um,

166
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.020
I had the only thing I knew how to do on the ground in those,

167
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.050
this was headlock people run and I,
you know,
as a strong guide,

168
00:09:51.051 --> 00:09:55.470
it pretty nicely headlock and I'm so I grabbed my poor little friend and,

169
00:09:55.471 --> 00:10:00.060
and throttled them with,
uh,
uh,
basically,
uh,
uh,
kids get timely type headlock.

170
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.870
And um,
uh,
to my shock and horror,

171
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:08.340
he started slipping around behind me and I started holding hotter and hotter and

172
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.300
then about two minutes when guy and I really had no real control over him and he

173
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:13.530
was starting to get around behind me.

174
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.830
Now I didn't know back attacks where I had complete naivety on the ground,

175
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.870
but I could feel something bad was happening.
Someone getting behind you,

176
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:22.020
isn't it for a good thing in a fight.
And,
uh,
I was getting tired,

177
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.240
my arms are getting tired,
I had no control over the guy.

178
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:26.640
And finally he's slept at night to stand up and run away.
And I said,

179
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.380
are you kidding me?
I'm twice your size.
You've been training to God damn weeks.

180
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.380
And if this was a real fight,
he would have got away from it.
And I'm tired.

181
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.220
That's not good.
And I was just saying,
if he did this in two weeks,

182
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.620
what could you do?
Some training?
So I was fascinated.
I went down,
um,

183
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.450
got completely destroyed on my first day.
Um,
or it was hilarious.
You know,

184
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.760
who was there on this first?
They,
Matt Serra was the most,
uh,

185
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.170
he was a blue belt at the time.
Um,
so even on that first day,

186
00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:00.120
you met people that would become very important in your life later on.
And um,

187
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.530
I vowed to the moon and the stars that I would at least become competent and the

188
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:04.680
game,

189
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.880
I couldn't live with the idea that I was incompetent at an important element of

190
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:10.980
fighting.
I didn't want to be a world champ.
I didn't worry.

191
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:13.950
I just want to be competent.
And,
uh,

192
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.370
I believed it would make my bouncing work significantly easier.

193
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.380
That was absolutely true.
Um,
within a very,

194
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.860
very short period of time,
balancing got massively easier for me.

195
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.570
I've bought,
you knew,
you always get this cliched Jujitsu saves.

196
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.610
Judas was saved my life.

197
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.400
How many people need to hear people say that all the time?
Well,

198
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:37.980
I can think of without any question.

199
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:41.460
There are four times in my life that Jujitsu actually did save my life balance.

200
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.930
I can say that with complete honesty.
Um,
uh,
it's a cliche for most people,

201
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.630
but for me it's,
it did happen.
Um,

202
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.200
so it made a massive difference,
but I still saw it as something,

203
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:57.040
it was interesting and something I just wanted to gain competence in.

204
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.860
That fundamentally changed it really at that point I wanted to finish my phd and

205
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.731
become a professor.

206
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:07.480
That's what was my original goal when it came to United States.
Um,

207
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.570
but things started to change when,
uh,

208
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.090
the three senior students at the hands of Gracie Academy,

209
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.850
he caught all made a met Sarah and hold real Gracie.

210
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:16.960
All went their separate ways.

211
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.640
They had to go out and start their own schools and Hanzo was busy fighting

212
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.340
professionally,
Japan,
so he couldn't be at the academy all the time.

213
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.390
And he came to and he said,
John,
you're going to have to be a teacher.

214
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.340
Like there's no one else.
And how long have you been training?
Uh,

215
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.390
I believe if I go to the,
it was around four years.

216
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:38.260
I believe I was a purple belt when I first started teaching at hands.
Those,
um,

217
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.760
don't quote me on that,
but I'll have to go back and check.
But I believe that's,

218
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.430
and why did he come to you?
Um,
probably because he felt sorry for me.

219
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:49.860
I don't know.
Um,
uh,
I was there a lot and um,

220
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.160
I think maybe he saw some enthusiasm while you are obsessed.
Right?

221
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:55.660
And like you were there daily.
Yeah.

222
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.130
That became much more so when I become a teacher because I saw that,
okay,

223
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.960
I'm filling big shoes here.

224
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.510
You must remember all three of those names that I just mentioned.

225
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:07.990
All three were world champions.
Okay.
These were good,
good people.

226
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:10.320
And for that time they were,
they would kill us.

227
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.200
And here I am a phd student.

228
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.410
Now I've got to fill in these shoes.
So I was like,

229
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:21.430
I've got to get serious about this.
So I made a commitment to,
um,

230
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.820
to becoming the best possible teacher I could.
Now,

231
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:28.480
you must remember I went in as a teacher.
That was my first assignment.

232
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.220
And so I decided my primary focus in Jujitsu would be upon teaching.

233
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.980
And uh,
uh,
fortunate I came from an academic background.
I had many brilliant,

234
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.120
brilliant professors coming through the philosophy programs both in New Zealand

235
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.120
and the United States.
Um,
Columbia University had fantastic PhD program.

236
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.910
Uh,
so I was very,
uh,
experience and the art of teaching,

237
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.950
but in an academic context.

238
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.550
And I thought maybe this has given me,

239
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:02.551
faith has given me this angle where I can use an academic approach to teaching

240
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.020
in a sports environment.

241
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.950
And that has really become one of the patents of my approach to teaching a

242
00:14:11.091 --> 00:14:11.924
Jujitsu.

243
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.750
<v 3>So this is,
uh,</v>

244
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.890
in the 90s and you are a purple belt at the time.

245
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.430
When did you develop this leg lock system that has become so legendary?

246
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:25.240
So for people,

247
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.260
for the uninitiated that have never heard of you or understand what we're

248
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:32.410
talking about here.
For the longest time,

249
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.740
Jujitsu was primarily attacks on the arms and the neck.

250
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.610
That was pretty much it.
And there were known attacks on the legs.

251
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.630
But they were frowned upon.
Yes,
something happened you,

252
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:50.920
you got to see some of those techniques.
In MMA,
you got to see some heel,

253
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.460
occasionally foot locks.

254
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.870
There's a few guys are Lawsky pulled off a a foot lock in the UFC against Tim.

255
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.510
Sylvia has a few guys that were pulling these off.

256
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.520
This is pre who some are Paul Harris,

257
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:07.270
but you all of a sudden came along with this very effective system that there

258
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.890
was rumblings many years ago about this where a lot of people were talking about

259
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:17.840
it and a lot of people were saying that,
you know,

260
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:22.841
John Danaher has this insane leg lock system and then you started developing all

261
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.680
these chat for people don't know the top grapplers in the world.
There's a,

262
00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:31.970
there's a lot of top grapplers in the world.
Jujitsu is incredibly competitive,

263
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
but you're recognized as being one of the premiere coaches of the most promising

264
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.170
young people like Gordon Ryan who you're talking about before who is in Abu

265
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.040
Dhabi champion,
Garry Tonin,
Nikki Ryan,
Eddie Cummings.

266
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:51.190
You have an incredible crew of world class strangle artists who are also known

267
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.270
to be some of the very best leg lockers in the world.

268
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.130
So what happened?
How did that,
how did that all take place?

269
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.340
<v 2>Um,
let's go through a,</v>

270
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.120
<v 3>we started about the history of,
Yep.</v>

271
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.310
<v 2>You've actually asked about six different questions.
Sorry.
It's good,</v>

272
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.370
but we can answer them in turn.
So let's go,
let's go.
The first question,

273
00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:16.060
your first question was a historical question.
How,
how did it happen?
Yeah.
Um,

274
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.050
first off,
um,
there was nothing in my early,

275
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.270
uh,
learnings,
uh,
of,
of Jujitsu,
which suggested leg blocks.
Nothing.

276
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.980
Okay.
Um,
hinder would teach by the way she'd say,
my,
my,

277
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.030
my sensei throughout my entire career has been hindered.
Gracie,
um,

278
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.480
I never left up.

279
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.720
He taught me from white belt to black belt and I never left his academy.

280
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.720
I'm the only one of his students who stayed with them from white belt to black

281
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:45.310
belt and never left.
Um,
uh,
so he ends up with teach legal logs,

282
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.880
but it was taught in always the same fashion that everyone else that here's a

283
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:53.320
move has a fig of auto whole,
here's a heel hook,
has an achilles lock.

284
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.610
Um,
so the,
the moves themselves when no one,
okay.
They,
they were,

285
00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.260
they were in existence.

286
00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:02.680
It wasn't like I invented he hawks or something like that.
That's not the idea.

287
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.380
But they weren't emphasized.
Um,
uh,

288
00:17:08.381 --> 00:17:13.240
very,
very uh,
talented and um,
uh,

289
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.690
uh,

290
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.690
influential figure in my life was a guy that I only knew for three days.

291
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.870
Now that sounds,
that sounds crazy,
right?

292
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.950
How can you learn something from someone in three days?
Well,

293
00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:26.620
actually the influence he had occurred in three minutes.

294
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:32.140
I'm a big believer in the idea that someone can come into your life for a very

295
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.770
short period of time and have a massive influence.

296
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.080
I truly believe that in my case,

297
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.360
it was a great American graphical dean list.

298
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.580
Dean lister was invited by Matt Serra to come to the Henzel Gracie Academy,

299
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.170
I believe,
don't quote me on this,

300
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:49.950
but I believe dean was a brown butter at the time.
I'm sure it met was a brown,

301
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:54.360
but at the time too.
And um,
I bought him in for around three days.
Any trained,

302
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:57.240
mostly with Matt Serra in preparation for a grappling tournament,
if I,

303
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.250
if I remember correctly now.

304
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.930
Dean was one mostly in those days for his Achilles lock.

305
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.990
It later on he would become a heel hook specialists.

306
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:10.440
But in those days it was mostly an Achilles lock and he came to the academy role

307
00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:11.520
with some people and he did,

308
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.290
he was doing Achilles lungs and getting some success.
Um,
you know,
went both ways.

309
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:21.120
I mean,
but um,
uh,
he,
he couldn't really get stuff to work on.
Matt Serra,

310
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:25.230
Matt Serra could get his stuff to work on him,
but um,
uh,

311
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.510
he was doing something which was unusual.

312
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.680
And so I talk with them just briefly after clients.
And I said,
you know,

313
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.290
that's interesting what you're doing with these achilles logs cause I don't

314
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:36.030
really do that at all.
It's not something I do.

315
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.720
And he said one sentence,

316
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.360
which completely changed my outlook.

317
00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:46.350
He cause why would you ignore 50% of the human body?
One sentence,

318
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.540
why would you ignore 50% of the human body?
And I looked and I was like,

319
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.400
I don't know why,
why would you?
It makes no sense.

320
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.230
And we never talked again.
And then he went back to California.

321
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.790
We don't want to become too,
too time ADCC champion mostly with Laila lungs.
Um,

322
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.980
but what Dean gave me was not technique,
didn't show me a single technique,

323
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.080
but he gave me at point of view as you give a man a point of view,

324
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.550
you can change them.
Okay,
you can,
we can work from there.

325
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.380
That was the influence.
And um,
my Sensei,

326
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.420
Henzel Gracie was at an extremely,
uh,
liberal minded professor of Jujitsu.

327
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.790
He would let us do whatever we wanted.
Okay.

328
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.730
He wasn't one of those guys in know no.
One in my academy studying lake walks.

329
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:36.870
He was never like that.
He was,

330
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.650
he would allow students to go in any direction they want it provided they could

331
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:43.740
prove it was effective.
Um,

332
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.830
so I started studying leg locks and that's where I'm going to come to the second

333
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:53.760
question,
which you asked,
which is why did leg logs have such a bad reputation?

334
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.000
And you did.
So it's curious,
right?
We don't got this way about Alex.
Um,

335
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.460
I'm going to run through the main criticisms and your,

336
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.710
you'll be my witness on this jury.

337
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.810
I'm sure you heard the same criticisms a thousand times.

338
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.980
You would always hear people refer to Lagos in the following way.
The fruit,

339
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.720
the first criticism,
they were too dangerous,
okay?
If you,

340
00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:12.210
if you allow people to do leg walks,

341
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.880
everyone would be injured in a week and units would be impossible.

342
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.250
So that was the first quarter system you would always hear.

343
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.050
The second great criticism is they didn't work.
Okay.
Um,

344
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.000
you might be to tap out a white belt with a heel hook,

345
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:25.950
but if you are a world championship level,

346
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.910
you never got to tap anybody that didn't work at high levels.
That by itself,

347
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:31.910
those two criticisms seem to go in opposite directions.
If they're,

348
00:20:31.911 --> 00:20:35.070
if they're really that dangerous but they don't work,
how does that,

349
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.300
how do those two gel?

350
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.760
They are either incredibly dangerous to the point where they can't be practice

351
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.330
or they don't work that they did the two arguments contradict each other.

352
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.330
Then you hear other arguments that they were positionally unsound that if you

353
00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:48.100
were in top position

354
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.090
<v 4>and you went for a leg lock,
you would lose position.
And that was,
it is Austin.</v>

355
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.500
Okay.
That's a criticism with no merit because it,

356
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.590
Chris St criticism applies to guillotines on bonds,
et cetera.

357
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:02.320
You can be mounted on someone,
go for an arm,
lock in the loose position,

358
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:05.620
end of bottom,
but no one criticizes ambos.
Um,

359
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.850
so as I went through the reasons why people criticized leg logging,

360
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.960
none of them really made sense.
So I started asking myself,
well,

361
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.860
often the reasons people give as opposed to what the real reasons are a very

362
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:22.840
different and the more I thought about it,

363
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.310
the more I thought the real reason people donate.

364
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:29.080
Leg locks runs much deeper than that.

365
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.640
Let's understand Jujitsu for what it is.

366
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.260
Jujitsu is a systems based approach to fighting,

367
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.400
okay?
What is the system of design Jujitsu?

368
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.410
While it can be described in a few different ways,

369
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:48.430
I'm going to give you one rendition which is pretty simple and will resonate

370
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:49.900
with most of your listeners.

371
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.250
Jujitsu is a system based around four distinct steps.

372
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.780
You can add steps,
you can subtract steps,
but the,

373
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.110
the rendition I'm going to give you now is publicly probably the most widely

374
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:04.240
known.
Okay.

375
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.810
Let's say a friend of yours asked for advice on fighting.

376
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.420
He knows you're a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu expert.

377
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.170
You're a black belt and resigned you to too.
And he said to me,
Joe Rogan,

378
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:16.540
tell me I didn't know anything.

379
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.010
I want to fight someone else using your procedures.

380
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.310
What are the steps?
It was only just said,
what's the system literate?
Uh,

381
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.990
what is a system that had espouses,

382
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.550
you're going to see always that step number one is take your opponent to the

383
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:34.570
ground.
Okay.
Why?
What he,

384
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.010
why do you think the ground is so special?

385
00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:39.550
Why did rezone Jess who choose the ground as step number one of it system,

386
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.713
why do you think,

387
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.970
<v 1>well,
it all came out of judo,
right?</v>

388
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.110
So Brazilian Jiu Jitsu took the effective submission techniques of judo and then

389
00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:52.170
just refine them.
That's these dog,
the reason.
But what's the,

390
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.120
what's the mechanical physical reason?

391
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.650
Because you can control someone on the ground far better,
right?

392
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.430
You can control people.

393
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.570
Loma Chenko con control suite from the standing position with angle and distance

394
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.470
is different ways to control people.
Yes.
In boxing,

395
00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:09.240
if you only are boxing,
but why the ground?
Why did they choose the ground?

396
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:10.280
What's the mechanical reason?

397
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.390
What happens when you take a human being to the ground?

398
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.620
While there's a whole barrier behind them that you can press them against?

399
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.330
What about if you're in bottom position?

400
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.480
While you could use that barrier as leverage?

401
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.610
<v 4>True.
But there's something that occurs when someone goes down to the ground.</v>

402
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.860
It's something big that you may be missing here.
What am I missing?

403
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.770
What's the most explosive event and the Olympic Games?

404
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.680
The the event that probably requires more

405
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.260
transfer of energy and development of kinetic energy than any other,

406
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.560
there's a bunch you name,

407
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:47.990
but one of them for me is always going to be the javelin throw.

408
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.560
The javelin throw involves a full powered sprint,

409
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.333
a jump,

410
00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:00.290
a massive explosive tuning of both hips and shoulders and a throw.

411
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.320
All the quintessential explosive elements of the human body are involved in a

412
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:10.490
javelin thrower,
probably to a greater degree than any other Olympic event.

413
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.900
And as a result,
people can throw a javelin 80 90 meters.

414
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.750
What would happen if you took those same javelin throwers and made them perform

415
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:22.730
the same event on the knees?

416
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.470
Wouldn't be so good.
They probably couldn't throw it more than 10 meters.
Okay,

417
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:32.720
and what's changed the closer they get to the ground,

418
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.290
the list they can employ explosive force.

419
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.720
What's the first thing cowboys do when they go to brand to steer?
Take it down.

420
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.510
Yeah.
They lock up into lakes and they put it down on the ground.

421
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.210
Nobody tries to brand as standing.
Still,

422
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:51.950
you're going to get killed because it can employ explosive dynamic movement to

423
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:54.350
hurt you.
You put them on the ground.

424
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.010
Dynamic explosive movement is massively curtailed.

425
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.790
It takes away the single riskiest element of fighting,

426
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.330
which is quick dynamic movement that can generate kinetic energy.

427
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.500
So step number one,
it was going to do it so it was get it to the ground.

428
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.430
It's inherently safer.
Less things can go catastrophic.

429
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:18.260
We wrong on the ground and in the standing position.
What step number two,

430
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.560
secure.
Dominant position control.
Control,
too vague.

431
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.320
There's many ways to control people.
There's a definite step.

432
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:29.690
You've just taken the guy down.
What's your first thing and was on a unit,
sir?

433
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.210
<v 1>Well,
the first thing I would try to do is get to a dominant position.</v>

434
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.550
What do you mean by that?
Be My pass to side control.

435
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:42.010
Try to match you just sounds it.
It right?
Then get pastas,
legs,
passes legs.

436
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.880
Why legs are strong.
I carry you around.

437
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.710
You could hold a person in position.
They,
they're very good defensively.

438
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.730
They dangerous.
Too dangerous.
Okay.
If I end up inside your legs,

439
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.940
if you're a skilled,
juicy play,
can unlock me.
Can Lake Lock,
we can strangle me.

440
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.940
Even if you were an untrained,
funny,
you could up kick me.
Right.

441
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.610
Mania man has been knocked out by an upkick.
Even an untutored guy conforming up.

442
00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:06.070
Get sure.
Lakes are dangerous.

443
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.380
So step number two is get past those dangerous lakes.
What step number three?

444
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.470
Go for submission.
No,

445
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.200
he must be a 10th planet backbone.
So yeah,
I hate to throw that in some rigid.

446
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.170
Um,
step number three.
Joe,
you're failing on pass.
Okay.

447
00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:29.320
I pass the legs.
Well,
um,
I'm going to try to control,

448
00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:33.160
I'm going to try to either a mount or like I said,
side control.

449
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.630
I'm trying to get you on the right track.

450
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.470
You're trying to work your way through a hierarchy of positions.
Yes.

451
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.710
You got to go to neon belly.
You're going to go side control.

452
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.950
You're going to transition to mount.
You got to transition to rainy,

453
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.040
depending upon

454
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.950
<v 4>my game.
Yeah.
This is sequence of pins.</v>

455
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.180
Once you get past your opponent's legs and Jujitsu encourages you to go through

456
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:53.750
those various pins.
If you look at the sport of Jiu Jitsu,

457
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.760
the pins score different amounts of points.

458
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.490
Neon belly scores a certain amount.

459
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.870
Malapposition school is more ram out in schools more.

460
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.870
Why you have a wondering about then why do we score the pins of Jujitsu

461
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.660
differently?
Well,
there's more available from rear mount.

462
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.460
Of course you have,
uh,
you can,
uh,
of course you can tack the neck.

463
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.700
You can also attack the arms.
You,

464
00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:23.790
you have a positional advantage where you can't be attacked.

465
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.130
Your,
you're behind them.

466
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.870
So it's one of the most superior positions to achieve.
Very good.

467
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.310
What about the Mount Mount?

468
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:38.200
When the striking involves phenomenal,
um,

469
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.470
when you just put your finger on it right there,
Joe,
every one of the pins,

470
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:44.304
if you did soon,

471
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.050
the value of it is measured by your potential to strike your opponent on the

472
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:53.850
ground.
That's why they score more you on belly scores more.

473
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.390
It's I control because from distance of neon belly,

474
00:27:57.391 --> 00:28:00.990
you can strike with more power.
It's inherently unstable.
However,

475
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.550
so at scores less than mount,

476
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.090
which is inherently more stable and offers the same punching platform.

477
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.810
Step number three of Judas,

478
00:28:08.811 --> 00:28:12.150
who was to work your way through a hierarchy of pins with a pins,

479
00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:17.151
a graded in value according to your ability to strike with effect on the ground.

480
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.110
So far,
so far we've got three elements in this system of Jujitsu.

481
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.120
Step number one,
get to fight down to the ground were explosive.

482
00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:30.210
Kinetic energy is less likely to be valid by a dangerous opponent.

483
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.130
Step number two,
get past this dangerous legs.
Step number three,

484
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.620
work your way through this hierarchy of pins.

485
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.910
The pins are understood in terms of the potential to harm your opponent was

486
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:45.030
strikes on the floor.
What step number four?

487
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.530
Step number four is try to secure a position where you can submit them.

488
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.030
You've already got the position.

489
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.250
So what state number four attack with a submission,
correct.

490
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.670
So we've just described was zoned unit.
Soon is a four step system.

491
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.710
It's beautiful,
it's elegant,
and it's deadly effective.
Step number one,

492
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.110
take the fight to the ground.
Take away the danger of explosive kinetic energy.

493
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.130
Step number two,
get passes.
Dangerous legs.
Step number three,

494
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.020
work your way through a hierarchy of pins.

495
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.040
Each one graded upon your ability to harm your opponent with strikes on the

496
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:25.800
ground and set up step number four submissions.

497
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:31.790
And now the question that needs to be asked with a lake logs put into that

498
00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:36.960
system
and where do they fit in?

499
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.930
They don't.
They don't.
They don't.

500
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.350
Traditionally leg walks fit into the system in only one way.

501
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.140
When the system has failed,

502
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.020
when the system's not working and you can't take your opponent down,

503
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.580
you can't pause.
As God,

504
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.270
you can't maintain a dominant position and you can't get the regular submissions

505
00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:00.550
to work.
Fuck it.
Try a leg lock.

506
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.730
Those works was seen lake locks.
We're seeing for generations

507
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.360
as a signal of failure.
When you couldn't get the system to work,

508
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.940
you had to resort to leg logs.
It meant you were a bad Jujitsu player.

509
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:21.850
You couldn't impose the fundamental system of Jujitsu.

510
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.940
And so you chicken down and you went to leg,
lungs.

511
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.660
That's why they were despised.
Mm.

512
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.670
That was the real reason why for generations,
lake logs were dismissed.

513
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.990
You don't think it was because so many people were injured by them that they

514
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.790
were sort of,
you know,
people get injured.

515
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.850
The worst injuries in Jiu who don't come from submission holds the worst

516
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:47.680
injuries in Jujitsu.
Jujitsu come from falling body weight.
When people jump God,

517
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:50.960
when people accidentally poorly performed takedowns.

518
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.330
That's where you see catastrophic injuries.

519
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:57.080
End Units is we sued career ending injuries,
the joint locks of missions.

520
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.870
You're out for a week,
two weeks,
you know,
catastrophic injuries.
Um,

521
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.010
as I said,
go on Youtube and put in God,
Paul gone wrong.

522
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.280
You'll see catastrophic injuries.
See career ending injuries there.

523
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.160
You're not going to see from Aamaz he'll hogs,
et cetera.

524
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.690
You'll see people getting hurt,
but it's a contact sport you expect then.
Okay.

525
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.770
Um,
no.
There's a,

526
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.460
a very simple elegant system resigned units that we just saw one rendition of
it,

527
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:25.600
the four step approach.

528
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.430
And you clearly see leg locks don't fit comfortably into that system.

529
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.333
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

530
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.800
<v 4>What I did is I tried to find an avenue with I could come in</v>

531
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.710
and the results were surprising.
The first thing is al forced it.

532
00:31:42.711 --> 00:31:43.910
Rendition of you did sue

533
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.640
looked at Jujitsu from top position where we took our opponent down to the

534
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:52.990
ground and we were on top of them.
But my study of Jujitsu,

535
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.970
he didn't start from top position started from bottom position.

536
00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.580
If you look at my students in competition,

537
00:31:58.581 --> 00:32:03.581
you will notice that around 80% of the entries into leg logs come from bottom

538
00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:08.390
position or with their opponent behind them.
In other words,

539
00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:10.790
from what a supposedly inferior positions.

540
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.810
So for me it was never a question of losing position when I went for lake logs

541
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.140
because I was already underneath my opponent.
I started underneath,

542
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.870
how can I end up on bottom by going fairly already on bottom.

543
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:29.720
So most of my early work in Lagos is how to get into lake hawks from

544
00:32:29.721 --> 00:32:34.190
disadvantageous positions from underneath or when someone is behind me.

545
00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.060
So I never have felt this problem of,
okay,
I'm,
I'm,

546
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.560
I'm going to position if I go for Lake Long.

547
00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.520
So I could still play a conventional Jujitsu game and have a very,

548
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:47.360
very strong leg or can show that was the first avenue of leg locking,

549
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.010
but things became more interesting when I got further into the leg lock game and

550
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:57.011
I started to realize that as you add lake lungs into the game,

551
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:00.770
you change the very nature of the sport.

552
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.510
If you look at Jujitsu as it's ordinarily practiced,

553
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.050
it's a single direction game.

554
00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.300
If someone is in front of me and I'm standing over them,
do did.

555
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.390
Sue is all about movement from the legs towards the head.

556
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.860
I'm supposed to pass the God worked my way up to chase the chase contact and get

557
00:33:26.531 --> 00:33:29.860
my head next to their head,
either in front of them or behind them,

558
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.510
either mounted or rear mounted.
So jujitsu always goes in one direction.

559
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.930
If you ever get stopped or you lose position,

560
00:33:37.931 --> 00:33:41.380
you just start the process over again.
It's a monodirectional sport.

561
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.180
It always goes from the legs to the head.

562
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.900
Once you start adding leg walks into the game,

563
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.400
Jujitsu become to two directional sport where you can go from the head down to

564
00:33:51.401 --> 00:33:53.590
the legs.
You can go in both directions.

565
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.400
So if I'm passing someone's guard and I somebody can't do it,

566
00:33:57.401 --> 00:34:00.430
I can fall back and go back into the legs.

567
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.310
If I'm site control on someone and they start to recompose the god,

568
00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:04.720
I can fall back into the legs.

569
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.330
I'm going from the upper body down to the lower body.

570
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.410
Traditional Jews who always goes from the lower body directionally up to the

571
00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:14.770
upper body.
So the end up head to head with your opponent.

572
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.100
But once you start adding league logs,

573
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.890
did you just see for the first time becomes a two directional score instead of a

574
00:34:20.891 --> 00:34:21.850
one directional sport.

575
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.650
And you can play your opponent's reactions between the threat of lower body and

576
00:34:26.651 --> 00:34:31.300
upper body in ways it opens up submissions so much more easily than the

577
00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:32.140
traditional game.

578
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.990
<v 3>So if I take you back to the moment where Dean Lester says to you,</v>

579
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.690
why would you ignore 50% of the human body?

580
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.910
You go back and think about this and what is your next step?

581
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.940
Do you just start looking at students and looking at what you're teaching and

582
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:53.360
analyzing positions and you're,
you're still rolling at the time.

583
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.850
<v 4>Correct.
Um,
the first thing that I started to look at is,</v>

584
00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.540
okay,

585
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:04.540
who out there is doing a good job with Blake logging and the owner starts or was

586
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.020
I,
in a lot of people,

587
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.910
what you would see is random success with lake loans.

588
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:15.770
You'd see a guy wins a match here we got wins a match to their,
um,
uh,

589
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.040
most of the imminent leg lock is of that generation are actually coming out of

590
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:21.560
Japan.
You'd have people like roominess Sato had a decent,

591
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:26.360
he'll hook for that time.
I'm an Ra,
I'm an Ra.
That was a little bit preliminary.

592
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:28.700
The MNR came slightly after roominess or they,
they,

593
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.370
they fought each other and grappling matches.

594
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.120
The covenant one was younger than the other.
Um,
uh,
but,
uh,
you know,

595
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.280
they had some success,
I believe even soccer finished Newton with a knee bar.

596
00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:44.250
So the knowledge was there.
Um,
but there was nothing systematic about it.

597
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.120
There was,
there wasn't,

598
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.080
there weren't people who were coming out and just systematically finishing

599
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:53.820
people with one move.
Okay.
Um,
uh,

600
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.420
so there wasn't much in terms of people to study.

601
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.900
So the first thing I started to asking is,
well,
what is the,

602
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:04.470
what is the nature of leg lock in what,
um,
if it's,

603
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.490
it seems to have some problems associated with it.

604
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.910
It's not as controlling as the traditional methods of Jujitsu,

605
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.590
that that was the really the keyword they control on Cam.

606
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.830
Why do people favor things that rain naked strangle so much?

607
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:19.230
Because it's such a controlling position where amount as an incredibly

608
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:23.290
controlling position.
Why do people favor things like cardiac?
Tommy?
I,
they,

609
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:27.900
they um,
triangle because this too is a very inherently controlling position.

610
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.640
All the most high percentage,
uh,

611
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.850
finishing holes in engineers who all have control as their dominant feature.

612
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.220
Okay.
It's hot.
People were going to,
as a result,

613
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.660
one person can continue to use the same move the illogic of success,

614
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.200
um,
uh,
over time against the wide array of opponents.

615
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.490
So everything I,

616
00:36:49.491 --> 00:36:53.380
every question I asked ultimately always came back to control and the one thing

617
00:36:53.381 --> 00:36:57.700
you would see with regards to the use of lake logs in the late 1990s and early

618
00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.740
two thousands was a lack of control,

619
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.400
so all of my studies and immediately went to the notion of control.

620
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.630
Now there are many forms of leg lock,

621
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:16.320
but the ones that interest me the most always come out of what the Japanese call

622
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.890
[inaudible] Rami,
Asha Grimes had generic term.
It just means tangled legs.
Okay.

623
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.160
There are many different forms of ashy growing
ashy.

624
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.160
Grameen is a mechanism by which I can use to have my legs to control my

625
00:37:30.161 --> 00:37:31.340
opponents legs and hips.

626
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:39.150
When I started to do was make a deep study of this notion of Asha Rami.

627
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.910
How am I going to use my legs to control the real estate between my opponent's

628
00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:45.520
knee and his hips?
Preferably on both sides.

629
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.000
Probably the single biggest cliche that you'll hear about Jujitsu is it its

630
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:53.760
position before submission.
At the time,

631
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:57.720
I was primary interest in the idea of control before submission control is a

632
00:37:57.721 --> 00:38:00.330
much deeper and wider concept.

633
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:06.110
Then the basic point structure based positional position for submission model a

634
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:08.100
of Jiu Jitsu.
There's many ways to control.

635
00:38:08.101 --> 00:38:11.070
People have very little to do with with position.
For example,

636
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.790
ashy Rami itself scores nothing and Jujitsu but done well.

637
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:17.850
It can control an opponent just as well as rare mount can,

638
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.860
so I started to see that there are many forms of control that went outside of

639
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:27.210
the traditional basic positional hierarchy resigned you to suit Washi grammy was

640
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:28.044
one of them.

641
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.160
Probably the single greatest key in the development of my leg lock system.

642
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.220
Again came from a simple realization that the greatest mistake that people have

643
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:46.510
made in lake log work prior to the arrival of the squad

644
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:48.941
was it.

645
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:53.800
They made no distinction between the mechanism of breaking and the mechanism of

646
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:58.150
control ashy go Rami was the mechanism of control.

647
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.290
The lock itself,
whether it be a heel hook and Achilles lock,

648
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:04.840
a figure for toe hold.
That was the mechanism of braking.

649
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.870
If you watch 99% of the people out there who claim to be experts in leg locking,

650
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.490
they don't distinguish between the two.
They see,
for example,

651
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:20.380
he'll hooking as a single skill.
There's the lock on the legs,

652
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:24.250
the ashy grammy or whatever term they use for it,
and the lock itself,

653
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.190
they're not distinguished.
They taught it a single skill.

654
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:32.140
You can't differentiate the ashy grammy and the lock and you'll see people

655
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.250
teaching in this manner.

656
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:38.650
What I did was to destroy only distinguished between the two so that my students

657
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:42.370
could all hold an [inaudible] position and switched from one.

658
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:46.360
Now she grabbed me to another and hope people for extended periods of time and

659
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:47.440
inhibit movement.

660
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:53.260
If I can inhibit movement for long periods of time,
I can break you at will.

661
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.950
I can take my time when I come to break you because the control is there.

662
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.300
The control is prime.
To break a second,

663
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.420
the most people is just trolling the ashy Grameen immediately go for the law.

664
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.400
They don't even have so much.

665
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.700
The ashy grammy is described as part of the heel hook.

666
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.140
They don't distinguish between the two.

667
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.790
Once I made that realization in the early two thousands,

668
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.320
that's when the ball started rolling.
That's when,

669
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:25.550
um,
uh,
a significant amount of progress was made.
Um,

670
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.290
I would say that you'll question was an interesting one.
Okay.

671
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.530
You had the inside list,
they gave you the insight.
What was the,

672
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.610
what started you going for it was the making first a critical distinction

673
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:41.050
between control and submission and the case of leg logging between the mechanism

674
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:43.840
of control or she go Rami and the mechanism of breaking,

675
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:46.660
which is the lock itself,
in my case,
the he hug.

676
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:53.630
<v 3>Oh really good example of this is how effective it's been implemented by your</v>

677
00:40:56.011 --> 00:40:59.040
students against real world class presenters,

678
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:04.041
Jiu Jitsu and competitors who don't use these methods like a good one is Gordon

679
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.280
Ryan versus Cyborg Cyborg who is a fucking beast of a man and just a physical

680
00:41:11.551 --> 00:41:12.370
specimen.

681
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.370
A real freak and is known for his Tornado Guard is,

682
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:19.800
you know,
is no stranger to leg locks,

683
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:24.030
is no stranger to any of the positions of Nogi or gay Jujitsu.

684
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.300
But when I watched Gordon wrap him up and control him and before he got the

685
00:41:29.911 --> 00:41:34.700
submission,
you could see Cyborg look befuddled.
Yeah.

686
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.260
He loses the match was over roughly 30 seconds before the submission was
applied.

687
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:39.660
Yeah.

688
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.190
He was just trying to figure out a way out of it and just was nowhere to go.

689
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.910
Yeah.

690
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:48.910
Is it terrifying position to be in for a real world class Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

691
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:53.690
black belt like Cyborg when you watch that,
that match.
I was like,

692
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.710
this is stunning because Gordon is what,
21 years,

693
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.730
which is amazing and Cyborgs in his thirties.
Right.

694
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.610
I think Cyborg has been a blight belt many,

695
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:07.870
many years longer than Gordon is even being doing Jujitsu.
Yeah.

696
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.820
He's one of the best guys in the world.
And when you,

697
00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.860
you look at how well Gordon Dismantle Tim on the ground using the strategy that

698
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:22.130
you just described it,
just see if we could find that.

699
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:26.900
Actually see if he can find Gordon Ryan versus uh,

700
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.100
his,
his actual name is,
I believe you pronounce it a brew.

701
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:36.350
How do you do cardio approved?
He caught,
oh,
Cybil upper.
Yeah,

702
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:41.120
just a lot of cyborgs in the Jujitsu world.
There's a male Cyborg and MMA.

703
00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:45.440
There's a female Cyborg,
I think Cyborg and pitfalls.

704
00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.050
So we're watching it here now.

705
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:53.380
And you see Cyborg who's this fucking tank of a man and Gordon Ryan was quite a

706
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:59.900
physical specimen himself,
but much younger guy.
It hasn't.

707
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.730
How long has John Gordon Been Doing Jujitsu?

708
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.230
<v 2>I believe it's between six and a half and seven years total now.</v>

709
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.320
<v 3>That's fucking crazy.
And,
and immediately he dives under,</v>

710
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:11.243
<v 5>gets low</v>

711
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.740
<v 3>using butterfly guard
and so his,
what he's trying to do,</v>

712
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.010
um,
Gordon is trying to do what with Cyborg his legs.

713
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:21.670
<v 2>Uh,</v>

714
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.970
the first thing that Gordon Ryan needs to do is establish inside position with

715
00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:27.690
his feet.
If you,
uh,

716
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.850
probably the single biggest uh,
uh,

717
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.730
starting point for any kind of Asha Rami based game.

718
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.030
If you want to remember anything about this,
Joe,
remember this,

719
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.710
whenever you go into lake lungs,

720
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:45.750
the person whose feet dominate the inside position will always dominate the ashy

721
00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:46.620
go rami game.

722
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.500
That's the heuristic that I teach all of my students called and Ryan has just

723
00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:50.780
established inside position,
right?

724
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.860
<v 3>We're just pulled him in,
which is interesting.</v>

725
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.160
Cyborg literally pulled him in with his feet inside.

726
00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.510
<v 2>You have a Gordon's feet.</v>

727
00:43:58.511 --> 00:44:00.940
We're positioned in a way where they could own me end up in,

728
00:44:00.941 --> 00:44:02.040
in the inside position.

729
00:44:02.041 --> 00:44:04.620
So that's the first thing he's got to establish inside position with the feet.

730
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.490
He knows damn well if his feet occupied the inside position,
wherever they go,

731
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.370
he's going to get to the,
uh,
the ashy grammy and his opponent.

732
00:44:11.371 --> 00:44:14.580
What about a stop now?
Can we freeze it there?
Pass.

733
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.690
Okay.
Uh,
actually can you go back a little bit with,
uh,

734
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.420
with overshot to sell at all?
Okay.

735
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.910
Right about here again,

736
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:28.050
initially there's a battle going on here for inside foot position.

737
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.060
Cyborg is an extremely well trained and opponent

738
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.100
<v 4>and he's doing a good job of trying to backstage with his left leg.</v>

739
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.420
He knows that if he keeps both of us feet on the lefthand side of Gordon Ryan's

740
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:42.930
body,
he will be able to prevent his opponent getting inside position.

741
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:45.480
So he's doing the right thing.
He's,
he's doing a good job.
He had cyborgs,

742
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:49.020
not naive.
He's,
as you said before,
he's a multi time world champion.
He's very,

743
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:52.590
very good.
He's not lake locking someone who doesn't understand what's going on.

744
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.410
He knows what Gordon Ryan wants.
Uh,

745
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.070
there's a battle here for inside foot position.
Cyborg is doing the right thing.

746
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:00.060
He's going into a back step.

747
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.520
He's going to post his right hand on the floor and try and backstep out.

748
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.820
Let's go just a little further forward into the video.
Got Freeze.

749
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:09.480
I go back just a fraction.

750
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.243
<v 0>Just a little more.</v>

751
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.910
<v 4>Okay.
What is Gordon's right,
right foot have</v>

752
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.350
uh,
his,
his right foot.
It looks like it's hard to see here,

753
00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:28.990
but it looks like he's got,
he's got inside position with one foot.

754
00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.000
He's got inside position with one foot.

755
00:45:31.001 --> 00:45:33.850
The whole question is what's going to happen with cyborgs left leg.

756
00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.340
Now we've got a battle between Gordon Ryans,
left leg and cyborgs.

757
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:44.350
Left leg.
Okay.
How the battle goes from here,
we'll come down to one thing.

758
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.950
Who Wins that battle?
Okay,
go forward.

759
00:45:47.951 --> 00:45:52.300
Just a little more hook.
Slump right away.
Okay.

760
00:45:52.301 --> 00:45:56.290
Cold Ryan just won the battle.
Essentially at this point,
the fight is over.

761
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:04.870
The only question is how long is it going to take?
Why am I so confident?
Am I,

762
00:46:04.871 --> 00:46:07.810
am I an asshole?
Am I saying this because I'm an asshole?
No,

763
00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:09.640
I'm saying because I know what's happening.

764
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:15.520
I gave you one of the keynotes of the leg walking game already.

765
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.740
I'll say it again because it's so important.

766
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:23.070
The man whose feet dominate the inside position will always dominate the ashy

767
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.550
grammy game.
Now the second,

768
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.850
whenever you go to a tech,
someone's leg,

769
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.690
90% of the resistance on the leg you're attacking comes from the other leg.

770
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:45.180
It's so important.
I'm going to say it to you again.
Whenever I go to a tech,

771
00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:46.440
my opponent's right leg,

772
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.920
90% of the resistance is going to come from his left leg.

773
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.850
We talked about control,
the foundational principle of control and leg logging.

774
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.020
As a principal,
I referred to as double trouble,

775
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.120
double trouble as a simple idea that if I control both of my opponent's legs,

776
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:08.040
he does no longer has the opportunity as sick and lake to defend the first,

777
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.180
so the amount of trouble that you've put them in is literally doubled in a

778
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:16.050
matter of seconds.
Gordon Ryan has a hold of Cyborgs,

779
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.330
right leg with his left arm,
and he has a,

780
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.270
a hold of cyborgs left leg with his legs.

781
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.780
Why was I so confident that the match is over at this point?

782
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.310
Because both of cyborgs legs are now controlled by Gordon Ryan.

783
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.740
He is just attained double trouble.

784
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.640
Now let's slowly advance the video.

785
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:49.070
Do you see how cyborgs legs are in a straight line?
He's having a very,

786
00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:52.000
very hard time holding his base.
Is The con stop?

787
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.860
Can you go back just a fraction

788
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.090
right about here?
Freeze.
Okay.

789
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:08.810
Al whole approach to Jitsu was based around the idea of putting wages around our

790
00:48:08.811 --> 00:48:13.190
opponent's body so that we can inhibit movement,
uh,
which functions just as,

791
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.390
um,
a door stopper stops the door from moving in a breeze on Cam.

792
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.780
The only thing better than a wage as a reinforced wage,

793
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.020
that's where the wage is locked in place by another part of your body.

794
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.040
Gordon Ryan currently has inside position with the right leg.

795
00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.150
He has control of Cyborgs,
other leg with his arm.

796
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:33.530
So both legs have some degree of control,

797
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:38.390
but he's about to massively reinforced that control by locking a triangle or a

798
00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:41.930
Sankaku around his opponent's leg.
In order for that to happen,

799
00:48:41.931 --> 00:48:44.240
he's going to have to lift his hips slightly off the floor so that he can

800
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:48.050
elevate over cyborgs.
Left knee,
watch the video.

801
00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:54.050
There's the elevation,
there's the lock.
Freeze,
freeze.
Now he's got cyborgs.

802
00:48:54.051 --> 00:48:56.330
Two lakes in a straight line.
That means cyborgs.

803
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.840
Only mechanism of posting or saving his balances,
his left arm.

804
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.070
That's all these got left at this point.
The fight is done.

805
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:11.270
Cyborgs right leg is controlled by Golden Ryan's left arm.
Cyborgs.

806
00:49:11.271 --> 00:49:15.750
Left leg is controlled by a reinforced wage to strength of both Gordon rines

807
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.540
legs locked up in a triangle.
Cyborgs actually a weight division heavier,

808
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:23.480
I believe then Gordon,
but it doesn't matter at this point.

809
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:28.010
Both hips a controlled.
This is a full state of double trouble.

810
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:33.040
Both legs controlled and a breaking mechanism in place is an asha grammy on the

811
00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:35.420
lake.
You can break someone from Dan.

812
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:41.180
Cyborg knows his only method of not being finished is to keep his hips over.

813
00:49:41.181 --> 00:49:42.230
Gordon Ryan's house.

814
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.950
So the next battle is how has Gordon Ryan going to put sidewalks,

815
00:49:45.951 --> 00:49:49.940
hips on the ground?
What's saving Cyborg is his left hand.

816
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.620
Let's see how the battle goes.

817
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.170
The battle just got lost.
The hips went down.
Why was it so easy?
Stop.

818
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.970
Why was it so easy?
I don't know.
Tell me.

819
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.080
Do you see that right knee?
Yes.
That's what pushed him over.

820
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.760
The right knee went into the pocket of cyborgs.
Left hip.

821
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.970
That made a directionality of force,

822
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.440
was slightly away from the one base of support that Cyborg had left,

823
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:25.300
which was his left hand.
So he got sat on his hips.
Now go forward.

824
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:30.240
Just a little
and freeze.

825
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.100
What do you see,
Joe?
In what way?
What do you,

826
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:40.370
what do you want me to look up?
What do you see?

827
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:43.280
Both legs are wrapped up but be more precise?
Uh,

828
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:46.820
well he has incredible control with his right leg.
Um,

829
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:51.230
the way he's got his right leg and his left leg triangled he's got the cyborgs

830
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:56.530
right foot talk deep under his arm and he also has the left foot in there as

831
00:50:56.541 --> 00:51:01.130
well.
So he's completely wrapped up with his legs and his arms.
Very good.
Okay.

832
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.560
Let's bring in a few points here.
First,

833
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.960
if you want to immobilize a human being and preventing it from moving,

834
00:51:05.961 --> 00:51:09.800
and what are the best things you can ever do is lock their legs together.

835
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.900
You get a dangerous prisoner.
What's the first thing you do?

836
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.210
Handcuff his feet together and handcuff.

837
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.360
Cup his hands together and he's no longer dangerous.
Okay.
He has Cyborg,

838
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.100
one of the most dangerous Judas who plays in the world,

839
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:21.060
but with the two of his feet slunk together,
he's,

840
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.880
he's effectively neutralized oncom pants.
Most importantly,

841
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.180
we've got a very interesting distinction here between what we call a primary and

842
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:33.770
a secondary leg.
Which leg is the Asha Rami locked up on?

843
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.070
Well,
he's got the left leg is was triangle.

844
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.330
That's the,
yeah,
she rummy lake.
We call that the primary leg.

845
00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:50.790
The ashy go Rami has locked on cyborgs.
Left leg.
That's the primary leg.

846
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:53.730
The other leg,

847
00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:57.390
remember our principal for 90% of all resistance comes from the second leg.

848
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:04.130
The arm controls the secondary leg and the legs control the primary leg.

849
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:09.600
So the resistance from the secondary leg is pushing off and trying to separate

850
00:52:09.601 --> 00:52:11.880
the lock.
This numerous things he could pummeled with foot.

851
00:52:11.881 --> 00:52:14.430
He could put his foot on the floor and turn.
You could invert his body.

852
00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:17.430
There's a thousand things he could do,
but he's not doing any of them.

853
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.790
If you control that leg.
Betsy,
important theme.

854
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.240
So golden boy Golden.
Ryan's up the body.

855
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.900
His left arm controls the secondary leg and his lower body,

856
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.740
the ashy grammy controls the primary leg as a result.

857
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.740
What do you think of cyborgs?
Ability to move.
He's fucked.

858
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:38.520
He's completely nullified.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go a little further.

859
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:47.650
Freeze.
Now cyborg is doing.
All he can do.

860
00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:52.750
Movement has been taken away from him,
so his only option is to fight the hands.

861
00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.680
Gordon Ryan understands that he has control of the secondary leg,

862
00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:04.810
but he needs to make a transition to the primary leg.
In order to break Cyborg,

863
00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:10.900
he's going to have to release the secondary leg.
Now that's a,

864
00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.720
that's a scary thing.
If you release a secondary leg,

865
00:53:13.721 --> 00:53:17.560
then your opponent Cosat to Findian himself again.
So he's got a measure.

866
00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:20.260
How he releases the secondary leg.

867
00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:25.030
So it is a battle for angle here.
Cyborg is battling for the hands,

868
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:28.920
but Gordon Ryan hasn't even started the hand flight yet.

869
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.080
He still in the control.
Fine.

870
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.830
His only interest is in holding the position.

871
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:41.490
Go a little further.
Freeze.

872
00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.000
Why did golden switch his right hand to the knee?

873
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:52.090
Well,
that's the leg that can control,
or a secondary late secondary leg,

874
00:53:52.091 --> 00:53:55.420
which can defend.
Um,
I would imagine he's distracting him.

875
00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:01.120
Why his Golden Ryan's head leaning to the right hand side?
I'm not.
Why?

876
00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.970
Because that society needs to take some Cybil.

877
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:08.230
If cyborg turns his head to the other side.

878
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.130
When Gordon Ryan releases the secondary leg,
he's going to be a problem

879
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.630
is a battle for angle.
Now that no one sees

880
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.800
Gordon Ryan's head tells the whole story here.

881
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.680
Let's go a little further.

882
00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.510
Freeze board.
Ryan is already beginning to transition to the primary leg.

883
00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:37.500
It's a way he's got it locked up.
It's just so horrific to yes,

884
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.140
the two of them crossed over each other.

885
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:43.340
Now at some point he's got uncross the legs to get to the primary leg.

886
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.830
Let's go a little further.

887
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.840
Cyborg still engage in the hand fight.

888
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.620
Now golden is about to make his transition to the hand fight.

889
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:01.653
<v 0>Okay,</v>

890
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.793
<v 4>freeze.</v>

891
00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.350
Gordon Ryan's made the critical release of the secondary leg.

892
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.710
This is where things start to get interesting.

893
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.160
Cyborg has perhaps tragically sat on his right hip,

894
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.900
which means he has no ability to use his secondary leg to escape,

895
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.810
and because he's holding Gordon Ryan's arm,

896
00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:29.860
he has no ability now to invert his body and go into a attorney and escape.

897
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.840
Now Gordon Reinders needs to release the right arm.

898
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:36.783
Let's go further.

899
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.720
Freeze.
Go back just to here.

900
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:54.380
Okay.

901
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.760
Gordon Ryan is about to release a secondary leg freeze right there.

902
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:04.280
Now very slowly.
Take it forward.
Watch Gordon Ryan's left elbow freeze.

903
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.390
Why did he put the elbow there?
I Dunno.

904
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.823
It's a wage.

905
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.480
It's a mobilizing the leg he really wants to attack.

906
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.350
He switched his arm position from controlling the secondary leg,

907
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:22.810
which he hasn't yet fully,

908
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:29.560
but he's put his elbow in front of the toes of the primary leg to keep that

909
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:34.350
primary life from extending.
Correct and to be able to transition effortlessly.

910
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:39.310
Enter the lock or he needs now is to release the right arm.

911
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:43.900
Cyborg knows if he loses the right arm.
The fight is lost.

912
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.680
Continuing Gordon goes back to our position.

913
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.440
Freeze,
freeze.
Go back just to here.

914
00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.730
Why did Gordon Ryan,
when the hand fight battle

915
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:15.670
freeze gold Cyborg is one of the strongest people in Jujitsu.

916
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:20.170
He's got two hands on a guy in a weight division lower than him.

917
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:22.600
Why can't he hold,
why did he lose the arm?

918
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.870
Why Watch Gordon Ryan's right elbow?

919
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.810
What did you say?
Sent,

920
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:37.663
let me say that again.

921
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.690
He's just lifting it up and pulling it away.
What is he doing?

922
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.430
He changed the angle through the elbow.

923
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.560
There's a grip over and a grip under.
If you just pull,

924
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:55.090
you'll never release the arm.
Right?

925
00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:00.300
He changed the elbow position so that one grip was lost and then a push poll

926
00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:05.290
with the elbow and a slip
once,
continue forward.
Now

927
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.470
he's got the left arm set.

928
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.680
As soon as the hands touch and sidebar just taps before he even gets a chance to

929
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:16.430
extend it because he knows the games lost.
Uh,

930
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:21.470
he knew the game was last long before then.
That's pretty odd.
Damn impressive.
Mm.

931
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.510
Yes.
And yet you'll see this with almost all of my students.

932
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.250
I have seen that with all your students,

933
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:32.251
which is so bizarre now how many people are recognizing this system and trying

934
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:39.550
to mimic it or trying to find out some sort of a counter attack to it?
Um,

935
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.560
that's an interesting question.
I'm a,

936
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:45.700
I'm told is actually kind of like an industry of people who try to break what we

937
00:58:45.701 --> 00:58:48.040
do down and mimic it.
Um,

938
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:52.180
I know there's people putting out numerous instructionals they've,

939
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.910
they've watched what the squad does and tries to,
to,
to break it down.

940
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.070
Um,
that's,
that's good.
And it's natural.
I,

941
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.430
I'd be doing the same thing if someone else was coming out and we're making

942
00:59:03.431 --> 00:59:08.050
people where they've given me a lot studying what they're doing to.
Um,
so yeah,

943
00:59:08.051 --> 00:59:10.510
there,
there does seem to be an industry of that.
Um,

944
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:12.480
the question is how successful I think.

945
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.600
Do you see any other groups of people coming out and just exclusively clinician

946
00:59:18.911 --> 00:59:21.980
people with the same moves?
Time and time again,
years at a time at

947
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.000
<v 2>all levels of competition.</v>

948
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:27.930
<v 3>No,
you're,
you're seeing more 10th planet guys do that now.
10th Planet guys have,</v>

949
00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:32.650
um,
and giving you all the credit in the world by the way that they've,
um,

950
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.360
started transitioning to a lot more leg lock attacks,
leg lock defense

951
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.590
<v 2>trading on that.
Yeah.
It's um,
uh,</v>

952
00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:46.070
what we find is most people definitely struggle with defending it and um,

953
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.530
uh,
you know,
this has been around for quite a while now.

954
00:59:49.531 --> 00:59:54.531
It's been five years since the score really started pushing this publicly and

955
00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:58.740
um,
uh,
it seems that there's still going to be some,

956
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.290
eventually people will figure things out.
It's just the way she progress works.

957
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.110
But,
um,
uh,

958
01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:10.170
I think at this point it's pretty clear that people have changed their minds

959
01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:10.851
about lego walks.

960
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:13.590
People I think are recognizing that there's something different going on here,

961
01:00:13.591 --> 01:00:18.180
that this is a control based approach to leg locks rather than a,
you know,

962
01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:22.800
a speed and power boast,
a approach to leg logs and,
um,

963
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:23.760
uh,

964
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.330
the evidence for its success really comes from the nature of the squad itself.

965
01:00:27.331 --> 01:00:30.540
If you look at the three founding members of the squat,
Eddie Cummins,
Gordon,

966
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:35.310
Ryan and Gary Thompson,
all three have very,
very different body types.

967
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.630
All three have very,

968
01:00:36.631 --> 01:00:40.680
very different personalities and yet all three use a very similar game.

969
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:45.390
Um,
two of those three athletes came from nowhere.

970
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:50.280
They had no competition record before they started training.
Uh,

971
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:54.060
with me at the hands of Gracie Academy.
One of them had a competition record.

972
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.910
He was a,
I believe Gary [inaudible] was a brown belt,

973
01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:01.260
a competitor in the ghee and,
but he had no legal game.

974
01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:05.090
He was a guy who was essentially no one forced scrambling from bottom half guard

975
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:08.700
and using Randwick naked strangles and out of scrambles,
um,

976
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:12.600
strangles out of scrambles.
My God,
then we would have such a tongue twister.
Um,

977
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.580
uh,
so Gary,

978
01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:17.550
Tom was a particularly interesting case because he came to me is an already

979
01:01:17.551 --> 01:01:20.160
developed athlete and he's trained under a very good friend of mine,

980
01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:24.030
Tom to blast,
um,
and completely changed his game.

981
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:27.660
So that showed something very interesting that showed that someone could already

982
01:01:27.661 --> 01:01:32.260
have a developed game and then take on this and change their games.

983
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.250
That was a particularly interesting case with the case of Eddie Cummings and

984
01:01:35.251 --> 01:01:39.300
Gordon Ryan.
They came to me early in their development.
So they,
they,
um,

985
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.400
they took it on wholesale as it were.

986
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:47.330
<v 3>I think this style and approach and one of the things that's so fascinating</v>

987
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:52.331
about it is it really requires someone like you to systematically break it down

988
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:58.100
the way you have it described it.
Um,
I've done Jujitsu for 20 years,

989
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:03.320
but I never stopped and thought of all the positions in the system,

990
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.590
all the steps in the system,
take the fight to the ground,

991
01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:08.840
can't pass the dangerous legs,
you know,
uh,

992
01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.240
achieve some sort of a dominant position and go for the submission.

993
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:14.090
I didn't do that.
I knew,
I knew what was,

994
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.930
<v 2>what I find with most unit supplies is they know what they're doing on an</v>

995
01:02:17.931 --> 01:02:20.010
unconscious level.
Yes.
My job

996
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.850
<v 4>as a coach is to make it conscious.
Okay.
Um,
now for me,</v>

997
01:02:23.851 --> 01:02:25.920
the most interesting thing when I,

998
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.320
when I first had to think about Jujitsu is a system.
Okay.

999
01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:33.210
I did that when I wrote a book for my,
for my Sensei Henzel Gracie.
Um,

1000
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.680
he asked me to write a book and I started thinking deeply about,
you know,

1001
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.070
what is this thing that I study?
I spend all day on the man's,

1002
01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:41.730
what am I doing exactly.
And um,
when you start consciously thinking about it,

1003
01:02:41.731 --> 01:02:42.540
okay,

1004
01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:46.980
breaking it down to steps you see presented gets was a step by step system.

1005
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.920
My question was,
can I go further than that?
If you did,

1006
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:55.440
sue was a simple single system.

1007
01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:01.220
What about if he divided Jujitsu up into niche areas and instead of having one

1008
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.560
overall system,

1009
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.240
you had an overall system with many subsystems within it.

1010
01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.720
So he had a leg system,
a bag system,
the front headlocks system,
a Kimora system.

1011
01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.930
My approach that you did,
sue,
is it,

1012
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:23.460
I had recognized it much of the success of early procedures who came from it's

1013
01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:27.360
systematic nature of the fact that it was a systems based approach to Jujitsu.

1014
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.770
And I took

1015
01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.900
various niche areas and created systems within systems.

1016
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:38.180
Then things started getting interested in when I started integrating the system

1017
01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:41.440
so that one subsystem failed.
You could transfer to another.

1018
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:47.700
That meant that my students could put opponents who were trained much,

1019
01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.830
much longer than they had into a niche area,

1020
01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.500
which my students had so much knowledge of.

1021
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.480
So much training in that isolated niche domain to take could take someone who

1022
01:03:58.481 --> 01:04:00.520
had trained three,
four times,

1023
01:04:00.521 --> 01:04:04.300
longs in themselves and have more knowledge in that one domain.

1024
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:06.760
Then they're much more experienced opponent did,

1025
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.710
and so what you saw with the squad was incredibly speedy progress.

1026
01:04:11.711 --> 01:04:15.130
Whether we're getting wins against people who are trained to three times longer

1027
01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:15.964
than they had,

1028
01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:21.200
and this idea of what I call integrated subsystems instead of having Jujitsu was

1029
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.670
just one simple single system.
You keep the overall system of Jujitsu,

1030
01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:28.060
but you have subsistence within it.
Each one integrated with the other,

1031
01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.710
so that one's one system fails,

1032
01:04:29.711 --> 01:04:33.370
you can pass off to another and it goes back and forth until you get the win.

1033
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.500
That was my approach to Jujitsu.

1034
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.440
That's one I want to do as him if I can innovate.
You did.

1035
01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.350
So in any given direction,
that's probably the one I would push the most.

1036
01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.230
Now throughout this time,

1037
01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.560
your dealing with some pretty significant injuries and physical limitations that

1038
01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:52.630
you've had.
Um,
tell me about those,

1039
01:04:52.631 --> 01:04:56.710
what those were and what and how those hindered.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
uh,

1040
01:04:56.711 --> 01:05:00.880
when I was in my early teens,
I was involved in a,
um,
a rugby injury where my,

1041
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:05.230
my knee was massively injured.
Um,
over the next,

1042
01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.100
uh,
six years.
Uh,

1043
01:05:08.101 --> 01:05:12.590
I would dislocate my knee ligaments appear to be,
um,

1044
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.070
severely compromised every six months or so I get a fresh,
which would be

1045
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.090
<v 2>severe or not be on crutches.</v>

1046
01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:23.890
I spent a significant amount of my teenage years on crutches,
um,

1047
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:29.460
around the age of 19.
I had one last injury and,
uh,

1048
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:34.440
my knee just seem to have no power and it seems like,
uh,

1049
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.360
I walk with a limp and,
um,

1050
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:41.510
you must remember this is in the 1980s in New Zealand and this is pre Mris,

1051
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:46.360
um,
preauthorize scopic surgery.
The doctors said,
well,

1052
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:50.050
we can do an operation where we shortened the ligaments so there's less

1053
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.560
looseness in there and hopefully you'll Neil be strong again.

1054
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.310
I'm an operation was performed and uh,

1055
01:05:57.311 --> 01:06:00.820
unfortunately the ligaments we'll cut too short.
And as a result,
my,

1056
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:04.030
my leg never straightened again.
Um,

1057
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:11.850
I developed a severe case of arthrofibrosis we might need actually became

1058
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:15.400
deformed and doesn't straighten.
Um,

1059
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.160
simple actions like walking,

1060
01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:21.700
kneeling are extremely painful for me and have been my whole life.

1061
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:27.550
I'm just walking around.
Just walking is painful.
A neediness,
extremely painful.

1062
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.240
And um,
you know,
it's not easy to do.
Just say we did.
There's a lot of kneeling.

1063
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.193
And,
uh,

1064
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.770
also there were other kind of structural problems as they got older because I

1065
01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:40.630
walk with a limp and one leg significantly bent and one straight.
Uh,

1066
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.530
I tend to be completely out of balance,
out of sync with my body.

1067
01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:49.150
So I soon developed a considerable hip and back pain.
Um,

1068
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.950
so this was something I carried with me my whole life.
And,
um,
uh,

1069
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.480
when I started unit two at the age of 28,
uh,
there was a,
there was a concern,

1070
01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.240
you know,
am I going to have to do this?
Well,
fortunately,

1071
01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.290
ground grappling as a rule is generally easier on your body.

1072
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.360
Then standing martial arts,
it is a,
I don't think,
for example,

1073
01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:13.450
with my leg,
I could even become moderately effective at [inaudible].

1074
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:17.620
Taekwondo is something we have to get a jump and land.
I just couldn't do it.
Um,

1075
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.190
whereas a Jujitsu,
because it's on the ground,
you can,
you can become pretty good.

1076
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.720
Um,
so I battled through that and uh,
I'm,

1077
01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.940
I developed a,
a satisfactory degree of competence.
Uh,

1078
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:34.830
uh,
I got up light bulb from Henzel Gracie and I became one of his main teachers.

1079
01:07:34.831 --> 01:07:39.030
So how would you train with such a compromised knee?
Ah,

1080
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.670
you just figured out a way around it.
You just,
you know,

1081
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:47.020
what are you going to do that you never thought,
well boy,
I fucked my knee up.

1082
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:49.870
I don't want to fuck my other knee up to,
you know,

1083
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:52.580
I think at that point you,

1084
01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.140
you just got to go forward and you've got a choice.

1085
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:58.030
You got to sit down and feel sorry for yourself,

1086
01:07:58.031 --> 01:08:00.250
where you're going to do the best you can with what you've gone.

1087
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.840
And how limited was your game because your knee,
I mean,
were you able to,

1088
01:08:03.841 --> 01:08:05.650
standing position was difficult for me,

1089
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.710
but will you ever do triangles and all sorts of different,
I mean,
I had,
you know,

1090
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.150
every week or so I would tweak it and I'd be in pain for a day.
I developed,
um,

1091
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:19.010
a strong for Ibuprofen throughout my life.
Um,
and uh,

1092
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.830
other problems started to emerge.
You speech to the lower back,

1093
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:26.580
lower back is a big issue and gave me problems.
My whole animal.

1094
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.470
Listo now I have a machine I have to show you.
Okay.

1095
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:34.040
That's a called the reverse hyper.
Have you ever heard of it?
Oh yes.
Um,

1096
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:38.190
I believe they were used by a guy called Louis Simmons.
Tom?
Yes.

1097
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.060
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
I can't use one now because they have a hip replacement.

1098
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.110
And when you go up,
it puts extreme shearing force on a hip replacement.

1099
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:52.740
So I can do it with body weight,
but I can't do it with a weight.
So,
um,
uh,

1100
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.690
I'm aware of what they are.
They,
I know many people speak very highly of them,

1101
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.060
but I'm so yeah,
I had this problem and,
uh,

1102
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:06.250
things didn't really become critical until my mid to early forties.

1103
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.070
When,
as a result of walking my whole life with a limp,

1104
01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:13.670
my left hip started to become completely bone on bone.

1105
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.590
So then the problem's doubled because now I had a completely screwed up knee and

1106
01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:19.610
a hip,

1107
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:24.290
but I couldn't get any kind of operations because George St Pierre was fighting.

1108
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:27.420
Chris Weidman was fighting.
They both had great goals.
And I,
I,

1109
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.790
so I delayed the,
uh,

1110
01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.550
the hip operation as long as they could until George had his first retirement

1111
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:35.540
and Chris Weidman,

1112
01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:38.420
what became a world champion and then moved further away to long island.

1113
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:43.220
It wasn't training with me so much.
Um,
at that time I,
uh,

1114
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:48.130
I started training the squad and,
um,
uh,
my first,
uh,

1115
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:52.490
active competitive grappling student was 80 Cummings and,
um,

1116
01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:53.630
uh,

1117
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:58.630
I was able to work effectively with him as best I could with my hip problems.

1118
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:04.260
Uh,
and of course the original lake problem.
Um,
and,
uh,

1119
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:05.250
then at some point I,

1120
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.770
it got to a point where literally if I walked down in New York City block,

1121
01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:13.700
I would have to stop several times and just stand on the side of the road and

1122
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.390
wait for my hip to stop hurting so I could walk in.

1123
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:21.200
It just became impossible to work with.
And I ended up getting a,
a,

1124
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:25.490
a full hip replacement and that's when they shear off the top of your head.
Yeah.

1125
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.060
These bolt down in there with a new hip and that's correct.

1126
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.070
And how does it feel now?
Um,
it's pain free,
which is a wonderful thing for me.
Um,

1127
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:37.640
like any,
uh,
fake Hep is never going to be as strong as your real hip.

1128
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:39.200
This limitations on what I can do there.

1129
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.670
The only problem was that shortly after the hip replacement went and then my

1130
01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:47.090
knee finally collapsed after 30 years of of problems.

1131
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:51.350
And so I'm going to have to get a knee replacement on the same leg.
Yeah.

1132
01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.870
And how do they do that?
One?

1133
01:10:54.130 --> 01:10:57.020
A knee replacements a little bit tricky because you don't get as much bone mass

1134
01:10:57.021 --> 01:10:58.640
to work with.
And um,

1135
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.660
general generally the longevity of knee replacements is not as,
uh,

1136
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:06.340
cause there's much more movement in the need.
And there,
there wasn't a hip,

1137
01:11:06.341 --> 01:11:09.560
there's much greater range of motion.
Um,

1138
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.740
and there's less bone to affects two.

1139
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:16.560
They generally don't have the longevity of a,
a hip replacement.
Um,

1140
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.260
so,
uh,
I'm,
I'm 50 years old,

1141
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:23.190
so ideally you would want a replacement that outlived you,

1142
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:27.960
but I would probably have to get a second knee replacement when I get older to

1143
01:11:27.961 --> 01:11:32.730
replace the first,
which is not ideal,
but I probably gonna have to do it.

1144
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:36.730
<v 3>Well,
who knows what kind of crazy technology they'll have down the line.</v>

1145
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.660
I hope so.

1146
01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.530
I have to give me some kind of superhero leg that turns things around for me.

1147
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:44.470
Yeah.
Well,
you never know.
I mean,
it's just the,

1148
01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:49.471
the nature of the hip replacement is so it's so brutally invasive.

1149
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:50.860
Uh,

1150
01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:55.860
the sheering off the top of the hip and then the rod that's inserted deep into

1151
01:11:55.991 --> 01:12:00.670
the bone of the hip and then all that jazz.
Yeah,
it's a lot.

1152
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:01.870
It's a lot going on there.

1153
01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.470
<v 2>So,
um,
it to,
to answer your question,
uh,
in the early days it was a,</v>

1154
01:12:06.471 --> 01:12:11.060
it was an impediment that I worked around.
Um,
but as I got older,
um,

1155
01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:16.090
I hit to,
uh,
do a first operation and now a second bullet.

1156
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.780
Believe it or not,
Joe,

1157
01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.600
I was actually scheduled to get my knee replacement tomorrow.
Um,

1158
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:26.000
but I didn't do it because Gary Tony is going to be fighting his first MMA fight

1159
01:12:26.001 --> 01:12:30.980
and much 26?
No.
Is He fighting for one FC One FC?
So I,

1160
01:12:30.981 --> 01:12:32.750
if I got the knee replacement now,

1161
01:12:32.751 --> 01:12:35.390
I would not be able to help them get ready for his first MMA fine,

1162
01:12:35.391 --> 01:12:39.910
which I thought would be,
um,
uh,
there's not fear on my part in it,
you know?
And,

1163
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.780
uh,
so I delayed it until after that fight.
Why did he decide on one MC?

1164
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:49.430
That's interesting question.
You'd have to ask.
Gary taught him to be certain.
Um,

1165
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.160
uh,
but he,
uh,

1166
01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.660
I think one of his main fears was that if he went through the amateur route and

1167
01:12:56.661 --> 01:12:58.460
then worked his way towards the UFC,

1168
01:12:58.910 --> 01:13:02.630
there would be problems because he's already an established name in grappling.

1169
01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.080
And I think he was concerned that it would be difficult for them to get people

1170
01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:10.040
to fight amateur,
um,
and uh,

1171
01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.500
and then eventually make its way to the UFC.

1172
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:17.570
Whereas one FC as a fairly well known organization and they were pretty open.

1173
01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.770
They,
he did a grappling match for them and they loved it and were like,
you know,

1174
01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:25.130
are you interested in MMA?
And so he could,
uh,
as it were,

1175
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.890
um,
go into a,

1176
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:32.180
a fairly high level of MMA right from the start as opposed to do a long

1177
01:13:32.181 --> 01:13:36.230
Securitas amateur route and then battle his way into the UFC.
I believe,

1178
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.870
don't quote me on this,
but I believe that was the logic behind it.

1179
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:41.990
<v 3>Hmm.
Now are you a book?</v>

1180
01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.460
So when you're demonstrating techniques,
so you're demonstrating them verbally

1181
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:48.830
<v 2>after the hip replacement.</v>

1182
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:53.330
I could only do it verbally and I had to trust and uh,
my,

1183
01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.600
my students,
80 Cummings,
Gary,
Tom and Gordon,
Ryan and others.
Brian Gluck isn't,

1184
01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:02.540
no one knows him,
but he's one of my,
uh,
great students.
Um,
I would,
uh,

1185
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:07.010
point with a stick and uh,
they would do the most for me.

1186
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:11.440
Um,
since then I've gotten a little better and I like to demonstrate as best can

1187
01:14:11.441 --> 01:14:12.870
this days when I,

1188
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:16.960
I can barely walk and on those days I'll have the students go through.

1189
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:20.560
Sometimes there's certain standing techniques that I had a little risky for me

1190
01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:25.440
to do and I'll have students demonstrate those.
But,
um,
uh,
I,

1191
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.020
I do what I can on the days that I teach.

1192
01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:34.370
<v 3>It is quite fascinating that a guy who was catastrophic injuries of his leg is</v>

1193
01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:40.671
one who was known for being an innovator and crushing people's lives.

1194
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:44.430
There is something kind of a strange about that.
Yeah.

1195
01:14:44.431 --> 01:14:46.320
You were joking around about it being revenge.
Yeah.

1196
01:14:46.321 --> 01:14:50.610
This is missing my revenge against the world.
If God took away my leg,

1197
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:54.930
I'm taking away everybody else's.
Um,
and so,
um,
yeah,
there,

1198
01:14:54.931 --> 01:14:56.280
there was something ironic about them.

1199
01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.710
Now when your teaching this system and um,
you,

1200
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:06.420
you're showing all the guys in the squad,
the Donna,
her death squad,

1201
01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.700
do you have,
um,

1202
01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.530
like do you have it worked out to the point where it's like you have a

1203
01:15:13.531 --> 01:15:14.364
curriculum?

1204
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:17.580
Like do you have like I never liked the word curriculum because that kind of

1205
01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:18.410
implies that it's all right,

1206
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:22.650
<v 2>worked out in advance and you know,
it's done step by step.
Um,</v>

1207
01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:26.670
I come in on any given day and I'm,
I'm there seven days a week.

1208
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.370
I watch all of my athletes every single day.

1209
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.010
They didn't do anything without me watching them do it.

1210
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.390
So I know at the end of every day what they need to work on tomorrow because I'm

1211
01:15:36.391 --> 01:15:40.440
there.
So it's not like a set curriculum early,
you know,

1212
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.650
I know that on April 13 I'm going to do this and it's not like that.

1213
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.260
It's like I saw you train yesterday,

1214
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:48.480
I saw where you fucked up and I saw where you were.
Good.

1215
01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:50.400
So tomorrow we're working this

1216
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.060
<v 3>what an amazing resource for those guys to have some like you standing over
them,</v>

1217
01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:59.440
watching them and analyzing their positions and techniques and progress.

1218
01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:02.600
<v 2>That's um,
that's generous of you to say.
Um,</v>

1219
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:07.750
but I always feel that my students are more of a resource to me than I am to

1220
01:16:08.991 --> 01:16:13.430
them.
I've been blessed through my entire coaching career to have some truly

1221
01:16:13.431 --> 01:16:14.480
remarkable students,

1222
01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.700
some of whom are famous and known to you and many others who aren't.
And,

1223
01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:21.230
um,
uh,

1224
01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.980
whatever debt they out to me,

1225
01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:28.820
I feel I owe at least as much to them.
Um,

1226
01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.810
my students literally give me everything.
I'm,

1227
01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.270
I'm a notoriously difficult person to get along with him,
demanding I'm,

1228
01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.590
I'm a perfectionist.
I'm,
I can be downright unpleasant when my body's in pain,

1229
01:16:39.591 --> 01:16:44.030
I'm short tempered.
Um,
and yet they're like angels.

1230
01:16:44.031 --> 01:16:48.440
They based stick in there and they tough it out and they,
they give so much time,

1231
01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:52.100
so much effort,
so much thought.
And as I said,

1232
01:16:52.101 --> 01:16:55.640
whatever resource I am to them,
they,
they give it right back.

1233
01:16:55.641 --> 01:16:56.630
There are a resource to me.

1234
01:16:57.130 --> 01:17:00.790
<v 3>Well that,
that attitude is why you're such a fantastic coach in the first place.</v>

1235
01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:05.290
I remember one of the first times I've started talking to you is when you were

1236
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.400
working with George.

1237
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:11.820
Now what's interesting is you had a very interesting approach and even the way

1238
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:16.640
you describe things you would talk about shoot boxing.

1239
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:17.583
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1240
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:22.930
<v 3>Describe that because you,
you didn't talk when like I remember,
uh,</v>

1241
01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.590
I think one of our first long conversations with at some weird Denny's or

1242
01:17:26.591 --> 01:17:31.591
something somewhere and one of those weird road shows like will it just sat down

1243
01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:33.870
with you,
right.

1244
01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.740
That was the first that we made were we had a long conversation and um,

1245
01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.650
you were talking about the principles of shoot boxing.

1246
01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.950
<v 4>Please explain.
Um,</v>

1247
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:48.960
one of the strange things about the sport of mixed martial arts is so young that

1248
01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:53.370
there's still so much to be done.
Okay.

1249
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.390
Even the way people understand mixed martial arts to me is interesting.

1250
01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.800
99% of people who look at mixed martial arts see mixed martial arts as an

1251
01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:07.440
eclectic sport.
In other words,

1252
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:11.070
it's a conglomeration of different martial arts kind of banded together.

1253
01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.630
And then you've got mixed martial arts.

1254
01:18:12.631 --> 01:18:16.460
It's a mix of martial arts and there you have it.
You get two guys in the cage.

1255
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.430
What mixed martial arts,

1256
01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:21.930
I never saw mixed martial arts as an eclectic sport.

1257
01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.140
I see it as a transcendent sport.

1258
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:31.490
What I mean by that is there are four distinct skill areas of mixed martial

1259
01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:33.324
arts.

1260
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:39.530
Any one of those skill areas always goes beyond the component martial arts that

1261
01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:43.830
make it up.
In other words,

1262
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:46.790
the skill area Kranz sins,

1263
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.000
the various martial arts that make it up and create something bigger and

1264
01:18:51.001 --> 01:18:54.930
different from the core components that originally built it.

1265
01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:57.900
When you look at the sport of mixed martial arts,

1266
01:18:57.901 --> 01:19:00.510
you see there are four dominant skill areas.

1267
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.150
The first occurs when they first come out and the two athletes who have no

1268
01:19:06.151 --> 01:19:08.850
connection with each other and they're dancing around the cage.

1269
01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:15.010
This is the so called shoot boxing phase,

1270
01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:19.150
which involves skills drawn from western boxing,
Muay Thai karate,

1271
01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:24.890
a freestyle wrestling and various other martial arts where the two athletes are

1272
01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:28.690
jocking for position and typically they trying to determine the direction of the

1273
01:19:28.691 --> 01:19:30.820
fight.
Will it go down or will it stay up?

1274
01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.120
That's one skill area.

1275
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.700
The second skill area as a scholar of the clinch with a two athletes are both

1276
01:19:39.701 --> 01:19:42.070
still standing,
but now they've got a hold on each other.

1277
01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.810
They no longer moving around.
It will,

1278
01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.890
this has its key components come drawn from Moitai,
Greco,

1279
01:19:50.891 --> 01:19:53.590
Roman wrestling,
freestyle wrestling,
judo,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1280
01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:58.750
Then there's a third key skill area.

1281
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.770
The area of fence fighting fence.

1282
01:20:04.771 --> 01:20:07.860
Boxing with a two athletes are in a clinch,

1283
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.690
<v 2>but they're locked on the fence,</v>

1284
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:14.250
which dramatically changes the skills required for success than if you're in the

1285
01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:18.210
open.
And then you have a fourth skill area,

1286
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.320
which is the ground.
And of course that's divided into top and bottom position.

1287
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:27.210
So there are four skill areas of mixed martial arts.

1288
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:31.260
You could add more or less.
Uh,
for example,

1289
01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:34.890
you could add in the idea of the geography of the cage can add a new areas,

1290
01:20:34.891 --> 01:20:37.140
but let's stick with that fundamental four for now.

1291
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:42.780
If you show me any one of those skill areas,
yes,

1292
01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:48.170
you can derive skills from those component martial arts,

1293
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:50.940
from Moitai,
from judo,
whatever you choose,

1294
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:56.820
but that skill here is going to have other elements that are not part of those

1295
01:20:56.821 --> 01:20:59.220
original martial arts that is something different,

1296
01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:04.110
something unique and something above the various component martial arts that

1297
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:08.890
made it up
when you're fighting on the ground.

1298
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:12.400
A lot of what you do is the ride from Brazilian Jujitsu and modern mixed martial

1299
01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:14.620
arts.
Most of the athletes come from a Jiu Jitsu background.

1300
01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.060
When they work ground skills they they work on in a kind of a Jujitsu framework,

1301
01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.400
but many of the things going on down,

1302
01:21:21.401 --> 01:21:26.401
there are a mix of things that have far outside of your daily training and

1303
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:31.090
beside units you can bring in things from Moitai you're throwing Moitai.

1304
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.560
Al was on the ground,
but on the ground the,

1305
01:21:32.561 --> 01:21:35.170
I was have a very different feel from the standing position.
They've,

1306
01:21:35.171 --> 01:21:37.090
a mechanics behind them is significantly different.

1307
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:39.700
You're throwing hooks on the ground.

1308
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.580
But the mechanics of soy and hooks on the ground have very,

1309
01:21:42.581 --> 01:21:45.430
very different from the mechanics of throwing hooks in the standing position.

1310
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.710
So yeah,
you're,
you're bringing skills in from box,

1311
01:21:48.711 --> 01:21:51.880
but you're adapting them to welcome.

1312
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.060
So the way to look at the sport of mixed martial arts is not just like,
okay,

1313
01:21:55.061 --> 01:21:59.980
I'm going to rope together some race lanes and boxing and see what happens.

1314
01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.720
Rather you're developing skills in four distinct areas,

1315
01:22:04.721 --> 01:22:05.770
a minimum of four,

1316
01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.510
and the skills you ultimately develop go beyond.

1317
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.580
And I'd significantly different from the core components that you started with.

1318
01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:20.080
And so ultimately the skills of a mixed martial artist at the highest levels

1319
01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:24.510
transcend the various corps martial arts that made the sport up.

1320
01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.450
You're going to something,

1321
01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:30.240
you're going further when you fight in a mixed martial arts fight.

1322
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:33.820
[inaudible] a huge in a lot more than just you did sue and the various other

1323
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:38.300
boxing styles,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
that you used.
In the case of shute box and,

1324
01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:42.850
and George Saint Pierre,
everyone always talks about George's wrestling.

1325
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:46.130
Now George is a very good wrestler.

1326
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:48.410
He's wrestler a long time with very good people,

1327
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:54.950
but 90% of the success of his ability to take people down

1328
01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:01.650
goes far beyond wrestling and has to do with the precursors to the shot.

1329
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.070
What wrestling teachers he drew and mixed martial arts is how to a shot.

1330
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.070
<v 4>It gives you the body mechanics to finish the shot,</v>

1331
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:15.180
but the sit ups I completely different from wrestling.

1332
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:19.930
I can show you endless examples of good wrestlers who went into mixed martial

1333
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:23.170
arts competition with no background in mixed martial arts and couldn't take

1334
01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:26.270
anybody down.
That distance is different.
The standards,

1335
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.720
different emotion is different.
The set ups are completely different.

1336
01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.330
The context is different.
You've been punched and sort of grappling.

1337
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:33.993
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1338
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.393
<v 4>George,</v>

1339
01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:42.740
in my opinion throughout his career had a level of skill and technical insight

1340
01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:50.570
and neat the art of boxing kickboxing and to take downs that no one else has

1341
01:23:51.571 --> 01:23:52.500
even come close to.

1342
01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:59.910
Much of what he did in that area came from himself.

1343
01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:03.450
Did he have good wrestling coaches?
Absolutely.
Did he have good boxing coaches?

1344
01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.040
Absolutely.
Great.
Moitai coaches 100%

1345
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:14.990
but the skills he was exhibiting went beyond any one of those teachers or even

1346
01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:17.130
them as a whole.

1347
01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:23.630
The act of tying together all of those disparate skills came from him.

1348
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:25.650
The integration of skills.

1349
01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.140
And so you have someone who had a wrestling background,
had a boxing background,

1350
01:24:31.141 --> 01:24:32.160
had a Moitai background,

1351
01:24:32.161 --> 01:24:35.220
but ultimately what he was doing was something bigger than all of those put

1352
01:24:35.221 --> 01:24:38.690
together.
There's a sign of just to get fit here with the,

1353
01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:41.300
is it the sum was,

1354
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:46.230
was somehow greater than the components that,
uh,
individually made it up.

1355
01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:50.190
And that's what I mean when I talk about trends in that support.
Um,

1356
01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.120
George St Pierre was largely responsible through individual experimentation,

1357
01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.500
starting his late teens and going through his entire career in the development

1358
01:25:01.501 --> 01:25:02.334
of shoot box.

1359
01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.860
<v 3>Now when you work as a coach for George,</v>

1360
01:25:08.861 --> 01:25:11.440
you weren't just working as a Jujitsu coach,

1361
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:16.590
you were working in almost like a mastermind sort of a position.

1362
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.033
You,
I mean,

1363
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.000
I saw some conversations that you had with him where you discussed various

1364
01:25:22.001 --> 01:25:23.740
things.
And in fact,

1365
01:25:23.741 --> 01:25:28.741
one of the things you came to me about was you asked me if I knew anyone who was

1366
01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:34.000
proficient at the spinning back kick and that's how I got to working with

1367
01:25:34.001 --> 01:25:36.310
George,
your Ph,
your,

1368
01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.600
your coaching with him was not just simply like these are the principles of

1369
01:25:42.521 --> 01:25:45.610
Jujitsu.
This is what I want you to work on.
When the fight goes to the ground.

1370
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.570
You were working on a lot of different aspects.

1371
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:52.750
Like you are a guy that sort of put it together.

1372
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:57.370
Now when you don't have a background in striking and you know,

1373
01:25:57.371 --> 01:26:01.930
you are you looking at all of these various disciplines and trying to formulate

1374
01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:06.230
a strategy for a guy who was just such a supreme athlete.
George,

1375
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.080
how did you,
how did you formulate that?

1376
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:13.310
Did you do it based on the individual and based on their physical strengths and

1377
01:26:13.311 --> 01:26:17.390
limitations and sort of formulate what you think could be the best approach?

1378
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:20.240
Did you work it out with him in conjunction?

1379
01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.490
<v 2>Um,
the,
when,
when George comes to train with me this,</v>

1380
01:26:24.491 --> 01:26:27.200
there's a bunch of considerations.
First of all,
George lives in Montreal.

1381
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:29.870
I live in New York.
So time is always an issue.

1382
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.380
Well he does go down there because then they quite often,
but um,
uh,

1383
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:35.930
but it's not like a squat.
The squat say like seven days a week,

1384
01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:39.650
three times a day.
George was never like that.
Um,
uh,

1385
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.880
so in the time available we'll work on uh,
on,

1386
01:26:44.881 --> 01:26:47.540
on what we can.
So everything is always done with Georgia.
Okay.

1387
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:51.200
How much time is available and what is the scenario that's coming up for George?

1388
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:55.940
Almost always.
That was,
um,
uh,
an upcoming mixed martial arts fight.
Okay.

1389
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.360
Um,
so a lot of people often ask me to say,
you know,
how can we didn't teach,

1390
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.450
teach George Saint Pierre League logs?
What,

1391
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.260
why wasn't he leg lock and everyone in MMA?
Um,
well it's,

1392
01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.320
it's a good question.
Uh,
first off,
um,

1393
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:14.390
leg logging as you saw from the Gordon Ryan Clip requires,

1394
01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.000
if it's not done well,

1395
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:19.490
leg lock in is one of those things where if it's done well,
it's amazing.

1396
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:22.370
But if it's done badly,
it's the worst looking thing in the world and a disaster.

1397
01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.850
Um,
so,
uh,
secondly,

1398
01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:30.320
Georgia's game because his takedowns to so strong as almost always done from top

1399
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:33.800
position on the ground is rare for George to be in bottom session on the ground.

1400
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.530
Um,
and in a fight situation,

1401
01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:39.860
if you're already on top of someone and you've got the striking prowess of

1402
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:41.530
George St Pierre,
I was happy to,

1403
01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:45.830
to coach a more in what we call a grapple boxing.
Just the skill of,

1404
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:50.390
of grappling to punching on the ground that just made more sense for him.
Um,

1405
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:54.610
he's competent and leg logging,
but he's not like Gary Thompson,

1406
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.980
Eddie Cummings or Gordon Ryan.
He could have finished most black belts.

1407
01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:58.814
He absolutely.

1408
01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:02.270
But why would you stake a fight where literally millions of dollars have been

1409
01:28:02.271 --> 01:28:03.650
fought?
These are legacy on the line.

1410
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.710
Why would you take that risk when you could just stay on time to punch him out?

1411
01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:09.660
Peggy did was say John Fetch for example.
Right.
Um,

1412
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:13.610
so it didn't really make sense to push that hard on George.
Um,

1413
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.310
your question though was,
okay,
well what about these other skills?

1414
01:28:16.311 --> 01:28:19.100
What about standing position?
Well.
Um,
I'm,

1415
01:28:19.101 --> 01:28:22.190
I'm fascinated not just by judges who are my martial arts in general.

1416
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:26.750
And I've always believed all the various sports martial arts in the world have

1417
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:29.840
areas where they are particularly strong.
For example,

1418
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:32.560
I've always people make fun of taekwondo,
you know,

1419
01:28:32.561 --> 01:28:34.670
that are don't want us to talk with on him and me,

1420
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.730
you'll back me up on this joke.

1421
01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.790
There are some taekwondo players out there at Olympic level who can kick with a

1422
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:44.660
skill level that most people can't even imagine.
Um,

1423
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:45.891
uh,

1424
01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:50.891
I've seen people like herb Perez kicking demonstrations where you're looking at

1425
01:28:51.561 --> 01:28:53.930
it as,
this is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen in my life.

1426
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:57.380
And this is as the guy who,
if he hits you,
it's going to take your head off.

1427
01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.840
It's impressive to borrowers.
There wouldn't hurt.
Pres was in his prime.

1428
01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.040
I watched him

1429
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.370
<v 1>Kao quite a few people.
I watched him Kao uh,</v>

1430
01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:07.710
one of the u s national champions with an ax care,

1431
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:12.180
some of the worst Kaos have ever seen in my life came from taekwondo.

1432
01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:17.400
Like they tend to involve a jump spinning kicks with is just huge amounts of,

1433
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:19.320
of,
of kinetic energy being the bell.

1434
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:22.330
You see the same talking point fighting courtesies and terrible knock and point

1435
01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:24.360
finding good people make fun of these sports.

1436
01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:27.540
Like doing it on their own is the issue.
That's the issue.

1437
01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:29.310
That's the issue on their own.
They've got problems.

1438
01:29:29.311 --> 01:29:33.420
But if you can integrate that door well developed,
complete skillset,

1439
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:34.800
they could be incredibly effective.

1440
01:29:34.801 --> 01:29:39.240
And I always saw tremendous potential for Tae Kwon dos jump,
spinning back kick.

1441
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:43.060
No one does spinning back x better than taekwondo.
Yeah,

1442
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.690
that's one of the main things.
And they do it incredibly well.

1443
01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:48.510
The set ups are fantastic that the application,
the mechanics,

1444
01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:51.900
everything's super impressive.
So I always thought that would be a,
you know,

1445
01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:53.490
George had a good spinning back kick,

1446
01:29:53.491 --> 01:29:54.990
but I thought that would be a nice addition.

1447
01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:58.410
You always want to be building new skills into upon or you don't,

1448
01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.900
you don't want to be that predictable guide where everyone knows what you're

1449
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:05.570
doing.
And,
um,
uh,
and I know you came from taekwondo backgrounds and uh,

1450
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.310
so I thought that would be an interesting thing for you to work on with him.

1451
01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.750
Well,
it was a funny conversation because that was my specialty.
Yes.

1452
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.880
And so when you brought in,
I always wanted to talk to you.

1453
01:30:14.881 --> 01:30:18.060
I was fuck found your fascinating guy.
So when he came up to me and you said,

1454
01:30:18.061 --> 01:30:21.590
do you know anyone,
it's almost like a trick question.
It was a trick question.

1455
01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:26.850
You know where anyone besides your answer?
Like what I sat,
I was like,

1456
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.540
I was hesitant.
I was like,
okay,
you're not going to believe this.

1457
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:34.290
But the truth is I knew you had a good jump spinning back kick.

1458
01:30:34.291 --> 01:30:39.100
I was trying to subtly did you,
how did you know word gets around Tom?

1459
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:42.250
I thought you were just fucking with me.
I mean,
but I,

1460
01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:46.050
I felt like when I was telling you,
I was like,
man,
I don't even want it.

1461
01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.710
I wish I knew someone who did it with two L's.
You should have just been like,

1462
01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.190
yeah,
I've got the best jump spinning back kick in the fucking world.

1463
01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.750
I did jump spinning back kick quite a bit,

1464
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:56.790
but I prefer a regular spinning back to you.

1465
01:30:56.791 --> 01:30:59.580
I want my foot on the ground cause I'm just going off of that foot.

1466
01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:04.850
There's a significant amount of force in the left leg forcing you pushing off

1467
01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:05.830
that back.

1468
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:09.720
Interestingly you've seen some some guys out there now having good success and

1469
01:31:09.721 --> 01:31:10.740
even maybe that thing back,

1470
01:31:10.741 --> 01:31:13.850
cause I remember seeing Michael Page hit up beautiful when he's got everything

1471
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.270
that guy can dairy impressive.

1472
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:18.930
He's another guy who came from that point fighting background with,
you know,

1473
01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:23.980
you see Raymond Daniels and him and a lot of these guys from that background

1474
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:28.860
that are defendant.
Daniel's worked with George for his last two fights.
Very,

1475
01:31:28.861 --> 01:31:32.230
very impressive guy.
Phenomenal.
Yeah.
And,
and again it's,

1476
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:37.670
he had just the point fighting skills and now he's developing real boxing skills

1477
01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:41.190
and he's,
you know,
you've seen him in Beltour kickbox you know,

1478
01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:44.100
and you see the integration of the two.
It's phenomenal.
I mean,

1479
01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:48.780
he could just do things physically that most kickboxer just really don't know

1480
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:50.190
what he's doing.
He'll,

1481
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:54.990
he'll jump up and do what's called like a touch spinning back kick.

1482
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.040
Like he'll jump up and touch you with the front leg.
I saw that.

1483
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.080
He hit it in a glory

1484
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:05.080
<v 3>flight I believe.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He's phenomenal.
He's phenomenal.</v>

1485
01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:05.914
But the,
again,

1486
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:11.020
when you see that it's like those things by themselves,

1487
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:14.290
you're just going to get taken to the ground and smashed.
And most people,

1488
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:18.220
unless you land one of those catastrophic spinning back kicks right away,

1489
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:20.520
the odds are you,
you,

1490
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:24.730
you need all those other things as well in order to be particularly effective.

1491
01:32:24.731 --> 01:32:29.240
Which is why George was such joy.
Yeah.

1492
01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:32.410
But that was a,
that was a fun moment.

1493
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.010
It was an interesting because like I've always wanted to like show somebody
this.

1494
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:38.380
It's cause it's a weird little thing that I know how to do.

1495
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:42.780
<v 2>Um,
going back to your original question,
the idea of Georgian and shoot box.</v>

1496
01:32:42.781 --> 01:32:46.860
You'll see that Georgia's entire methodology in a standing position is built

1497
01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.160
around the concept of a dilemma that the Lemur is always between his jacket and

1498
01:32:53.491 --> 01:32:54.324
his take down.

1499
01:32:56.550 --> 01:33:00.480
People always talk about proactive and reactive takedowns.
Okay.

1500
01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:03.150
This guy's how reactive to discuss a proactive takedown guy.

1501
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:09.020
The thing about George is he would use his jab proactively,

1502
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.390
but he would use his takedowns reactively.

1503
01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.910
Now that's interesting because George would literally provoke people

1504
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:22.300
<v 3>you're saying as take down,
oh,
I just want to point this out past tense.</v>

1505
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.910
You're saying this like,
you know something.
I don't know.
No,
no,
no.

1506
01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.730
It's George just won the middleweight title,

1507
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:33.570
relinquished the title and then the great speculation is will George fight
again?

1508
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.070
<v 2>Yeah.
The truth is no one knows because it comes down some medical problems.</v>

1509
01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.140
George has,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1510
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:43.600
he's got a problem on his stomach and a colitis.
What it is.
Yeah.

1511
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:47.720
What is that exactly?
It's,
uh,
I'm not going to claim to be a medical expert,

1512
01:33:47.721 --> 01:33:51.290
but it's one of the most frustrating things that George has had to deal with

1513
01:33:51.291 --> 01:33:54.710
where there are certain parts of the human body that is out of your control and

1514
01:33:54.711 --> 01:33:57.080
the stomach is one of them.
Just things happening in your stomach,

1515
01:33:57.110 --> 01:34:01.220
you can't control it.
Things like stress seem to make it worse.
Um,

1516
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:05.970
and uh,
uh,
the truth is that no one really knows at this point.
So,
um,

1517
01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:10.640
wherever this doubt,
my instinct is to think,
well,

1518
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.520
you already want to come back,
George,
you've done all this and

1519
01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:17.590
<v 3>what a great way to cap off a career too.
It was amazing.
It was embracing it.</v>

1520
01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.670
I gotta tell you when he came back,

1521
01:34:19.671 --> 01:34:24.080
this is what was really interesting about that fight.
George had said,
I'm better,

1522
01:34:24.081 --> 01:34:28.910
I'm a better martial artist than I was before.
And he looked better.
He,
I mean,

1523
01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.420
he definitely looked like he was a little out of competition.

1524
01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:35.810
Like there was a moment,
should be how many fights,

1525
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.580
<v 2>you know,
it came back up to a four year layoff.
Very few.
But</v>

1526
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:42.240
<v 3>skill wise,
he looked phenomenal.</v>

1527
01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:47.300
I mean his striking looked incredibly smooth and I think you could see it in

1528
01:34:47.401 --> 01:34:51.450
Bisping's face like pretty early on.
Like this guy is,

1529
01:34:51.451 --> 01:34:56.040
this is not a rusty George Saint Pierre is not a small welterweight who's,

1530
01:34:56.041 --> 01:35:00.410
you know,
making his way in the,
where he looked huge.
He looked phenomenal.
His,

1531
01:35:00.411 --> 01:35:02.150
his technique,

1532
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:05.420
the way he was landing leg kicks and his Sharp Jab.

1533
01:35:05.421 --> 01:35:08.990
And then ultimately that left hand that he used to stun Bisping and get 'em on

1534
01:35:08.991 --> 01:35:11.570
the ground.
I mean,
he looks sensational.
Yes.

1535
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.760
<v 2>Um,
uh,</v>

1536
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.390
you were there the night George went into his first retirement and you'll recall

1537
01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.540
the whole retirement thing was kind of,
the speech was vague.

1538
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:23.740
It wasn't as confusing and um,
cause he didn't,

1539
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:26.540
in truth he didn't know if he wanted to retire.
Um,

1540
01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.760
the whole thing was actually contrived in the octagon right there in front of

1541
01:35:31.761 --> 01:35:32.210
you.

1542
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:35.780
I would be been a hard fight to training camp hadn't been the best camp though.

1543
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:39.350
The five for Hendricks was,
uh,
George was unclear if he wanted to fight it all.

1544
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:42.620
There were,
there's all kinds of controversies involved in the fight.
And um,

1545
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:47.390
then when the fight was over,
it was,
it was a very close fight.
Um,
and uh,

1546
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.750
uh,
he wasn't sure what he wanted to do.

1547
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:55.430
There was a language miscommunication and ultimately he essentially,

1548
01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:58.220
he walked away from the game and he walked away for four years.

1549
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.550
That's a long time to be out of a sport that as young as him or main,

1550
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:04.790
which is evolving all the time every year the sport changes and uh,

1551
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:08.840
the belts tend to change hands very,
very quickly.
Um,

1552
01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:13.750
so when George started talking to me about the idea of,
okay,

1553
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.240
I want to come back,
I think I've still got can be,
I want to come back.

1554
01:36:17.850 --> 01:36:21.770
There's a desire,
passion.
My point to him was,

1555
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.460
first off you show you really want to do this.
Like,
you know,

1556
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:26.870
the last two fight camps,
it's tough.

1557
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.360
You didn't seem to have the same kind of drives.

1558
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:30.920
He used to have you show you want to do this.

1559
01:36:30.921 --> 01:36:34.700
Is this like a middle aged fantasy he had going through here?
And he said,

1560
01:36:34.701 --> 01:36:39.170
none of that.
I feel this,
I want to come back.
So my question to him was,

1561
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:43.790
if you're going to come back,
I was going to do the same thing.

1562
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.850
You just going to come back to welterweight and do what you always did,

1563
01:36:46.851 --> 01:36:51.020
which has come out and beat the base welterweights and just hold a title.

1564
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:55.850
It's going to be doing the same thing.
I thought if you're going gonna come back,

1565
01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.450
let's do something significant.
Something you haven't done before.

1566
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.660
And so the way I put it to him was,

1567
01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.310
what are the three most persistent criticisms you always hear about George Saint

1568
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:11.750
Pierre?
Number one,
you never fought up a weight class.
Never went up.

1569
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.450
Number two,
you fought.

1570
01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.480
So tactically sound was such an emphasis on a strategy and techniques or what

1571
01:37:21.531 --> 01:37:24.590
have you.
That matches could become dull.

1572
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:29.420
That the average fan was like,
well,
yeah,
he's,
he's winning easily.
It's dominant,

1573
01:37:29.421 --> 01:37:32.930
but it doesn't do it for,
it's not excited.
No drama in the funds on gun.

1574
01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:38.360
Um,
so he had this idea that uh,
on the one hand,

1575
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:42.470
uh,
uh,
he was very technically sound strategically deep,

1576
01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.600
but the fights weren't as exciting as they ought to be.
Um,

1577
01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:52.250
the idea that he'd never gone up a weight category and the third most persistent

1578
01:37:52.251 --> 01:37:56.370
Chris and we didn't finish fights.
Okay.
He,
it was a very skilled fighter.

1579
01:37:56.371 --> 01:38:01.050
It wasn't finishing fights.
So my point is,
okay,
if you're going to come back,

1580
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:06.060
let's do it in a way where you address those three things.
Okay.

1581
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:10.080
George is always concerned about his legacy as a fighter.

1582
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:12.840
And if there were three persistent criticisms of George NPS legacy,

1583
01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:14.790
it was those three things.
You're not finishing fights,

1584
01:38:14.791 --> 01:38:18.370
you never went up a weight class and you're too tactical.
Okay.
You're not,

1585
01:38:18.371 --> 01:38:22.620
you're not providing the drama that a fight should.
So I said,

1586
01:38:22.621 --> 01:38:23.454
let's change things.

1587
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:29.640
We've got in that four years previous to that,
whenever I was training George,

1588
01:38:29.641 --> 01:38:32.370
I was training him for a fight.
He was,
now he's fighting.

1589
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:35.040
Nick Diaz is finding cars,
condos,
finding,
you know,
whoever.

1590
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:36.910
And it was always getting him ready for a fight.

1591
01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:40.860
You Find Matt Hughes in two months.
Let's get ready now.
You're a tired.

1592
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:46.110
I'm not going to train you to find some dude going to train you in Jujitsu.

1593
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:50.160
Freddie Roach.
It's kind of train you in boxing

1594
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:56.510
in this sense.
We could.

1595
01:38:56.690 --> 01:39:00.200
We hit the time now to start working on finishing skills.

1596
01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:06.410
A significant change occurred where my primary emphasis in training George in

1597
01:39:06.411 --> 01:39:10.940
that four year layoff was in submissions.
Now happily that happened at what time?

1598
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.100
The time the school,
it was coming out,

1599
01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:17.900
so I had a group of some of the best submission peoples in the world for George

1600
01:39:17.901 --> 01:39:21.200
to work with,
so it was submission started getting better.
Suddenly,

1601
01:39:21.201 --> 01:39:23.240
George Saint Pierre,
he got on your back as a problem.

1602
01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.440
He submitting people in the gym.
I could run off some names.

1603
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:29.510
I won't do it because it's not the thing to do,

1604
01:39:29.511 --> 01:39:32.450
but I could run off some names of people he submitted an agenda would shock you

1605
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:37.460
like well known Jujitsu people and for the first time he's our primary versus

1606
01:39:37.461 --> 01:39:39.500
wasn't on grapple walks in.
It was submission

1607
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:44.790
Freddie Roach was working on,
on the mechanics of punching.

1608
01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:48.880
George always had good in out movement.
It was head.
I get karate movement,
the um,

1609
01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:51.210
the ability,
he always had a strong jab,

1610
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:53.550
but now he's teaching them how to sit on a punch.

1611
01:39:53.551 --> 01:39:57.600
Suddenly George had a left hook.
Okay.

1612
01:39:57.601 --> 01:39:59.950
And you're a guy who can integrate left,
uh,

1613
01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:04.910
left hand chip between Jab and lived til gets a dangerous man.
I'm gonna.
Um,

1614
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:08.560
everyone was worried,
you know,
there's so much overreaction to George's Jab.

1615
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.820
There's suddenly left talk opportunities.

1616
01:40:09.821 --> 01:40:12.300
We're working it up and now he was sitting on that left hook and people getting

1617
01:40:12.301 --> 01:40:13.134
hurt.

1618
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:16.830
So now for the first time you got a guy who's got submissions and he's hitting

1619
01:40:16.831 --> 01:40:18.360
with genuine power.

1620
01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:27.370
As he came back,
it was a question of who's going to be the opponent?

1621
01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.170
And the next thing I say it is,
well,
you know,
went up a weight division,

1622
01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.260
go to 85
now.
Now

1623
01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:41.820
<v 3>was any consideration about going up to 85 because the fact that Bisping was the</v>

1624
01:40:41.821 --> 01:40:44.180
champion,
no.
George has trained with business.

1625
01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:47.620
That decision was made before piston?
Was The champion real?
Yeah.

1626
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.370
How far in advance was a decision made?

1627
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:53.440
Because Bisbing a defendant against head understand where maybe this one against

1628
01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.190
four

1629
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.690
<v 2>year project.
Okay.
I didn't know during initially,</v>

1630
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:01.270
initially I couldn't make that decision because at another student of mine,

1631
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:04.930
Chris Weidman was the one 85 pound champion and Chris and Georgia never fight

1632
01:41:04.931 --> 01:41:09.040
each other.
But once that was no longer an issue,
then it was like,
hey,
this,

1633
01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.590
this could work,
this could be interesting.

1634
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:15.760
So d during the entire four years he was talking about eventually becoming,

1635
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:17.550
not the entire four years now,

1636
01:41:18.010 --> 01:41:21.250
but he was training the whole time and I was pushing him a kid,

1637
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.210
you don't fight anymore.
Let's do some submission grappling.
Right.
Okay.
Um,

1638
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.340
he stuck with Freddie Roach.
He,
he loves working with Freddie Roach.
And,
um,

1639
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.840
uh,
so the training was going in different direction.

1640
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:38.550
Who is this Moitai coach?
Um,
mostly he works at Ferrazzi Hobby and,

1641
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:43.000
and tries to that,
but that's more,
uh,
integrated for us is a black belt of mine.

1642
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.320
So he,
um,
often,
uh,
does Jujitsu with,
for us.
We had,

1643
01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:52.520
I teach for us in frost that does a good job there.
Um,
but for us,
uh,

1644
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:53.680
ties things together,

1645
01:41:53.710 --> 01:41:57.160
let's his principal function and I know he trained with Phil nurse for a while

1646
01:41:57.161 --> 01:42:01.260
as well.
Then he trained with a lot of guys who came out of uh,

1647
01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.800
uh,
Thailand itself from Tiger Moy,
Tai,
um,

1648
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:11.170
uh,
yard.
That's a shortening of his actual name.
They will have very long names,

1649
01:42:11.171 --> 01:42:16.030
but a yard was one of his trainers.
They trained him prior to condit and Diaz,

1650
01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.850
um,
uh,
did a fine job.

1651
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:23.790
So there's never been a shortage of coaches in his life,
but uh,

1652
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.530
there are certain things that seem to gel with them more than others.

1653
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:29.050
Interesting leader.
In that four year period,

1654
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:34.500
George had a strong rebirth into karate and worked with a lot of specialized

1655
01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:38.380
creative people,
including Raymond Daniels and others.
Uh,
they came from the,

1656
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:41.470
mostly from the European point fighting karate,
a circuit,

1657
01:42:41.471 --> 01:42:42.820
and he was working with them a lot.

1658
01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:47.630
And so somewhere or the cross,

1659
01:42:47.631 --> 01:42:52.190
a certain poor period of time where you're dealing with a different athletes.

1660
01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.210
Now,
this is the guy who's had four years off and the train had gone in different

1661
01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:56.044
directions.

1662
01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:01.500
It's finishing skills in both fisticuffs and grappling had gotten considerably

1663
01:43:01.781 --> 01:43:03.610
better.
Um,

1664
01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:08.820
he was toying with the idea of going up to 85 and experimented with diet and et

1665
01:43:09.331 --> 01:43:12.310
Cetera to get his body weight up.
That's never an easy thing to do.

1666
01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:18.450
And tactically he was working more that on the idea of being an exciting fighter

1667
01:43:18.551 --> 01:43:23.110
through movement and pushing harder for the finish.
And,

1668
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:27.490
uh,
and I thought those were three very,
very healthy directions to go and,

1669
01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:32.440
and,
um,
uh,
this would,
as it were,
if he did come back,

1670
01:43:32.441 --> 01:43:36.280
this would be offer a genuine opportunity to address the three most persistent

1671
01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:40.780
criticism of his Korea.
Initially,
there was a lot of resistance from the UFC.

1672
01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.310
I don't think they were fond of the idea at all.

1673
01:43:42.311 --> 01:43:46.210
They wanted him to go to one 70 and,
and do what he had done.
And uh,

1674
01:43:46.211 --> 01:43:50.560
but George pushed hard for the,
uh,
for the fight at 85.

1675
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.420
And ultimately it happened in a rather strange way.

1676
01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:58.040
Tyrone Woodley had a fight at one 70.
What Shum,

1677
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.610
uh,
wasn't the most crowd pleasing fight and uh,

1678
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:08.210
uh,
George St Pierre was supposed to fight Tyrone Woodley.
And in UFC is,

1679
01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:11.360
you know what five bays mean it's on,
so they,

1680
01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.250
we chose the Madison Square Garden.

1681
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:17.120
That's one of the great fight capitols of the world and it's how it happened.

1682
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.270
So there was consideration and fighting one 70?
Yes.

1683
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:25.190
And so this was the UFC his idea,
but what about your python for I,

1684
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:28.870
I thought first of all,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not the matchmaker.

1685
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.740
I'm not the main policy making under,

1686
01:44:30.741 --> 01:44:32.930
I don't want to say that I was the guy that,

1687
01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:36.830
I was the guy that suggested those ideas and George seems to like the idea,

1688
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.360
he said,
if I'm going to come back,

1689
01:44:38.361 --> 01:44:40.610
if I'm going to take the risk of a four year layoff and come back,

1690
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:41.444
it's a big risk.

1691
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:45.380
I mean Muhammad Ali came back after three years and had to warm up fights and

1692
01:44:45.381 --> 01:44:49.820
still lost his title phone.
But Muhammad Ali really wasn't working out.

1693
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:52.790
That was when the Vietnam war thing,

1694
01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:55.120
it happens mostly doing tours of college game.

1695
01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:58.070
It wasn't really working out the whole time and improving.

1696
01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.040
You can see the difference in Muhammad Ali,
his body when he came back,

1697
01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.630
it's still,
there's many other examples that you,

1698
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.400
sugar ray Leonard came back after layoffs.

1699
01:45:04.401 --> 01:45:07.790
He had one successful and one very unsuccessful come back and he was working

1700
01:45:07.791 --> 01:45:10.820
hard the whole time.
So coming back,
cause it's,
it's a hard,

1701
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.110
tricky thing on many levels too.
Not just physical but also the psychological.

1702
01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:18.400
So now this collitus thing is thrown a monkey wrench into the gears.

1703
01:45:18.401 --> 01:45:21.740
If actually it threw a monkey wrench during the camp.
Really?

1704
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:26.260
I could tell you some stories about that.
That camp was,
uh,
as,

1705
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:29.710
as good as the four years was.
The camp itself,
I,

1706
01:45:29.711 --> 01:45:32.690
I can say it now because it's over,
was a disaster.

1707
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:35.000
It was probably the worst camp I've ever been involved.
Uh,

1708
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:39.930
I was coaching of course the scored for ADCC.
So,
uh,

1709
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:43.950
ADCC I believe was around six weeks,
uh,

1710
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:45.470
before Georges fight.

1711
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:50.960
So I was in Finland and communicating with George and he's like feeling good.

1712
01:45:50.961 --> 01:45:52.400
Let's get the moment I get back,

1713
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:56.030
I'm just going to get on a plane from Finland to Montreal and start the camp.

1714
01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.650
Uh,
George sent me out.
I've got stomach issues and I was like,

1715
01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:07.670
what do you mean stomach issues?
What does that even mean now?
Um,
uh,

1716
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:09.950
about two weeks into the camp,

1717
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:14.390
the issues got so bad that George literally could not.

1718
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:16.970
Now this is a six week fight camp.
It's a very short camp.

1719
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.070
Back in the day we used to do eight to 12 weeks,

1720
01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:22.100
but George thought of shorter camp,
we would be better.
He as he's getting older,

1721
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:26.420
he wanted to shorter camp.
First two weeks were okay,
but I was in,

1722
01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:28.110
uh,

1723
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.680
the aftermath of the Finland expedition and um,
uh,

1724
01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.020
when I first went up,
George said,
I've got to cancel.
Okay.
I,

1725
01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:41.780
uh,
I can't train
fights four weeks away

1726
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:45.290
and George took two weeks off.

1727
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:50.790
It was a critical moment on a Friday evening where I say it to for Rasa Hobby,

1728
01:46:51.010 --> 01:46:53.200
this is the second time I've had to say this to,
for our salary.

1729
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.620
The other was the Carlos condit camp.
I say George.

1730
01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.850
And training by Monday we can to pull the plug.
There's no other way.

1731
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:05.460
And we were talking about a four year layoff and this camp is lost.

1732
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:09.600
It's dead in the water.
So four weeks out he takes two weeks off.
Uh,

1733
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.540
I believe it might've been five.
I'll check the dates later,

1734
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:15.070
but I'm very close to it.

1735
01:47:15.071 --> 01:47:17.340
There was a critical two week period where during that two weeks,

1736
01:47:17.341 --> 01:47:21.130
what is he able to do?
Essentially?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Yeah.

1737
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:25.680
Just no train light drilling some movement.
And uh,
he,
he was,

1738
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.710
it,
it occurred the worst possible time.
It,

1739
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.560
it wasn't at the start of the cameras in the middle of the camp so that the

1740
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:35.580
first two weeks were lost because then,
uh,

1741
01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:38.430
we had two weeks of inactivity.
Then there's two weeks left.

1742
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:42.930
And I remember the first time I went up,
I bought Jake Shields,

1743
01:47:42.931 --> 01:47:44.410
Gary Turner and Gordon Ryan with me.

1744
01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:48.360
We came up and we went through some drills on the ground and,
and I was happy,

1745
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:51.810
you know,
Joseph Del k on the ground.
He did fine against the score guys.
And,
um,

1746
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:52.980
uh,

1747
01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.950
we worked on some specialized grabbing stuff and then the next day he went to a

1748
01:47:55.951 --> 01:47:56.910
shoe box workout.

1749
01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.360
Now I could sit here all day until you adventures of George St Pierre Doing shoe

1750
01:48:03.511 --> 01:48:07.350
box training with people.
I've seen him spot everybody.
Okay.

1751
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:11.520
I'm not going to mention names,
but I've seen George Saint Pierre takedown

1752
01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:13.860
effortlessly.

1753
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:19.470
Some of the biggest names in mixed martial arts in weight divisions,

1754
01:48:19.471 --> 01:48:23.760
far above his own.
So many times per around.

1755
01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:27.270
You just lose count.
Nigga.
I,
I,
I'm,

1756
01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:31.140
I'm afraid to even tell you the stories because people wouldn't believe me.
Um,

1757
01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:35.790
I'm used to seeing George Saint Pierre Shoot,
boxing bap,
bap,
bap,
Bang down.
Right.

1758
01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.200
Okay.
Um,
I've seen that since the thought of his career,

1759
01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.090
I watched George Saint Pierre to a shoe box workout where he couldn't score a

1760
01:48:45.091 --> 01:48:50.040
take down.
This is a fights two weeks away.
I'm just looking,
going like,

1761
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:54.630
holy heck,
what is this?
He's getting hit.
He's getting frustrated,

1762
01:48:54.930 --> 01:48:59.550
he's getting tired.
And I said to,
for us,
you know,
this is,

1763
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:03.630
this is a crisis.
This is one of the biggest UFC shows of the year.

1764
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.330
It's Madison Square Garden.
He's the headline.

1765
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:11.460
The USC had to pull some big things to get this fight to happen.

1766
01:49:11.461 --> 01:49:13.590
They didn't originally didn't want it.
If we pull out now,

1767
01:49:13.591 --> 01:49:17.220
it's going to look like a disaster.
It's going to be George let the UFC down.

1768
01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.570
Um,
and to his everlasting credit,

1769
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:27.120
George said,
I'll be back on Monday and I'll be better.
We went up and,

1770
01:49:28.050 --> 01:49:31.830
uh,
he,
he is,
he dug in deep.
What can I tell you?

1771
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.460
He's a trooper.
He,
um,
he trained every day,

1772
01:49:35.461 --> 01:49:39.690
those last two weeks and as each day went by,

1773
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:42.630
there was significant improvement.
And I remember there was a distinct moment,

1774
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:44.340
about five days before the end of the camp,

1775
01:49:44.341 --> 01:49:48.320
I swung to a shoot box workout and he looked like the old George and I was like,

1776
01:49:48.321 --> 01:49:51.010
okay,
I believe in this kid again.
You can do it.

1777
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:55.830
<v 1>Jamie,
will you please Google?
Collitus I don't know enough.</v>

1778
01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:59.430
I believe he should.
What the goals?
Ulcerative colitis.

1779
01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:05.970
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's so it,
it's something to do with stomach ulcers.
Um,

1780
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:08.420
I'm not going to claim to be an expert,
but,
uh,
yeah,

1781
01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:10.260
I can tell you what the symptoms were.

1782
01:50:10.261 --> 01:50:14.370
I was extreme stomach pain and inability to eat at,
screwed up his entire diet.

1783
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:15.700
And when did it start?
Uh,

1784
01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.330
it's not an early in the camp and got progressively worse.

1785
01:50:18.331 --> 01:50:21.370
And then for the camp there was no issues.
Uh,

1786
01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:25.140
ulcerative colitis is usually only,
uh,

1787
01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:27.810
in innermost lining of the large intestine,

1788
01:50:27.811 --> 01:50:30.750
colon and rectum forms range from mild to severe.

1789
01:50:30.751 --> 01:50:34.710
Having all sort of colitis puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon

1790
01:50:34.711 --> 01:50:38.190
cancer symptoms including rectal bleeding,
bloody diarrhea,

1791
01:50:38.191 --> 01:50:42.260
abdominal cramps and pain.
And it sounds like a party.
Yeah.
If you read the,

1792
01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.350
can you bring it back,
read the first four treatment,

1793
01:50:46.351 --> 01:50:50.790
can help with this condition,
cannot be cured,
requires a medical diagnosis,

1794
01:50:50.791 --> 01:50:51.960
lab tests or imaging.

1795
01:50:51.961 --> 01:50:56.760
Always required chronic can last for years or be lifelong.

1796
01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:00.180
It's incredibly frustrating for him to deal with and says treatments,

1797
01:51:00.181 --> 01:51:02.220
including medications and surgery.

1798
01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:07.370
<v 2>Yeah.
So it's a forgery,
but,</v>

1799
01:51:07.371 --> 01:51:10.970
uh,
it appeared to back off a little bit in the last two weeks.

1800
01:51:10.971 --> 01:51:15.680
He came back and he,
um,
this is the kind of person,
George Saint Pierre.

1801
01:51:15.681 --> 01:51:17.660
It's the morning of the fight.

1802
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:23.140
Saturday morning we're in New York City in the hotel room,
uh,
for Rasa,

1803
01:51:23.150 --> 01:51:26.240
hobby,
Freddie Roach and myself,
or at the breakfast table,

1804
01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:28.580
George comes down for breakfast and he's weighed in,

1805
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:32.990
he looks at his breakfast,

1806
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:37.460
has originally the plan,
because it was a fight at one 85,

1807
01:51:37.461 --> 01:51:40.850
was to have George come in at a,
at a higher body weight,

1808
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:45.170
but he ended up weighing 191 pounds,

1809
01:51:45.171 --> 01:51:48.020
which is exactly the same as it used to fight at welterweight,

1810
01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:52.910
the same body weight.
So that was kind of a disappointment,
you know.
Um,

1811
01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.160
and uh,
he quietly excuse himself and went to the bathroom.

1812
01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:00.260
Everyone else went away to do their things.

1813
01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.160
And I sat there and I realized he's in the bathroom for an hour.

1814
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:08.690
He came out and I would say,
Joe,
do you okay?
And he looked at me,
he said,

1815
01:52:08.691 --> 01:52:13.330
I'm fine,
but I knew he wasn't.
And then he went out for it.

1816
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:16.550
Um,
and then afterwards he told me,
dude,

1817
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:21.440
I was in so much pain and he was afraid to tell me because he would worry that

1818
01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.900
if I cornered him and I thought he was compromised,

1819
01:52:23.901 --> 01:52:27.410
I wouldn't call him the way I normally would,
that I would doubt him.

1820
01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:32.750
So he kept it all inside,
didn't say a word.
And,
uh,
he's a good kid,
you know,

1821
01:52:32.751 --> 01:52:34.430
he can't help it in market like that.

1822
01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:39.180
<v 1>Wow.
Well that's what makes them a champion.
Yeah.
That's one of the things.
It's,</v>

1823
01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:42.950
it's less than perfect conditions.
He could still rise to the occasion,

1824
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:45.980
the less than perfect.
It was a very far from perfect.

1825
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.130
<v 3>Now you said that during the Johnny Hendricks fight,
uh,</v>

1826
01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:50.600
during the camp for that fight,

1827
01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:55.100
when he decided to impromptu retire inside the octagon,

1828
01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.670
that there was talk during the camp that he didn't want to fight.
Yeah.

1829
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.793
What was that about?

1830
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:03.840
<v 2>Uh,
really seen it around two things.
One,
I can just,</v>

1831
01:53:03.970 --> 01:53:08.860
I can not discuss because it involves a personal life.
Joe San Pa,

1832
01:53:08.861 --> 01:53:13.230
there was some things going on in his personal life that,
um,
uh,

1833
01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:18.370
deeply affected him and he was deeply unhappy with some circumstances in his

1834
01:53:18.371 --> 01:53:22.660
personal life and it's not appropriate for me to talk about those.
Um,

1835
01:53:22.690 --> 01:53:27.430
and the second was the whole idea that it'd become an obsession with George at

1836
01:53:27.431 --> 01:53:31.570
that time,
which is the use of anabolic steroids in mixed martial arts.

1837
01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:33.180
And um,

1838
01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:38.560
and he was deeply unhappy with what he perceived as the prevalence of the use of

1839
01:53:38.741 --> 01:53:41.560
anabolic steroids in mixed martial arts as a whole.

1840
01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:46.420
And among his opponents in particular.
And um,

1841
01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.250
uh,
he wanted a testing program to be bought in for that fight.

1842
01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.560
There was talk about it but nothing came of it.

1843
01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:58.740
And it became like this psychological obsession during the camp and uh,

1844
01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:05.110
uh,
between those two issues,
uh,
there was a lot of unhappiness.

1845
01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:08.770
He came in,
he did was train,
you know,
he's,
he's a professional athlete.

1846
01:54:08.771 --> 01:54:11.230
It's not like he missed workouts or anything crazy like there wasn't a going out

1847
01:54:11.231 --> 01:54:12.310
at night or anything foolish,

1848
01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:17.880
but there was a degree of unhappiness where I'm looking and thinking how much

1849
01:54:18.791 --> 01:54:19.930
longer can this go on?

1850
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:26.590
<v 3>Now there was some talk about the Tyron Woodley fight and then Tyron had this</v>

1851
01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:30.021
bad performance,

1852
01:54:30.021 --> 01:54:35.021
but if George did get healthy and was confident enough in his health that he

1853
01:54:38.451 --> 01:54:40.550
could get through,
get through an actual training camp,

1854
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:44.300
would he be interested in considering a fight with Tyron Woodley?
Absolutely.

1855
01:54:44.301 --> 01:54:47.390
I think Tyron Woodley is a great champion.
I know he gets a lot of steak,

1856
01:54:47.391 --> 01:54:50.660
a lot of flag.
That kid is talented,
very talented,
very good.

1857
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.730
And he doesn't think George wants to fight him.

1858
01:54:52.731 --> 01:54:54.520
He was on the podcast the other day.
Yeah.

1859
01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:55.820
<v 2>I,
I think,
uh,</v>

1860
01:54:55.870 --> 01:55:00.100
people say that for reasons so that they can motivate someone to find et Cetera,

1861
01:55:00.101 --> 01:55:00.934
et cetera.

1862
01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:03.820
There's a political aspect to it and I think that both athletes have a deep

1863
01:55:03.821 --> 01:55:05.890
respect for each other.
Um,

1864
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:09.010
Tara [inaudible] is a very,

1865
01:55:09.011 --> 01:55:13.330
very difficult opponent to beat is people criticize his style,

1866
01:55:13.331 --> 01:55:17.290
but people don't understand difference between regular fighting and championship

1867
01:55:17.291 --> 01:55:17.681
fighting.

1868
01:55:17.681 --> 01:55:20.650
Championship fighting is about winning and losing and you got to do what you

1869
01:55:20.651 --> 01:55:24.700
gotta do to win.
That's the first consideration.
It's nice to impress the crowd.

1870
01:55:24.701 --> 01:55:26.200
It's nice to do this or that.

1871
01:55:26.201 --> 01:55:28.990
But ultimately it's about what are you going to do to win?
What do you,

1872
01:55:28.991 --> 01:55:31.030
what are you going to do to beat the second best guy in the world?

1873
01:55:31.031 --> 01:55:33.130
That's a difficult,
difficult thing.

1874
01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:34.820
<v 3>It has to be done correctly.</v>

1875
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:40.190
This idea of fighting to entertain and then this is a very complex thing and you

1876
01:55:40.191 --> 01:55:41.490
talked about it with,
uh,

1877
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:45.090
George addressing that are attempting to address that in his comeback and trying

1878
01:55:45.091 --> 01:55:48.300
to finish and be more energetic and aggressive.

1879
01:55:48.301 --> 01:55:52.110
But the reality is that's not always the best way to engage.

1880
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.680
There's is a right way to fight a person with a particular skillset.

1881
01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.090
And especially in the Woodley,
uh,
versus,
uh,

1882
01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.250
Stephen Wonderboy Thompson fights.
Yeah.
I was like,

1883
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:05.250
this is the only way to fight that guy.
You cannot,
I mean,

1884
01:56:05.251 --> 01:56:08.610
unless you are what he is,
which is a,

1885
01:56:08.611 --> 01:56:13.611
a very skillful traditional martial artists that has this very unique ability to

1886
01:56:13.771 --> 01:56:17.310
bend at the waist,
like a snake and slide in with techniques.

1887
01:56:17.311 --> 01:56:20.820
And it does a lot off the front leg.
Dangerous stuff off the front leg.

1888
01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:22.650
Unless you can do that too.

1889
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:25.260
You really shouldn't be on the outside striking with him.
It's just,

1890
01:56:25.261 --> 01:56:27.180
it's just too weird that styles too weird.

1891
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.350
So he kind of had the lay back and if you,
and I think again,

1892
01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:32.910
if you look at the results of the fight,

1893
01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:36.000
the times in the fight where someone was hurt,

1894
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:40.200
it was Tyron Woodley putting the hurt on Wonderboy Thompson.
Yes.

1895
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.810
Those are the only times in the fight where it was really exciting.

1896
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:43.591
Other than that,

1897
01:56:43.591 --> 01:56:48.270
it was sort of Wonderboy kind of trying to pick out them from the outside and
um,

1898
01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:50.400
it's a very difficult fight to look good at.

1899
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.430
<v 2>Um,
you know,
the whole idea of mixed martial arts fans,</v>

1900
01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:00.110
there's always three kinds of people that watch mixed martial arts.

1901
01:57:00.170 --> 01:57:05.060
There's fans of drama is fans of violence and his fans of strategy and

1902
01:57:05.061 --> 01:57:09.350
technique.
Guys like us,
when we watch MMA,

1903
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:13.130
we fall into the technique and strategy guy.
That's the guy to me.

1904
01:57:13.131 --> 01:57:16.080
I can watch Woodley flight one,
the boy.
And I'm fascinated by that.

1905
01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:20.180
To me that's just like,
wow,
this said magic.
Yeah,
I can watch it all day.
Um,

1906
01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:24.710
many of the fans want to see violence.
That's what they're tracking too.

1907
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:27.650
And it's a significant portion.
Um,

1908
01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:32.600
others like the idea of drama and athletes in a sense have to brand themselves

1909
01:57:32.601 --> 01:57:34.340
according to one of those three choices.

1910
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:37.730
George always branded himself as the technique and strategy guy.

1911
01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.100
Tyron Woodley's struggling with that.
Now himself,
he's doing the same thing.
Um,

1912
01:57:42.190 --> 01:57:44.870
Calcitonin is the quintessential drama fighter.

1913
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:48.680
He didn't really have an exciting fighting style and he was never really a

1914
01:57:48.681 --> 01:57:52.790
technique and strategy guy.
So he went with drama.
So He'd done vocally,

1915
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:57.180
um,
you know,
get violence based,
find someone who's a mop.

1916
01:57:57.181 --> 01:58:00.150
How Jaros that's his appeal.
You know the Johnson,
yeah.

1917
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.150
Rumble Johnson that it's a violence.
Okay.

1918
01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:06.470
He's not into drama is not going to talk anything.
He's not gonna.
He's not,

1919
01:58:06.471 --> 01:58:08.510
no one is stuck as strategy and t neat guy.

1920
01:58:08.511 --> 01:58:11.240
He's going to come out and do the same thing every fight and it's going to be a

1921
01:58:11.241 --> 01:58:15.170
violent finish.
Um,
so every fighter has to,
as it were,

1922
01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.450
identify what's his ear,
what's he gonna do,

1923
01:58:17.451 --> 01:58:21.080
what's going to be his appeal on work within that.
And um,
you know,

1924
01:58:21.081 --> 01:58:25.940
Tyron is learning.
It's not an easy thing to do.
You get criticism from certain,

1925
01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.260
uh,
as we said,
the other two elements of the,
of,

1926
01:58:29.261 --> 01:58:30.860
of the mixed martial arts audience,

1927
01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:35.150
<v 3>that seems like the big fight.
It's certainly the big fight for Tyron,</v>

1928
01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:37.240
but it seems like the big five for Georges.

1929
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:42.090
<v 2>Yeah.
My only um,
reservation,
uh,
when</v>

1930
01:58:42.090 --> 01:58:45.250
<v 1>you,
when you say,
is this the big fight,
is it essentially,</v>

1931
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.380
it's the same fight that George did for a decade.

1932
01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:51.560
It's George against another very,
very tough welterweight.

1933
01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:56.900
What you did for 10 years was life.
Yeah.
But Tyron is,

1934
01:58:58.570 --> 01:59:01.840
he's especially dangerous.
I mean,

1935
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:06.250
he's a more,
I think he's more dangerous than Hendricks.

1936
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:07.990
I think he's more dangerous than nails guys.

1937
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:11.680
I think his ability to put you away with one shot is,

1938
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:14.530
but you could say top of the food chain tricks was putting people away with one

1939
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:19.450
shelf is,
you know,
yeah,
he was Hendrix's fascinating case.

1940
01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:23.610
And we should probably talk about that once the camera stops.
Um,

1941
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.000
he's a,
he's a,
he was a fascinating case and I can understand,
um,

1942
01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:34.150
why he was so successful.
But you know,

1943
01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:37.030
there's a lot to maintaining that.

1944
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:42.240
There's a lot too is one thing to get to a position where you are a world class

1945
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:44.910
fighter.
It's like how long can you keep that up for her?

1946
01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.950
And one of the most impressive aspects of George's career was the fact that

1947
01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:51.820
George was able to keep that up for so long.
People don't understand this.
They A,

1948
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:56.530
um,
it's incredibly tough to become a UFC champion,
but however tough net is,

1949
01:59:56.620 --> 02:00:00.160
it's 10 times tougher to stay there.
Um,

1950
02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.450
and on so many different levels too.
It's not just a physical thing.
You,

1951
02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:06.640
the moment you become champion,
you become the most studied fighter in the world.

1952
02:00:06.850 --> 02:00:09.010
Yeah.
Everyone knows every little weakness.

1953
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.130
They see every little strength and they can negate it and um,

1954
02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:17.230
psychologically it's tough to,
you know,
every time the other guy fights,

1955
02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:22.840
it's the biggest fight of his life where he's,
every time you find it,

1956
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.570
it's just another fun.
Is He a 10th title?

1957
02:00:25.571 --> 02:00:29.200
Defense fields is another flight for the other guy across the ring.

1958
02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:31.330
This is the biggest moment of his life.

1959
02:00:31.331 --> 02:00:35.410
He's coming at you with everything he's got.
This is his moment of glory.

1960
02:00:35.411 --> 02:00:38.960
This is literally gonna change his life and keep them still UFC champion feel

1961
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:39.833
his the next fight.

1962
02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:44.530
That's the question was like is it possible for a champion to maintain it

1963
02:00:44.531 --> 02:00:49.531
challenges intensity through a 10 title fight defect or do you just have to

1964
02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:53.650
accept the fact that you're dealing with a completely different mind space?

1965
02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.120
I think ultimately you have to drop the whole pretense that it's about intensity

1966
02:00:58.570 --> 02:00:59.140
because no,

1967
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.500
I don't believe anyone can hold the same amount of intensity of a teen years of

1968
02:01:02.501 --> 02:01:07.030
preparation.
You have to start thinking in terms of,

1969
02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.550
I'm going to defend my title with technique and strategy,

1970
02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.010
because if you go with intensity,

1971
02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:16.450
you can only hold intensity so long it's going to diminish and time as you get

1972
02:01:16.451 --> 02:01:20.320
paid more,
as you get tired,
as you get injured,
as years go by,

1973
02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:23.170
the intensity drops.
Now,

1974
02:01:23.171 --> 02:01:27.430
when you analyze various fighters of today,

1975
02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.500
who stands out to you?
Oh,
it's a lot.
There's some very,
very impressive people.

1976
02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:37.020
A guy who impresses me enormously is Demetrius Johnson.
Yeah,

1977
02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:40.040
I extremely impressed this.
I think he's the

1978
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.480
<v 2>greatest of all time.
Um,
it's,
it's hard to,</v>

1979
02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:49.130
graceful time is such a tough thing to say.
It's um,
uh,

1980
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:52.640
with Demetrius to the open question is always going to be what was the level of

1981
02:01:52.641 --> 02:01:54.830
competition.
Right?
But that's not his fault.

1982
02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:58.820
He can only fight the guys that give you what's like Roy Jones Jr when Roy was

1983
02:01:58.821 --> 02:02:00.890
in his prime.
Yeah.
Same sort of situation.

1984
02:02:00.891 --> 02:02:03.050
Yet he was so much better than everybody else.

1985
02:02:03.051 --> 02:02:07.130
It's like how good were these guys?
I mean they were worldclass guys,

1986
02:02:07.131 --> 02:02:10.340
but against him,
they just looked like they didn't belong in there.

1987
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:15.140
What you typically find is that when you come to a cs who's the greatest of all

1988
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:18.970
time,
it's always going to come down to criteria.
And um,

1989
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:24.170
each guy,
his his strong point,
his claim to fame,

1990
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:26.840
as far as,
you know,
I was the bass guy of all time.
Um,

1991
02:02:26.841 --> 02:02:29.000
let's stick with just UFC champions.

1992
02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.990
Otherwise we could live discussion would be too great if we go into pride and

1993
02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:36.650
you know,
he's getting is going to get out of control.
Um,

1994
02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.660
but Demetrius Johnson's,
uh,
his,

1995
02:02:41.661 --> 02:02:42.890
his claim to fame is,

1996
02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:46.790
is the completeness with which he's winning fights.

1997
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:51.380
He's using everything beautifully.
He's knocking,
you know,
he's hitting people.

1998
02:02:51.381 --> 02:02:54.260
He's,
he's clenching people.
He's,
he's hitting clinched knockouts.
You know,

1999
02:02:54.261 --> 02:02:58.130
you don't see it as often in the USC.
Um,
he's incredibly good on the ground.

2000
02:02:58.131 --> 02:02:59.420
A few times he gets in trouble.

2001
02:02:59.421 --> 02:03:02.670
He seems to navigate his way out without a problem.
Um,

2002
02:03:02.690 --> 02:03:06.170
this a completeness in a skillset,
which is incredibly impressive.
Okay?

2003
02:03:06.171 --> 02:03:09.470
He's integrating wrestling and striking and ways that just deeply,

2004
02:03:09.471 --> 02:03:11.390
deeply impressive.
Um,

2005
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:16.510
you'll get someone like a Jose Aldo who's right up there in terms of,

2006
02:03:16.701 --> 02:03:21.640
you know,
as he wanted the grace of all time.
Um,
a sad thing about USC is that,
uh,

2007
02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:25.160
UFC fans I should say,
is that people have very short memories.

2008
02:03:25.590 --> 02:03:28.550
You a guy loses a couple of fights and suddenly he sucks.
And it's like,
dude,

2009
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:32.390
Jose Aldo was a killer and you kill it for 10 years.
Um,

2010
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:37.890
and uh,
obviously a very,
very skilled,
he had that and um,
and he fought,
you know,

2011
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:42.530
many tough opponents.
And uh,
do you feel like when you see a guy,
like,

2012
02:03:42.531 --> 02:03:45.620
although you were just seeing the miles,
the miles pile up,

2013
02:03:45.621 --> 02:03:49.280
or do you think that Max Holloway,
he's not that good?
It's not that all of that.

2014
02:03:49.290 --> 02:03:50.940
All 32.
Yeah.
So I'm,

2015
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:54.680
I'm reluctant to say it's the miles and also wholesale to it didn't really take

2016
02:03:54.681 --> 02:03:56.480
a lot of damage and it's crazy.
And he's,

2017
02:03:56.630 --> 02:04:00.270
he's not like a guy that got knocked out five times and you know,
it came back.

2018
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.110
So in terms of like the damage he took in his age,

2019
02:04:03.111 --> 02:04:05.630
I don't think it's a question of miles and his,

2020
02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:09.180
do you think as a team it's a question of the game just passing them by,
um,

2021
02:04:09.710 --> 02:04:13.970
new levels of the game?
I,
that's,
that's a great question.
Well,

2022
02:04:13.971 --> 02:04:18.610
I feel like Max Holloway style was almost like the perfect.
Yeah.

2023
02:04:18.710 --> 02:04:22.780
A lot of it comes out to styles and um,
and you're right,
uh,

2024
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.530
Holloway's awkward distancing and things like very good distancing but also

2025
02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:30.950
phenomenal endurance,
unbelievable mental toughness,

2026
02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.720
extreme confidence in himself.

2027
02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:37.800
And he has the ability to break guys just puts a piece on them very nick like in

2028
02:04:37.801 --> 02:04:38.510
that regard.

2029
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:41.820
<v 3>Yeah.
It just puts that pace on him.
And you saw it with Aldo.</v>

2030
02:04:41.821 --> 02:04:45.750
You see all those start to wilt almost thought is strongly in both cases.
Yes.

2031
02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:48.270
He had a very strong,
well that's his thing though.

2032
02:04:48.271 --> 02:04:53.130
He's so explosive and he sprints essentially.
But you really can't do that.

2033
02:04:53.131 --> 02:04:53.700
I mean,

2034
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:58.700
his style is highlighted by incredibly explosive,

2035
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:02.580
fast movement and Max is not.

2036
02:05:02.970 --> 02:05:06.990
Maxxis is about avoiding and then accumulation of bombs,

2037
02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:12.000
a of techniques keep it on you keep and also his well-roundedness his ability to

2038
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:15.060
submit you ability to absorb shots,

2039
02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:18.600
maintain composure when being fired upon all those things.

2040
02:05:18.601 --> 02:05:22.100
Incredible strengths of his but particularly,
uh,

2041
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:25.580
matched up against Aldo.
His strengths really shine.

2042
02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:28.310
<v 2>Yes.
Yeah,
but that's a,
Eh,</v>

2043
02:05:28.690 --> 02:05:31.850
a whole mark of if you're going to call someone that already of times they have

2044
02:05:31.851 --> 02:05:34.840
to be able to take on a wide array of upon

2045
02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:39.110
<v 3>yeah and still be successful.
Which is why Demetrius gets my vote.</v>

2046
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:44.290
I just feel like when you look at Benevidez,
when you look at,
uh,

2047
02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:47.810
th this many different people that he fought,

2048
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:50.180
showed him a bunch of different looks,

2049
02:05:50.190 --> 02:05:54.500
bunch of different styles and he was able to overwhelm the mall.
Wilson Hayes,

2050
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:58.520
what's your assessment of his fight against Dominick Cruz?
Apple Weight Division.

2051
02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:03.560
See,
I look at that as a learning experience.
A different era.

2052
02:06:03.561 --> 02:06:06.080
A different guy.
He had a full time job back then.

2053
02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:09.830
It wasn't the same thing happens if he finds Dominick Cruz is second time.

2054
02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:12.960
I'm fascinated by that.
I want to see him fight TJ dental shop.

2055
02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:16.730
I think that's the big fight because Tj is willing to go down to 125.

2056
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:19.910
So instead of fighting Dominick at one 35,
Tj is like,

2057
02:06:19.911 --> 02:06:24.080
I can make one 25 and Tj feels like he'll be the guy to break the legacy.

2058
02:06:24.081 --> 02:06:25.820
He'll be far bigger,
stronger.

2059
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:28.910
It feels like he can match them speed for speed and he thinks he can make the

2060
02:06:28.911 --> 02:06:31.880
weight comfortably.
I'm really fascinated by that fight.
Um,

2061
02:06:32.150 --> 02:06:37.150
because also I think Tj is one of the few guys that's trained,

2062
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:42.650
uh,
by,
I think Matt Hume is one of the great unsung heroes of MMA.

2063
02:06:42.930 --> 02:06:47.420
I agree with.
He's a master,
fascinating,
fascinating guy.
Incredibly intelligent,

2064
02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:51.550
deep,
deep knowledge of the sport.
Both stand up and on the ground and,

2065
02:06:51.551 --> 02:06:54.500
and integrating those two things together.
He's one of the few guys

2066
02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:59.190
<v 2>you can genuinely say his,
um,
uh,</v>

2067
02:06:59.490 --> 02:07:04.490
expertise across all areas of mixed martial arts and played a pivotal role in

2068
02:07:05.311 --> 02:07:09.180
taking someone from being an unknown to a legitimate,

2069
02:07:09.181 --> 02:07:13.380
Greg will champion,
um,
all the time.
I see people who,

2070
02:07:13.890 --> 02:07:18.510
people often don't make a distinction between recruiters and coaches.
Okay.
This,

2071
02:07:18.511 --> 02:07:22.080
there's many fight camps out there that are very good at recruiting people that

2072
02:07:22.081 --> 02:07:26.390
were already good and helping them to manage them,
et Cetera,

2073
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:29.010
and make them slightly better.
The world's full of recruiters,

2074
02:07:29.370 --> 02:07:33.320
but there's not many coaches out there.
Matt Hume took a kid who'd known,

2075
02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:38.160
had heard of and took him from obscurity to arguably one of the base of old

2076
02:07:38.161 --> 02:07:41.800
time.
Okay.
Um,
and he,

2077
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:46.870
he did it in a way with that that kid went from being essentially a wrestler to

2078
02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:51.820
a genuinely well rounded mixed martial artist with a complete set of skills.

2079
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:54.250
Uh,
that's an impressive accomplishment.

2080
02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:58.090
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
and it's also his,</v>

2081
02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:02.740
the way he does it,
the way he fights,
how little damage he takes.
Yes.

2082
02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:08.020
It's his movement,
his,
his,
uh,
ability to control like,
uh,

2083
02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:09.850
a good example,
Dodson,

2084
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:14.910
he fought John Dodson who's unbelievably explosive and fast and dangerous and

2085
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:16.660
just overwhelmed him.

2086
02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:21.980
<v 2>If Demetrius Johnson didn't exist,
would have been a very good champion.
Oh yeah.</v>

2087
02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:23.420
Highly regarded champion.
Yeah.

2088
02:08:23.690 --> 02:08:26.140
That people don't realize how good some of these opponents,
Audi and,

2089
02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:29.710
and they say,
oh,
I see the level of a Ponant that goodwill Dalton's it.

2090
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:34.060
<v 3>He's a very good Dotson was especially a few years ago.</v>

2091
02:08:34.130 --> 02:08:37.930
It's extremely dangerous.
He seems to be in a bit of a Rut down,

2092
02:08:37.931 --> 02:08:40.330
whether it's a psychological rod or a physical Rut.

2093
02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.950
It was not quite the same guy that he used to be.
But you know,

2094
02:08:44.951 --> 02:08:49.270
it's hard when a guy best you,
the way that mighty mouse best too,

2095
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:53.650
because it seems like the level of talent is so far above where you're at,

2096
02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.440
that you,
it's like you left with a dilemma.
Like,
how do I catch this guy,
Ken?

2097
02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:00.340
Is it even possible for me to catch them?

2098
02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:04.840
Because they had two fights and the second fight mighty mouse won handily.

2099
02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:08.380
The first fight was closer.
The first fight was more dangerous.

2100
02:09:08.381 --> 02:09:10.960
He got hit a few times,
but in the second fight,

2101
02:09:10.961 --> 02:09:15.700
mighty mouse just showed leaps and bounds and it was just a route he just ran

2102
02:09:15.701 --> 02:09:17.560
him over.
Um,

2103
02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:21.800
the other arguments are Anderson Anderson in his prime is one of the,
uh,

2104
02:09:21.850 --> 02:09:25.570
it's a great argument for the greatest of all time,
you know,
uh,

2105
02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:29.650
outside of the UFC it's fate or I think those are really the only arguments for

2106
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:33.010
the greatest of all times.
And George George's in there,

2107
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:36.870
especially coming back and beating Bisping that puts him,
you know,

2108
02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:38.170
right back into the mix.

2109
02:09:38.171 --> 02:09:41.350
And in terms of a argument of one of the greatest of all time.
Yeah,

2110
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:44.230
<v 2>I think it was an important step for him because as I said,</v>

2111
02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:47.560
there were three persistent criticisms and he answered all three in one night.

2112
02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:50.860
So,
um,
that definitely helps his case.
What's your thought on,

2113
02:09:50.861 --> 02:09:53.830
could be number of Madoff?
Extremely embraced.

2114
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:59.860
His kid is a deeply,
deeply impressive.
I've um,

2115
02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:03.790
uh,
he's coming to the academy a couple of times before fights.

2116
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:07.300
I've never actually seen him train.
Um,
he uh,

2117
02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:09.970
after his fight in Madison Square Garden,

2118
02:10:09.971 --> 02:10:13.240
he bought himself and a group of his friends,

2119
02:10:13.241 --> 02:10:15.970
his training partners came into the academy and trained in my Monday afternoon

2120
02:10:15.971 --> 02:10:18.280
class.
Could be,
didn't train.
He just sat on the bench.

2121
02:10:18.281 --> 02:10:20.680
Cause he'd just support on Saturday nights.
Of course he's not going to train,

2122
02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:23.010
but his,
um,
his,
uh,

2123
02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:26.350
his training partners came in and trained with a squad and that was a fun

2124
02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:31.150
afternoon.
They rolled with,
um,
I think mostly Nikki Ryan and um,
uh,

2125
02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:33.800
it's hard for them of course,
because it's submission grappling.

2126
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.280
That's not really what they do.
They do more the interface of,
of,
um,

2127
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:40.580
grappling to bind with striking.
So they had a hard time of it.
But,
uh,

2128
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:42.590
he struck me as a very,
very nice person.

2129
02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.820
He shockingly big for his weight division,
shockingly,
shockingly.
So,
um,

2130
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:51.650
like all the people coming out of the Caucasus regions of Russia has wrestling

2131
02:10:51.651 --> 02:10:54.170
is extremely good.
Um,

2132
02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.410
they have probably the base wrestling program in the world,

2133
02:10:57.411 --> 02:11:00.860
that whole area stretching from,
uh,
uh,

2134
02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:03.410
asitia through Dagestan's or Chechnya,

2135
02:11:03.411 --> 02:11:07.040
all the way down to Iran at that areas as the hotbed of wrestling in the world.

2136
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:09.230
And it shows all their fighters.

2137
02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:13.130
They're all strong and wrestling and in night is add to that,
the various skills.

2138
02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:15.110
And you've got a tough,
tough group of people.

2139
02:11:15.670 --> 02:11:16.690
<v 1>Yeah,
I was extremely,</v>

2140
02:11:16.691 --> 02:11:19.480
I bet I've been impressed with every single performance he's had in the octagon.

2141
02:11:19.481 --> 02:11:23.440
I mean,
he's a undefeated,
which is incredibly rare in and of itself,

2142
02:11:23.441 --> 02:11:26.380
but in the hundred and 55 pound division,
even more impressive.

2143
02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:31.620
But the way he mauled Barboza shocking Jesus Christ and that you could see the

2144
02:11:31.841 --> 02:11:34.610
fight was essentially over halfway through round one.
Yes.

2145
02:11:35.290 --> 02:11:38.650
You could see it in Barboza his face.
It was drained.
Yeah.

2146
02:11:38.651 --> 02:11:43.450
That was an incredibly impressive performance.
Um,
I,
uh,

2147
02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:44.800
uh,
obviously there's still,

2148
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:48.100
you can't put them yet in the grace of all time category,

2149
02:11:48.101 --> 02:11:50.450
but he hasn't won a title.
Hasn't even challenge for it.
Yeah.

2150
02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:54.280
But you definitely get the sense that if,
if he had had a title fight by now,

2151
02:11:54.281 --> 02:11:59.230
he probably would've been a champion by now hem versus Connor,
Jesus Christ.

2152
02:11:59.231 --> 02:12:02.650
That's what I want to say.
Him versus Connor and Russia or him versus Tony,

2153
02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:06.550
Tony Ferguson.
And then would be a very interesting fight.

2154
02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:07.051
<v 2>Well.</v>

2155
02:12:07.051 --> 02:12:10.260
What's interesting about those two fights as you have basically polar opposites

2156
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:15.360
can be minimum and get all this a control based Phaidon whereas Tony Focus in is

2157
02:12:15.361 --> 02:12:20.361
a scramble based fight them and just that clash in styles.

2158
02:12:20.431 --> 02:12:24.140
It's going to be fascinating with regards Conor McGregor and could be minimum

2159
02:12:24.150 --> 02:12:24.780
get off.

2160
02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:29.780
The feeling one gets is that if they did fight it would be a complete shutout in

2161
02:12:30.301 --> 02:12:31.770
one of two directions.

2162
02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:38.120
It's either like a man beating up a child on the ground or it's just a flush

2163
02:12:38.581 --> 02:12:43.581
knock out a guy unable to cover distance properly and walking into a left hand

2164
02:12:44.491 --> 02:12:49.491
and just we ain't catastrophic k OTE and you feel like there's potential for it

2165
02:12:49.831 --> 02:12:52.770
to go in both directions.
Uh,
and

2166
02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:55.870
<v 1>that's a fight I don't think goes to the distance.
It's uh,</v>

2167
02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:00.460
it's one way or the other.
Yeah,
I agree.
Um,
I feel like what Connor presents,

2168
02:13:00.461 --> 02:13:05.461
it's interesting in terms of danger is speed and one shot knock out power with

2169
02:13:05.831 --> 02:13:09.310
his hands and could be,
has been hurt coming in by Michael Johnson.

2170
02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.800
It's really the only adversity ever suffered inside the occupant.

2171
02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:14.520
And he dealt with it.
Well that's a good sign for debate.

2172
02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:17.200
It's a sliver of hope that every opponent claims to,

2173
02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:21.220
they watched that one moment where Michael Johnson clipped him and be like,
look,

2174
02:13:21.221 --> 02:13:26.020
look,
he's human.
Yeah.
Think you'd be hurt.
It's like the terminator if it bleeds.

2175
02:13:26.021 --> 02:13:30.790
Okay.
I believe that this predator.
Oh yeah.
What'd I say?
Terminator?

2176
02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:36.000
You just fucked up your reference.
Sorry,
I'm sweaty.
Ah,

2177
02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:37.770
yeah,
I did fuck it up.
Um,

2178
02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.800
but I think that Connor has been overwhelmed on the ground though and he's been

2179
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:46.850
overwhelmed by Nate.
Yeah.
And he's been controlled in the ground by Chad.

2180
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:50.670
One gets the feeling that whatever amount of control they were able to impose on

2181
02:13:50.671 --> 02:13:54.510
them,
it would be nothing compared with what could be,
could impose more of a,

2182
02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:59.250
could be.
Um,
it's a much more dangerous form of control.
Could be.
Yes.
It could be,

2183
02:13:59.310 --> 02:14:02.130
has a program of hitting people on the ground,

2184
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:06.320
which is substantially better than either of the two athletes you just
mentioned.

2185
02:14:06.321 --> 02:14:10.430
Yes.
Um,
and big differences when it could be,

2186
02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.090
gets you on the ground.
You're not getting up.
No.
You're getting mauled.

2187
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:16.800
And it's almost like a spider.

2188
02:14:17.070 --> 02:14:21.330
Like he's injecting venom into you and slowly but surely like weakening your

2189
02:14:21.331 --> 02:14:22.890
body.
Yeah.
Like you,

2190
02:14:22.891 --> 02:14:27.780
you see after the first round when Barboza gets up,
it's like,

2191
02:14:27.810 --> 02:14:30.460
okay,
you mean he's,
he's alive still.

2192
02:14:30.690 --> 02:14:34.420
But this is a different person now and going into the second round,
I mean,

2193
02:14:34.421 --> 02:14:37.140
the Barboza gave an admirable kind of himself.
I mean,

2194
02:14:37.141 --> 02:14:38.580
he showed himself to be a true warrior.

2195
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.500
He did try a couple of spinning back kick.
Yeah.

2196
02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:43.680
Some of them were relatively close.
Our Bose is kicking.

2197
02:14:43.710 --> 02:14:48.390
Heavy strategy though is very different than Connors Connors kicks or just the

2198
02:14:48.391 --> 02:14:52.620
opposite.
His kicks are just probes.
He sort of poking at you,

2199
02:14:52.621 --> 02:14:56.790
poking at you and it putting things out in front of you and he's just trying to,

2200
02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:01.380
just trying to drop that hard left hand on you.
It's a fascinating guy.

2201
02:15:01.381 --> 02:15:05.850
It was fascinating.
I always undervalued him.
When he first came in the UFC,

2202
02:15:05.851 --> 02:15:09.100
I said,
oh,
that's high,
but typing it.
But the more I started the little wrestle,

2203
02:15:10.230 --> 02:15:13.860
he's very,
very skilled.
While he's also,
he Mindfox people.

2204
02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.830
He mind fucks people in a way that,
um,

2205
02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:19.970
but I don't think he's mind fucking could be anything that works on could be.

2206
02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:21.390
I don't think that's going to happen.

2207
02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:24.990
I just think there's dealing with a totally different kind of human being.

2208
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:28.200
Does people from Dagestan are just so hard.

2209
02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:33.750
It's just a hard part of the world.
They're just,
they're made of hardier stuff.

2210
02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:36.900
You know what I mean?
It's just like they have to deal with way more.

2211
02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:40.260
Not that people in Ireland are soft.
They're fucking hard people too.

2212
02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.850
I just think that with,
I've always said the most important,

2213
02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:49.650
if you have a pyramid of technique,
when it comes to a mixed martial arts,

2214
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:51.030
the base of the pyramid,

2215
02:15:51.031 --> 02:15:55.140
the most important thing is the ability to control the grappling,

2216
02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:59.520
the ability to take a guy down.
If you can take a guy down and control him,

2217
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:02.010
you have a significant advantage.

2218
02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:05.550
You can choose where the fight takes place and if you're competent in the

2219
02:16:05.551 --> 02:16:08.400
standup,
which could be was definitely competent in the standup.

2220
02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.200
So you are adequate in the standup but overwhelming when it gets to the ground.

2221
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:17.040
You can present problems with a guy standing up and which,

2222
02:16:17.041 --> 02:16:18.360
which case his problems.

2223
02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:23.160
The guy has to deal with the striking aspects which opened up the takedowns.
Um,

2224
02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:26.160
I wholeheartedly agree with you,
but I'll go a little further.

2225
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:29.650
Whenever someone asks me what are the,

2226
02:16:30.090 --> 02:16:31.750
<v 2>what are the programs that,
well,</v>

2227
02:16:31.751 --> 02:16:35.370
what do you look for when you see a guy dominating fights?
What,
what,

2228
02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:39.280
what makes someone go in the right directions with their training and

2229
02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:42.640
[inaudible] fighting itself.
I always say there's three things.

2230
02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:45.160
If you show me a fighter who can,
one,

2231
02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:51.310
dominate the setups to dominate the pace of the fight.

2232
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:56.110
And three,
how can I phrase this?

2233
02:17:00.990 --> 02:17:05.190
Dominate the simple direction of the fight.
Three things dominate the setups,

2234
02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:07.440
dominate the pace,
dominate the direction.

2235
02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.700
You show me a fighter who can do those three things and I'll show you a fighter

2236
02:17:11.701 --> 02:17:14.460
who can win 95% of the fights he gets into

2237
02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:19.600
dominate the setups,
dominate the pace,
dominantly direction.

2238
02:17:20.510 --> 02:17:23.630
Thinking about someone that could be,
or anyone who comes from a a,

2239
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.600
a strong wrestling or judo,

2240
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:29.290
Jujitsu with takedowns baseline is they always going to hit a dominated

2241
02:17:29.291 --> 02:17:33.850
direction.
They determine whether it goes down to the ground over there.

2242
02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:38.260
It say standing
to be always dominates the pace of the fight.

2243
02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:40.720
Once you're on the ground,
you're on top.

2244
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:43.360
The other guys is reacting to what you're doing,

2245
02:17:43.361 --> 02:17:46.960
trying to get back up to his feet,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
You're dominating pace.

2246
02:17:49.210 --> 02:17:53.410
If there's one weakness that could be pairs is,
is not as strong.

2247
02:17:53.411 --> 02:17:58.000
It dominating the setups to get to those areas where he can dominate,

2248
02:17:58.330 --> 02:18:01.780
pays and uh,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2249
02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:03.790
If he's going to lose a fight,

2250
02:18:03.791 --> 02:18:07.810
it's going to be in their area and corner more than anything else.

2251
02:18:07.811 --> 02:18:12.340
As a guy who dominates the setups you set up before the kicks,

2252
02:18:12.341 --> 02:18:15.100
a probe,
they're not kicks.
It's not trying to hurt you with the kicks.

2253
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:19.200
He's probing.
He hurts you with this.
Okay.

2254
02:18:19.510 --> 02:18:23.950
So Connor skill is,
he's a master of dominating setups,

2255
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:27.820
especially in a standing position,
but to beavs mastery.

2256
02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:33.040
Out of those three critical areas for domination and all forms of fighting is

2257
02:18:33.041 --> 02:18:34.630
he's a dominant,
uh,

2258
02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:38.860
he's incredibly dominant in determining the direction of the fight and the pace

2259
02:18:38.861 --> 02:18:41.380
of the fight.
That's why he never gets tired and it's white.

2260
02:18:41.381 --> 02:18:43.870
It's got a very high work rate,
but he never gets tired.

2261
02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:47.110
He never see him just completely shattered despite the fact he's working hard

2262
02:18:47.111 --> 02:18:47.730
the whole time.

2263
02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:48.240
<v 3>And the fight,</v>

2264
02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:51.750
despite the fact that he is significantly weakens themselves to make 155 pounds,

2265
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:54.660
which apparently he's done far better now.

2266
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:58.770
He had a real nutritionist heading into this camp and it was much easier for him

2267
02:18:58.771 --> 02:19:02.040
to cut the weight.
I'd be fascinated to see him fight at one 70 and,
well,

2268
02:19:02.041 --> 02:19:02.874
that's a plan.

2269
02:19:03.210 --> 02:19:06.040
Apparently that was the plan and Willie was joking around about it saying he,

2270
02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.620
he'll send them nutritionists.

2271
02:19:07.710 --> 02:19:11.700
So sell to keep his psycho ass down at one 55 was his exact,
that's fine.

2272
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.943
Yeah.

2273
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:18.690
<v 2>Yeah.
With regards to your point before you saying the,
this,</v>

2274
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:20.140
this core combat skill,

2275
02:19:20.141 --> 02:19:23.470
the most important one that you as a commentator look for when you look at fine,

2276
02:19:23.471 --> 02:19:28.430
it's,
you know,
um,
can you determine,
uh,
you,
you put grappling

2277
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:31.880
<v 4>skill as the number one same way there'd be wrestling with every Samba at the</v>

2278
02:19:31.881 --> 02:19:35.120
beach you get,
so what have you.
Um,
I would go through them and say,
yeah,

2279
02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.760
there's three things that I look for who dominates the setups,

2280
02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:40.220
who dominates the pace,
who dominates the direction.

2281
02:19:40.670 --> 02:19:44.420
Now what are your thoughts about strength and conditioning for mixed martial

2282
02:19:44.421 --> 02:19:47.660
arts fighters?
That's,
um,
that's a huge question,

2283
02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.900
but the question is like,
what takes precedent?

2284
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:52.730
Does skill training take precedent?

2285
02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:56.800
Like there's several schools of thought and um,
one of them would be,
well,

2286
02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:00.830
one of the more interesting ones is nick curse on and Marvin Marinovich that

2287
02:20:00.831 --> 02:20:01.190
camp.

2288
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:04.790
They believe that you already know how to fight and that what the camp really

2289
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:08.150
should be about is just radical strength and conditioning to the point where,

2290
02:20:08.370 --> 02:20:11.900
let's,
uh,
let's,
that's a mixed question then.

2291
02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:16.550
Are you talking about a fight camp or he's talking about fight training over the

2292
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:21.470
year?
Let's,
let's talk about a fight camp and specific.
Okay.
Okay.

2293
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:25.060
Average fight camp is around,
uh,
uh,

2294
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:27.780
six to eight weeks and has the longest you ever heard,

2295
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:31.790
it's like a 10 to 12 weeks.
That's a,
that's a very,
very long fight camp.
Um,

2296
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:37.040
how much physiological change can you affect in the body in six to eight weeks?

2297
02:20:39.610 --> 02:20:43.520
She can,
you could tighten everything up.
You can,

2298
02:20:43.521 --> 02:20:47.810
you can certainly increase your endurance,
your threshold,
your ability to work.

2299
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:51.110
How much could you increase your vo two Max and six weeks is a good question.

2300
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:54.980
A few percentage points,
I believe.
Uh,
I think considerably less than that.
Really?

2301
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:55.843
Yeah.

2302
02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:58.593
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

2303
02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:03.540
<v 4>I don't know.
How much could you increase your vertical jump in six weeks?</v>

2304
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:06.890
Not much.
Not much at all.

2305
02:21:07.970 --> 02:21:11.780
I'm not a big believer in the idea that you're going to create big,

2306
02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:16.340
significant fight changing physiological changes in six to eight weeks.

2307
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:19.280
It's not really my experience.
Um,

2308
02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.760
but I can show someone a single technique which can have a direct impact on a

2309
02:21:25.431 --> 02:21:30.200
fight.
I can show them that and five minutes.
Mm.
Okay.
Um,

2310
02:21:30.201 --> 02:21:33.920
I'm not gonna claim to be a medical expert who has a deep understanding of these

2311
02:21:33.921 --> 02:21:38.660
things about my experience in coaching is that physiological changes take time

2312
02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:41.990
and you're not going to get it done in a fight camp.
Yes.

2313
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:46.010
You can make physiological changes over a year,
two years.
Absolutely.

2314
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:48.110
George went up a weight division.
Okay.

2315
02:21:48.111 --> 02:21:51.200
But it took quite a bit of preparation to do.
So it didn't happen in six weeks.

2316
02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:53.990
What kind of strength training was he doing to do though?

2317
02:21:53.991 --> 02:21:56.150
I know he's very involved in gymnastics.

2318
02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:01.100
George George has primary physical training outside.
Is this gymnastics?

2319
02:22:01.101 --> 02:22:03.410
He loves it.
Um,
uh,

2320
02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:08.300
he also for a time did Olympic weightlifting less so now than before,
but,
uh,

2321
02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:11.030
there was a time that was a big part of it.
Um,

2322
02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:16.060
recently he started taking on a training in water with various fins,

2323
02:22:17.481 --> 02:22:20.540
et Cetera,
et Cetera to increase resistance.
And he's quite a fan of that.

2324
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:24.230
But the truth is George go through,
goes through cycles and uh,
you know,

2325
02:22:24.231 --> 02:22:26.190
boredom is a factor.
He get bored at a certain

2326
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:30.450
<v 2>kind of physical activity and you want to try something new.
And um,</v>

2327
02:22:30.451 --> 02:22:33.150
so he's gone through various cycles.
I can tell you this,

2328
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:39.530
Georgia's strength has not significantly changed despite the various changes in

2329
02:22:41.881 --> 02:22:44.940
physiological training.
Like when he did Olympic lifting,

2330
02:22:44.941 --> 02:22:49.830
he wasn't massively strong with him when he did regular weight lifting or when

2331
02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:53.520
he did swim training.
I did,
I didn't feel like,
okay,

2332
02:22:53.521 --> 02:22:56.530
one made him stronger than the other.
Okay.
Um,

2333
02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:03.520
there's so many interesting questions and the one you just asked is okay.

2334
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:07.690
Do I believe that strength is important?
Absolutely.
Okay.
Anyone,

2335
02:23:07.730 --> 02:23:10.950
anyone who says that strengths doesn't make a difference in a fight is just

2336
02:23:10.951 --> 02:23:14.110
straight up ignoring the obvious facts.

2337
02:23:14.111 --> 02:23:17.470
Is a reason why men don't find women because there's massive strength

2338
02:23:17.471 --> 02:23:18.304
differences.

2339
02:23:18.310 --> 02:23:21.270
There's a reason why this weight categories cause there's big strength was when

2340
02:23:21.310 --> 02:23:25.390
heavyweight and lightweight.
Okay.
Um,
strength makes a difference.

2341
02:23:25.391 --> 02:23:29.350
The pro proof of that is simple easy tool.
Why do people take anabolic steroids?

2342
02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:32.250
Because they know that strength makes a difference.
Okay.

2343
02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:35.710
And there's a reason why they are illegal because they do change the outcome of

2344
02:23:35.711 --> 02:23:38.860
fights.
So yeah,
strength is extremely important.

2345
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:42.550
The question is how are you going to build it and then are you going to do it in

2346
02:23:42.551 --> 02:23:46.300
camp?
Is your fight camp can be based around strings.

2347
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:51.220
That's a risky strategy.
Can you ready to get that much stronger in six weeks?
Um,

2348
02:23:51.370 --> 02:23:55.990
I've always believed that the whole idea of fight camp is to prepare an already

2349
02:23:55.991 --> 02:23:59.740
well trained athlete to get around the problem of one individual.

2350
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:04.990
It's programming one individual to solve the complex problem that another

2351
02:24:04.991 --> 02:24:08.830
individual presents.
It's kind of like preparation for an exam so to speak.

2352
02:24:09.970 --> 02:24:13.790
And um,
for me,
the whole,
the whole thing,

2353
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:16.600
every flight campus motivated by two very simple questions.

2354
02:24:16.810 --> 02:24:20.230
How are you going to win this fight and how you not going to lose this fight,

2355
02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:25.300
the entire structure of the campus based around that and almost all of it has to

2356
02:24:25.301 --> 02:24:29.140
do with tactics and techniques rather than changes in the physical body.

2357
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:35.670
<v 1>Now,
when George is in off camp,
when,
when he's out of camp,</v>

2358
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:39.990
is that when he would,
that's a period of skill acquisition,
uh,

2359
02:24:40.050 --> 02:24:41.700
trying to acquire new skills.

2360
02:24:43.050 --> 02:24:46.850
So that's when he would t I know he's notorious for taking trips like to Brazil.

2361
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:49.350
You do your experimentation,
you know,

2362
02:24:49.351 --> 02:24:51.960
you bring in different perspectives at different person and you think,
hey,

2363
02:24:51.961 --> 02:24:54.720
this is interesting.
This has potential,
this doesn't really have much.

2364
02:24:54.721 --> 02:24:57.750
But then you,
you start changing things up.
Now,

2365
02:24:57.751 --> 02:25:02.330
do you have that same approach with all the fighters that you've worked with?
Uh,

2366
02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:04.510
depends on the context.
How they mixed martial artists.

2367
02:25:04.511 --> 02:25:08.070
Did they train with me full time?
Part time is,
it would depend on the context.

2368
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.870
I can answer with regards to the squad.
Yeah.
Well I,
I'm what I'm,

2369
02:25:10.871 --> 02:25:15.840
what I was going to bring up as Weidman Weidman's approach.
Um,
uh,
you know,

2370
02:25:15.841 --> 02:25:19.890
coming from that elite wrestling background and then developing a lot of,
uh,

2371
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.130
significant,
uh,
mixed martial arts skills,
he,
uh,

2372
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.480
<v 2>is in,
uh,
an unusual situation right now.
Right?
Where,</v>

2373
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:30.490
where does he stand in terms of like future opponents?

2374
02:25:30.491 --> 02:25:33.670
Like where's he at right now?
That's,
uh,

2375
02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:37.720
that's a tough question to us to answer.
Um,
uh,

2376
02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:42.840
Chris I think had probably one of the most meteoric rises into will came chip

2377
02:25:44.741 --> 02:25:47.830
level.
He literally beat twice in a row.

2378
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:51.280
The guy that at that time was considered by most people to be the greatest of

2379
02:25:51.281 --> 02:25:55.210
all time.
His run up to that was incredible.

2380
02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:59.410
I'm sure you've commentated many of those funds until this kid who an animal,

2381
02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:03.670
that the timeframe with which she went from obscurity to world championship

2382
02:26:03.850 --> 02:26:08.500
level is incredibly,
should undefeated,
is insane what he was doing.

2383
02:26:09.310 --> 02:26:13.350
Um,
so there was this incredible meteoric rise.
And then there was a,

2384
02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:17.890
a short period after that where he appeared to be crushing great former

2385
02:26:17.891 --> 02:26:20.890
champions and the Mashiah Vito Belfort.
It wasn't just beating them,

2386
02:26:20.891 --> 02:26:25.870
he says smashing it.
Incredibly impressive.
Um,
and,
uh,

2387
02:26:25.871 --> 02:26:30.580
and then I think people were shocked by what appeared to be an unbeaten record.

2388
02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:35.940
And then 73 losses in a row and catastrophic iasis getting smashed by Luke

2389
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.551
Rockhold,

2390
02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:41.110
getting KOD by a flying knee from yo over Merrill and getting dominated by gay

2391
02:26:41.111 --> 02:26:44.110
garden was saucy.
And then all the controversy that led to that stoppage.

2392
02:26:44.111 --> 02:26:44.930
So it was,

2393
02:26:44.930 --> 02:26:49.930
it was three in a row that on a guy who never even experienced defeat.

2394
02:26:50.250 --> 02:26:54.570
Right.
And so you go from no defeats to three catastrophic defeats in a row that

2395
02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:57.850
that's,
that throws everything off.
Um,

2396
02:26:57.910 --> 02:27:01.900
but then he rebounded with even gas and curd finished one of the toughest guys

2397
02:27:01.901 --> 02:27:03.430
in the division and he's not an easy,

2398
02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:08.290
you saw what guests on went on to do with yes.
Bisbing Bisbing and uh,
so yeah,

2399
02:27:08.370 --> 02:27:10.960
he's,
that was,
that was a great one.
It was a nice come back.
And,

2400
02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:14.710
but the question is,
where does it go from here?
Um,
uh,

2401
02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.690
and I don't have an answer for you.
I'm so sorry.

2402
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:20.280
How often do you work with them on,
not often,
Chris.
Um,

2403
02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:25.090
Chris came to me as a student.
He was a student of met Sarah,
who's,
um,

2404
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:29.920
one of my great friends and training partners from the Henzel Gracie Academy.

2405
02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:35.200
And Matt was having some medical issues and he said,
John,
you know,

2406
02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:38.440
can you take over this student of mine,
Chris Weidman,

2407
02:27:38.441 --> 02:27:41.070
this guy's incredibly talented.
I'd heard of Chris Cause you know,

2408
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:44.080
we're linked schools fairly close by and people were telling me about this

2409
02:27:44.081 --> 02:27:47.650
amazing race lows,
you know,
uh,

2410
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:50.520
incredibly talented picks techniques up.
And you know,

2411
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:53.170
I always take these things with a grain of salt because people exaggerate and

2412
02:27:53.171 --> 02:27:57.460
stuff.
So Chris data coming in and it was all true.
This kid,

2413
02:27:57.461 --> 02:28:00.280
you can show them a teeny on Monday and by Tuesday is doing a better than you

2414
02:28:00.281 --> 02:28:01.690
are.
And uh,

2415
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:06.410
he has a gift for physical movement that you don't see very often.

2416
02:28:06.411 --> 02:28:11.230
And guys that big,
um,
big agile,

2417
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:14.800
highly intelligent and um,
uh,

2418
02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:16.780
and had at that time

2419
02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:22.400
a level of self confidence that was deeply impressive.

2420
02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:28.180
I would show Chris a guillotine variation and then five minutes later he would

2421
02:28:28.731 --> 02:28:33.560
be using it in a gym and then a month later be using it in an MMA fight.

2422
02:28:33.970 --> 02:28:35.220
I get it.
He,

2423
02:28:35.250 --> 02:28:40.250
he literally would see opportunities and immediately act upon them.

2424
02:28:40.970 --> 02:28:45.620
What I worry about with Chris is that in those three losses,

2425
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:49.580
I'm not saying this has happened,

2426
02:28:49.581 --> 02:28:54.581
but what I worry will happen is it fighters who are typically very dominant and

2427
02:28:54.951 --> 02:28:59.951
what confidence fighters when they experienced a feet lose confidence and a big

2428
02:29:00.501 --> 02:29:04.190
pot of Croesus success was that ability to see opportunity and have the

2429
02:29:04.191 --> 02:29:07.310
confidence to immediately act upon it.
Um,

2430
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:12.400
so my concern if I,
uh,
if I,
if I look at cresses,

2431
02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:15.140
will that still be there when he still had the same conference,

2432
02:29:15.141 --> 02:29:17.690
which was such a big part of his rise to the top,

2433
02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:21.280
will it be drastically altered by three losses?
And I'm,

2434
02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:25.580
I'm very pleased to say that it didn't appear to be so in the fight with guests

2435
02:29:25.581 --> 02:29:26.870
to he,
he,
uh,

2436
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:29.930
he actually took a heavy hit at the end of the first round in that fight and

2437
02:29:29.931 --> 02:29:33.770
came back at eight.
It looked like he had,
he'd gone through those,
those,
um,

2438
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:37.190
those three losses and come back,
come back strong and everything was fine.

2439
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:42.320
So I'm pretty confident.
Uh,
Chris,
we'll go on to great success again at one,

2440
02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:44.920
<v 3>knowing how good Chris is on the ground.</v>

2441
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:48.610
How shocked were you about the Luke Rockhold fight?

2442
02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:52.260
<v 2>Uh,
it was a hard one for me to watch.
Um,
uh,</v>

2443
02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:56.850
Chris stopped working with me after this second Anderson Silva fight.

2444
02:29:56.910 --> 02:30:01.440
We did most of that came together and then he stopped working,
um,

2445
02:30:01.850 --> 02:30:04.260
with me move further out onto long island.
He opened up a gym,

2446
02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:08.700
was Ray Longo and uh,
went back to train with Matt Serra and,

2447
02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:11.310
uh,
they,
those guys were incredible training camp.

2448
02:30:11.311 --> 02:30:13.950
They did a fine job getting them through the machine to fines,
et Cetera,

2449
02:30:13.951 --> 02:30:17.780
et cetera.
Um,
I went,
um,
uh,

2450
02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:20.210
I was at that UFC,
uh,

2451
02:30:20.250 --> 02:30:25.020
it was in Las Vegas and Conor Mcgregor was the main event and Chris was the,

2452
02:30:25.021 --> 02:30:29.250
uh,
Co main event.
And,
um,
uh,

2453
02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:32.070
the fight had an interesting beginning.
Um,

2454
02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:35.940
Chris was doing well with the take downs,
but,
um,
uh,
uh,

2455
02:30:35.941 --> 02:30:40.170
Luke Rockhold was doing a great job of controlling Chris's head with like fake

2456
02:30:40.171 --> 02:30:42.990
guillotines to prevent any kind of damage on the ground and doing a good job of

2457
02:30:42.991 --> 02:30:46.530
standing makeup to the feet.
So there was no really significant damage.
Um,

2458
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:51.170
then they got into an interesting kickbox in battle where,
um,
uh,
it,

2459
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:53.040
it seems to go in one direction,

2460
02:30:53.041 --> 02:30:55.740
then switched directions and increasing to be getting the better of it and

2461
02:30:55.741 --> 02:30:56.574
things look good.

2462
02:30:56.730 --> 02:31:01.730
And then there was just one episode where everything just came unstuck in a

2463
02:31:01.921 --> 02:31:05.190
second.
And I remember watching and it's like,
uh,

2464
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:10.020
like watching a bad dream,
you know,
and um,
uh,
yeah,
it was shocking.

2465
02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:13.690
<v 3>Chris through an ill advised wheel Keck.
Yeah.</v>

2466
02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:18.220
Which is slow and telegraph and Rockhold took him to the ground.

2467
02:31:18.221 --> 02:31:20.070
And what I was most shocked with

2468
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.170
<v 1>was,
and I've seen it time and time again,</v>

2469
02:31:22.171 --> 02:31:26.790
I saw it in the David Branch fight and sought in Leo Machida fight is Rockhold

2470
02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:31.110
top game,
if you fucking terrified.
Pretty impressive.
Very impressive.

2471
02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:34.710
Unbelievable.
I,
I attribute that not just his skill,

2472
02:31:34.711 --> 02:31:35.850
which I think is considerable,

2473
02:31:35.851 --> 02:31:40.380
but also to training on a regular basis with Daniel Carmia and Cain Velasquez is

2474
02:31:40.381 --> 02:31:44.760
just his wrestling,
his grappling,
it severely underrated.

2475
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:48.750
Maybe not so now,
but his ability to control guys on the ground.

2476
02:31:48.751 --> 02:31:53.110
It's just terrifying.
An amazing job,
I hope.

2477
02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:55.020
Got very strong submission skills.
Yes.

2478
02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:59.300
People I didn't think talk about those at all.
And uh,

2479
02:31:59.550 --> 02:32:02.550
he submitted a good people and he's hit summit at Beth's been without one arm,

2480
02:32:02.551 --> 02:32:05.850
good team.
And suddenly some of his finishes like highlight reel finishes,

2481
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:11.100
the beautiful,
um,
you know,
he's got tremendous skills.
Um,

2482
02:32:11.101 --> 02:32:15.750
he's big for the division.
Uh,
he's,
uh,
you,
you talk about a guy who,
uh,

2483
02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:19.140
Dominique's that pace and dominates the,
uh,
uh,
the ration.

2484
02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:22.950
He's no one can hold them down for any period of time is great at getting makeup

2485
02:32:22.951 --> 02:32:26.070
to his feet.
He wrestles the fence very,
very well.
Like all the Aka guys,

2486
02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:30.510
they're good on the fence.
Um,
he's a,
he's a very,
very impressive fighter.

2487
02:32:31.130 --> 02:32:32.670
I'm impressed with him and a lot of ways,

2488
02:32:32.671 --> 02:32:36.810
but his ability to control top level guys,
I just thought,

2489
02:32:37.380 --> 02:32:40.260
my thought was when he got Chris down,
like,
okay,

2490
02:32:40.261 --> 02:32:42.750
Chris is a worldclass grappler.

2491
02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:45.220
He's going to be able to get out of this situation.
That'd be scrambles to,

2492
02:32:45.221 --> 02:32:46.890
it's a lot happening,
but there was none of that.

2493
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:51.390
It was just total control and ground and pound for a considerable period of
time.

2494
02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:52.233
Yeah,
it was rough.

2495
02:32:52.290 --> 02:32:55.680
It was rough to watch because it was one of those where you could easily make

2496
02:32:55.681 --> 02:32:58.640
the argument for it had been stopped sooner.
Yeah,
I think so too.
Yeah,

2497
02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:03.060
it was a rough one.
Um,
and now Rockhold is going to face Yoel Romero,

2498
02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:05.580
which is very,
and he's the freak of all freaks.

2499
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:08.330
That's like that guy was made in a lab.
Yeah.

2500
02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:12.930
Isn't Yoel Romero with fighting dated Brunch?
No.
Did this happen recently?

2501
02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:18.120
Yes.
At Robert Whitaker got injured.
What happened?
The knee again,

2502
02:33:18.210 --> 02:33:21.240
most likely if I had a gas,
I don't think they released it,

2503
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:24.900
but there's been an injury.
Maybe it's a different entry,
but um,

2504
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:26.910
when did this happen?
A couple days ago.
Wow.

2505
02:33:27.220 --> 02:33:31.170
I've just flown to California and using the Internet.
So yeah.
So rock.

2506
02:33:31.171 --> 02:33:35.230
Good for you.
It was only two days.
All say that,

2507
02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:40.440
but a Rockhold and well now we're going to fight for the interim belt.

2508
02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:45.840
That's a huge development.
Yeah.
Big Development.
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,

2509
02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:49.600
that's uh,
I mean Yoel Romero.
That's um,

2510
02:33:50.170 --> 02:33:51.750
it's a different vibe.

2511
02:33:53.370 --> 02:33:58.370
Yoel Romero is probably the most uncontrollable man in the universe is a

2512
02:33:58.981 --> 02:34:02.130
difficult,
difficult posting to control in any aspect of the fight.

2513
02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:06.120
He's a fight as some parts of what he does.
Make no sense.

2514
02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:08.370
Like he's one of the greatest grace list of his generation.

2515
02:34:08.980 --> 02:34:11.790
Many people take them down.
Yeah.
He gets taken down all the time,

2516
02:34:12.090 --> 02:34:14.160
but they kind of control and he just springs back up.

2517
02:34:14.310 --> 02:34:17.380
He's not worried about being taken down.
I think that's part of it.
Yeah.

2518
02:34:17.381 --> 02:34:21.010
Cause he comes so hard with the upper body,
lower body open and um,

2519
02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.600
and you're right,
there's no consequence to it.

2520
02:34:22.601 --> 02:34:27.110
He can just get up whenever he feels like it.
Um,
he,
he,

2521
02:34:27.310 --> 02:34:32.310
he has a greater propensity to change direction at speed than anyone else who

2522
02:34:34.111 --> 02:34:37.510
would have seen in my life.
People always talk about speed.
They're all,
you know,

2523
02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:40.060
this guy's font.
So that guy's spas to me,
the only kind of,

2524
02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:43.720
there's two kinds of speed.
They don't that impress me in fighting.

2525
02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:48.280
One is the speed of decision making.
Okay.
If you can make decisions,

2526
02:34:48.310 --> 02:34:51.010
good decisions faster than your opponent,
you gotta win a lot of fights.

2527
02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:56.700
And the other is your ability not to go in straight lines at speed,

2528
02:34:57.100 --> 02:34:58.660
but to change direction.

2529
02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:03.940
Speed of directional change is the most important kind of physical speed.

2530
02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:08.110
And fighting I'll get is plenty of people that weren't really that fast,

2531
02:35:08.410 --> 02:35:10.060
but they can change direction quickly.

2532
02:35:10.330 --> 02:35:12.790
And that's the kind of speed that counts and fighting.

2533
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:16.300
So the two kinds of speed that you needed to be to be a fighter with speed of

2534
02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:20.530
decision making and speed of directional change.

2535
02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:24.130
And you see lots of fast people are,
there's a Hussein bolt as fast,

2536
02:35:24.310 --> 02:35:26.920
but he's not fast and directional change.
It's not his thing.

2537
02:35:27.310 --> 02:35:30.820
But the thing that Yoel Romero is there's this certain twitchiness to his

2538
02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:34.000
movement where it's so hard to read where he's going,

2539
02:35:34.001 --> 02:35:36.010
where he's going to be in the next half second.
That's,

2540
02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:40.870
it's just a handful to deal with that.
That is a very good assessment of what,

2541
02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:45.590
what's shocking about him and his ability to go from zero to 60 insist freakish

2542
02:35:45.591 --> 02:35:47.710
shin.
This is him at 40.

2543
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:53.570
What was he like when he was 25 when this doesn't look like a 40 year old man.

2544
02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:57.250
Just everything is wrong.
Yeah.
It doesn't look like a normal person.

2545
02:35:57.540 --> 02:35:59.680
Like if you look at his body,
his proportions,

2546
02:35:59.681 --> 02:36:04.270
everything looks like something from a movie that doesn't there is,
yeah.

2547
02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:09.300
Yeah.
And that flying knee that he hit Chris with was like,
she,
she's Christ.
Yeah.

2548
02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:13.150
Now he could feel it.
And the audience,
it was,
uh,
it was,
uh,
it was terrible.

2549
02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:17.230
It's just the,
the amount of force that he can generate is just stunning.

2550
02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:21.430
But he's also a guy that's carrying around a tremendous amount of muscle.

2551
02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:25.030
And I wonder what kind of pace he can keep up.
You know?

2552
02:36:25.031 --> 02:36:28.270
And we saw that in the Whitaker fight,
you faded a bit and that fight,

2553
02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:30.970
one of losing that fight,
and we've seen it in several,

2554
02:36:30.971 --> 02:36:32.560
was fights a Tim Kennedy fight.

2555
02:36:32.561 --> 02:36:35.380
You faded in that fight and eventually came back to win.

2556
02:36:35.381 --> 02:36:38.920
But he's got so much to feed.

2557
02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:42.370
There's so much tissue,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
No,

2558
02:36:42.371 --> 02:36:45.370
he's a fascinating character and fascinating.
And again,

2559
02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.160
boy wouldn't you have loved to seen him in the UFC at 26 yeah,

2560
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:53.190
I mean when he was just dominating everyone of the wrestling scene and now he's

2561
02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:57.370
as Nice as good as I get in Raceland metaled into every single world class

2562
02:36:57.371 --> 02:37:00.130
competition he ever answered.
Not only that,

2563
02:37:00.131 --> 02:37:03.850
but the best wrestlers in his weight division of that time.

2564
02:37:03.851 --> 02:37:07.900
He beat all of them like
crazy.

2565
02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:12.760
It's as good as he did it.
The hard to imagine.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2566
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.010
All right John,
I think we've covered

2567
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.940
<v 3>basically enough or it's a,
we're three hours in here,
man.
Oh my God.</v>

2568
02:37:20.450 --> 02:37:23.720
Is Lawson is longer than one of my Instagram posts.

2569
02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:27.910
Your Instagram posts are amazing,
by the way.
I'm a huge fan.
You're,

2570
02:37:27.930 --> 02:37:29.930
you're one of the few bright,
not true.

2571
02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:32.140
I have a lot of friends share them and they,

2572
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:34.400
they didn't send them to me in text messages.

2573
02:37:34.401 --> 02:37:39.401
Occasionally you are breakdowns of technique and strategy and what is actually

2574
02:37:40.311 --> 02:37:44.240
happening.
I think they're critical.
I think your voice and what you're doing,

2575
02:37:44.241 --> 02:37:46.880
like with the squad and what you're doing for,

2576
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:50.810
for Jujitsu as a whole and the way you're able to articulate that and break

2577
02:37:50.811 --> 02:37:54.630
these things down,
it's,
it's,
it's really,
really critical.
I think it's awesome.

2578
02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:56.770
Thank you very [inaudible].
Thank you.

2579
02:37:57.050 --> 02:37:59.120
And I'm really glad we finally got a chance to do this.

2580
02:37:59.510 --> 02:38:02.650
It's better than a meeting at Denny's.
Yes.
Well,
Denny's for meeting.

2581
02:38:02.651 --> 02:38:06.020
It was fun too.
What is your Twitter for people?
Is it just John,

2582
02:38:06.021 --> 02:38:09.710
Donna her on Instagram rather?
You don't have a Twitter?
I believe it's Danaher.

2583
02:38:09.711 --> 02:38:12.770
John Danaher.
John.
Yeah.
Okay.
Beautiful.
Thank you brother.
Cute.
