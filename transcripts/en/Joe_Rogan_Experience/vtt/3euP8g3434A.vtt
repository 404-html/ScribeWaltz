<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

38
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a different approach to a Clintons.</v>

73
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Here's where I really got and here's where the weight gain really came on.</v>

74
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 3>Anyone that really that's been working with me knows this.</v>

75
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I owed her two meals.</v>

76
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 3>I order two meals cause I like to eat like a king.</v>

77
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm not paying for it,</v>

78
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 3>but so like you're not paying for it and that work's paying for it.</v>

79
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It's Oh,</v>

80
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.871
<v Speaker 3>creator.</v>

81
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 3>So you're assuming like all your meat,</v>

82
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 3>that's how much you work,</v>

83
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:36.991
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

84
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 3>You work so much.</v>

85
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Most of your meals are paid for.</v>

86
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had,</v>

87
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 3>I haven't paid for a meal in 11 months.</v>

88
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

89
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 3>I've been on the road straight for 11 fucking months.</v>

90
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

91
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Nobody I know travels as much as you other than Bordain maybe.</v>

92
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.404
<v Speaker 3>He's pretty close.</v>

93
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 3>He's travels a fucking Dick load and he goes to like all over the mirror.</v>

94
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

95
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 3>he goes a horrible places that are like really scary.</v>

96
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the reason he left the travel channel is that they wouldn't let</v>

97
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 3>them go to those places.</v>

98
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.963
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

99
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.361
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

100
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

101
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

102
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.653
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty certain.</v>

103
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

104
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause uh,</v>

106
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 3>cause CNN has a different set of insurance and travel channel's insurance</v>

107
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 3>doesn't cover like they're like dangerous skateboard shipping type shit.</v>

108
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't cover it pretty much your own insurance.</v>

109
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Almost his last episode,</v>

110
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.311
<v Speaker 3>he was in the Congo.</v>

111
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.061
<v Speaker 3>I haven't watched it yet,</v>

112
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 3>but I saw the Congo and I was way too hard to watch it.</v>

113
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.541
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

114
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.171
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

115
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:22.711
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

116
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 3>can't do it.</v>

117
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.593
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

118
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 3>I did a Montana episode with him a couple of weeks ago.</v>

119
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

120
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 3>we camped out too.</v>

121
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 3>We did the full Montana experience,</v>

122
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 3>went pheasant hunting and then we camped out.</v>

123
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Hung out by the fire,</v>

124
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.093
<v Speaker 3>got lit up.</v>

125
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.393
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>

126
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 3>So wait,</v>

127
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.010

128
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

129
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 3>We went hard.</v>

130
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 3>We weren't hard boozing.</v>

131
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 3>We'd everything.</v>

132
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 3>We went hard.</v>

133
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bordain to not fuck around.</v>

134
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really incredible?</v>

135
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 3>That guy's addicted to Jujitsu.</v>

136
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

137
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 3>90% of what he was talking about,</v>

138
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 3>he just wanted to talk</v>

139
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 4>about Jujitsu.</v>

140
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.380

<v Speaker 4>Now he's 59 and he just everyday trains.</v>

142
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 4>He trains when he's on the road,</v>

143
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 4>he goes to these places like Bozeman,</v>

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Super into it.</v>

152
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.603
<v Speaker 4>She's uh,</v>

153
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 4>she's constantly training.</v>

154
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 4>Like I think she trains like twice a day,</v>

155
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:28.924
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

156
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.823
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

157
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Now that's good for him.</v>

158
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:31.871
<v Speaker 4>And he looks,</v>

159
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.704
<v Speaker 4>he looks good.</v>

160
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.543
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't look like a,</v>

161
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't look like the way he should look.</v>

162
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the clearings.</v>

163
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 4>And you're in the mine.</v>

164
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

165
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 4>He looks a lot better than he looked just a few years ago.</v>

166
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Smoking cigarettes.</v>

167
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

168
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.231
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

169
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 4>He stopped when his daughter was born.</v>

170
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

171
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Except for the occasional one.</v>

172
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 4>He'll cheat.</v>

173
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

174
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

175
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.991
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

176
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think he does that anymore.</v>

177
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 4>And now that he's doing Jujitsu,</v>

178
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he does it.</v>

179
00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:50.771
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

180
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 4>what happens with the Jujitsu world with the lifestyle is you get those become</v>

181
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 4>your new friends.</v>

182
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Like those become like it and it becomes like a Jujitsu family and like they</v>

183
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 4>understand you more than other people understand you because they've choked you,</v>

184
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

185
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 4>and you've,</v>

186
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 4>you've gone to,</v>

187
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 4>to battle together an intimacy when someone chokes you out.</v>

188
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Like a bizarre,</v>

189
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 4>like I held you in my hand.</v>

190
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

191
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.581
<v Speaker 4>I could've let go.</v>

192
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 4>You and I decided to keep you.</v>

193
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

194
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.423
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

195
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely something there.</v>

196
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 4>And then it also like makes regular life seemed kind of boring,</v>

197
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

198
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 4>so they'd just get engulfed into that world and some people they wind up doing</v>

199
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 4>that to the point of that becomes their job.</v>

200
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 4>They ended up teaching it.</v>

201
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people have left lucrative careers because they decided they</v>

202
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 4>wanted to start teaching Jujitsu.</v>

203
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

204
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 4>And they just got into it a lot.</v>

205
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.371
<v Speaker 4>They were doing it,</v>

206
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 4>they started teaching private lessons and then they just downsized and started</v>

207
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.111
<v Speaker 4>doing Jujitsu.</v>

208
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:41.351
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

209
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 4>this is just so much more fun than being some guy trying to climb the corporate</v>

210
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:45.904
<v Speaker 4>ladder.</v>

211
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.751
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>

212
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:47.584
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

213
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 4>I know that they,</v>

214
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 4>like most martial arts,</v>

215
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 4>there's like a spiritual message.</v>

216
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Is there any like kind of spiritual guidelines through Jujitsu?</v>

217
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

218
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 4>there are in different schools,</v>

219
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:56.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

220
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 4>depending on who's teaching you and how they,</v>

221
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 4>how they approach it.</v>

222
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 4>But there's as overall in the art of Jujitsu,</v>

223
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 4>and I call it an art because it really is an art.</v>

224
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's it's techniques and it's,</v>

225
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 4>it's a martial art.</v>

226
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.413
<v Speaker 4>It's the most,</v>

227
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 4>most Marshall or the most art of martial arts in my opinion,</v>

228
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 4>and my opinion because it's the most open to creativity.</v>

229
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Like guys like Eddie Bravo is the best example of that because he's such a</v>

230
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:22.901
<v Speaker 4>creative guy.</v>

231
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 4>He's invented so many moves,</v>

232
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 4>so many transitions and pathways and named them and they're really unique.</v>

233
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 4>So if like your role with him,</v>

234
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 4>he literally don't know what he's doing.</v>

235
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 4>If you roll with the standard Jujitsu Guy,</v>

236
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 4>even if you're really good,</v>

237
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 4>like if there's like there's certain guys like a Hicks and Gracie for example,</v>

238
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 4>who does the basics,</v>

239
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 4>all of the basics of Jujitsu,</v>

240
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:49.141
<v Speaker 4>but does them to a level of mastery that you cannot comprehend until he trained</v>

241
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 4>with him and you,</v>

242
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 4>when you train with him,</v>

243
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:52.721
<v Speaker 4>you would just go,</v>

244
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 4>all that other stuff is nonsense.</v>

245
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 4>You just need straight Jujitsu,</v>

246
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

247
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 4>from the mothership,</v>

248
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 4>from Eylea Gracie and Carlos Gracie,</v>

249
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.071
<v Speaker 4>that's all you need.</v>

250
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Just razor sharp.</v>

251
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.044
<v Speaker 4>That shit.</v>

252
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.080
<v Speaker 4>Hodra Gracie is like that hens,</v>

253
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:05.901
<v Speaker 4>those like that.</v>

254
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.340
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

255
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.340
<v Speaker 4>they mostly just do the basics but to a level of mastery that's incomprehensible</v>

256
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 4>to the average person.</v>

257
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 4>But then there's a bunch of guys that are super creative.</v>

258
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Like Jeff Glover,</v>

259
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 4>the guy that we were talking about the other day,</v>

260
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.341
<v Speaker 4>he's one of them.</v>

261
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:19.911
<v Speaker 4>Bravo.</v>

262
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo is one of them,</v>

263
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:21.674
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

264
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 4>And there's a bunch of other guys out there too.</v>

265
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

266
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Cummins,</v>

267
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 4>who's a student of this guy.</v>

268
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

269
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Speaker 4>John Danaher who's probably the most creative of all the,</v>

270
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 4>the teachers or one of the most creative next to Eddie.</v>

271
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

272
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 4>and he's like got this crazy leg lock game that they're all learning so they're</v>

273
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 4>all learning this like super complicated leg lock came from this guy who was</v>

274
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 4>like a philosophy phd major.</v>

275
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.741
<v Speaker 4>That's what he was doing.</v>

276
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 4>He was like studying philosophy and working as a bouncer and he got into Jujitsu</v>

277
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 4>because he wanted to learn how to defend themselves cause all these fights would</v>

278
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 4>happen when people are drunk.</v>

279
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 4>And then he just became obsessed with Jujitsu and now he's like one of the most</v>

280
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 4>sought after Jiu Jitsu coaches in the world.</v>

281
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Like George Saint Pierre,</v>

282
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 4>you still use him and he teaches at Henzel Gracie academy in New York.</v>

283
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 4>So it's like there's like this real underground like it's,</v>

284
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 4>it's not what everybody thinks it is.</v>

285
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 4>People think of it as being like meatheads and like these like really muscled up</v>

286
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 4>do's with tattoos on their necks.</v>

287
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

288
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of those guys in there too,</v>

289
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 4>but what it really is,</v>

290
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.990
<v Speaker 4>is this crazy problem solving game that's going on that everybody's playing with</v>

291
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:27.074
<v Speaker 4>their body.</v>

292
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 5>It's going to sound like a really silly question,</v>

293
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 5>but if we give you,</v>

294
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

295
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 5>if say Eddie Bravo,</v>

296
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 5>say you picked a fight with Eddie Bravo and he was forced to kick your ass.</v>

297
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Would there be at some point when you woke up the next day that you'd remember</v>

298
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 5>something he did to you artistically and be like,</v>

299
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.121
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

300
00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:42.954
<v Speaker 4>I was beautiful.</v>

301
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

302
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.921
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

303
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:44.754
<v Speaker 4>we spar.</v>

304
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.600
<v Speaker 4>If we would spar,</v>

305
00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:46.950
<v Speaker 4>Eddie would do shit to me and I would go,</v>

306
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:47.101
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

307
00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:47.550
<v Speaker 4>What'd you do?</v>

308
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.270
<v Speaker 4>How'd you set that up?</v>

309
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.103
<v Speaker 4>What did I do wrong?</v>

310
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 4>And like he's always teaching like he doesn't hide anything from students.</v>

311
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

312
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.500
<v Speaker 4>He's always trying to get them so that they tap him.</v>

313
00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Like he gets tapped by students,</v>

314
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.990
<v Speaker 4>but he considers it a good thing.</v>

315
00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:01.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like I taught this guy so well that he can get me there.</v>

316
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 4>That you need that if you don't have that,</v>

317
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.230
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

318
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.670
<v Speaker 4>don't you agree that as standup comedians we need to be around killers?</v>

319
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Like you need to be around Diaz.</v>

320
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.060
<v Speaker 4>He need to be around guys like Burt,</v>

321
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.680
<v Speaker 4>like when you're around all these killers,</v>

322
00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 4>it makes you up your game.</v>

323
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 5>I told you that the day after we were all at the comedy store,</v>

324
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

325
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.610
<v Speaker 5>and you had the joke about,</v>

326
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.503
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

327
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.463
<v Speaker 5>Bruce Jenner,</v>

328
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.560
<v Speaker 5>the gargoyle and I'm fucking howling in the back and I,</v>

329
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.370
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>

330
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I told you this part,</v>

331
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 5>but I will tell you right now,</v>

332
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.630
<v Speaker 5>and then I went up in between you,</v>

333
00:08:30.631 --> 00:08:31.464
<v Speaker 5>amber.</v>

334
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.860
<v Speaker 5>Amber went up after me and to seamlessly destroyed and then you went up into the</v>

335
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.050
<v Speaker 5>seamlessly destroyed after him and I got,</v>

336
00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:37.741
<v Speaker 5>I woke up the next morning.</v>

337
00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:38.311
<v Speaker 5>I totally Anna,</v>

338
00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 5>so I'm fucking bombed.</v>

339
00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:40.074
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

340
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like,</v>

341
00:08:41.341 --> 00:08:42.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm not writing the way these guys were writing.</v>

342
00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:43.051
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm,</v>

343
00:08:43.051 --> 00:08:43.884
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm,</v>

344
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm slow.</v>

345
00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

346
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 5>I feel clumsy on stage.</v>

347
00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:47.964
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>

348
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.630
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I should.</v>

349
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.900
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

350
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.740
<v Speaker 5>and then Leann was like,</v>

351
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:50.100
<v Speaker 5>hold on,</v>

352
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.430
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

353
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.780
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about Joe and bill,</v>

354
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 5>two of the best comedians in the world,</v>

355
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 5>so don't hold to that standard,</v>

356
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 3>but use that.</v>

357
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Use that inspiration by watching the bests to say to yourself,</v>

358
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.291
<v Speaker 3>well fuck,</v>

359
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.124
<v Speaker 3>I can be better.</v>

360
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 3>That's if that's what you're saying.</v>

361
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like that he always got to feel like you could be better.</v>

362
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:07.291
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

363
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean I always do I those low level cons who come out of a club and they're</v>

364
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.020
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

365
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.791
<v Speaker 3>well just look that room.</v>

366
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.451
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking fire.</v>

367
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:12.781
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

368
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what fight you saw but I saw you get kind of fucking up against the</v>

369
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 3>ropes like New York is was when I was there.</v>

370
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 3>It was filled with that.</v>

371
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Guys that walk out fucking destroyed that shit in the beginning.</v>

372
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that's like a defense mechanism that guys put on.</v>

373
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 3>If you talk to most comics,</v>

374
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 3>most comics are not happy with their act.</v>

375
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you think seriously good people that are good?</v>

376
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

377
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 3>It was always like these moments where you're like,</v>

378
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.641
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

379
00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I gotta fix this.</v>

380
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:38.490
<v Speaker 3>I've got to tighten that up.</v>

381
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 3>I got gotta.</v>

382
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It's the guys that are like super confident about my act.</v>

383
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.853
<v Speaker 3>Perfect right now.</v>

384
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Your ex dog shit,</v>

385
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.323
<v Speaker 3>you know that's like,</v>

386
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.623
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>

387
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a like a high level of scrutiny that you have to give yourself and give</v>

388
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing and you know,</v>

389
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 3>it does,</v>

390
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like this is a lot of bits that just don't ever work.</v>

391
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.030
<v Speaker 3>They just know you got to eventually get a thought,</v>

392
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 3>throw them in the garbage,</v>

393
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 3>they just don't like,</v>

394
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.891
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

395
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:02.371
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

396
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 3>There's something in here and you just hammer at it and trying to turn into a</v>

397
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.384
<v Speaker 3>sword.</v>

398
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.180
<v Speaker 3>But nope,</v>

399
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 3>it's just a ladle.</v>

400
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.181
<v Speaker 3>It's a ladle.</v>

401
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna stay a ladle.</v>

402
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 3>It just never works.</v>

403
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 3>It just stupid thing that you very rarely use and it's just like might've worked</v>

404
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 3>a couple of times on stage in certain places,</v>

405
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's just can't figure out the transition.</v>

406
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And then there's other bits that you like.</v>

407
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 3>You Pilfer you take chunks of them and you create other bits with them and it</v>

408
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 3>turns out that there are better mine than they are like an entity.</v>

409
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 3>They're better for like mining ideas.</v>

410
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 3>That's how that happens all the time.</v>

411
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 3>We have a bit and you're into the bit,</v>

412
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.160
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out the,</v>

413
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 3>the best part about it is like a side thing,</v>

414
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

415
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 3>like a little side path that you take while you're creating it.</v>

416
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

417
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I like it more than I've ever liked.</v>

418
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It fed up more than ever.</v>

419
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 3>It's so much fun man.</v>

420
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.111
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

421
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 3>especially like right now because uh,</v>

422
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.540
<v Speaker 3>is a year after my last special and I have like a full set now and now I'm just</v>

423
00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 3>trying to make it good and trying to add to it and cut away from it.</v>

424
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 3>But it's like I am working with,</v>

425
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:04.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

426
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 3>a full hour,</v>

427
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes of new stuff so it's all,</v>

428
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I pretty much have what I need to turn into like a weapon now.</v>

429
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to like hone it and sharpen it.</v>

430
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.620
<v Speaker 3>It's super exciting man.</v>

431
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's nerve racking and you know,</v>

432
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 3>and you're doing a lot of sets and you're fucking around in different places and</v>

433
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 3>it's just never been more excited about it.</v>

434
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.813
<v Speaker 3>So much fun.</v>

435
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.390

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.130
<v Speaker 3>not the opposite of you,</v>

438
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:29.964
<v Speaker 3>but like I get,</v>

439
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.290
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time.</v>

440
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

441
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I like the fucking of creativity.</v>

442
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Speaker 3>I like to fucking of impulse.</v>

443
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:36.864
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to,</v>

444
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to be in a relationship with creativity.</v>

445
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.391
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

446
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

447
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.523
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

448
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.191
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to meet,</v>

449
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 3>create,</v>

450
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I like the moment where you get an idea,</v>

451
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 3>you meet it at the bar and you fucking take it home and you fuck it up against a</v>

452
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 3>wall and then you walk out and you're like,</v>

453
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I'll never call that idea again.</v>

454
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.821
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

455
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:50.971
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

456
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 3>so you mean like in the moment,</v>

457
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 3>like on a show on improvisation?</v>

458
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you mean?</v>

459
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

460
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I love when you come up with an idea and I,</v>

461
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:57.791
<v Speaker 3>and I walk away.</v>

462
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:59.240
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>

463
00:11:59.241 --> 00:11:59.741
<v Speaker 3>Almost like,</v>

464
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I used to call,</v>

465
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 3>used to call it the angel share of like it wasn't a bit,</v>

466
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 3>it was just happened or you or,</v>

467
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 3>or what happens to me.</v>

468
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times I'll come up with a bit and I'll kind of Ha I'll fuck it one</v>

469
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

470
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I won't make a relationship out of it and then I'll just use it and I'd be like,</v>

471
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:13.691
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

472
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>

473
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:14.951
<v Speaker 3>I don't wanna fuck with that.</v>

474
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm bored like I want to do,</v>

475
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.790
<v Speaker 3>I want the new next thing I'm a,</v>

476
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a commitment phobe with material.</v>

477
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 3>Like I run a tear through material of so quickly that I just go like,</v>

478
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it's because it's not that good or maybe it's because I'm not focusing</v>

479
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:26.771
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>

480
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really have a lot of the passion of focus on it and literally toil</v>

481
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:31.654
<v Speaker 3>with a bit.</v>

482
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Like I get really kind of disconnected sometimes on stage,</v>

483
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:35.861
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

484
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 3>well I told him she's throwing out and I'm a second car.</v>

485
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.231
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

486
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I say when I was 22 years old,</v>

487
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I fucking feel a weight on my shoulders.</v>

488
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:42.011
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

489
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.341
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

490
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 3>this is 12 minutes.</v>

491
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this the other day.</v>

492
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Like you should just get that on a video,</v>

493
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 3>get that and put it on Netflix thing or something and then just release it so</v>

494
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do it anymore.</v>

495
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

496
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 3>I've were were negotiated in that.</v>

497
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 3>I would put would you,</v>

498
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:55.781
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

499
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 3>I brought up and if you do that man,</v>

500
00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 3>like then like maybe a year from now,</v>

501
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:00.501
<v Speaker 3>so going to last week,</v>

502
00:13:00.501 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 3>tell him and I'll be inspired.</v>

503
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 3>It'll still be fun.</v>

504
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.111
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

505
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:05.891
<v Speaker 3>you could tell a story.</v>

506
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Even a great story like that story,</v>

507
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 3>you can tell it too many times and just just call it goes away from you.</v>

508
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything and noises.</v>

509
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

510
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:13.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 3>like they would sell if you ever say fuck around your grandma,</v>

512
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like Whoa,</v>

513
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.270
<v Speaker 3>it sounds so harsh.</v>

514
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

515
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 3>like Oh my God,</v>

516
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

517
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Speaker 3>But if you say fuck to us,</v>

518
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 3>we say fuck around each other.</v>

519
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 3>So often it's just like the or end or,</v>

520
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:30.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's just normal cause no unusual registration of it,</v>

521
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.383
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

522
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the same thing with story.</v>

523
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:35.550
<v Speaker 3>If you tell a story so much that doesn't,</v>

524
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't register anymore.</v>

525
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Even though if you heard it for the first time,</v>

526
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:38.561
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

527
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:38.890
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

528
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Like the first time you told me that story,</v>

529
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

530
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.173
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

531
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck he doing?</v>

532
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

533
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

534
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.741
<v Speaker 3>it's filled with,</v>

535
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:45.574
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

536
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a chaos filled story.</v>

537
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 3>It's an awesome story.</v>

538
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.114
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

539
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.133
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

540
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

541
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 3>you fucking too many times.</v>

542
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

543
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 3>that's where I'm at right now.</v>

544
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Get bored.</v>

545
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

546
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a Chechen whore and a fucking 10 fucking miners are just running trains on</v>

547
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.220

548
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:00.551
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

550
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 3>they'll show me you have to change the oil.</v>

551
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.960
<v Speaker 3>There is a great moment though when you tell that story and I have no passionate</v>

552
00:14:09.961 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 3>about telling it but I tell it and then this,</v>

553
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 3>this like a couple that it just doesn't seem like they'd ever liked me.</v>

554
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Just come out there like that was fucking amazing.</v>

555
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

556
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:17.980
<v Speaker 3>you forget.</v>

557
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.813
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

558
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Thomas told me this.</v>

559
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

560
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea how many people don't know who you are.</v>

561
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Like concept of like you think everyone's heard the story.</v>

562
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's heard the story.</v>

563
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I would say at least,</v>

564
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 3>at least 80% of every room I sell out or I sell or I sell,</v>

<v Speaker 3>hasn't heard that story.</v>

568
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 3>At least live you will.</v>

569
00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 3>You've got to think about how many people there are to listen to nowadays too.</v>

570
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.131
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

571
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 3>like for them to know,</v>

572
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 3>even if they catch one of your podcasts,</v>

00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:50.410
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

576
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.450
<v Speaker 3>If they catch one of them,</v>

577
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.080
<v Speaker 3>it might not</v>

578

00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

726
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 5>And I remember the first thing I ever fucking saw was uh,</v>

727
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.210
<v Speaker 5>on Fletcher Avenue Ne,</v>

728
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.000
<v Speaker 5>this pizza shop is old news stand in.</v>

729
00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 5>My sister picked up a magazine that was bondage and showed it to me and was</v>

730
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

731
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 5>like fucking full blown bondage.</v>

732
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:28.801
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

733
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

734
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 5>I was like maybe first grade.</v>

735
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:30.541
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

736
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

737
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 5>When I went to this dominatrix in like 19,</v>

738
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 5>no 2001 is when I went and did an episode.</v>

739
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

740
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:39.983
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

741
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 5>she check out some of my stuff.</v>

742
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 5>We're just bullshitting mistress Isabella.</v>

743
00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Ari had her own as podcast too.</v>

744
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.641
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

745
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 5>you just turn it on someone and stuff and gave me a bunch of videos and I put in</v>

746
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 5>one and dude,</v>

747
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.531
<v Speaker 5>one thing,</v>

748
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 5>just like fucking like the rubber gloves up to the shoulders with the boost Da.</v>

749
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 5>And I was literally,</v>

750
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 5>it brought me back to that point and I had this fucking,</v>

751
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 5>it's like rediscovering like shit.</v>

752
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.463
<v Speaker 5>Like I was like,</v>

753
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 5>holy fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

755
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

756
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 6>so it imprinted in you during that formative age.</v>

757
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:09.700
<v Speaker 6>So you've had an actual experience with angel.</v>

758
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.051

<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna say six.</v>

762
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have probably first grade before first grade around first grade.</v>

763
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 5>When was it that you saw it again?</v>

764
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 5>28 years old.</v>

765
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.821
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So 22 years later or something like</v>

767
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.431
<v Speaker 5>22 years later.</v>

768
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:20.571
<v Speaker 5>And I'm,</v>

769
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:20.851
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

770
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 5>I'd never been tied up.</v>

771
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.820
<v Speaker 5>I never tied up a girl I'd never been in,</v>

772
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 5>but I'd never,</v>

773
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.770
<v Speaker 5>I'd never done any of that.</v>

774
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 5>She had never been leather or like,</v>

775
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 5>or like never been leather,</v>

776
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 5>like been leathered up or their depth.</v>

777
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:31.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

778
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:31.531
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

779
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:31.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

780
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.990
<v Speaker 5>like I never been any,</v>

781
00:19:32.991 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm like a meat and potatoes fucker.</v>

782
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 5>Like I go in,</v>

783
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 5>I have sex,</v>

784
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 5>maybe a couple of positions,</v>

785
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:38.874
<v Speaker 5>but that's it.</v>

786
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.163
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

787
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 5>and then I saw this and I was like,</v>

788
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 5>it fucking hit a switch.</v>

789
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:43.801
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

790
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

791
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.043
<v Speaker 5>But you liked it.</v>

792
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.681
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>

793
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:47.514
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was hot.</v>

794
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.830
<v Speaker 5>Like you've ever looked at like little Mrs. Yeah,</v>

795
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 5>she knows I had Mr Mistresses,</v>

796
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:53.844
<v Speaker 5>Isabel at my house.</v>

797
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 5>I wish my wife would get into that.</v>

798
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 5>Not Interested in the whole lesson.</v>

799
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:02.581
<v Speaker 5>Taste with kids,</v>

800
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 5>do not want to get tied up.</v>

801
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 5>That's just a fact.</v>

802
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 5>Fucking and not at all.</v>

803
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.223
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

804
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 6>They used to love that shit because now they're,</v>

805
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.271
<v Speaker 6>they're a mom.</v>

806
00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:14.530
<v Speaker 6>There's something that happens.</v>

807
00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:15.400
<v Speaker 6>It switches.</v>

808
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.650
<v Speaker 6>It's very hard to describe.</v>

809
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.670
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

810
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.140
<v Speaker 6>I think you know a little bit of it because you're a dad and when you become a</v>

811
00:20:23.141 --> 00:20:23.710
<v Speaker 6>dad,</v>

812
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 6>you switch from just being a guide with dad and it's,</v>

813
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:28.180
<v Speaker 6>it's a very real switch,</v>

814
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it's nearly as gigantic as the switch that goes off inside of</v>

815
00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:37.930
<v Speaker 6>a woman when she actually grows the baby in her body and then gives birth to it</v>

816
00:20:37.931 --> 00:20:40.570
<v Speaker 6>and then is insanely responsible for that baby.</v>

817
00:20:40.571 --> 00:20:43.400
<v Speaker 6>And they loved them to a level that like you,</v>

818
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.450
<v Speaker 6>you compare the way you love your kids to the way someone says,</v>

819
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:46.811
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

820
00:20:46.811 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 6>I love cat.</v>

821
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.861
<v Speaker 6>You like,</v>

822
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 6>you don't even know what the fuck love is.</v>

823
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 6>You think a cat is like,</v>

824
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 6>I can love a cat openly and pure porch.</v>

825
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>

826
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.303
<v Speaker 6>Shut up.</v>

827
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.143
<v Speaker 6>Shut up.</v>

828
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 6>If you had a kid it would be different.</v>

829
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

830
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:00.510
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

831
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 6>there's an intense,</v>

832
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 6>and I don't even necessarily say that this is like a moral choice that you make</v>

833
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:06.664
<v Speaker 6>that it's different.</v>

834
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.820
<v Speaker 6>I think there's some insane biological switches that go off that are undeniable.</v>

835
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.461
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

836
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:17.461
<v Speaker 6>there's this connection between oxytocin and kids and that you look at the kids</v>

837
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:18.641
<v Speaker 6>and you,</v>

838
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 6>your brain produces oxytocin,</v>

839
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 6>which is just love feeling.</v>

840
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 6>There's like all sorts of weird shit that goes on.</v>

841
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 6>I think that for a woman and not all women,</v>

842
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 6>because there's women that have that do porn,</v>

843
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.750
<v Speaker 6>that have babies,</v>

844
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 6>they have families and they have,</v>

845
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

846
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.121
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

847
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:39.121
<v Speaker 6>they've given birth and then they go and just get gang bang by giant dicks and</v>

848
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 6>they love it.</v>

849
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 6>They love it.</v>

850
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 6>You think they love it?</v>

851
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

852
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 6>They say they love it.</v>

853
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Speaker 6>I have no reason to believe they're lying and I don't want to ruin it.</v>

854
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.863
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

855
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 6>They say they love it.</v>

856
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.380
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a lot of different people in the world,</v>

857
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:53.561
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

858
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 6>Think about a guy like you and some,</v>

859
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.740
<v Speaker 6>some guy who's like really into accounting.</v>

860
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.730
<v Speaker 6>You know there's gotta be someone out there that enjoy is doing people's books.</v>

861
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.360
<v Speaker 6>There's gotta be some noise and try it.</v>

862
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 6>There's gotta be someone out there that does that.</v>

863
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 6>That's a real person.</v>

864
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 6>So if this is a real person,</v>

865
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:14.431
<v Speaker 6>I think of course he's a real person wants to pay for Sierra Lynch's shit or you</v>

866
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:14.861
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

867
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:19.450
<v Speaker 6>some real person who can do stand up comedy like so people are fucking weird.</v>

868

<v Speaker 5>I'd appreciate if you didn't use that kind of language lambs.</v>

1013
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.110
<v Speaker 5>Like wait hold on.</v>

1014
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about cause like there's things where we said when kids like you</v>

1015
00:26:36.291 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 5>call people ninnies well I think that what's [inaudible] and then he is a,</v>

1016
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a derivative of picking any,</v>

1017
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 5>which is a derivative of a young black kid</v>

1018
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.053
<v Speaker 3>from islands.</v>

1019
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:45.571
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1020
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 3>but we got called ninnies all growing up and I still send any,</v>

1021
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that one.</v>

1022
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 3>And so Leanne was like calm pig a minute and they're like cotton picking minute.</v>

1023
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:54.770
<v Speaker 3>It has to do something with black people and Lance like,</v>

1024
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.711
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1025
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 3>lance was saying that her whole life and never,</v>

1026
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 3>and she and my wife's a redneck,</v>

1027
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 3>but it never heard that phrase.</v>

1028
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.720
<v Speaker 3>And like her new,</v>

1029
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:05.760
<v Speaker 3>the definition just knew that was a phrase.</v>

1030
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 3>So we looked it up.</v>

1031
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 3>It turns out a cotton picking minute has nothing to do with race.</v>

1032
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with the fact that cotton is the most tedious crop to pick in the</v>

1033
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:14.191
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1034
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 3>So if you picked cotton for one minute,</v>

1035
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 3>it would feel like a year.</v>

1036
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>

1037
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.541
<v Speaker 3>When you say,</v>

1038
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:18.751
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1039
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 3>what cotton picking minute.</v>

1040
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 3>It says wait a little longer than a minute.</v>

1041
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.201
<v Speaker 3>Wait one,</v>

1042
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Speaker 3>wait a long fucking minute.</v>

1043
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:24.781
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1044
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 3>but the menu I,</v>

1045
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 3>everyone's so quick to be up and fucking outraged.</v>

1046
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Well they just looking for an opportunity to be outreach.</v>

1047
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.010
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that she was actually upset at someone saying one cotton picking</v>

1048
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:35.360
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>

1049
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1051
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.953
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that.</v>

1052
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.183
<v Speaker 3>That's dumb.</v>

1053
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not just dumb.</v>

1054
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1055
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 3>it's a sign of the times we live in this time where there's a bunch of people</v>

1056
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:45.980
<v Speaker 3>out there that think they're doing good,</v>

1057
00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 3>that they're good people because the call people out and they shame people.</v>

1058
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1059
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.630
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1060
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.890
<v Speaker 3>it's so arbitrary.</v>

1061
00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 3>What you decide is negative and what other people,</v>

1062
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.340
<v Speaker 3>it's all about intent.</v>

1063
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1064
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.840
<v Speaker 3>And when you say one cotton picking minute or hold off,</v>

1065
00:27:59.841 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 3>fuck his thinking about racism.</v>

1066
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Who's thinking a racist thought?</v>

1067
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:04.464
<v Speaker 3>When you say that,</v>

1068
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 3>it's just a nice way saying one motherfucking minute is what it is.</v>

1069
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.780
<v Speaker 3>That check was the racist for even putting the two together with that kind of,</v>

1072
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 3>she's just a dummy.</v>

1073
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them out there.</v>

1074
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of politically correct dummies.</v>

1075
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Like here's,</v>

1076
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 3>here's one that's super common that everybody wants to use.</v>

1077
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.070
<v Speaker 3>You know the term faggot is a terrible term to use for gay folk ea.</v>

1078
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.413
<v Speaker 3>It's okay though.</v>

1079
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.921
<v Speaker 3>This terrible term,</v>

1080
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1081
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to say that that has,</v>

1082
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.180
<v Speaker 3>that has backfired because that word is now age,</v>

1083
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:34.050
<v Speaker 3>like a fine wine.</v>

1084
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:34.621
<v Speaker 3>So beautiful.</v>

1085
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 3>We were throwing around way too much as kids and now you only hear it all</v>

1086
00:28:37.471 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 3>special occasions and so you're just saying that caught me so fucking old guard.</v>

1087
00:28:41.671 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1088
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:42.571
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

1089
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:43.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm in hindsight,</v>

1090
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 3>the machine story and I'm making a comeback,</v>

1091
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but two to call someone that for being gay is a terrible thing to do,</v>

1092
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1093
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.230
<v Speaker 3>It is a slur.</v>

1094
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible thing to do.</v>

1095
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.490
<v Speaker 3>But to call someone that for being just a pussy is what we always did as kids.</v>

1096
00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.251
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1097
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 3>we can't do that anymore because it's so problematic.</v>

1098
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 3>It's too connected with that other word.</v>

1099
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that drives me crazy is when they,</v>

1100
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1101
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 3>what does the ed to Ma Entomology,</v>

1102
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:09.631
<v Speaker 3>what's the word?</v>

1103
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Etymology.</v>

1104
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:10.831
<v Speaker 3>Etymology.</v>

1105
00:29:10.831 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1106
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.651
<v Speaker 3>When the,</v>

1107
00:29:11.651 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1108
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 3>the history of the origins of the word,</v>

1109
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:19.430
<v Speaker 3>they always like to say that it's about a bundle of wood because these to light</v>

1110
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 3>gay people on fire,</v>

1111
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.770
<v Speaker 3>that was on Louis show,</v>

1112
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.810
<v Speaker 3>he repeated this false myth.</v>

1113
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 3>That's not what it meant.</v>

1114
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 3>A bundle of wood meant you were,</v>

1115
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 3>when they called you,</v>

1116
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:31.861
<v Speaker 3>it was all,</v>

1117
00:29:31.861 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 3>it was like a burden.</v>

1118
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Some woman,</v>

1119
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 3>that's the way they described it,</v>

1120
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.130
<v Speaker 3>like a bundle of woods,</v>

1121
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 3>like something you got to carry.</v>

1122
00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:41.130
<v Speaker 3>That was a really awkward and a pain the ass.</v>

1123
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 3>So that</v>

1124
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 4>was a faggot of wood.</v>

1125
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 4>So when you were acting like of like a pain in the ass woman,</v>

1126
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 4>like you would be a Faggot,</v>

1127
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 4>you'd be a bundle of wood.</v>

1128
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 4>That's such a pain to carry around.</v>

1129
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 4>You'd be awkward and annoying.</v>

1130
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the origins of the word.</v>

1131
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 4>So how did it get connected to gay people?</v>

1132
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 4>It sounds great that it was because these to light people on fire.</v>

1133
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.181
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1134
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:05.014
<v Speaker 4>you're a victim.</v>

1135
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.003
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1136
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:06.461
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

1137
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 4>So don't use that word again.</v>

1138
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 4>So full people tied and sure people have definitely died from being gay,</v>

1139
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.040
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the origins of that word.</v>

1140
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 4>That's not like the used to be angry.</v>

1141
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the whole world was lightened gay people on fire one point like it</v>

1142
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 4>was a sport so much that it became a name.</v>

1143
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 4>You connected them,</v>

1144
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:24.610
<v Speaker 4>which is called gay people.</v>

1145
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Kerosene.</v>

1146
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.201
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1147
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>

1148
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 4>That's not what it was.</v>

1149
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.950
<v Speaker 4>It was a bundle of wood was also like a burden.</v>

1150
00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 4>Some woman,</v>

1151
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 4>that's the way they used to describe it.</v>

1152
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:34.931
<v Speaker 4>You can like,</v>

1153
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 4>you can look up the origins of the word.</v>

1154
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.680
<v Speaker 4>That makes me feel so much more sense for using it as kids.</v>

1155
00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:39.860
<v Speaker 4>When you called your friend a bundle,</v>

1156
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 4>a burdensome burdens and woman.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:42.910
<v Speaker 4>He called him taking forever.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You faggot.</v>

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:44.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:30:44.841 --> 00:30:45.970

00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:46.520
<v Speaker 4>faggot.</v>

1164
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>

1165
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 4>that's has nothing to do with homosexuality.</v>

1166
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1167
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:56.130
<v Speaker 4>the homosexuality aspect of it was calling someone that if they're gay as a slur</v>

1168
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.160
<v Speaker 4>because if you think of like the stereotypical gay man like that gets mocked,</v>

1169
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1170
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1171

1172
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 4>which would be like a burdensome woman,</v>

1173
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.850
<v Speaker 4>so that's why they would call those gay guys that slur.</v>

1174
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit Man.</v>

1175
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.231
<v Speaker 4>West Hollywood.</v>

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 4>If you want to use it for the original word that we can start dropping that in</v>

1181
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 4>any grouping out,</v>

1182
00:31:25.241 --> 00:31:26.790
<v Speaker 4>things will take a of carrots.</v>

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 4>It became a cigarette.</v>

1184
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:29.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm not butchering that.</v>

1191
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.851
<v Speaker 4>Like in England,</v>

1195
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like their word for that.</v>

1196
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.481
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1197
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 4>Like fanny for them is a vagina.</v>

1200
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a fanny pack,</v>

1201
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I wear a fanny pack.</v>

1202
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 4>They mock me hardcore.</v>

1203
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1204
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.030
<v Speaker 4>you have a vagina pack.</v>

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying.</v>

1206
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 4>You have a vagina pack.</v>

1207
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.531
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing that they say,</v>

1208
00:32:02.531 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 4>do you know what you're saying?</v>

1209
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:04.811
<v Speaker 4>They clearly,</v>

1211
00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 4>any pack.</v>

1212
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.191
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1214
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:06.401
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1215
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:06.611
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1216
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 4>It's bumbag has,</v>

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 4>so they call him over there.</v>

1218
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 4>They call them bum bags.</v>

1219
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:16.950
<v Speaker 4>But what is the real problem with all this stuff is these forbidden words,</v>

1220
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.771
<v Speaker 4>taboo words.</v>

1221

1222
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.343
<v Speaker 4>It's intent.</v>

1223
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.130
<v Speaker 4>And if you go around policing the world and stopping words from being used,</v>

1224
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 4>you don't change the People's intent.</v>

1225
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.030
<v Speaker 4>You don't do anything but be annoying.</v>

1226
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.043
<v Speaker 4>That's all you're doing.</v>

1227
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.610
<v Speaker 4>You're being an annoying person.</v>

1228
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:33.070

1246
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.550

<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1273
00:33:34.441 --> 00:33:35.430
<v Speaker 5>I read a book on shame,</v>

1274
00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:36.270
<v Speaker 5>on public shaming,</v>

1275
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.990
<v Speaker 5>and there's all these examples and there's just one guy whose dad was a famous</v>

1276
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.490
<v Speaker 5>Nazi,</v>

1277
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.880
<v Speaker 5>like a Nazi sympathizer.</v>

1278
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.240
<v Speaker 5>And then he got caught in these s and m things where it looked like he was a</v>

1279
00:33:45.241 --> 00:33:47.340
<v Speaker 5>Nazi and it was like the people,</v>

1281
00:33:48.211 --> 00:33:49.230
<v Speaker 5>And it said in the book,</v>

1282
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.110
<v Speaker 5>the only way to get through public shaming is to not give a fuck about the</v>

1283
00:33:52.111 --> 00:33:52.800
<v Speaker 5>shaming.</v>

1284

<v Speaker 5>Like if you're,</v>

1285

1286
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.240

1288
00:33:54.601 --> 00:33:54.961
<v Speaker 5>shame me,</v>

1289
00:33:54.961 --> 00:33:56.040
<v Speaker 5>cause I don't give a fuck</v>

1290
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 4>funny with this Charlie Sheen story,</v>

1291
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.290
<v Speaker 4>because that's how Charlie Sheen got through everything up until now,</v>

1292
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.680

1293
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.431

<v Speaker 4>I'll give you money.</v>

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.700
<v Speaker 4>So we did some dude's Dick allegedly video.</v>

1302
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.410
<v Speaker 4>You're getting everything.</v>

1303
00:34:20.411 --> 00:34:20.801
<v Speaker 4>Third,</v>

1304
00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:21.611
<v Speaker 4>fourth hand.</v>

1305
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:23.170
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows what really happened?</v>

1306
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.180
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly?</v>

1307
00:34:25.181 --> 00:34:26.140
<v Speaker 4>There's a video.</v>

1308
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.003
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1309
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:27.671
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1310
00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:28.504
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it.</v>

1311
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 4>But the point being,</v>

1312
00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:33.580
<v Speaker 4>he said he always owned up to everything he did up until this,</v>

1313
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.710
<v Speaker 4>everything he did up until this was like,</v>

1314
00:34:35.711 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 4>who gives a fuck all?</v>

1315
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Well that's me.</v>

1316
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Tiger blood winning,</v>

1317
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:41.163
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1318
00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:42.243
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote.</v>

1319
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.233
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1320
00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:44.470
<v Speaker 4>now you know,</v>

1321
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean he went on Matt Lauer's that what it was and said that he had HIV,</v>

1322
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.811
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>

1323
00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:51.520
<v Speaker 4>HIV is a weird one dude,</v>

1324
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.000
<v Speaker 4>because medication that they have today is so effective.</v>

1325
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Speaker 4>You take HIV medication and it doesn't even show up in your blood.</v>

1326
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.150
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather have that than Hep c.</v>

1327
00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:01.751
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1328
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:02.620
<v Speaker 4>there's so many dish.</v>

1329
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.630
<v Speaker 4>It's got this stigma attached to it.</v>

1330
00:35:04.631 --> 00:35:05.230
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1331
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.180
<v Speaker 4>But there's so many diseases that kill people that are quicker than that.</v>

1332
00:35:09.181 --> 00:35:11.350
<v Speaker 4>Like women die from HPV,</v>

1333
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.300
<v Speaker 4>which is like super common,</v>

1334
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.070
<v Speaker 4>but we want to pop Loma virus.</v>

1335
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:15.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:17.050
<v Speaker 4>Women get cancer from that.</v>

1337
00:35:17.051 --> 00:35:19.480
<v Speaker 4>They can get cancer from that and they can die from that.</v>

1338
00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:24.690
<v Speaker 4>That's way more common than a guy with HIV in the western world who finds out</v>

1339
00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:26.171
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

1340
00:35:26.171 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 4>gets diagnosed and started taking medication way more common for a woman to die</v>

1341
00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:35.551
<v Speaker 4>from that than it is for the guy to die from the HIV in 2015 2015 is an amazing</v>

1342
00:35:36.461 --> 00:35:37.590
<v Speaker 4>time to have HIV.</v>

1343
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.911
<v Speaker 4>You want to go get it?</v>

1344
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 4>Go get it.</v>

1345
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Go get it.</v>

1346
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.411
<v Speaker 4>You want it.</v>

1347
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:41.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like they've,</v>

1348
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 4>they don't have it licked.</v>

1349
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 4>And the point where they work,</v>

1350
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 4>where they have an injection that they can give you the cures it,</v>

1351
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 4>but they do have medication that make it undetectable.</v>

1352
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.350
<v Speaker 4>The him not telling the girls though.</v>

1353
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's a,</v>

1354
00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:53.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1355
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty fucked up,</v>

1356
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1357
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.680
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1358
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 4>that's prison time.</v>

1359
00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1360
00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely not nice.</v>

1361
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.813
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

1362
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like,</v>

1363
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1364
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 4>I had to do the triangle,</v>

1365
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:05.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1366
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:05.731
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

1367
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:08.730
<v Speaker 4>Did I sleep with somebody that slept with somebody that might have slept with</v>

1368
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.031
<v Speaker 4>him?</v>

1369
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:09.271
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1370
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 4>I it,</v>

1371
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can get it that way.</v>

1372
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.560
<v Speaker 4>There's very little evidence that a man can get it through normal heterosexual</v>

1373
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 4>intercourse,</v>

1374
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 4>herpes outbreak and or period.</v>

1375
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.711
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1376
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:21.460
<v Speaker 4>I've been saying this for fucking years.</v>

1377
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not politically correct to say,</v>

1378
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 4>but there's very little evidence.</v>

1379
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.763
<v Speaker 4>Here's the deal.</v>

1380
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.551
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>

1381
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 4>if it was easy to get.</v>

1382
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's impossible to get because I'm obviously not a doctor and an</v>

1383
00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:32.064
<v Speaker 4>idiot,</v>

1384
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 4>but I think if it was,</v>

1385
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 4>if it was possible or easy to get Jesus Christ,</v>

1386
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:37.890
<v Speaker 4>everybody would have it.</v>

1387
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy would it?</v>

1388
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.001
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1389
00:36:39.001 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 4>that's what everybody was worried about in the 1990s when,</v>

1390
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 4>when AIDS started the it's rampant rage through the,</v>

1391
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 4>the public eye.</v>

1392
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was scared that everybody was going to have it.</v>

1393
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.660
<v Speaker 4>I had my first AIDS test and 92 it was an HIV test,</v>

1394
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

1395
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1396
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I was getting a insurance and I had to get it an aids test.</v>

1397
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.571
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1398
00:36:56.571 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

1399
00:36:57.421 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking terrified.</v>

1400
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Terrified,</v>

1401
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 4>terrified.</v>

1402
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 4>And when it came back clean,</v>

1403
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:03.421
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1404
00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:04.254
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1405
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 4>because you don't know.</v>

1406
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.770
<v Speaker 4>I think all the time she got drunk and didn't use a condom.</v>

1407
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 4>And who knows what that girl had and who knows what.</v>

1408
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 4>It's just like there's no,</v>

1409
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:11.821
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1410
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1411
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.440
<v Speaker 4>if it really was something that normal heterosexual men got through normal</v>

1412
00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:17.274
<v Speaker 4>intercourse.</v>

1413
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 4>The way it's been described to me by medical professionals,</v>

1414
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.250
<v Speaker 4>obviously not by knuckleheads on the Internet was it,</v>

1415
00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:28.251
<v Speaker 4>it's just really difficult to get that because a man is injecting his dick</v>

1416
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:30.570
<v Speaker 4>inside of a girl and coming and a girl,</v>

1417
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 4>a woman's vagina on the other hand is an excellent candidate for reception</v>

1418
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.900
<v Speaker 4>because it's moist in there.</v>

1419
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially open tissue.</v>

1420
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1421
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:40.941
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1422
00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:41.774
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1423
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1424
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.810
<v Speaker 4>that's why like some girls take drugs that way.</v>

1425
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 4>That's why people take drugs ain't only too,</v>

1426
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 4>while you take like an anal suppository,</v>

1427
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 4>like dudes to take ecstasy Annaly that take an ecstasy pill and stuff it up</v>

1428
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 4>their ass and it'll melt down,</v>

1429
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 4>break down and get into their bloodstream.</v>

1430
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.910
<v Speaker 4>People to a herpes,</v>

1432
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 4>a little drunk tea and tea drinking chill.</v>

1433
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 4>You can kill you cause it goes through right into your blood.</v>

1434
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:05.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1435
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:06.870
<v Speaker 4>That's real dangerous man.</v>

1436
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Because it's not going through your stomach.</v>

1437
00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.430
<v Speaker 4>You can get fucked up from putting like alcohol,</v>

1438
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:12.001
<v Speaker 4>like vodka,</v>

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:14.660
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1441
00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.191
<v Speaker 4>And Vodka,</v>

1442
00:38:15.191 --> 00:38:16.024
<v Speaker 4>tampons,</v>

1443
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.351
<v Speaker 4>girls,</v>

1444
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 4>soap,</v>

1446
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.320
<v Speaker 4>but they have fresh,</v>

1447
00:38:22.321 --> 00:38:23.154
<v Speaker 4>minty breath.</v>

1448
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.220
<v Speaker 4>There's breath is perfect.</v>

1449
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 4>Go back to this,</v>

1450
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.100
<v Speaker 4>go back to this age thing.</v>

1451
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I had some people one night and I was drunk.</v>

1452
00:38:29.041 --> 00:38:31.890
<v Speaker 4>I was in Atlanta by some people from the CDC at my show.</v>

1453
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.440
<v Speaker 4>And they were saying exactly what you're saying to me.</v>

1454
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Because said something about,</v>

1456
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:37.441
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1457
00:38:37.441 --> 00:38:38.141
<v Speaker 5>I forget the Gee,</v>

1458
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:38.351
<v Speaker 5>I may,</v>

1459
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I made a joke.</v>

1460
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 5>And they came out and they like set me straight.</v>

1461
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:40.871
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1462
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1463
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.250
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

1464
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.083
<v Speaker 5>oh my first,</v>

1465
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1466
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.231
<v Speaker 5>this is nominal.</v>

1467
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:45.041
<v Speaker 5>It's not worth telling.</v>

1468
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:45.874
<v Speaker 5>But one of the,</v>

1469
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 5>I got an aids test at 95.</v>

1470
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.453
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1471
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.120
<v Speaker 5>one of the first jokes I ever wrote ever before I was a comedian.</v>

1472
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 5>And I remember waiting the results and saying,</v>

1473
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.173
<v Speaker 5>think positive.</v>

1474
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.311
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1475
00:38:55.311 --> 00:38:55.440
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1476
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.273
<v Speaker 5>think negative,</v>

1477
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:56.711
<v Speaker 5>negative,</v>

1478
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:58.770
<v Speaker 5>nothing positive or negative like I was.</v>

1479
00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1480
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:00.580
<v Speaker 5>am I was waiting in the waiting room.</v>

1481
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:01.250
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>

1482
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.083
<v Speaker 5>that's funny.</v>

1483
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Like you want a positive result,</v>

1484
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:04.601
<v Speaker 5>but you would have negative,</v>

1485
00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 5>positive result.</v>

1486
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 5>And I was joking with my head,</v>

1487
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.481
<v Speaker 5>I said that.</v>

1488
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 5>Then they came out and they said,</v>

1489
00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:08.621
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1490
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 5>you exactly what you just said.</v>

1491
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1492
00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.770
<v Speaker 6>It's very hard to get apparently,</v>

1493
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.633
<v Speaker 6>and this is just,</v>

1494
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.140
<v Speaker 6>this seems to be a consensus.</v>

1495
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.290
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't say something like this to try to encourage people to not use</v>

1496
00:39:18.291 --> 00:39:19.124
<v Speaker 6>condoms,</v>

1497
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.520
<v Speaker 6>but it just seems like through now gay sacks and the other hand,</v>

1498
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.810
<v Speaker 6>if you were having gay,</v>

1499
00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:24.531
<v Speaker 6>anal sex,</v>

1500
00:39:24.531 --> 00:39:27.740
<v Speaker 6>the same thing you're dealing with like open tissue.</v>

1501
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.660
<v Speaker 6>It's not skin.</v>

1502
00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.860
<v Speaker 6>It's not the same.</v>

1503
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.371
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1504
00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:32.690
<v Speaker 6>it's not the same as the skin on the out.</v>

1505
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.860
<v Speaker 6>If you come on someone's back,</v>

1506
00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:35.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure they're not going to get aids,</v>

1507
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.010
<v Speaker 6>but if you come in there butthole</v>

1508
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.710
<v Speaker 6>and you've got the hip,</v>

1509
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.600
<v Speaker 6>weird things can happen.</v>

1510
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.111
<v Speaker 6>It's getting,</v>

1511
00:39:42.111 --> 00:39:42.830
<v Speaker 6>it's getting bad.</v>

1512
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.110
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a lot of scary diseases out there,</v>

1513
00:39:45.111 --> 00:39:45.710
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1514
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.191
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1515
00:39:46.191 --> 00:39:46.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1516
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.120
<v Speaker 6>we were super lucky that we live in live in this amazing time as far as like</v>

1517
00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:52.220
<v Speaker 6>modern medicine and what they could figure out.</v>

1518
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.063
<v Speaker 6>Not figure out,</v>

1519
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.160
<v Speaker 6>but it's always going to be weirdest when diseases come through sex because like</v>

1520
00:39:58.161 --> 00:40:02.990
<v Speaker 6>Ebola is scary as fuck and malaria is the scariest of all time.</v>

1521
00:40:02.991 --> 00:40:04.700
<v Speaker 6>Malaria has killed ready for this.</v>

1522
00:40:04.701 --> 00:40:09.200
<v Speaker 6>There's a fact malaria has killed half of the people that have ever died,</v>

1523
00:40:09.201 --> 00:40:10.034
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

1524
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.120
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

1525
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.780
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

1526
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.550
<v Speaker 6>Half the people that have ever died on the planet earth ever were killed by</v>

1527
00:40:16.551 --> 00:40:17.384
<v Speaker 6>malaria</v>

1528
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.620
<v Speaker 6>at of all the reasons why people died.</v>

1529
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.060
<v Speaker 6>Car Accidents,</v>

1530
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.680
<v Speaker 6>plane crashes,</v>

1531
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:25.913
<v Speaker 6>AIDS,</v>

1532
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 6>cancer,</v>

1533
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.340
<v Speaker 6>malaria,</v>

1534
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.780
<v Speaker 6>killed half of the people that have ever died ever.</v>

1535
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1536
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 5>how's that possible?</v>

1537
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1538
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.200
<v Speaker 6>because malaria is a mother fucker.</v>

1539
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 6>Malaria kills millions of people that we just don't hear about it.</v>

1540
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Cause we don't get malaria in California.</v>

1541
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 6>We don't get malaria in America.</v>

1542
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 6>But if you're in Africa,</v>

1543
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 6>you are fucking terrified of malaria.</v>

1544
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.263
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

1545
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:50.871
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1546
00:40:50.871 --> 00:40:51.681
<v Speaker 5>This is not a fact.</v>

1547
00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:52.580
<v Speaker 5>That I'm sure is right.</v>

1548
00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:57.581
<v Speaker 5>But black people with sickle cell anemia develop the sickle cell gene to defend</v>

1549
00:40:58.401 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 5>against malaria.</v>

1550
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.013
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

1551
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.470
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1552
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.370
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard that before.</v>

1553
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1554
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.291
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

1555
00:41:03.291 --> 00:41:05.960
<v Speaker 5>because someone helped me find some type in sickle cell malaria.</v>

1556
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1557
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:07.970
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting of true.</v>

1558
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 5>It's something to do with the sickle cell gene is what is what protects black</v>

1559
00:41:13.371 --> 00:41:14.810
<v Speaker 5>people in Africa for malaria.</v>

1560
00:41:14.811 --> 00:41:16.400
<v Speaker 5>Because the body tried to define it.</v>

1561
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.500
<v Speaker 5>I only know this because when we were traveling to Africa,</v>

1562
00:41:18.501 --> 00:41:20.300
<v Speaker 5>we had to take malaria pills and they fucked me up.</v>

1563
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.163
<v Speaker 5>They really fucked.</v>

1564
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.060
<v Speaker 5>I heard they Cribble you.</v>

1565
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh my dreams were like insane.</v>

1566
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.480
<v Speaker 5>I've heard people saying that they would rather get malaria then deal with the</v>

1567
00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:32.350
<v Speaker 5>malaria medication cause they get malaria.</v>

1568
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Then they'd just get antibiotics and get it taken</v>

1569
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.580
<v Speaker 4>care of.</v>

1570
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 4>Mystery solved how sickle cell hemoglobin protects against malaria.</v>

1571
00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1572
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.221
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1573
00:41:39.221 --> 00:41:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Well I learned that in Africa from a black dude.</v>

1574
00:41:40.741 --> 00:41:40.921
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1575
00:41:40.921 --> 00:41:41.251
<v Speaker 5>when I go,</v>

1576
00:41:41.251 --> 00:41:42.720
<v Speaker 5>how come you're not taking him learn medicine?</v>

1577
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.261
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

1578
00:41:43.261 --> 00:41:43.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm black.</v>

1579
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.530
<v Speaker 4>A new article is likely to help solve one of the longstanding mysteries of</v>

1580
00:41:47.531 --> 00:41:51.370
<v Speaker 4>biomedicine in a study that challenges currently held views.</v>

1581
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:56.371
<v Speaker 4>Researchers unraveled the molecular mechanism whereby sickle cell hemoglobin</v>

1582
00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.390
<v Speaker 4>confers.</v>

1583
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.021
<v Speaker 4>That's what says,</v>

1584
00:41:59.021 --> 00:42:02.740
<v Speaker 4>confers a survival advantage against malaria.</v>

1585
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.540
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1586
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.463
<v Speaker 4>That's racist.</v>

1587
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy that died from sickle cell,</v>

1588
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1589
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.890
<v Speaker 4>guys to train with back Boston.</v>

1590
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.820
<v Speaker 4>My friend Walter.</v>

1591
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.360
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1592
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:13.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1593
00:42:13.571 --> 00:42:14.800
<v Speaker 4>He was like really talented,</v>

1594
00:42:14.801 --> 00:42:17.200
<v Speaker 4>a taekwondo fighter and he would uh,</v>

1595
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.770
<v Speaker 4>come in and train like really hard for a short period of time and then he would</v>

1596
00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:22.450
<v Speaker 4>get sick and uh,</v>

1597
00:42:22.451 --> 00:42:24.310
<v Speaker 4>he was always one of those guys that everybody was like,</v>

1598
00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:25.001
<v Speaker 4>where's Walter?</v>

1599
00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:25.181
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1600
00:42:25.181 --> 00:42:25.370
<v Speaker 4>where's,</v>

1601
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.100
<v Speaker 4>he was like super talented,</v>

1602
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:27.993
<v Speaker 4>really good,</v>

1603
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.920
<v Speaker 4>but he would get sick and he just couldn't compete and then he would get better</v>

1604
00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:34.450
<v Speaker 4>and he would just look like a world beater.</v>

1605
00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:36.160
<v Speaker 4>He was like really fucking good,</v>

1606
00:42:36.161 --> 00:42:37.030
<v Speaker 4>really talented,</v>

1607
00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:37.864
<v Speaker 4>really smart.</v>

1608
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Just knew,</v>

1609
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.740
<v Speaker 4>knew how to fight and then just kept getting sickle cell.</v>

1610
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Just kept getting worse and getting better.</v>

1611
00:42:43.781 --> 00:42:44.614
<v Speaker 4>And this is like</v>

1612
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.230
<v Speaker 4>early eighties,</v>

1613
00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.760
<v Speaker 4>84</v>

1614
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.500
<v Speaker 5>or that's when it was taken out.</v>

1615
00:42:49.501 --> 00:42:50.400
<v Speaker 5>Brothers left and right.</v>

1616
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:51.630
<v Speaker 5>Maybe even earlier than that.</v>

1617
00:42:51.631 --> 00:42:52.590
<v Speaker 5>It might have been 82.</v>

1618
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.750
<v Speaker 5>Who Do we sell them and Leroy's Selman played for the bucks,</v>

1619
00:42:54.751 --> 00:42:55.251
<v Speaker 5>do we sell them?</v>

1620
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:57.660
<v Speaker 5>Was a defensive back and Dewey Seldman had sickle cell anemia.</v>

1621
00:42:57.661 --> 00:42:58.710
<v Speaker 5>That was first time I ever heard of it.</v>

1622
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.410
<v Speaker 5>But I remember telling my dad,</v>

1623
00:43:01.411 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 5>I think I have sickle cell anemia because I'd heard this too.</v>

1624
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.390
<v Speaker 5>My Dad was like he black.</v>

1625
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

1626
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.350
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing that it came from malaria.</v>

1627
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:11.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1628
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.540
<v Speaker 4>well it makes it makes sense.</v>

1629
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

1630
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.780
<v Speaker 4>your body or the human body is going to try to figure out some way to get over</v>

1631
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:19.614
<v Speaker 4>this hump.</v>

1632
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.870
<v Speaker 4>This is the most deadly disease I think ever.</v>

1633
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.520
<v Speaker 4>If I had a gas,</v>

1634
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:27.120
<v Speaker 4>I would say malaria is probably the most deadly disease ever.</v>

1635
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:28.440
<v Speaker 4>But everybody's scared of it.</v>

1636
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:28.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1637
00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.161
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>

1638
00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:31.470
<v Speaker 5>rabies is pretty fucking bad cause I got,</v>

1639
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.150
<v Speaker 5>I got bit by a bat and Costa Rica very bad.</v>

1640
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:34.651
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>

1641
00:43:34.651 --> 00:43:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1642
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.060
<v Speaker 5>I thought I had,</v>

1643
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:36.600
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1644
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.640
<v Speaker 5>I was like I got bit by a bat and you get the rabies shot.</v>

1645
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.361
<v Speaker 5>And they were all,</v>

1646
00:43:39.361 --> 00:43:42.450
<v Speaker 5>you know Costa Cause I pulled Avida man a pure life.</v>

1647
00:43:42.451 --> 00:43:43.970
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry now you fine.</v>

1648
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.940
<v Speaker 5>We don't have rabies down here.</v>

1649
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.833
<v Speaker 5>Thought he'd be fine.</v>

1650
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.490
<v Speaker 5>And then I go back and I come back to,</v>

1651
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1652
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.090
<v Speaker 5>get my shots to go again.</v>

1653
00:43:49.091 --> 00:43:50.070
<v Speaker 5>And they said you want a rabies shot?</v>

1654
00:43:50.071 --> 00:43:50.700
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1655
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.000
<v Speaker 5>I've been bit by about once and the lady freaked and like laid it on me.</v>

1656
00:43:54.001 --> 00:43:54.834
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

1657
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.171
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>

1658
00:43:55.171 --> 00:43:55.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1659
00:43:55.381 --> 00:43:57.990
<v Speaker 5>there's no recovery from rabies.</v>

1660
00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.880
<v Speaker 5>Like if you do in fact have rabies,</v>

1661
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.230
<v Speaker 5>you'll die from rabies.</v>

1662
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.511
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1663
00:44:01.511 --> 00:44:02.190
<v Speaker 5>And that's not true.</v>

1664
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.120
<v Speaker 5>100% no,</v>

1665
00:44:03.121 --> 00:44:03.954
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1666
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:05.100
<v Speaker 5>nope.</v>

1667
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.170
<v Speaker 5>Not One person has ever knocked,</v>

1668
00:44:07.171 --> 00:44:09.090
<v Speaker 5>gotten bit by rabies,</v>

1669
00:44:09.091 --> 00:44:10.440
<v Speaker 5>gotten the shots in two days.</v>

1670
00:44:10.441 --> 00:44:15.060
<v Speaker 5>You got to him and within two days and ever lived ever fucking lip.</v>

1671
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:15.460
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1672
00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.140
<v Speaker 4>so everybody who gets rabies,</v>

1673
00:44:17.141 --> 00:44:18.850
<v Speaker 4>even if you get the shots inside of two days,</v>

1674
00:44:18.851 --> 00:44:19.590
<v Speaker 4>you still die.</v>

1675
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.261
<v Speaker 4>If you get the shit,</v>

1676
00:44:20.261 --> 00:44:23.200
<v Speaker 4>you have to get the shots within two days and then you live and then you live.</v>

1677
00:44:23.201 --> 00:44:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1678
00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.060
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't get those shots,</v>

1679
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:25.811
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1680
00:44:25.811 --> 00:44:26.501
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

1681
00:44:26.501 --> 00:44:28.000
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't get the shots,</v>

1682
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:29.710
<v Speaker 4>you're dead a hundred percent</v>

1683
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 5>five months later you're sitting in a bed,</v>

1684
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:32.634
<v Speaker 5>you start feeling sick.</v>

1685
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.530
<v Speaker 5>When he's a scary man,</v>

1686
00:44:35.531 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 5>it starts with a sore back.</v>

1687
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 5>How many fucking times I lay in a hotel bed going,</v>

1688
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:39.860
<v Speaker 5>God damn it.</v>

1689
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.550
<v Speaker 5>Or rabies kicking in these fucking scared me.</v>

1691
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm worse than you have.</v>

1692
00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:49.810
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1693
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 5>you never heard about when I thought I got genital warts,</v>

1694
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 5>what happened?</v>

1695
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:53.873
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Magnifying glass and no,</v>

1698
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 5>look at the little individual cells.</v>

1699
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.610
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1700
00:44:59.610 --> 00:44:59.791
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1701
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:00.624
<v Speaker 5>it looks weird.</v>

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:01.681
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1703
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:05.220
<v Speaker 5>but I did sit with my balls and Dick's and a bowl of vinegar watching quantum</v>

1704
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 5>leap drink a 40 vinegar because vinegar,</v>

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.310
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1709
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.800
<v Speaker 5>No vinegar will tell you if you have genital warts,</v>

1710
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.180
<v Speaker 5>so that's hilarious.</v>

1711
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.430
<v Speaker 5>Let's tell you it.</v>

1712
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.310
<v Speaker 5>The march we just slept,</v>

1713
00:45:18.311 --> 00:45:18.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1714
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 5>it'll whisper to you.</v>

1715
00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:21.651
<v Speaker 5>You look down,</v>

1716
00:45:21.651 --> 00:45:22.760
<v Speaker 5>it's an exclamation point.</v>

1717
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.300
<v Speaker 5>Never had one of those times where you looked at your dick a bunch like you like</v>

1718
00:45:26.301 --> 00:45:29.000
<v Speaker 5>have sex one night and then the next day you like kind of giving you a dick a</v>

1719
00:45:29.001 --> 00:45:29.781
<v Speaker 5>once over and you're like,</v>

1720
00:45:29.781 --> 00:45:29.931
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:30.764
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that?</v>

1722
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.700
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of amazing how rarely guys do give their dick a once over.</v>

1735
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.460
<v Speaker 5>You got to start off with a one night stand and I was working at Barnes and</v>

1736
00:45:57.461 --> 00:46:00.580

<v Speaker 5>I start looking at those web journals,</v>

1745

1784
00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.390
<v Speaker 5>Every conversation you start starts with like,</v>

1785
00:47:11.391 --> 00:47:11.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1786
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:12.230

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.081

00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:15.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.833
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1795
00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:20.853
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1796
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:23.380
<v Speaker 5>I went to a dermatologist in Tampa.</v>

1797
00:47:23.381 --> 00:47:24.910
<v Speaker 5>I like spiraled out my mom like said,</v>

<v Speaker 5>something's going wrong with you.</v>

1801
00:47:27.341 --> 00:47:29.350
<v Speaker 5>I flew home and I like,</v>

1802
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 3>you had to fly home to deal with this and it wasn't even general warts was it?</v>

1803
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Even by the way,</v>

1804
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 3>in your Dick and vinegar,</v>

1805
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:38.190
<v Speaker 3>you got to get on a plane.</v>

1806
00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.530
<v Speaker 3>All Jesus Christ use hydrogen peroxide.</v>

1807
00:47:41.531 --> 00:47:42.031
<v Speaker 3>It's way better than,</v>

1808
00:47:42.031 --> 00:47:42.864
<v Speaker 3>than vinegar.</v>

1809
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1810
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1811
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:44.950
<v Speaker 3>why are you using vinegar?</v>

1812
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:45.611
<v Speaker 3>You're just kind of starting,</v>

1813
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:46.011
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1814
00:47:46.011 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Did we didn't have the Internet back then.</v>

1815
00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:50.470
<v Speaker 3>We have the Internet back then marinate your Dick.</v>

1816
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:51.723
<v Speaker 3>Just don't,</v>

1817
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.351
<v Speaker 3>just don't,</v>

1818
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 3>don't try any home remedies.</v>

1819
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Did you even bother googling it?</v>

1820
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:56.921
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1821
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Google wasn't around.</v>

1822
00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:58.391
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1823
00:47:58.391 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1824
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 3>This was like,</v>

1825
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 3>this is right when I moved to New York by 1997.</v>

1826
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:02.111
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1827
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to get an encyclopedia and you know how hard those were standup to</v>

1828
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:06.590
<v Speaker 3>thumb through the fucking do.</v>

1829
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Does anyone remember the Dewey decimal system?</v>

1830
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Like that fucking was so complicated to me.</v>

1831
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Like I never learned it and I never had to.</v>

1832
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you like do they even cover that kind of stuff?</v>

1833
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Like if you got an encyclopedia or a medical encyclopedia,</v>

1834
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 3>would they talk about Dick Wards and home remedies like pickling your Dick and</v>

1835
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:25.054
<v Speaker 3>vinegar,</v>

1836
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 3>where would you get that data?</v>

1837
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Figlin Dick and vinegar.</v>

1838
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I probably did get from the Internet.</v>

1839
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.160
<v Speaker 3>The Internet was around.</v>

1840
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't like what it is today.</v>

1841
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:35.110
<v Speaker 3>There was those books as homeroom Mindy books like medical books though my mom</v>

1842
00:48:35.111 --> 00:48:35.651
<v Speaker 3>used to have like,</v>

1843
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:38.810
<v Speaker 3>like a kind of a book that like if you have a fever and you don't have Tylenol</v>

1844
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 3>tried to this,</v>

1845
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 3>you know words to that though.</v>

1846
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like sure they had something they had to in rewards back then.</v>

1847
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they talked about it though,</v>

1848
00:48:45.101 --> 00:48:49.510
<v Speaker 3>because there's a certain innocence to that time where they just lay like to</v>

1849
00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 3>sweep stuff under the rug and not talk about it for the longest time.</v>

1850
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.183
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

1851
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:54.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1852
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how much of that was discussed.</v>

1853
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.040
<v Speaker 3>It probably called something different back then too.</v>

1854
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Like Indian mounds or something.</v>

1855
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.193
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1856
00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1857
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's right,</v>

1858
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you what,</v>

1859
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.710
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a lot of information back then and it was just what you'd get was</v>

1860
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 3>like literally what you'd get on the Internet now if your battery was dying.</v>

1861
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the kind of internet information you get.</v>

1862
00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 3>That's why aids was so scary because nobody made you.</v>

1863
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:23.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1864
00:49:23.201 --> 00:49:23.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1865
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:26.680
<v Speaker 3>you would have to like wait til a news report came out.</v>

1866
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1867
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.040
<v Speaker 3>To find out like how you could get it,</v>

1868
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.841
<v Speaker 3>how you couldn't get it.</v>

1869
00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:30.970
<v Speaker 3>And when's the vaccine coming?</v>

1870
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 3>2020 was how people found out about aids.</v>

1871
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1872
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:34.090
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1873
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 3>stop and think about that.</v>

1874
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Unless you read some Newsweek article,</v>

1875
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.770
<v Speaker 3>like you had to read some,</v>

1876
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 3>some article and then it was up to the person writing the article.</v>

1877
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Like they had a tremendous responsibility to get the facts right,</v>

1878
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.020
<v Speaker 3>which they don't always do.</v>

1879
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:47.861
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1880
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 3>and then the facts change,</v>

1881
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.040
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to science and medicine,</v>

1882
00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:51.731
<v Speaker 3>like the facts,</v>

1883
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:52.564
<v Speaker 3>they change,</v>

1884
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1885
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 3>they find out new discoveries.</v>

1886
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 3>They have to back date things,</v>

1887
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>they have to change things you have to fit.</v>

1888
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh well now there's a great,</v>

1889
00:49:59.160 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1890
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.290
<v Speaker 3>believe it was radio lab.</v>

1891
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 3>There was a great,</v>

1892
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:08.850
<v Speaker 3>yes it was radio lab on patient zero and it was all on the origins of aids,</v>

1893
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:09.491
<v Speaker 3>how it happened.</v>

1894
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:13.060
<v Speaker 3>And they think it happened from a hunter in Africa.</v>

1895
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.240
<v Speaker 3>They think that it was a combination of two different diseases that different</v>

1896
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:18.881
<v Speaker 3>monkeys,</v>

1897
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:19.510
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1898
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:22.060
<v Speaker 3>and they probably got it from eating each other.</v>

1899
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.960
<v Speaker 3>And that a hunter who killed a monkey and was cutting the meat up must have cut</v>

1900
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 6>his hand and gotten that monkey blood in his,</v>

1901
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 6>in his body.</v>

1902
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 6>So the virus got into him and that was the origins of HIV.</v>

1903
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.301
<v Speaker 6>He was gay.</v>

1904
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 6>Fucking fascinating.</v>

1905
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 6>I had nothing to do with get well,</v>

1906
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.060
<v Speaker 6>I mean if he was okay,</v>

1907
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 6>well but that might have had sex with a woman or it might.</v>

1908
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:50.480
<v Speaker 6>It's just by virtue of the way men have sex,</v>

1909
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.710
<v Speaker 6>gay men have sex.</v>

1910
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 6>It made it easier for them to spread it.</v>

1911
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.713
<v Speaker 6>That's available.</v>

1912
00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1913
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.843
<v Speaker 6>more susceptible.</v>

1914
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:56.870
<v Speaker 6>And then on top of it,</v>

1915
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 6>there's the gay community loves to party,</v>

1916
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:01.521
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1917
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:05.060
<v Speaker 6>and that's like a big thing that that Peter Duesberg guy that we had on that was</v>

1918
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 6>super controversial men.</v>

1919
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 6>I never had more people get mad at me.</v>

1920
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 6>Then you and Brian.</v>

1921
00:51:10.221 --> 00:51:10.760
<v Speaker 6>Carolyn,</v>

1922
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

1923
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:11.710
<v Speaker 6>And that guy,</v>

1924
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.110
<v Speaker 6>I heard that who was a professor of biology at the University of California</v>

1925
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:20.111
<v Speaker 6>Berkeley and he has this insanely controversial viewpoint on aids and 90 but</v>

1926
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:21.041
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>

1927
00:51:21.041 --> 00:51:26.041
<v Speaker 6>I'm just say this before I repeat what he believes that 99% of the people that</v>

1928
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:28.910
<v Speaker 6>are in his field disagree with him.</v>

1929
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:29.871
<v Speaker 6>This is a very,</v>

1930
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:31.520
<v Speaker 6>very small people,</v>

1931
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.890
<v Speaker 6>small percentage of people that might just be him.</v>

1932
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:34.911
<v Speaker 6>So this is,</v>

1933
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:35.744
<v Speaker 6>but this is his,</v>

1934
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 6>his friends belief.</v>

1935
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 6>He believes that HIV is actually weak virus.</v>

1936
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:45.730
<v Speaker 6>And he said that what it is a symptom of is a compromised immune system and that</v>

1937
00:51:46.131 --> 00:51:48.710
<v Speaker 6>your immune system is compromised from drugs.</v>

1938
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that he connected is the amount of people that die from</v>

1939
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:53.451
<v Speaker 6>aids,</v>

1940
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 6>complications that were heavy drug users in the gay community.</v>

1941
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 6>And it's overwhelming crazy numbers,</v>

1942
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:02.600
<v Speaker 6>crazy numbers because they're do ll night trade and poppers,</v>

1943
00:52:02.601 --> 00:52:05.930
<v Speaker 6>which are poppers and math and they just love to party because they don't have</v>

1944
00:52:05.931 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 6>kids and they but fucking woo seventh grade old time having a good time man.</v>

1945
00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.363
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1946
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.720
<v Speaker 6>so it was his contention that HIV was just a symptom that their immune system</v>

1947
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 6>was already fucked up and that if,</v>

1948
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 6>if we looked at it correctly instead of from a social point of view,</v>

1949
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.930
<v Speaker 6>everybody's looking at it as like a social stigma.</v>

1950
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 6>It's something that can't be questioned because it's such a blight on the gay</v>

1951
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:32.920
<v Speaker 6>community and we should all rally and help them and you,</v>

1952
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 6>you can't question what,</v>

1953
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 6>what's actually going on.</v>

1954
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 6>They obviously have a disease that's killing them off and we need research and</v>

1955
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:39.464
<v Speaker 6>funding and all this.</v>

1956
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 6>And he was saying when you get outside of that cloud of emotion that's attached</v>

1957
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:44.290
<v Speaker 6>to this and,</v>

1958
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.860
<v Speaker 6>and politically correct thinking.</v>

1959
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 6>And one common denominator you see with these people with a lot of them is heavy</v>

1960
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:51.734
<v Speaker 6>drug use.</v>

1961
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 6>So what he believed is that your immune system gets shattered from doing all the</v>

1962
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 6>drugs and then when they test you HIV shows up,</v>

1963
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 6>but they raised the HIV is there,</v>

1964
00:53:01.941 --> 00:53:03.140
<v Speaker 6>it's like if you are healthy,</v>

1965
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:04.700
<v Speaker 6>your body would battle the HIV.</v>

1966
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:08.060
<v Speaker 6>Now HIV researchers think he's out of his fucking mind,</v>

1967
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 6>but they are saying that there is ways to make it so the you HIV doesn't show up</v>

1968
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:12.840
<v Speaker 6>the people's body.</v>

1969
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.640
<v Speaker 6>Exactly,</v>

1970
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.150
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

1971
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1972
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.310
<v Speaker 6>that's more recently,</v>

1973
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.480
<v Speaker 6>that's within the last,</v>

1974
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 6>I believe the last decade or so.</v>

1975
00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 6>I think those things are called protease inhibitors.</v>

1976
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's one of the ways that they,</v>

1977
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1978
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 6>have figured out how to,</v>

1979
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 6>I think they have even better stuff now.</v>

1980
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1981
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the latest in HIV medication is,</v>

1982
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.860
<v Speaker 6>but if they have something that could uh,</v>

1983
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.920
<v Speaker 6>make it get to that point,</v>

1984
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.400
<v Speaker 6>you would kind of assume that that would like,</v>

1985
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:41.821
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

1986
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 6>I know a few people actually that have it,</v>

1987
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 6>that have HIV and they take the drugs and they are,</v>

1988
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.393
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1989
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 6>one of our friends works at the comedy store and they are uh,</v>

1990
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:53.770
<v Speaker 6>unperceptive and in December you don't,</v>

1991
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 6>what's the word?</v>

1992
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.730
<v Speaker 6>Presumable perceivable.</v>

1993
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

1994
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:56.851
<v Speaker 6>You can't,</v>

1995
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:58.080
<v Speaker 6>you can't test it when,</v>

1996
00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 6>when you test them they show up negative but he knows that he has it somehow or</v>

1997
00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:01.930
<v Speaker 6>another,</v>

1998
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:05.970
<v Speaker 6>it's like dormant in the system and if his immune system drops down and it gets</v>

1999
00:54:05.971 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 6>all fucked up but could be parties too hard or something like that and he</v>

2000
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 6>doesn't take his medication,</v>

2001
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 6>maybe it would come back and see that doesn't necessarily mean that Duesberg is</v>

2002
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:13.530
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2003
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2004
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.131
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2005
00:54:14.131 --> 00:54:14.431
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2006
00:54:14.431 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 6>it seems very complicated.</v>

2007
00:54:15.751 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 6>It seems like the doing the drugs doesn't help.</v>

2008
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.310
<v Speaker 6>That's what it seems like to me to say that the doing the drugs is the reason</v>

2009
00:54:23.311 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 6>that these people should get aids.</v>

2010
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.320
<v Speaker 6>And it's not the HIV and the drugs,</v>

2011
00:54:27.321 --> 00:54:29.280
<v Speaker 6>it was compromising their immune system.</v>

2012
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 6>That's not necessarily true because there's not a lot of people that are just</v>

2013
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:35.820
<v Speaker 6>getting HIV and then getting better on their own with no drugs,</v>

2014
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.110
<v Speaker 6>with no medication.</v>

2015
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:42.320
<v Speaker 6>So it could be that one thing we all know is it doing a lot of drugs is bad for</v>

2016
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:42.871
<v Speaker 6>your body.</v>

2017
00:54:42.871 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 6>So when they're doing crystal meth and Emile nitrate and they getting crazy and</v>

2018
00:54:46.591 --> 00:54:47.424
<v Speaker 6>not getting any sleep,</v>

2019
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:51.590
<v Speaker 6>that's terrible for your body and any disease that you have when your body's</v>

2020
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.360
<v Speaker 6>already wrecked is going to have a better grip on you.</v>

2021
00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 6>This just the fact,</v>

2022
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:55.790
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2023
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:57.120
<v Speaker 6>when we all know that that's the,</v>

2024
00:54:57.121 --> 00:54:59.010
<v Speaker 6>that's what the common cold with the flu,</v>

2025
00:54:59.011 --> 00:54:59.844
<v Speaker 6>with anything,</v>

2026
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 6>you have the flu and you get fucking hammered and start doing meth.</v>

2027
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.350
<v Speaker 6>You're gonna feel like shit,</v>

2028
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.011
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2029
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:06.330
<v Speaker 6>because your body's already wrecked.</v>

2030
00:55:06.331 --> 00:55:07.830
<v Speaker 6>Your immune system's already torched.</v>

2031
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:13.370
<v Speaker 6>So I don't necessarily think that his conclusions make a lot of sense to me.</v>

2032
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 6>A nonscientific nonmedical person,</v>

2033
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:17.723
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

2034
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.780
<v Speaker 6>I think he probably one of the reasons why all these people are angry at him</v>

2035
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:26.730
<v Speaker 6>cause he's jumped to some unscientific conclusions or some conclusions at least</v>

2036
00:55:26.731 --> 00:55:29.040
<v Speaker 6>that they don't think are scientific or,</v>

2037
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 6>or just politically incorrect,</v>

2038
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 6>but definitely politically incorrect and that's what a lot of us are</v>

2039
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:35.101
<v Speaker 6>researchers,</v>

2040
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:35.341
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2041
00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:36.570
<v Speaker 6>they've spent decades.</v>

2042
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.051
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2043
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:41.640
<v Speaker 6>the cynical point of view is that like people that are conspiracy theorists</v>

2044
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:42.390
<v Speaker 6>would say,</v>

2045
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2046
00:55:42.661 --> 00:55:43.170
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2047
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.440
<v Speaker 6>the money is in the treatment and the cure man.</v>

2048
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:47.101
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2049
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 6>what they want to do is I'm going to continue making money.</v>

2050
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.730
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to be extremely cynical to think that that's the case.</v>

2051
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:55.470
<v Speaker 6>Like they say that about cancer,</v>

2052
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:59.070
<v Speaker 6>but they kind of know how to stop cancer in a lot of ways.</v>

2053
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 6>They could prevent a significant amount of cancer if people just cleaned up</v>

2054
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:04.194
<v Speaker 6>their diet,</v>

2055
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.280
<v Speaker 6>cleaned up their diet,</v>

2056
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:06.930
<v Speaker 6>started eating healthy and exercising,</v>

2057
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.380
<v Speaker 6>that would,</v>

2058
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:08.820
<v Speaker 6>that would stop a lot of it.</v>

2059
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 6>A lot of it.</v>

2060
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:10.411
<v Speaker 6>What percentage,</v>

2061
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2062
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:14.220
<v Speaker 6>But if you cut sugar out of your diet and you started eating healthy and you</v>

2063
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 6>started exercising on a daily basis,</v>

2064
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.200
<v Speaker 6>how many people would be way healthier than they are now?</v>

2065
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.130
<v Speaker 6>Probably a lot.</v>

2066
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 6>And now there's definitely people that get cancer because of genetics.</v>

2067
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 6>There's that.</v>

2068
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.840
<v Speaker 6>It's not all of it is due to poor diet and stress,</v>

2069
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:30.860
<v Speaker 6>but that can help when your immune system's going bonkers and you,</v>

2070
00:56:30.861 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking tired and stressed out all the time.</v>

2071
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 6>That shit ain't good.</v>

2072
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 6>But it does,</v>

2073
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.171
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

2074
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 6>So that's all it's everyone's looking for a one or the other.</v>

2075
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 6>They are looking to point the finger at like one source and I think it's a</v>

2076
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:44.110
<v Speaker 6>combination of a bunch of different things that makes your rack</v>

2077
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:44.711
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>

2078
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:46.420
<v Speaker 5>I always thought the CIA created aids.</v>

2079
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.490
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear that presidential thing that came out this week?</v>

2080
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 5>Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev?</v>

2081
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:55.891
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2082
00:56:55.891 --> 00:56:56.050
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2083
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 5>Like them talking about HIV and aids are in the know or late.</v>

2084
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.010
<v Speaker 5>They pretty much,</v>

2085
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 5>they were just making fun of it and like people were like,</v>

2086
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 5>where's the prison going to mouth a mouth kiss?</v>

2087
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:04.470
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2088
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 5>and they weren't taking it serious at all.</v>

2089
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:07.170
<v Speaker 5>And like the,</v>

2090
00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:08.200
<v Speaker 5>the press was like,</v>

2091
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 5>are you guys not taking aid serious or HIV series?</v>

2092
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:13.810
<v Speaker 5>And they just continued to joke about it,</v>

2093
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:15.700
<v Speaker 5>like Reagan's administration and stuff like that.</v>

2094
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 5>Audio about it.</v>

2095
00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.530
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that woman who was a publicist who made that joke on Twitter</v>

2096
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.833
<v Speaker 5>line?</v>

2097
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.430
<v Speaker 5>That's a book I read is uh,</v>

2098
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.630
<v Speaker 5>so you've been publicly shamed?</v>

2099
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2100
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:26.351
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2101
00:57:26.351 --> 00:57:26.750
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2102
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2103
00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 5>John Ronson Justine's Soco was,</v>

2104
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean it fucking destroyed her life.</v>

2105
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not even,</v>

2106
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>

2107
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm this far out of it.</v>

2108
00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:36.461
<v Speaker 5>The stuff,</v>

2109
00:57:36.461 --> 00:57:40.060
<v Speaker 5>I read the book like where she works now and I've heard stories about her now I</v>

2110
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 5>won't even share cause I don't like public shaming.</v>

2111
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it works.</v>

2112
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think it's,</v>

2113
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:45.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's benefit to anyone.</v>

2114
00:57:45.611 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 5>I think it makes just makes the people that shame good.</v>

2115
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.960
<v Speaker 5>Wait a cotton picking minute.</v>

2116
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:52.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't like what you're saying.</v>

2117
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.053
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

2118
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:55.691
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2119
00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2120
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.813
<v Speaker 5>I don't like it either.</v>

2121
00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2122
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:58.180
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2123
00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.410
<v Speaker 5>it's what we were saying earlier,</v>

2124
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.330
<v Speaker 5>it's this,</v>

2125
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.460
<v Speaker 5>it's these people that are just looking to be outrage.</v>

2126
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 5>That's a big part of it.</v>

2127
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 5>And there's some things that you probably should shame people for.</v>

2128
00:58:06.071 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Like Bill Cosby,</v>

2129
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 5>like if you want to go around and drugging and weight raping women,</v>

2130
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:10.661
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2131
00:58:10.661 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 5>you should be shamed for that.</v>

2132
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:12.341
<v Speaker 5>But you really,</v>

2133
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:15.460
<v Speaker 5>you should be prosecuted if you're not prosecuted than definitely shamed.</v>

2134
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.280
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

2135
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2136
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 5>but like get prosecuted me.</v>

2137
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:20.440
<v Speaker 5>Let them go to fucking jail and I don't really care to shame him.</v>

2138
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Just send him away.</v>

2139
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.170
<v Speaker 5>He's definitely experiencing hell,</v>

2140
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2141
00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Whether whether they lock him in a cage or not,</v>

2142
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck of that.</v>

2143
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:28.690
<v Speaker 5>Guys living in the lap of luxury,</v>

2144
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 5>he's experiencing hell because he's gone from being a guy,</v>

2145
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.230
<v Speaker 6>been loved his entire career.</v>

2150
00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.770
<v Speaker 6>he's one of the great,</v>

2151
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:38.990
<v Speaker 6>if you had a mount Rushmore of standup comedy,</v>

2152
00:58:38.991 --> 00:58:40.670
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to put bill Cosby's head on there.</v>

2153
00:58:40.671 --> 00:58:41.390
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to,</v>

2154
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.571
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2155
00:58:41.571 --> 00:58:43.160

2156
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:44.420
<v Speaker 5>he's impervious to shame.</v>

2157
00:58:44.421 --> 00:58:44.780
<v Speaker 5>I bet.</v>

2158
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.160
<v Speaker 5>I bet it's like a great white shark.</v>

2159
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.940
<v Speaker 5>He was so fucking condescending to everyone he spoke to.</v>

2160
00:58:49.941 --> 00:58:53.030
<v Speaker 5>I heard the theory ever fucking met someone with like,</v>

2161
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:53.721
<v Speaker 5>Hey man,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Nice to meet ya soul like just staring down like DC Ben.</v>

2164
00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:58.641
<v Speaker 5>He's got a story of that.</v>

2165
00:58:58.641 --> 00:59:00.590
<v Speaker 5>Just the way he treated him in DC was like,</v>

2166
00:59:00.591 --> 00:59:01.520
<v Speaker 5>what a fucking Dick.</v>

2167
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:02.360
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

2168
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.021
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2169
00:59:03.021 --> 00:59:03.771
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking,</v>

2170
00:59:03.771 --> 00:59:05.780
<v Speaker 5>it was probably 12 years ago that I heard the story.</v>

2171
00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:06.930
<v Speaker 5>So for me to repeat it,</v>

2172
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.480
<v Speaker 5>start making up stuff.</v>

2173
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:13.540
<v Speaker 5>DC walks into his trailer and bill Cosby's raping this woman in DC.</v>

2174
00:59:13.911 --> 00:59:14.661
<v Speaker 5>He's like a,</v>

2175
00:59:14.661 --> 00:59:17.030
<v Speaker 5>I do a great impression of you and started doing it and go,</v>

2176
00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.290
<v Speaker 5>cause he was right when the woman,</v>

2177
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.550
<v Speaker 5>the girl starts waking up,</v>

2178
00:59:19.551 --> 00:59:20.750
<v Speaker 5>she hears bill Cosby.</v>

2179
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 5>Bill like not cool man.</v>

2180
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't use my voice with them.</v>

2181
00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2182
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:24.351
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2183
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:25.250
<v Speaker 5>that's what DC told me.</v>

2184
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 5>Did he have like a luchador mask on it?</v>

2185
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:29.331
<v Speaker 5>That's what I heard.</v>

2186
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2187
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 5>I think when I'm Mexican wrestling masks,</v>

2188
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:32.773
<v Speaker 5>that's what I heard.</v>

2189
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 5>I think so old school bill Cosby.</v>

2190
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:36.463
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2191
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 5>But what were you gonna say about Justine Sacco?</v>

2192
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2193
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 5>well that's a perfect story.</v>

2194
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 5>When we talk about someone like cracking a joke about aids,</v>

2195
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.020
<v Speaker 5>you know she mateze picked fairly recently.</v>

2196
00:59:48.021 --> 00:59:49.310
<v Speaker 5>She was talking about going to Africa.</v>

2197
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:49.971
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

2198
00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 5>I think the exact quote was,</v>

2199
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to Africa hope that I get don't get aids.</v>

2200
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:55.221
<v Speaker 5>Lol.</v>

2201
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:55.731
<v Speaker 5>Just kidding.</v>

2202
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:56.564
<v Speaker 5>I'm white.</v>

2203
00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2204
00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.970
<v Speaker 5>She says she's just,</v>

2205
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 5>and she tried to say,</v>

2206
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:05.570
<v Speaker 5>I think that it was like that.</v>

2207
01:00:05.571 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 5>She was pointing out the disparity of how white people did it.</v>

2208
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 5>She just did a poor job at please bitch cracking a joke.</v>

2209
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Cause she,</v>

2210
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 5>she was in that first generation of funny girl.</v>

2211
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.021
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2212
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:15.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm to,</v>

2213
01:00:15.241 --> 01:00:17.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say girls only because they ran the internet at this time.</v>

2214
01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 5>They were Twitter.</v>

2215
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 5>Was she black too?</v>

2216
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2217
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:19.821
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2218
01:00:19.821 --> 01:00:24.821
<v Speaker 5>But there was a bunch of girls that women that overtook and showed people how</v>

2219
01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 5>funny women were on the Internet through Jenny Johnson high five.</v>

2220
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 5>Jenny Molan,</v>

2221
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.961
<v Speaker 5>Jay Johnson,</v>

2222
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:30.411
<v Speaker 5>high fives.</v>

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Fucking really.</v>

2225
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 5>She says some really funny shit.</v>

2226
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:33.921
<v Speaker 5>Slash.</v>

2227
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:34.281
<v Speaker 5>Lien.</v>

2228
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Our friends slash thing from Toronto,</v>

2229
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.633
<v Speaker 5>Oxford.</v>

2230
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 5>They're all funny and it's women.</v>

2231
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 5>And she was in that first generation of those women who would post outrageous</v>

2232
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:42.060
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2233
01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.440
<v Speaker 5>Jenny Kenny Kelly Oxford's posted what time?</v>

2234
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.480
<v Speaker 5>And I fucking lost it.</v>

2235
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I lost it laughing and she deleted it cause she was afraid of it,</v>

2236
01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:54.851
<v Speaker 5>I think was that a women who like meant women who wear pads love to smell their</v>

2237
01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 5>menstruation.</v>

2238
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:56.960
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2239
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 5>And I loved that.</v>

2240
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 5>I just thought it was my wife's like,</v>

2241
01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:01.100
<v Speaker 5>my wife would never wear a pad like in her life.</v>

2242
01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:02.810
<v Speaker 5>I remember someone offered a packs.</v>

2243
01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:03.321
<v Speaker 5>He had a period.</v>

2244
01:01:03.321 --> 01:01:03.531
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2245
01:01:03.531 --> 01:01:04.310
<v Speaker 5>what pad?</v>

2246
01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.930
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather put a sock in my fucking pants.</v>

2247
01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:06.890
<v Speaker 5>What are you fucking kidding me?</v>

2248
01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 5>Hadn't people hate Tampon people?</v>

2249
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:09.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.110
<v Speaker 5>Looks like a war going on.</v>

2251
01:01:11.111 --> 01:01:12.140
<v Speaker 5>You see in Mac,</v>

2252
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 5>the first PC and Mac first generation.</v>

2253
01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:17.324
<v Speaker 5>But that fight.</v>

2254
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:18.220
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

2255
01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.750
<v Speaker 5>but I think Justine sacco was in that group of women.</v>

2256
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>

2257
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.093
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

2258
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:23.620
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know she was always Ligo.</v>

2259
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

2260
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 5>not like friends with them,</v>

2261
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 5>but it was funny,</v>

2262
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:26.503
<v Speaker 5>that generation of,</v>

2263
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 5>she had had a bunch of outrageous tweets.</v>

2264
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:29.750
<v Speaker 5>I in the book,</v>

2265
01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:34.040
<v Speaker 5>I read that from John Ronson that she was just outrageous and funny and would</v>

2266
01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:35.210
<v Speaker 5>say the inappropriate things.</v>

2267
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden got,</v>

2268
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 5>there's another,</v>

2269
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.810
<v Speaker 5>there's a young lady who worked with mentally disabled adults who took a picture</v>

2270
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:43.970
<v Speaker 5>at Arlington cemetery where it said,</v>

2271
01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:45.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2272
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.970
<v Speaker 5>please be quiet and be respectful.</v>

2273
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 5>And she did this like fake yelling and flipping off thing.</v>

2274
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.310
<v Speaker 5>The girl's life got destroyed,</v>

2275
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.420
<v Speaker 5>destroyed.</v>

2276
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.420
<v Speaker 5>And apparently her thing was posting funny pictures of her doing the opposite of</v>

2277
01:01:58.851 --> 01:01:59.690
<v Speaker 5>whatever the sign said.</v>

2278
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.480
<v Speaker 5>Science had no smoking in her with a cigarette and a lighter.</v>

2279
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:02.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:02.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.350
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

2282
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 5>and like an over the top.</v>

2283
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.750
<v Speaker 5>Girl picture.</v>

2285
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 5>She got destroyed to the point where she didn't,</v>

2286
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:09.500
<v Speaker 5>she's like,</v>

2287
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get my name cleanse because I'm afraid I'll come back up in the</v>

2288
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:15.290
<v Speaker 5>thing because they can now clean your name.</v>

2289
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.550
<v Speaker 5>Here's the real one.</v>

2290
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:17.390
<v Speaker 5>There's one that fucked up.</v>

2291
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 5>Clean your name.</v>

2292
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:18.920
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2293
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean companies</v>

2294
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 3>that they go through the cleaner and it sounds like the professionals at French</v>

2295
01:02:24.661 --> 01:02:25.150
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2296
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.983
<v Speaker 3>What's that guy?</v>

2297
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:26.933
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2298
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.320
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2299
01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2300
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.070
<v Speaker 3>the professional side though.</v>

2301
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.501
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2302
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2303
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 3>they go through,</v>

2304
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 3>they do it a lot.</v>

2305
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I think they think they do it for sex offenders.</v>

2306
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2307
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.760
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2308
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 3>by my reading comprehension skills aren't tops,</v>

2309
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 3>but like for people that don't want their name on the Internet for whatever the</v>

2310
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:46.044
<v Speaker 3>fuck they did,</v>

2311
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.840
<v Speaker 3>guys that have been convicted of rape.</v>

2312
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2313
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 3>And so what they do is they basically you pay them and then they flood the</v>

2314
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Internet with websites that your name comes up on and fake pop up that you go to</v>

2315
01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:00.630
<v Speaker 3>the website and it says temporarily unavailable or whatever.</v>

2316
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 3>And they just flood the Internet with that.</v>

2317
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So that when you do find Justine soccer,</v>

2318
01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:10.761
<v Speaker 3>what's number seven on the list and number one is a semifinal final semi final</v>

2319
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 3>medalist for the,</v>

2320
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 3>this uh,</v>

2321
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.850
<v Speaker 3>ran a five k.</v>

2322
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 3>So they just add shit to the internet to flood the water.</v>

2323
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 3>So it makes it more difficult to find information about you.</v>

2324
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 3>That would be the smart thing to deal with if somebody was fucking with you,</v>

2325
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.740
<v Speaker 3>hire someone to write complete fiction about you all the time,</v>

2326
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.520
<v Speaker 3>like all day long.</v>

2327
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2328
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 3>just make up shit,</v>

2329
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 3>get to the point where it's like finally thinly veiled,</v>

2330
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 3>like it's very difficult to tell like what's true,</v>

2331
01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:44.250
<v Speaker 3>what's not like almost like an onion story and just hire someone to do that all</v>

2332
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2333
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 3>So like if Justine sacco had like a pile of cash,</v>

2334
01:03:47.101 --> 01:03:50.880
<v Speaker 3>if she was a scrooge McDuck and she just sat back with all our cash and said,</v>

2335
01:03:50.881 --> 01:03:51.181
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2336
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to hire a team of creative writers and it just going to tell my</v>

2337
01:03:55.801 --> 01:03:56.634

2338
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 3>What's that like to just tell her story,</v>

2339
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:03.501
<v Speaker 3>make up stories all day long about things that she did like constantly and make</v>

2340
01:04:03.751 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2341
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 3>some of them seem reasonable and some of them seem completely ridiculous.</v>

2342
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this.</v>

2343
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.920
<v Speaker 3>You're that guy.</v>

2347
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this.</v>

2348
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:15.241
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2349

2350
01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:15.751

2357
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thought that it'd be so retarded to think that then I guess I didn't</v>

2358
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:30.384
<v Speaker 3>think it either.</v>

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch it?</v>

2427
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.831
<v Speaker 3>He said No.</v>

2428
01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:09.664
<v Speaker 3>Brian said no.</v>

2429
01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch a parascope when he went on a website and he definitely,</v>

2430
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:13.564
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

2431
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.130
<v Speaker 3>He's telling me his eyes weren't working correctly and I'm like,</v>

2432
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 3>do you know that's a symptom of diabetes?</v>

2433
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't have it.</v>

2434
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2435
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2436
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.420
<v Speaker 3>who you drank all the time.</v>

2437
01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:23.254
<v Speaker 3>You don't want your food.</v>

2438
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I was that good.</v>

2439
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.693
<v Speaker 3>Coconut water.</v>

2440
01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2441
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Did you get tested for diabetes?</v>

2442
01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:27.011
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>

2443
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Are you just hoping to get tested?</v>

2444
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I got fully tested.</v>

2445
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I had was a little bit of a lack of vitamin D,</v>

2446
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.600
<v Speaker 3>which is I guess normal or being assigned.</v>

2447
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:37.600
<v Speaker 3>It's called being outside.</v>

2448
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing you had.</v>

2449
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.990
<v Speaker 3>You want one.</v>

2451
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Vitamin D is a a pretty normal ailment or pretty normal?</v>

2452
01:06:44.871 --> 01:06:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I think there's jaundice.</v>

2453
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.033
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

2454
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Well George and I both with jaundice and you'd have to sit and hold them by the,</v>

2456
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.413
<v Speaker 3>by the sun,</v>

2457
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.600
<v Speaker 3>like by the window and let the sun hit him and then you'd watch him turn from</v>

2458
01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:56.291
<v Speaker 3>yellow to white.</v>

2459
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>

2460
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 3>I just remember hearing that they turned from yellow to white.</v>

2461
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:03.370
<v Speaker 3>How bizarre is it that your body produces a vitamin from the sun,</v>

2462
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:08.170
<v Speaker 3>like the sun hits you and it actually produces vitamin D and I had a convertible</v>

2463
01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 3>and I live in Los Angeles and I still was that.</v>

2464
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.940
<v Speaker 3>And it's like really need to be actually out there,</v>

2465
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2466
01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.520
<v Speaker 3>we're very rarely like out in the sun.</v>

2467
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2468
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 3>What was the last time you were sunburned without going to a tanning bed?</v>

2469
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 3>That shit's not good either.</v>

2470
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Tanning beds.</v>

2471
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who just got a,</v>

2472
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 3>my friend Cameron Hanes,</v>

2473
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:29.110
<v Speaker 3>he just got a big chunk of his face cut off.</v>

2474
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2475
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Skin cancer.</v>

2476
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:31.973
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

2477
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't it start,</v>

2478
01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>was it like a weird mole on his face?</v>

2479
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Molly guy and it's scary because like a half,</v>

2480
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:41.430
<v Speaker 3>a lot of my moles look like they are,</v>

2481
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 3>they should be cancer.</v>

2482
01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:45.610
<v Speaker 3>But then you get them checked and like know if it turns red and starts to like</v>

2483
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.230
<v Speaker 3>hurt spread and stuff.</v>

2484
01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:49.901
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2485
01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:50.141
<v Speaker 3>wait til,</v>

2486
01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

2487
01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:51.231
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about camera.</v>

2488
01:07:51.231 --> 01:07:52.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm more interested in cameras.</v>

2489
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Weird the on his face.</v>

2490
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:53.831
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2491
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:54.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2492
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I went to the doctor and they,</v>

2493
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.290
<v Speaker 3>they check it and I'm like,</v>

2494
01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

2495
01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:57.730
<v Speaker 3>you gotta cut it out.</v>

2496
01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:58.680
<v Speaker 3>They make an appointment late.</v>

2497
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 3>They sliced them like a box cutter.</v>

2498
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Like he was in a war with the gang banger,</v>

2499
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.650
<v Speaker 3>cut his face open and stitched it back up.</v>

2500
01:08:05.651 --> 01:08:07.270
<v Speaker 3>They took a big chunk out of his face,</v>

2501
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.640
<v Speaker 3>but his camera and use sunscreen when he goes hunting.</v>

2502
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2503
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:11.770
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2504
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:12.603
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2505
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:13.280
<v Speaker 3>It probably doesn't.</v>

2506
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>Money runs either.</v>

2507
01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.291
<v Speaker 3>He runs a lot.</v>

2508
01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:15.861
<v Speaker 3>He's a police,</v>

2509
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2510
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:16.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2511
01:08:16.371 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2512
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.421
<v Speaker 4>he's doing,</v>

2513
01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:18.820
<v Speaker 4>he's getting ready now for,</v>

2514
01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2515
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 4>a double ultra marathon.</v>

2516
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.240
<v Speaker 4>It's something called the big foot race.</v>

2517
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 4>It's 200 plus miles,</v>

2518
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.900
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 204 miles.</v>

2519
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:27.590
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2520
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2521
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:28.660
<v Speaker 4>It's two days.</v>

2522
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Two days.</v>

2523
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:29.970
<v Speaker 4>These guys were,</v>

2524
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:30.651
<v Speaker 4>why the sound guy?</v>

2525
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 4>That was James Deamer who does,</v>

2526
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:33.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2527
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 4>who does those ultra marathons?</v>

2528
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 4>Cam's done a bunch,</v>

2529
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:36.411
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2530
01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 4>not a bunch.</v>

2531
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 4>He's done a bunch of marathons,</v>

2532
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.860
<v Speaker 4>but I think he's done three 100 mile runs and one of them,</v>

2533
01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 4>he actually did a 24 hour race and he won 106 miles.</v>

2534
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I think it was something like that.</v>

2535
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:50.354
<v Speaker 4>Something crazy like that.</v>

2536
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 4>106 and a now he's going to essentially double that</v>

2537
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.003
<v Speaker 5>or close to it.</v>

2538
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking insane.</v>

2539
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2540
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:57.951
<v Speaker 5>but you don't know what it was.</v>

2541
01:08:57.951 --> 01:09:01.820
<v Speaker 5>I'll say this guy's like Cameron and uh,</v>

2542
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 5>who's the guy who had the children travel general for,</v>

2543
01:09:03.891 --> 01:09:04.790
<v Speaker 5>can't remember his name right now,</v>

2544
01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's a good friend of yours is also Steven Nelson Mandela.</v>

2545
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 5>They've made hunting.</v>

2546
01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2547
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.431
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

2548
01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Again.</v>

2549
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:11.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.100
<v Speaker 5>Like I like the,</v>

2551
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.840
<v Speaker 5>I listen to those stories and it's hunting's you know,</v>

2552
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:15.710
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid,</v>

2553
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 5>hunting was about like waking up early and going out with your dad and,</v>

2554
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.470
<v Speaker 5>and fucking being tired and cold in the car and then going out and then possibly</v>

2555
01:09:24.471 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 5>someone would hit you with buck shot like at some point in the day.</v>

2556
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 5>But like now it's like,</v>

2557
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:29.800
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2558
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 5>it seems like these adventures,</v>

2559
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.331
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

2560
01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 5>which almost as a man,</v>

2561
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:34.280
<v Speaker 5>like my wife got chickens and,</v>

2562
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.780
<v Speaker 5>and I understand she's never been more happy about a project in her life and she</v>

2563
01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 5>met.</v>

2564
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.010
<v Speaker 5>Got It from your wife.</v>

2565
01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:41.143
<v Speaker 5>When we went to your house,</v>

2566
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:43.670
<v Speaker 5>she saw that she thought it was so fucking cool.</v>

2567
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.840
<v Speaker 5>She had been talking about forever.</v>

2568
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:47.390
<v Speaker 5>Finally gets the chickens every morning she let the chickens out,</v>

2569
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:48.403
<v Speaker 5>she talks to them,</v>

2570
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:49.101
<v Speaker 5>she's trained them.</v>

2571
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 5>So they'll come up and get on her and,</v>

2572
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.920
<v Speaker 5>and I watched that.</v>

2573
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 5>And it's a primal instinct that's inherent in humans is to almost,</v>

2574
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:56.540
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

2575
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

2576
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.370
<v Speaker 5>I want to plow my own field.</v>

2577
01:09:58.371 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

2578
01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 5>I want to do my own work.</v>

2579
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:04.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to feel like I did something and those guys want to,</v>

2580
01:10:04.841 --> 01:10:05.641
<v Speaker 5>and when I listen to you,</v>

2581
01:10:05.641 --> 01:10:06.800
<v Speaker 5>I'll do podcasts about it.</v>

2582
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 5>I get it makes me want to go hunting.</v>

2583
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.030
<v Speaker 5>And I told you I'd never kill an animal.</v>

2584
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:11.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm never,</v>

2585
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I'd be cool with it.</v>

2586
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that I'd have killed a couple animals.</v>

2587
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.981
<v Speaker 5>I take that back.</v>

2588
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:18.620
<v Speaker 5>But I had a pig roast and house and kill,</v>

2589
01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:21.680
<v Speaker 5>killed animals are definitely killed animals but never like no with a shotgun</v>

2590
01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 5>now with the gun.</v>

2591
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Never the bone arrow.</v>

2592
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 5>But it makes it seem like,</v>

2593
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:26.890
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2594
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 5>I might need this in my life.</v>

2595
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 5>That sounds so fucking stupid,</v>

2596
01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:33.540
<v Speaker 5>but I might need this in my life to get out into nature with me and a gun and,</v>

2597
01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:35.780
<v Speaker 5>and be afraid because you're in the jungle,</v>

2598
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 5>you're in the woods and a bear might roll up on you.</v>

2599
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 5>What you are out there to hunt might roll up on you and get,</v>

2600
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 5>it's like this fight club,</v>

2601
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 5>cut your fingernails cause you're fighting type thing.</v>

2602
01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:46.610
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2603
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:50.630
<v Speaker 5>and I like I just started going back out to that place we shot shotguns and</v>

2604
01:10:50.631 --> 01:10:52.940
<v Speaker 5>shooting sporting clays cause I was like,</v>

2605
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.021
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2606
01:10:54.021 --> 01:10:54.290
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2607
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:55.040
<v Speaker 5>maybe this,</v>

2608
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.873
<v Speaker 5>maybe this will,</v>

2609
01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:59.450
<v Speaker 5>maybe this will be like a new form of therapy or maybe this'll be like a new</v>

2610
01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:02.990
<v Speaker 5>thing that blossoms into me growing.</v>

2611
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Does that make any sense?</v>

2612
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:06.081
<v Speaker 4>It does make sense.</v>

2613
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Like the shotgun that what you were,</v>

2614
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.620
<v Speaker 4>the way you were explaining it.</v>

2615
01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:11.450
<v Speaker 4>I've never done that sporting clay stuff,</v>

2616
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.980
<v Speaker 4>but it sounds really fun.</v>

2617
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 4>That what it is</v>

2619
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:14.371
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2620
01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:14.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2621
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 5>well you can explain it,</v>

2622
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:18.690
<v Speaker 5>but you go out there and there's a course and all these things pop up and you</v>

2623
01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 5>shoot him,</v>

2624
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.070
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>

2625
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 5>you're going through this course and as you're going through this course,</v>

2626
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 5>some of them are rolling on the ground.</v>

2627
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 5>Some of them they shoot up,</v>

2628
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 5>they launch them in the air and they're these clays,</v>

2629
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 5>just like those same sorts of things,</v>

2630
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:30.061
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2631
01:11:30.061 --> 01:11:30.481
<v Speaker 5>Like those,</v>

2632
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:31.500
<v Speaker 5>those 50th,</v>

2633
01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:31.840
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2634
01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.140
<v Speaker 5>it's 15 different stations that you go to.</v>

2635
01:11:34.141 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 5>You can go to 15 dissertations and they're all set up differently to be</v>

2636
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 5>different types of birds,</v>

2637
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:39.030
<v Speaker 5>different types of animals.</v>

2638
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 5>So like some will be like a rabbit where the clay roles on the ground out in</v>

2639
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:42.811
<v Speaker 5>front of,</v>

2640
01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 5>but you don't the real,</v>

2641
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:45.780
<v Speaker 5>the real sport in it.</v>

2642
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:46.710
<v Speaker 5>And I gotta be honest with you,</v>

2643
01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:47.544
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2644
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:48.001
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2645
01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:48.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2646
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.000
<v Speaker 5>it's like fine tuning your machine where you get up there,</v>

2647
01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:51.834
<v Speaker 5>you have your gun,</v>

2648
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 5>your shotgun and a,</v>

2649
01:11:53.941 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 5>we did the two shot,</v>

2650
01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.590
<v Speaker 5>top and bottom right.</v>

2651
01:11:57.650 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 5>And you out there and you go pull and your buddy hits the button behind you.</v>

2652
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:05.940
<v Speaker 5>And all of a sudden two things come out of the woods and you don't know where</v>

2653
01:12:05.941 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 5>the common from and you don't know where and you just feel like fuck just and</v>

2654
01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 5>you try to get it and then there is this thing that hits on your head and hits</v>

2655
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 5>in your fucking cerebellum.</v>

2656
01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:14.121
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

2657
01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:14.954
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

2658
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.410
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't feed my family today.</v>

2659
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.611
<v Speaker 5>Like you get done.</v>

2660
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2661
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:19.290
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't find my family that day.</v>

2662
01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to defend myself or my family.</v>

2663
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.410
<v Speaker 5>I'd be back in the woods tomorrow.</v>

2664
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:23.070
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2665
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.903
<v Speaker 5>and it was,</v>

2666
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:24.700
<v Speaker 5>it's cool man.</v>

2667
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:25.533
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2668
01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.860
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could remember the name of the place to say it so people would go</v>

2669
01:12:28.861 --> 01:12:29.694
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2670
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 5>but it was fucking packed.</v>

2671
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:32.371
<v Speaker 5>But the day we went,</v>

2672
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:33.204
<v Speaker 5>someone setting,</v>

2673
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.500
<v Speaker 5>I posted a video on my youtube page cause we were walking doing the walk and a</v>

2674
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:41.450
<v Speaker 5>deer just walked across us and we've fucking shotguns and it tears just walked</v>

2675
01:12:41.451 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 5>across.</v>

2676
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.120
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2677
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.050
<v Speaker 5>we can fucking kill it.</v>

2678
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Like we have loaded shotguns,</v>

2679
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.920
<v Speaker 5>but we're tuning sporting clays and we're like,</v>

2680
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.961
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

2681
01:12:47.961 --> 01:12:49.470
<v Speaker 5>You might not really even kill it.</v>

2682
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't even,</v>

2683
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.000
<v Speaker 5>you just fuck up a tide.</v>

2684

<v Speaker 5>You have heard of the evening.</v>

2685

2687
01:12:54.181 --> 01:12:57.660
<v Speaker 5>you're shooting spray those little tiny pellets.</v>

2688
01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 5>He would need a slug.</v>

2689
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:00.810
<v Speaker 5>Like they use slugs to hunt deer.</v>

2690
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.261
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the,</v>

2691
01:13:01.261 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 5>with a shotgun.</v>

2692
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:05.880
<v Speaker 5>That's the one thing about that video is I posted and I was like hunters and uh,</v>

2693
01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.730
<v Speaker 5>anti gun people will both hate this video cause hunters were like,</v>

2694
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.720
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't fucking kill it.</v>

2695
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.250
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2696
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.840
<v Speaker 5>And Go,</v>

2697
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.131

<v Speaker 5>how are you,</v>

2699
01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:12.270
<v Speaker 5>why do you have guns?</v>

2700
01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:14.220
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like right in that window of stupid.</v>

2701
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.193
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2702
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 5>what's going on is when you're out there and those things are running by like</v>

2703
01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 5>your focused folks forced to focus on them.</v>

2704
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 5>And when you forced to focus on the clay rolling on the ground or the one</v>

2705
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.370
<v Speaker 5>launching through the air,</v>

2706
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.770
<v Speaker 5>it takes you away from your pro,</v>

2707
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.040
<v Speaker 5>your problems and your troubles.</v>

2708
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 5>It takes you away from thinking about all the other things that are going on in</v>

2709
01:13:32.821 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 5>the back of your brain constantly,</v>

2710
01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 5>whether it's bills or stress or a schedule or did you try it on the road?</v>

2711
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2712
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.641
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2713
01:13:38.641 --> 01:13:40.210
<v Speaker 5>you're constantly doing things and you,</v>

2714
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:44.370
<v Speaker 5>you have all these obligations and all these people tugging at you all the time,</v>

2715
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.910
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2716
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.710
<v Speaker 5>And it just happens the second you get kids,</v>

2717
01:13:46.711 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 5>you commit to all that shit.</v>

2718
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:48.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2719
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.620
<v Speaker 5>it's like growing up,</v>

2720
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2721
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:52.080
<v Speaker 5>I talked to my therapist about it and he was like,</v>

2722
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.460
<v Speaker 5>it's like when did your stress start?</v>

2723
01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 5>Like when did you start really caring,</v>

2724
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:56.940
<v Speaker 5>giving a fuck?</v>

2725
01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:58.590
<v Speaker 5>I finally give a fuck when I had kids.</v>

2726
01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 5>And then you go out hunting and you're like,</v>

2727
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:00.571
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2729
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 5>It takes you back to,</v>

2730
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.600
<v Speaker 5>it takes me by society.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't use that defense.</v>

2872
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.880
<v Speaker 3>We're watching a fucking blood sport on TV.</v>

2873
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 3>The child's been watching tonight to shirtless guys.</v>

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking light me up for being the fucking start with them.</v>

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:53.420
<v Speaker 3>So I got kicked out of that one.</v>

2879
01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 3>What if the kid's gangster and likes fighting?</v>

2880
01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't even watch these on an iPad the whole time.</v>

2881
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one day we'll do like,</v>

2882
01:17:58.521 --> 01:17:59.660
<v Speaker 3>we'll take it in peripherally.</v>

2883
01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:00.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2884
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:01.640
<v Speaker 3>like roar of the crowd.</v>

2885
01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 3>I want to inspire them,</v>

2886
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:04.430
<v Speaker 3>father.</v>

2887
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.800
<v Speaker 3>So should me to fight the most ridiculous ones.</v>

2888
01:18:06.801 --> 01:18:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo wild wings.</v>

2889
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing up having a beer guy comes up to me.</v>

2890
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2891
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.660
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2892
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.441
<v Speaker 3>I can't have you doing that.</v>

2893
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I need you to sit down.</v>

2894
01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.450
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize,</v>

2895
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize you can't stand and have a beer in Utah that's illegal to stand</v>

2896
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.640
<v Speaker 3>and drink a beer.</v>

2897
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.740
<v Speaker 3>So when you go to a bar and you taught everyone seated,</v>

2898
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you have to be seated and you have a,</v>

2899
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.080
<v Speaker 3>you can't be walking around.</v>

2900
01:18:24.081 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 3>You can be like standing and standing at a bar.</v>

2901
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:26.841
<v Speaker 3>So you can't like,</v>

2902
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:27.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
01:18:27.021 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 3>people go to a bar and they mingle and they walk around with their beer.</v>

2904
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.230
<v Speaker 3>You sit down,</v>

2905
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:30.611
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2906
01:18:30.611 --> 01:18:31.400
<v Speaker 3>if you want to stand up,</v>

2907
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.233
<v Speaker 3>if you want to stand up,</v>

2908
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.881
<v Speaker 3>you got to have no,</v>

2909
01:18:32.881 --> 01:18:33.570
<v Speaker 3>no beer in hand.</v>

2910
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2911
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.720
<v Speaker 3>They used to be a rule that we thought for the longest time at the Tempe Improv</v>

2912
01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:40.340
<v Speaker 3>that you weren't allowed to drink on stage,</v>

2913
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:42.290
<v Speaker 3>but it turned out was bullshit.</v>

2914
01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Denmark,</v>

2915
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:45.140
<v Speaker 3>may he rest in peace.</v>

2916
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2917
01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:46.731
<v Speaker 3>Dan Mar,</v>

2918
01:18:46.731 --> 01:18:47.564
<v Speaker 3>he's dead,</v>

2919
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2920
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.300
<v Speaker 3>was decided for whatever reason that he was going to put up a fake sign that</v>

2921
01:18:53.301 --> 01:18:56.360
<v Speaker 3>there's a fake state law that says you can't drink on stage.</v>

2922
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 3>And so we would,</v>

2923
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 3>we would just bring flasks.</v>

2924
01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.440
<v Speaker 3>When Brian and I were there,</v>

2925
01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:01.370
<v Speaker 3>we went to a,</v>

2926
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 3>like a drive Thru BU's place,</v>

2927
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:04.640
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

2928
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Bought a flask full of flask and a bottle of Jack and then we're drinking on</v>

2929
01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

2930
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I was just adding,</v>

2931
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I was explaining,</v>

2932
01:19:12.561 --> 01:19:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I was adding warm diet coke to my cold diet coke because I like to,</v>

2933
01:19:16.911 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I like a medium temperature.</v>

2934
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.600
<v Speaker 3>So I have a flask of warm diet coke to always keep with him.</v>

2935
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2936
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm already on top of that lie to whoever asks,</v>

2937
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:27.830
<v Speaker 3>because I'm such a drinker in public like you are like,</v>

2938
01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.281
<v Speaker 3>cause I like,</v>

2939
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 3>and I was already going,</v>

2940
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.310
<v Speaker 3>what's my line real quick cause my teeth get too cold.</v>

2941
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my teeth to get cold.</v>

2942
01:19:32.181 --> 01:19:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I just had oral surgery.</v>

2943
01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to look at it.</v>

2944
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 3>So in Utah,</v>

2945
01:19:36.801 --> 01:19:37.610
<v Speaker 3>is that True Brian?</v>

2946
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.911
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

2947
01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:39.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't say anything about that.</v>

2948
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 3>But it does say a lot of weird things about Utah.</v>

2949
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Any beer over 4% eight BV is considered liquor.</v>

2950
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol by volume.</v>

2951
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:47.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2952
01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 3>And when they have Zions curtain there Zions curtain is,</v>

2953
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.003
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>

2954
01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:52.481
<v Speaker 3>they have it.</v>

2955
01:19:52.481 --> 01:19:53.720
<v Speaker 3>They won't pour your drink in front of you.</v>

2956
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.790
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

2957
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.910
<v Speaker 3>they weren't see the bartender there were just mixing or pouring drinks.</v>

2958
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:00.020
<v Speaker 3>They used to have it.</v>

2959
01:20:00.021 --> 01:20:04.220
<v Speaker 3>So you would buy like your drink in one spot and your mixer and another spot.</v>

2960
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Like if you wanted a jack and coke they would,</v>

2961
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.930
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

2962
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 3>you have the poor,</v>

2963
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.710
<v Speaker 5>the Jack Daniels and the glass in one spot and then you have to go over and get</v>

2964
01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:11.850
<v Speaker 5>the coke and another spot.</v>

2965
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2966
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh I got another part of the bar.</v>

2967
01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 5>This also says that you could only have 1.5 ounces of alcohol and your drink no</v>

2968
01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:18.691
<v Speaker 5>exception.</v>

2969
01:20:18.691 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 5>So like a long island ice tea would be like the worst drink ever.</v>

2970
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:23.820
<v Speaker 5>And the ones that actually you can actually all sugar.</v>

2971
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.181
<v Speaker 5>Hold on,</v>

2972
01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:25.910
<v Speaker 5>you can actually get along us honesty.</v>

2973
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 5>That's the exception in Utah because I had ordered a double Tito's and soda and</v>

2974
01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:31.531
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

2975
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:32.364
<v Speaker 5>we can't do doubles.</v>

2976
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.370
<v Speaker 5>We can bring you to drinks or we'll know that we can bring you a drink and a</v>

2977
01:20:35.371 --> 01:20:36.204
<v Speaker 5>shot,</v>

2978
01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 5>but we can't do two drinks.</v>

2979
01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 5>They can't order doubles.</v>

2980
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:40.703
<v Speaker 5>Doubles.</v>

2981
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:41.390
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

2982
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.590
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2983
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:46.530
<v Speaker 5>you should've seen the look on my face as we're watching UFC in a buffalo wild</v>

2984
01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 5>wings.</v>

2985
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.630
<v Speaker 5>And the bartender says to me,</v>

2986
01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:49.051
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2987
01:20:49.051 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 5>the manager comes up,</v>

2988
01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 5>I wish I knew where we were in Utah because it's a smaller,</v>

2989
01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:54.570
<v Speaker 5>it's an,</v>

2990
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:55.100
<v Speaker 5>it's not one,</v>

2991
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.810
<v Speaker 5>it's not Provo or it's one of the smaller towns.</v>

2992
01:20:58.380 --> 01:20:59.820
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like the big city,</v>

2993
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 5>which I'm sure you're allowed to stand up and with your beer in your hand at</v>

2994
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:03.684
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>

2995
01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.500
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

2996
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.790
<v Speaker 5>but like he came up to me,</v>

2997
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:07.560
<v Speaker 5>I had gone to the bathroom with my beer in my hand.</v>

2998
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.860
<v Speaker 5>Who leaves a beer on the fucking bar and walks to the bathroom.</v>

2999
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.270
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to be crazy.</v>

3000
01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:12.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3002
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.700
<v Speaker 5>I walked,</v>

3003
01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even think anything of it.</v>

3004
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 5>It sounds ridiculous now just walk to the bar with my beer in my hand.</v>

3005
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.690
<v Speaker 5>Take a piss and come back.</v>

3006
01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:19.051
<v Speaker 5>And he was,</v>

3007
01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:19.650
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

3008
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:20.430

3011
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.011

<v Speaker 5>do you need to sit down?</v>

3019
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:28.020

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3058
01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:18.830

01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:32.530
<v Speaker 5>This isn't a 30 minute flight and I'm giving you for it.</v>

3069
01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.160

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3072
01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:35.063
<v Speaker 5>I think we've had a lot.</v>

3073
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.611
<v Speaker 5>Then you just go,</v>

3074
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:36.000
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3075
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.751
<v Speaker 5>I automatically,</v>

3076
01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:36.901
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

01:22:38.311 --> 01:22:38.791
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry about it.</v>

3080
01:22:38.791 --> 01:22:41.610
<v Speaker 5>And then I fucking white knuckle the rest of the flight because I can't because</v>

3081
01:22:41.611 --> 01:22:42.120
<v Speaker 5>I get nervous.</v>

3082
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.953
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

3083
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 5>I had a guy on the plane to South Africa telling me I've had a lot and I was</v>

3084
01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3085
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:46.921
<v Speaker 5>I pulled him aside.</v>

3086
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:47.310
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3087
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:49.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally sober right now,</v>

3088
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 5>but we need to figure out a way where I can drink the rest of this flight</v>

3089
01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:56.280
<v Speaker 5>because I will have panic because I had 13 hours left and I was like,</v>

3090
01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 5>so you come up with a system,</v>

3091
01:22:58.050 --> 01:22:58.883
<v Speaker 5>I'll agree with it.</v>

3092
01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 5>And the guy looked at me very plainly is like,</v>

3093
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:02.730
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you a beer every hour for the next 13 hours.</v>

3094
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:03.031
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3095
01:23:03.031 --> 01:23:03.391
<v Speaker 5>perfect.</v>

3096
01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:04.670
<v Speaker 5>She's just crying.</v>

3097
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.793
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3098
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:07.350
<v Speaker 5>13 beers on flight.</v>

3099
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:07.991

<v Speaker 5>Are we going to lie?</v>

3103

<v Speaker 5>So I nibble a little Xanax and then had the next beer and then fucking,</v>

3106
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're supposed to mix those.</v>

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Cause these,</v>

3134
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 5>these are real for people who take Xanax.</v>

3135
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:07.481
<v Speaker 5>You need to know.</v>

3136
01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 5>But from what I understand,</v>

3137
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:09.743
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3138
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:10.833
<v Speaker 5>Greg,</v>

3139
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.920
<v Speaker 5>I hate,</v>

3140
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:14.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know how to talk like this because I liked Greg a lot and I don't</v>

3141
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.060
<v Speaker 5>want to tell Google what Greg draw the died off.</v>

3142
01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:20.560
<v Speaker 5>It was toxicology reports going to be a little bit of everything.</v>

3143
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm certain because I think he was partying at the time when he definitely liked</v>

3144
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.573
<v Speaker 5>pills.</v>

3145
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:25.570
<v Speaker 5>He had an issue.</v>

3146
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3147
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.071
<v Speaker 5>I think I,</v>

3148
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:27.360
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3149
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3150
01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.360
<v Speaker 5>I feel we were talking about Greg.</v>

3151
01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:31.270
<v Speaker 5>So I really genuine liked him and he was very sweet to me.</v>

3152
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:31.990
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>

3153
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.771
<v Speaker 5>He was like fantastic.</v>

3154
01:24:32.771 --> 01:24:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't it take away from the fact that he had an issue with pills?</v>

3155
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.080
<v Speaker 5>He definitely need.</v>

3156
01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.030
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't a great guy.</v>

3157
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:37.361
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

3158
01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:38.470
<v Speaker 5>but I still have great people.</v>

3159
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:39.640
<v Speaker 5>If issues of pills,</v>

3160
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:43.180
<v Speaker 5>I say this then as a warning and using Greg's legacy is a warning.</v>

3161
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.550
<v Speaker 5>It's not a bad thing to say it killed him.</v>

3162
01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:46.401
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

3163
01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 5>it's a good,</v>

3164
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.141
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3165
01:24:47.141 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a good thing to bring up.</v>

3166
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:48.830
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

3167
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:49.270
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3168
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.570
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3169
01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3170
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:50.561
<v Speaker 5>But I'll tell you what,</v>

3171
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:53.140
<v Speaker 5>the whole reason I don't fuck with Xanax at all.</v>

3172
01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:53.993
<v Speaker 5>It's because of Greg,</v>

3173
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.990
<v Speaker 5>because from what I understand,</v>

3174
01:24:56.110 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 5>he was coming,</v>

3175
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.581
<v Speaker 5>from what I understand,</v>

3176
01:24:57.581 --> 01:24:58.560
<v Speaker 5>he was coming off partying.</v>

3177
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:59.680
<v Speaker 5>He was in a hotel room,</v>

3178
01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:00.850
<v Speaker 5>he wanted to sleep.</v>

3179
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.550
<v Speaker 5>He took Xanax and he,</v>

3180
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.900
<v Speaker 5>and with Xanax sometimes,</v>

3181
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:05.441
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3182
01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:06.274
<v Speaker 5>when you use it,</v>

3183
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:06.790
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

3184
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:08.470
<v Speaker 5>I've used it a bunch in the past,</v>

3185
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.673
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3186
01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 5>you build up a tolerance and then you stop using it and you,</v>

3187
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 5>and it feels like shit when you stop using it.</v>

3188
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.660
<v Speaker 5>Benzos are the worst.</v>

3189
01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:18.580
<v Speaker 5>They won't even admit you to Rehab if you're on Benzos.</v>

3190
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:19.120
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3191
01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3192
01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:19.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3193
01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.331
<v Speaker 5>I have a buddy.</v>

3194
01:25:20.331 --> 01:25:24.070
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't go to rehab because there's on Benzos and you stop using it.</v>

3195
01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.540
<v Speaker 5>And then the second you stop using it,</v>

3196
01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.131
<v Speaker 5>you get,</v>

3197
01:25:26.131 --> 01:25:28.120
<v Speaker 5>you get sick and you could die.</v>

3198
01:25:28.121 --> 01:25:28.954
<v Speaker 5>You could have a stroke.</v>

3199
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:31.630
<v Speaker 5>But then when you go back to using it again,</v>

3200
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:32.190
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3201
01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:33.160
<v Speaker 5>your tolerance goes back.</v>

3202
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:36.370
<v Speaker 5>So you can take back to half a milligram and you feel it again.</v>

3203
01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:37.510
<v Speaker 5>But from what I understand,</v>

3204
01:25:37.511 --> 01:25:40.900
<v Speaker 5>Greg used more used to what he used to use and it just,</v>

3205
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:41.860
<v Speaker 5>it has its way with them.</v>

3206
01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I could be totally wrong.</v>

3207
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:44.730
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3208
01:25:44.730 --> 01:25:45.011
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

3209
01:25:45.011 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 5>and I hope I am.</v>

3210
01:25:45.881 --> 01:25:46.714
<v Speaker 5>I hope whatever.</v>

3211
01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:47.591
<v Speaker 5>I Love Greg.</v>

3212
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:48.161
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

3213
01:25:48.161 --> 01:25:48.994
<v Speaker 5>genuinely,</v>

3214
01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong with what you're saying.</v>

3215
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3216
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.353
<v Speaker 5>you can just,</v>

3217
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.620
<v Speaker 5>you're saying something and everybody knew,</v>

3218
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3219
01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 5>it's like Patrice dying of diabetes.</v>

3220
01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not a bad thing if you say the Patrice didn't take care of his health</v>

3221
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:02.463
<v Speaker 5>because he didn't,</v>

3222
01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:02.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3223
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 5>just the fact it doesn't make them any less of an awesome guy,</v>

3224
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:06.891
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3225
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 5>or an amazing comedian or just a fucking joy to be around.</v>

3226
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 5>He was all those things,</v>

3227
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 5>but he also had diabetes.</v>

3228
01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.300
<v Speaker 5>It didn't take care of it.</v>

3229
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 5>I think of him a lot,</v>

3230
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:16.701
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

3231
01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:17.261
<v Speaker 5>these are all,</v>

3232
01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:17.441
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3233
01:26:17.441 --> 01:26:17.541
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3234
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:21.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever I say fucking shelve it until what Burt's memory of his narrative is.</v>

3235
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 5>But Patrice called his,</v>

3236
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3237
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:28.820
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend Vaughn when he was having a stroke and he's like,</v>

3238
01:26:28.821 --> 01:26:29.870
<v Speaker 5>I feel weird.</v>

3239
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Like something's going on.</v>

3240
01:26:31.371 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 5>I need to go to the hospital.</v>

3241
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.261
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3242
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:34.370
<v Speaker 5>it's so funny as a,</v>

3243
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:37.280
<v Speaker 5>I think anyone with anxiety attacks and anxiety attack feels like that.</v>

3244
01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.120
<v Speaker 5>And so like sometimes I've been like sitting in a hotel room and I just feel</v>

3245
01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:41.481
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>

3246
01:26:41.481 --> 01:26:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

3247
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.070
<v Speaker 5>like everything's shifting,</v>

3248
01:26:43.071 --> 01:26:44.090
<v Speaker 5>you're having anxiety at Pepin,</v>

3249
01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:44.943
<v Speaker 5>panic attack,</v>

3250
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.080
<v Speaker 5>and then you start thinking of a stroke and I think of what Patrice said that</v>

3251
01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:48.740
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

3252
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.190
<v Speaker 5>I do over take yoga or do you ever meditate or anything like that?</v>

3253
01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:53.751
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3254
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:54.800
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to get into meditation.</v>

3255
01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:55.634
<v Speaker 5>I really liked to.</v>

3256
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever exercise when you're on the road?</v>

3257
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:58.310
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3258
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.551
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

3259

3260
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:01.670

3261
01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 5>Last 11 months probably.</v>

3262
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:04.340
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.173
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>

01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:06.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean a little bit like scattered,</v>

3265
01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:06.951

3269
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:10.941
<v Speaker 5>I feel like piece of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Let me get down there and I'll run,</v>

3271

<v Speaker 5>I'll run,</v>

3272
01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:16.310
<v Speaker 5>walk two miles and I'll lift some weights,</v>

3273
01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.060

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 5>like right now I'm on a pretty sincere regiment where I'm working out.</v>

3276
01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.980
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm about 10 I get a walk on my fitbit.</v>

3277
01:27:24.981 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 5>I walk like 10 to 12 miles a day,</v>

3278
01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:28.700
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty good burden.</v>

3279
01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:33.590
<v Speaker 5>About 4,000 calories taken in under 2000 day writing down everything I had</v>

3280
01:27:33.591 --> 01:27:33.921
<v Speaker 5>taken.</v>

3281
01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:34.754
<v Speaker 5>Other than this,</v>

3282
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:35.870
<v Speaker 5>do you doing?</v>

3283
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:36.141

<v Speaker 5>it's on my blog.</v>

3285
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 5>I just started doing it.</v>

3286
01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 5>I started November 29th.</v>

3287
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:42.380
<v Speaker 5>And who's giving you this number?</v>

3288
01:27:42.381 --> 01:27:43.730
<v Speaker 5>Like 2000 calorie me,</v>

3289
01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:44.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm registering the calories.</v>

3290
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:45.660
<v Speaker 5>But why,</v>

3291
01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.300
<v Speaker 5>why did you decide on 2000?</v>

3292
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.660
<v Speaker 5>Because weight watchers,</v>

3293
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:48.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3294
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:49.970
<v Speaker 5>just me.</v>

3295
01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:50.740
<v Speaker 5>His,</v>

3296
01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.040
<v Speaker 5>the decided that would be enough.</v>

3297
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.520
<v Speaker 5>Now do you look at like what you're actually eating?</v>

3300
01:27:58.551 --> 01:27:59.990
<v Speaker 5>I can literally run through what I've eaten.</v>

3301
01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:00.410
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3304
01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.700
<v Speaker 5>Avoiding a lot of breads.</v>

<v Speaker 5>A lot of sugars.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm cool with a lot of vegetables.</v>

3427
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.240
<v Speaker 5>Would you be more happy if you were doing standup?</v>

3428
01:30:30.241 --> 01:30:31.074
<v Speaker 5>You think?</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3432
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.071
<v Speaker 5>it's really,</v>

3433
01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:38.410
<v Speaker 5>it's not hard to say because my heart is in stand up.</v>

3434
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.720
<v Speaker 5>It's always been in standup.</v>

3435
01:30:39.721 --> 01:30:44.370
<v Speaker 5>The only thing I'm proud of in my life is the fact that I am a standup comedian.</v>

3436
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.941
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3437
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:45.774
<v Speaker 5>the fact that I can,</v>

3438
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:48.000
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't happen all that often,</v>

3439
01:30:48.001 --> 01:30:51.780
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that I can roll into the comedy cellar and I'll know Jim,</v>

3442
01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:57.540
<v Speaker 5>The fact that it's like a fraternity that you've earned that you can't get,</v>

3443
01:30:57.570 --> 01:30:59.040
<v Speaker 5>you can't like just parent.</v>

3444
01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Your parents pay money and you join it.</v>

3445
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:02.303
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3486
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.400
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3490
01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 5>So like I don't want to lose that.</v>

3491
01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:07.511
<v Speaker 5>I and I,</v>

3497
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:22.390
<v Speaker 5>Last year I've been,</v>

3531
01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:15.820
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3532
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 5>like a little bit.</v>

3533
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:20.800
<v Speaker 5>There's gotta be a trade off 100%.</v>

3534
01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.820
<v Speaker 5>There's no way around it,</v>

3535
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:22.001
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3536
01:33:22.001 --> 01:33:23.360
<v Speaker 5>I got to retweet something for our,</v>

3537
01:33:23.361 --> 01:33:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm just remembering those,</v>

3538
01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3539
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be a trade off 100%.</v>

3540
01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:28.060
<v Speaker 5>There's no way around it.</v>

3541
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.651
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to do,</v>

3542
01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:29.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3543
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.440
<v Speaker 5>that's how I always felt when I was doing,</v>

3544
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:33.303
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3545
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:34.263
<v Speaker 5>fear factor,</v>

3546
01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.160
<v Speaker 5>but always felt like a big trade off.</v>

3547
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 5>But go back to yourself in a time machine.</v>

3548
01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:39.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3549
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.681
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3550
01:33:39.681 --> 01:33:40.251
<v Speaker 6>I would've done it.</v>

3551
01:33:40.251 --> 01:33:43.280
<v Speaker 6>I would do it again because I made enough money that I didn't have to give a</v>

3552
01:33:43.281 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 6>fuck about anything.</v>

3553
01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.261
<v Speaker 6>And in that,</v>

3554
01:33:45.261 --> 01:33:46.340
<v Speaker 6>not in the,</v>

3555
01:33:46.341 --> 01:33:47.570
<v Speaker 6>not giving a fuck,</v>

3556
01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.460
<v Speaker 6>having not giving a fuck money like true,</v>

3557
01:33:49.461 --> 01:33:53.030
<v Speaker 6>not giving a fuck money is when you can be yourself.</v>

3558
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.020
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to say,</v>

3559
01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.820
<v Speaker 6>oh I shouldn't say this because then people are going to be upset at me.</v>

3560
01:33:56.850 --> 01:33:59.960
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that'll stop me from getting an audition or stop me from getting a,</v>

3561
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:01.323
<v Speaker 6>but if you,</v>

3562
01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.790
<v Speaker 6>if you have enough money that you don't have to worry about that anymore,</v>

3563
01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:04.740
<v Speaker 6>then you can be yourself.</v>

3564
01:34:04.741 --> 01:34:06.230
<v Speaker 6>So on stage you can be yourself.</v>

3565
01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:06.980
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3566
01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:07.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm still,</v>

3567
01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.081
<v Speaker 5>I'm always like,</v>

3568
01:34:08.081 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

3569
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:10.030
<v Speaker 5>not going to be myself on stage,</v>

3570
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.050
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3571
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 5>but here's the question,</v>

3572
01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:13.023
<v Speaker 5>is there,</v>

3573
01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 5>is there,</v>

3574
01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:15.920
<v Speaker 5>there's the Joe Rogan and stop,</v>

3575
01:34:16.730 --> 01:34:18.410
<v Speaker 6>there's a time we should stop hauling it out</v>

3576
01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

3577
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.310
<v Speaker 5>and go and do what you love the best.</v>

3578
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.851
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

3579
01:34:22.851 --> 01:34:23.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3580
01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:24.260
<v Speaker 5>or do less.</v>

3581
01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm like not maybe not three shows.</v>

3582
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:27.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3583
01:34:27.171 --> 01:34:28.004
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>

3584
01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:28.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3585
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.480
<v Speaker 5>definitely three is too many.</v>

3586
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:30.453
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3587
01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:30.891
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3588
01:34:30.891 --> 01:34:31.760
<v Speaker 5>here's the question.</v>

3589
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:33.163
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3590
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:37.430
<v Speaker 5>would without,</v>

3591
01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.440
<v Speaker 5>where do you consider whoring it out?</v>

3592
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:40.603
<v Speaker 5>Cause I don't consider it.</v>

3593
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:42.260
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think I'd done really for me out.</v>

3594
01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 5>I hoard it out for like six years doing fear factor.</v>

3595
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that my standup got better when I stopped doing fear factor pretty</v>

3596
01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.073
<v Speaker 5>positively.</v>

3597
01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.033
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

3598
01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:53.990
<v Speaker 5>So go to like shiny happy Jihad.</v>

3599
01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 5>It was like one of my best things ever and I did it like right when I or right</v>

3600
01:34:57.681 --> 01:34:58.514
<v Speaker 5>when it ended</v>

3601
01:34:58.670 --> 01:34:59.530
<v Speaker 4>and then uh,</v>

3602
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:03.260
<v Speaker 4>from shiny happy Jihad talking monkey's in space is probably my best one after</v>

3603
01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:03.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3604
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 4>And that was no,</v>

3605
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 4>no fear factor at all.</v>

3606
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:06.830
<v Speaker 4>No TV at all.</v>

3607
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:08.510
<v Speaker 4>Just doing the EOC and stand up.</v>

3608
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:13.900
<v Speaker 4>And then I honestly think like now might be doing too many things with a podcast</v>

3609
01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 4>and then doing the UFC and doing standup might be too many.</v>

3610
01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:21.350
<v Speaker 4>I think podcasts and standup is like the way to go.</v>

3611
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.560
<v Speaker 4>I think those are just having less stuff and more,</v>

3612
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.660
<v Speaker 4>the more the less you have to focus on,</v>

3613
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.090
<v Speaker 4>the more you can focus on those things,</v>

3614
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:30.411
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3615
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 4>And then free time,</v>

3616
01:35:31.650 --> 01:35:32.483
<v Speaker 4>free free times.</v>

3617
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:34.070
<v Speaker 4>It's giant.</v>

3618
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

3619
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.800
<v Speaker 4>not having to go buy anybody else's schedule.</v>

3620
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:37.251
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3621
01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:41.240
<v Speaker 4>if you want to go out to the salt and sea and go visit that fucking weird guys</v>

3622
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:44.900
<v Speaker 4>hill that he's painted and all these religious symbols and signs and crosses,</v>

3623
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.990
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to just do that.</v>

3624
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.790
<v Speaker 4>But then Whoa,</v>

3625
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 4>stop on that thought because that's what I do for a living.</v>

3626
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.611
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3627
01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 4>But you have to do it with a camera and you have to be with these people and</v>

3628
01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3629
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.390
<v Speaker 4>You're still in the kitchen makeup bird.</v>

3630
01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna to put a microphone on you and you're doing it for 12 hours a day,</v>

3631
01:35:57.411 --> 01:36:00.530
<v Speaker 4>and then you're going out to eat and some strange hotel in Boise with your</v>

3632
01:36:00.531 --> 01:36:01.400
<v Speaker 4>fucking crew.</v>

3633
01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3634
01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:02.600
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3635
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.070
<v Speaker 4>there's great things to that,</v>

3636
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:04.933
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about it.</v>

3637
01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:08.920
<v Speaker 4>But I think that if you ultimately want to do your best stand up,</v>

3638
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:10.610
<v Speaker 4>you probably should do less of it.</v>

3639
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:11.500
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3640
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:11.681
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3641
01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:14.110
<v Speaker 5>life was a big believer in putting what you want in the universe.</v>

3642
01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:14.621
<v Speaker 5>And so like,</v>

3643
01:36:14.621 --> 01:36:15.431
<v Speaker 5>right when she told me that,</v>

3644
01:36:15.431 --> 01:36:15.760
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

3645
01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.110
<v Speaker 5>that might be a Scientology thing,</v>

3646
01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.630
<v Speaker 5>but scientologist,</v>

3647
01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.391
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3648
01:36:19.391 --> 01:36:20.201
<v Speaker 5>but I gotta be honest with you,</v>

3649
01:36:20.201 --> 01:36:21.460
<v Speaker 5>I like a lot of their ideas.</v>

3650
01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big,</v>

3651
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:23.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

3652
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:23.460
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3653
01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:24.293
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3654
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.570
<v Speaker 5>I like all there actually.</v>

3655
01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:26.950
<v Speaker 5>I like all their crazy ideas.</v>

3656
01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:28.930
<v Speaker 5>They're the ones that they really grounded in.</v>

3657
01:36:28.931 --> 01:36:30.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't get like one c runs.</v>

3658
01:36:30.821 --> 01:36:31.690
<v Speaker 5>I do believe in alien.</v>

3659
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:33.640
<v Speaker 5>I do believe in aliens.</v>

3660
01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:34.890
<v Speaker 5>What do you believe what I'm saying?</v>

3661
01:36:34.891 --> 01:36:37.990
<v Speaker 5>I believe in aliens believe there's fucking life forms out there.</v>

3662
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:39.191
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3663
01:36:39.191 --> 01:36:39.911
<v Speaker 5>Things started us,</v>

3664
01:36:39.911 --> 01:36:40.391
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3665
01:36:40.391 --> 01:36:42.550
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if they started as just as much as,</v>

3666
01:36:42.551 --> 01:36:45.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if Jesus really got out and moved to fucking rock and was like,</v>

3667
01:36:45.401 --> 01:36:46.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm bad bitches.</v>

3668
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:47.260
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

3669
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.220
<v Speaker 5>like there's a lot like,</v>

3670
01:36:48.221 --> 01:36:50.980
<v Speaker 5>I like that I hear about Scientology.</v>

3671
01:36:50.981 --> 01:36:51.610
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

3672
01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:51.821
<v Speaker 5>They've,</v>

3673
01:36:51.821 --> 01:36:53.560
<v Speaker 5>there's acting courses they teach in la.</v>

3674
01:36:53.710 --> 01:36:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Every young actor you ever hang out with took it at Scientology acting course.</v>

3675
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:58.540
<v Speaker 5>And it's about accountability.</v>

3676
01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:00.640
<v Speaker 5>A fucking being a better person,</v>

3677
01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3678
01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:02.230
<v Speaker 5>being your authentic self.</v>

3679
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:03.610
<v Speaker 5>It's all Depok jokes</v>

3680
01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:06.130
<v Speaker 4>for shit while I'm in the middle of the reading going clear.</v>

3681
01:37:06.190 --> 01:37:07.270
<v Speaker 4>And when I say in the middle of it,</v>

3682
01:37:07.271 --> 01:37:09.580
<v Speaker 4>I put it down and I won't pick it up for a week or two.</v>

3683
01:37:09.581 --> 01:37:11.950
<v Speaker 4>And then I pick it up for a few days and I'll throw it down again.</v>

3684
01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:12.790
<v Speaker 4>I just can't,</v>

3685
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:16.600
<v Speaker 4>it's so bizarre that I'm worried that I'm going to get infected by this dude's</v>

3686
01:37:16.601 --> 01:37:17.830
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous ideas.</v>

3687
01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:19.650
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] was not,</v>

3688
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:23.980
<v Speaker 5>my dad represented a Scientology through the infancy stages,</v>

3689
01:37:24.190 --> 01:37:25.360
<v Speaker 5>representing them as a lawyer,</v>

3690
01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:26.470
<v Speaker 5>one of their head lawyers.</v>

3691

<v Speaker 5>my dad is not like that at all.</v>

3698

3725
01:38:09.010 --> 01:38:10.660
<v Speaker 7>the one story is that my dad had told my mom,</v>

3726
01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:14.020
<v Speaker 7>don't fucking talk to anybody because you will get convinced that Shit's real.</v>

3727
01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:16.453
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:31.400

3735
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:32.061
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3736
01:38:32.061 --> 01:38:32.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3737
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.961

01:38:32.961 --> 01:38:34.970
<v Speaker 4>cause she wanted me to go to her acting class.</v>

3739
01:38:34.971 --> 01:38:37.610
<v Speaker 4>She was burrowed it all are you on be at this time?</v>

3740
01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:38.510
<v Speaker 4>He did so much tension.</v>

3741
01:38:38.511 --> 01:38:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3742
01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:39.603
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

3743
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:40.250
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3744
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:42.430
<v Speaker 4>she needed so much attention that was so ridiculous.</v>

3745
01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.340
<v Speaker 4>She wanted to watch,</v>

3746
01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:45.710
<v Speaker 4>she wanted you to watch her rehearse,</v>

3747
01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.650
<v Speaker 4>like for her thing in an acting class.</v>

3748
01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:52.820
<v Speaker 4>And she made me come to her acting class once when they did this thing called</v>

3749
01:38:52.821 --> 01:38:54.020
<v Speaker 4>private moments.</v>

3750
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:55.820
<v Speaker 4>And this is what private moments are,</v>

3751
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:57.680
<v Speaker 4>what a private moment is.</v>

3752
01:38:57.890 --> 01:39:02.390
<v Speaker 4>You would go onstage and you would just do stuff like they had like a little</v>

3753
01:39:02.391 --> 01:39:02.990
<v Speaker 4>set,</v>

3754
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:05.990
<v Speaker 4>so they had like a bed and they had some books and they had like a little fake</v>

3755
01:39:05.991 --> 01:39:10.880
<v Speaker 4>kitchen area and you would just go on stage and pretend that you were just</v>

3756
01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.560
<v Speaker 4>hanging out by herself.</v>

3757
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe reading a book.</v>

3758
01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:15.063
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3759
01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 4>and I remember sitting there sucking this all for,</v>

3760
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.971
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3761
01:39:19.971 --> 01:39:21.020
<v Speaker 4>the relationship was a joke.</v>

3762
01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.270
<v Speaker 4>It was a disaster from jump,</v>

3763
01:39:23.271 --> 01:39:23.991
<v Speaker 4>but she was hot.</v>

3764
01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:24.824
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>

3765
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:28.430
<v Speaker 4>But watching this whole thing go down,</v>

3766
01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:29.121
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3767
01:39:29.121 --> 01:39:29.480
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3768
01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.650
<v Speaker 4>do you understand what's happening here?</v>

3769
01:39:30.970 --> 01:39:31.530
<v Speaker 4>They think this is,</v>

3770
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:32.600
<v Speaker 4>this is not an acting,</v>

3771
01:39:32.630 --> 01:39:34.600
<v Speaker 4>you're not acting like this is an active,</v>

3772
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:37.130
<v Speaker 4>what this is is that they're giving you a little fix.</v>

3773
01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3774
01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.860
<v Speaker 4>You have this desire for attention,</v>

3775
01:39:39.861 --> 01:39:41.630
<v Speaker 4>this overwhelming desire for attention.</v>

3776
01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:42.321
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>

3777
01:39:42.321 --> 01:39:42.621
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3778
01:39:42.621 --> 01:39:43.151
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3779
01:39:43.151 --> 01:39:44.300
<v Speaker 4>How do you think for you to prepare?</v>

3780
01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.730
<v Speaker 4>But you can be the person on stage for the next 10 minutes.</v>

3781
01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's going to look at you.</v>

3782
01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3783
01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.340
<v Speaker 4>That's killing me 15 minutes with people,</v>

3784
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:52.300
<v Speaker 4>all my God thumb.</v>

3785
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:53.390
<v Speaker 4>And that was okay.</v>

3786
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3787
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:55.280
<v Speaker 4>what were you doing with the book there?</v>

3788
01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:56.690
<v Speaker 4>Is that how you normally would read a book?</v>

3789
01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:57.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3790
01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.640
<v Speaker 4>what I read,</v>

3791
01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I like to eat things that are implied and so like that,</v>

3792
01:40:01.811 --> 01:40:06.110
<v Speaker 4>like it was like they would go over the public moment or the private moment</v>

3793
01:40:06.111 --> 01:40:07.040
<v Speaker 4>rather with,</v>

3794
01:40:07.041 --> 01:40:07.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3795
01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:07.660
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3796
01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:08.630
<v Speaker 4>the various actors.</v>

3797
01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:12.380
<v Speaker 4>And I would love to sit there and listen to the things that they would say.</v>

3798
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:13.450
<v Speaker 4>And they're PR I only made,</v>

3799
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:14.360
<v Speaker 4>it's like two of them,</v>

3800
01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.190
<v Speaker 4>two classes where I was like,</v>

3801
01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this.</v>

3802
01:40:17.271 --> 01:40:18.040
<v Speaker 4>And all eyes.</v>

3803
01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.160
<v Speaker 7>That could be a TV show on comedy central if you just did that with comics,</v>

3804
01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:22.420
<v Speaker 7>five comics,</v>

3805
01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.920
<v Speaker 7>Jim Norton's tribe private moments.</v>

3806
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:28.030
<v Speaker 7>And it's just five minutes of gym in a room just watching him fucking do gym.</v>

3807
01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.890
<v Speaker 7>You're see that show Nathan for you?</v>

3808
01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.000
<v Speaker 7>It's one of the,</v>

3809
01:40:31.001 --> 01:40:32.230
<v Speaker 7>I think one of my favorite shows.</v>

3810
01:40:32.231 --> 01:40:32.920
<v Speaker 7>That song.</v>

3811
01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.400
<v Speaker 7>It's a,</v>

3812
01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:34.900
<v Speaker 7>it's this comedian Nathan,</v>

3813
01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:37.610
<v Speaker 7>and he gets hired to like,</v>

3814
01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:42.760
<v Speaker 7>like go to these small businesses and help their business by using weird ways</v>

3815
01:40:42.761 --> 01:40:42.941
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3816
01:40:42.941 --> 01:40:44.350
<v Speaker 7>like as an example,</v>

3817
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:44.651
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3818
01:40:44.651 --> 01:40:46.270
<v Speaker 7>this bar ever since,</v>

3819
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.810
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3820
01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:47.770
<v Speaker 7>smoking became,</v>

3821
01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.300
<v Speaker 7>I got interrupted for right now.</v>

3822
01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:52.630
<v Speaker 7>It's totally sounds like comedy central's buying ad space through Brian.</v>

3823
01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 7>He's</v>

3824
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:54.560
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3825
01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.360
<v Speaker 5>does anyone see where you all companies?</v>

3826
01:40:56.730 --> 01:40:57.900
<v Speaker 7>So like as an example,</v>

3827
01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.280
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3828
01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.530
<v Speaker 7>bars can't have smoking in them and they're saying that they've lost a lot of</v>

3829
01:41:01.531 --> 01:41:03.150
<v Speaker 7>money since that's happened.</v>

3830
01:41:03.151 --> 01:41:03.990
<v Speaker 7>A lot of smokers,</v>

3831
01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:04.291
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3832
01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:05.600
<v Speaker 7>want to smoke in the bar,</v>

3833
01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:05.791
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

3834
01:41:05.791 --> 01:41:05.911
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

3835
01:41:05.911 --> 01:41:06.420
<v Speaker 7>blah.</v>

3836
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:10.260
<v Speaker 7>So he found a loophole where you can make it a theater,</v>

3837
01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:11.760
<v Speaker 7>like a bar being a theater.</v>

3838
01:41:11.761 --> 01:41:13.110
<v Speaker 7>So he put up two seats,</v>

3839
01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.710
<v Speaker 7>sold like tickets so that you would sit down on these cds and just sit there and</v>

3840
01:41:16.711 --> 01:41:18.180
<v Speaker 7>watch a bar for an hour.</v>

3841
01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.440
<v Speaker 7>That giving the bar,</v>

3842
01:41:19.441 --> 01:41:22.320
<v Speaker 7>being able to smoke cigarettes as if there were a play.</v>

3843
01:41:22.590 --> 01:41:23.580
<v Speaker 7>And it's just interesting.</v>

3844
01:41:23.581 --> 01:41:23.801
<v Speaker 7>Like I,</v>

3845
01:41:23.801 --> 01:41:26.130
<v Speaker 7>we hacks normal everyday things.</v>

01:41:39.361 --> 01:41:42.620
<v Speaker 7>He could sell coffee because he was using a parody law and he does this like</v>

3922
01:42:57.551 --> 01:42:58.330
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:10.023
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3929
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:12.940
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't like it that they pull stuff off of youtube.</v>

3930
01:43:12.941 --> 01:43:13.600
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

3931
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:13.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3932
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:14.703
<v Speaker 5>I love you already.</v>

3933
01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:16.420
<v Speaker 5>This would already said I love you already.</v>

3934
01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you said,</v>

3935
01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:21.010
<v Speaker 5>Kj fucking we both agree with this.</v>

3936
01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.173
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3937
01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:23.090
<v Speaker 5>you never will.</v>

3938
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Look fucking people find content is where you find content.</v>

3939
01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.840
<v Speaker 5>If content drives you to traditional media,</v>

3940
01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 5>then so be it.</v>

3941
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:32.440
<v Speaker 5>That's how this fucking business works.</v>

3942
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:35.170
<v Speaker 5>We push it on youtube because that's where people are finding content.</v>

3943
01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:36.070
<v Speaker 5>And then you put it,</v>

3944
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:39.610
<v Speaker 5>I put five minutes of a show on youtube and you like it and you go,</v>

3945
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:40.960
<v Speaker 5>I kind of want to watch my show.</v>

3946
01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.153
<v Speaker 5>And then you go there.</v>

3947
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.810
<v Speaker 5>Like when I look at at trailers,</v>

3948
01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:48.070
<v Speaker 5>I watched trailers for movies that I will see inside movie theaters on Youtube</v>

3949
01:43:48.071 --> 01:43:48.940
<v Speaker 5>and an on apple movies.</v>

3950
01:43:48.941 --> 01:43:49.600
<v Speaker 5>That's why I go,</v>

3951
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.290
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3952
01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.630
<v Speaker 5>And so comedy central and,</v>

3953
01:43:52.631 --> 01:43:52.841
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3954
01:43:52.841 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 5>and travels guilty of this as well.</v>

3955
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:55.270
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes</v>

3956
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:56.530
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to get the ad,</v>

3957
01:43:56.770 --> 01:43:58.420
<v Speaker 6>they try to get all the traffic to their web.</v>

3958
01:43:58.710 --> 01:44:03.270
<v Speaker 5>It's the older people in the company that don't technically get how people are</v>

3959
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:06.930
<v Speaker 5>using their content and finding their content and,</v>

3960
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.351
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3961
01:44:07.351 --> 01:44:07.830
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3962
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:09.090
<v Speaker 5>and enjoying their content.</v>

3963
01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.320
<v Speaker 5>I know how I enjoy mine.</v>

3964
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.580
<v Speaker 5>I sit online and a fucking watch it on youtube and I go through youtube and I go</v>

3965
01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:16.350
<v Speaker 5>into a spiral and next thing you know,</v>

3966
01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching butterflies getting extracted out of a guy's back.</v>

3967
01:44:19.230 --> 01:44:20.520
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm looking at ear cleaning,</v>

3968
01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:21.960
<v Speaker 5>now I'm watching opion gym.</v>

3969
01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:23.340
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how it goes.</v>

3970
01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:26.110
<v Speaker 5>But no one that's like [inaudible],</v>

3971
01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:28.860
<v Speaker 5>my wife is 45 shouldn't use fucking youtube.</v>

3972
01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.720
<v Speaker 5>She's never used youtube in her life.</v>

3973
01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:33.180
<v Speaker 5>She tried to find a video the other day.</v>

3974
01:44:33.181 --> 01:44:33.481
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

3975
01:44:33.481 --> 01:44:34.231
<v Speaker 5>it's on Facebook.</v>

01:44:34.231 --> 01:44:34.411
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3977
01:44:34.411 --> 01:44:34.561
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3978
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:36.690
<v Speaker 5>Google the things you remember from it,</v>

3979
01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:39.660
<v Speaker 5>Google that and those are the codes keywords and you'll find it.</v>

3980
01:44:39.661 --> 01:44:39.901
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

3981
01:44:39.901 --> 01:44:40.051
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3982
01:44:40.051 --> 01:44:40.950
<v Speaker 5>it's not on Google.</v>

3983
01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.000
<v Speaker 5>It's on Facebook,</v>

3984
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 5>but that's who's that?</v>

3985
01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.670
<v Speaker 5>She's running comedy central,</v>

3986
01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.653
<v Speaker 5>so when they go,</v>

3987
01:44:45.690 --> 01:44:50.100
<v Speaker 5>we don't want any of our content on youtube because it's a bunch of ad sales</v>

3988
01:44:50.101 --> 01:44:51.420
<v Speaker 5>dollars that we're missing out on.</v>

3989
01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.180
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're accurate in some extent,</v>

3990
01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:54.810
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3991
01:44:54.810 --> 01:44:55.890
<v Speaker 5>I would argue that</v>

3992
01:44:57.450 --> 01:45:01.590
<v Speaker 5>300,000 people watching me talk about fighting a bear on Ari's.</v>

3993
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:02.400
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>

3994
01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:04.800
<v Speaker 5>this is not happening now on youtube.</v>

3995
01:45:05.610 --> 01:45:09.570
<v Speaker 5>I would venture to say not one person woke up that morning after they saw that</v>

3996
01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.420
<v Speaker 5>and went to comedy central.com and then said,</v>

3997
01:45:12.421 --> 01:45:12.601
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3998
01:45:12.601 --> 01:45:13.291
<v Speaker 5>check this out.</v>

3999
01:45:13.291 --> 01:45:13.561
<v Speaker 5>Swipe,</v>

4000
01:45:13.561 --> 01:45:13.801
<v Speaker 5>swipe,</v>

4001
01:45:13.801 --> 01:45:14.550
<v Speaker 5>swipe.</v>

4002
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:15.383
<v Speaker 5>This is Bert.</v>

4003
01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:16.373
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to go there.</v>

4004
01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:20.080
<v Speaker 6>Did they understand that you can get money from Youtube ads?</v>

4005
01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:23.110
<v Speaker 6>They just need to control their own youtube channels and then they could have it</v>

4006
01:45:23.111 --> 01:45:26.410
<v Speaker 6>on youtube and it would be on the comedy central channel on Youtube and put all</v>

4007
01:45:26.411 --> 01:45:29.140
<v Speaker 6>their stuff up there and they would make plenty of money and I don't think it</v>

4008
01:45:29.141 --> 01:45:31.120
<v Speaker 6>would cost them shit because no one's paying for anything,</v>

4009
01:45:31.121 --> 01:45:31.780
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4010
01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:35.000
<v Speaker 6>No one's paying for anything and not going to pay for shows unless it's on apple</v>

4011
01:45:35.001 --> 01:45:38.200
<v Speaker 6>TV and you can just buy the whole season like game of Thrones or something like</v>

4012
01:45:38.201 --> 01:45:39.011
<v Speaker 6>that and watch it.</v>

4013
01:45:39.011 --> 01:45:40.840
<v Speaker 6>Or like a show like walking dead.</v>

4014
01:45:40.841 --> 01:45:44.140
<v Speaker 6>I pay for the walking dead so I don't have to watch those fucking commercials</v>

4015
01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:47.860
<v Speaker 6>because I've made the mistake of recording it on live TV and then trying to</v>

4016
01:45:47.861 --> 01:45:50.290
<v Speaker 6>watch it when I had been used to watching it on an apple TV.</v>

4017
01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.400
<v Speaker 6>It's unwatchable.</v>

4018
01:45:51.730 --> 01:45:53.530
<v Speaker 6>The fucking commercials are brutal.</v>

4019
01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:58.720
<v Speaker 6>Anytime something happens to fade to black and a fucking dancing tied box comes</v>

4020
01:45:58.721 --> 01:46:00.970
<v Speaker 6>on the screen and it's horrible.</v>

4021
01:46:00.971 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 6>It's awful.</v>

4022
01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 5>Who's no commercial option is awesome by the way.</v>

4023
01:46:04.301 --> 01:46:05.350
<v Speaker 5>It's like an extra five.</v>

4024
01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:05.831
<v Speaker 5>Another thing,</v>

4025
01:46:05.831 --> 01:46:09.730
<v Speaker 5>Brian's being paid for comedy central sponsored by Hulu.</v>

4026
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:13.480
<v Speaker 6>Some,</v>

4027
01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.080
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4028
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.100
<v Speaker 6>it's a new era and I think you're right that a lot of people need to understand</v>

4029
01:46:18.101 --> 01:46:19.840
<v Speaker 6>that having things on youtube,</v>

4030
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:21.460
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't take money away from you.</v>

4031
01:46:21.461 --> 01:46:22.480
<v Speaker 6>It makes your show bigger.</v>

4032
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.470
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4033
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:25.570
<v Speaker 6>the more Ari has his content on Youtube,</v>

4034
01:46:25.571 --> 01:46:27.550
<v Speaker 6>the more it's going to make that show bigger than more comedy.</v>

4035
01:46:27.551 --> 01:46:28.780
<v Speaker 6>Central's going to get more viewers,</v>

4036
01:46:28.781 --> 01:46:31.630
<v Speaker 6>the more ad dollars are going to make is not taking any money away from them.</v>

4037
01:46:31.631 --> 01:46:32.530
<v Speaker 6>It's making it bigger.</v>

4038
01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:33.850
<v Speaker 6>It's just gonna make a show bigger</v>

4039
01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:34.820
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

4040
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:35.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4041
01:46:35.081 --> 01:46:35.914
<v Speaker 5>think about,</v>

4042
01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:37.690
<v Speaker 5>think about we,</v>

4043
01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:39.970
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about this and touch on this at certain times,</v>

4044
01:46:39.971 --> 01:46:41.860
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that we have free content out there,</v>

4045
01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.470
<v Speaker 5>the fact that I fucking three,</v>

4046
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:48.490
<v Speaker 5>four years ago told a story on your podcast that changed the scope of my career</v>

4047
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 5>and I never make any money off that.</v>

4048
01:46:50.371 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't make any money off of the guys that have posted it.</v>

4049
01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4050
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:54.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>

4051
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:55.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4052
01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 5>you'd think I look at become my minions.</v>

4053
01:46:57.391 --> 01:46:58.021
<v Speaker 5>Is the guy's name.</v>

4054
01:46:58.021 --> 01:46:59.010
<v Speaker 5>Do you think I looked at him and go,</v>

4055
01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:00.570
<v Speaker 5>go man,</v>

4056
01:47:00.571 --> 01:47:01.860
<v Speaker 5>he's making an ad dollars on this.</v>

4057
01:47:01.861 --> 01:47:03.460
<v Speaker 5>That guy was created enough to create a car,</v>

4058
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.960
<v Speaker 5>a car,</v>

4059
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4060
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 5>a comic and add it to the story and it got me people to come to my shows.</v>

4061
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.680
<v Speaker 5>That's all I give a fuck about.</v>

4062
01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4063
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 5>it's free content,</v>

4064
01:47:11.161 --> 01:47:11.250
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4065
01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:12.230
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm doing the vlogs.</v>

4066
01:47:12.231 --> 01:47:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Just think about like comedy central,</v>

4067
01:47:14.311 --> 01:47:17.490
<v Speaker 5>how much money they spend on advertising on billboards.</v>

4068
01:47:17.491 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 5>They had that giant billboard above sunset,</v>

4069
01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.060
<v Speaker 5>that billboard above sunset,</v>

4070
01:47:21.061 --> 01:47:21.930
<v Speaker 5>above pink dot.</v>

4071
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:27.090
<v Speaker 5>Didn't get nearly as many people to listen or watched our show as a youtube</v>

4072
01:47:27.091 --> 01:47:28.800
<v Speaker 5>video would don't even close.</v>

4073
01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:33.180
<v Speaker 5>Here's what he's doing right now with the storytelling is so fucking smart.</v>

4074
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.141
<v Speaker 5>It's so smart.</v>

4075
01:47:34.141 --> 01:47:34.381
<v Speaker 5>I've tried,</v>

4076
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.030
<v Speaker 5>I've sold this to two people,</v>

4077
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:36.340
<v Speaker 5>mom,</v>

4078
01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.141
<v Speaker 5>puppet by more than that.</v>

4079
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:38.670
<v Speaker 5>But definitely to Orient Tommy.</v>

4080
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:41.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm jealous in the most happy way for them.</v>

4081
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:44.220
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm so happy that they did what they wanted to do.</v>

4082
01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:47.070
<v Speaker 5>But that's what's interesting to me is cause you're very successful right now.</v>

4083
01:47:47.071 --> 01:47:50.820
<v Speaker 5>But it seems like you look at what they're doing and it looks like more fun to</v>

4084
01:47:50.821 --> 01:47:51.750
<v Speaker 5>you than what you're doing,</v>

4085
01:47:51.751 --> 01:47:55.230
<v Speaker 5>or it looks like something more attractive to you than what you're doing.</v>

4086
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.053
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4087
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:58.950
<v Speaker 5>that's why you're saying you're jealous.</v>

4088
01:47:59.010 --> 01:47:59.551
<v Speaker 5>I am jealous.</v>

4089
01:47:59.551 --> 01:48:00.301
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely jealous.</v>

4090
01:48:00.301 --> 01:48:00.501
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

4091
01:48:00.501 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

4092
01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.110
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>

4093
01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:03.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't want people to associate that with not a bad thing.</v>

4094
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.511
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4095
01:48:03.511 --> 01:48:03.931
<v Speaker 5>you're not.</v>

4096
01:48:03.931 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 5>You're not a petty guy.</v>

4097
01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.420
<v Speaker 5>It's like you said one time you saw Dave Chappelle ad at the comedy store</v>

4098
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:09.360
<v Speaker 5>working out and you got,</v>

4099
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.781
<v Speaker 5>you got,</v>

4100
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:10.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you said jealous,</v>

4101
01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 5>but you said you got envious of his,</v>

4102
01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 5>of like how great he was and you went home and wrote,</v>

4103
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.541
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4104
01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:18.630
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's inspired would be the term that I would use.</v>

4105
01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:19.240
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4106
01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was a envious thing,</v>

4107
01:48:20.581 --> 01:48:21.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's certainly like,</v>

4108
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.140
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4109
01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:22.471
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

4110
01:48:22.471 --> 01:48:22.741
<v Speaker 5>Tammy,</v>

4111
01:48:22.741 --> 01:48:24.240
<v Speaker 5>so good and you want to run home.</v>

4112
01:48:24.241 --> 01:48:26.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't like anybody can get envious.</v>

4113
01:48:26.581 --> 01:48:28.680
<v Speaker 5>We all can fall prey to that.</v>

4114
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm broad stroke and then I don't let it in.</v>

4115
01:48:31.141 --> 01:48:31.680
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

4116
01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.430
<v Speaker 5>I know what it is.</v>

4117
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:33.031
<v Speaker 5>I feel it.</v>

4118
01:48:33.031 --> 01:48:33.864
<v Speaker 5>I don't let it in.</v>

4119
01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I recognized turn it the other way.</v>

4120
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.941
<v Speaker 5>I don't get it.</v>

4121
01:48:35.941 --> 01:48:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't like sit and go,</v>

4122
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.231
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

4123
01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:37.831
<v Speaker 5>I fucking want that.</v>

4124
01:48:37.831 --> 01:48:38.371
<v Speaker 5>That's jealousy.</v>

4125
01:48:38.371 --> 01:48:39.130
<v Speaker 5>That's envy.</v>

4126
01:48:39.130 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 5>But I recognize that feeling.</v>

4127
01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:41.820
<v Speaker 5>I recognize that feeling of like,</v>

4128
01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:44.640
<v Speaker 5>but we've all seen people that do get that jealous,</v>

4134
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.940
<v Speaker 5>But I don't get that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>whatever it was.</v>

4149
01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:05.544
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what it was,</v>

4150
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.390
<v Speaker 5>but it was great.</v>

4156
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:20.310
<v Speaker 5>Not like big J.</v>

4157
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:24.180
<v Speaker 5>Big j can do it for a living for the rest of his life and never write material.</v>

4158
01:49:24.181 --> 01:49:25.290
<v Speaker 5>He's that fucking good.</v>

4159
01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:28.200
<v Speaker 5>He does it all the time to use Joe.</v>

4160
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:28.921
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

4161
01:49:28.921 --> 01:49:30.270
<v Speaker 5>watch big J do crowd work</v>

4162
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:32.670
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>

4163
01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:33.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you,</v>

4164
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:34.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how you do it the way I do,</v>

4165
01:49:34.441 --> 01:49:35.500
<v Speaker 5>but like I go to Kroger corn,</v>

4166
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.353
<v Speaker 5>I want to do it.</v>

4167
01:49:36.450 --> 01:49:37.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't just do it all the time.</v>

4168
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:38.520
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4169
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:38.731
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

4170
01:49:38.731 --> 01:49:40.590
<v Speaker 5>he fucking destroyed.</v>

4171
01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:41.510
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

4172
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:43.020
<v Speaker 5>and I literally looked at him and I was like,</v>

4173
01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.360
<v Speaker 5>I was so enviously proud of him.</v>

4174
01:49:45.361 --> 01:49:46.200
<v Speaker 5>Like going big.</v>

4175
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:46.840
<v Speaker 5>You made you,</v>

4176
01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 5>you told your own show.</v>

4177
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 5>You're doing just what I already did,</v>

4178
01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 5>but we crowd work what your thing is.</v>

4179
01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:53.440
<v Speaker 5>And I look at those guys and you're right.</v>

4180
01:49:53.441 --> 01:49:54.940
<v Speaker 5>I think I do look at them and think,</v>

4181
01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:55.720
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4182
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.460
<v Speaker 5>I know Ari's of different beast.</v>

4183
01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.690
<v Speaker 5>He answers to nobody.</v>

4184
01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:01.450
<v Speaker 5>He wants to do his own fucking thing to take a year off from standup.</v>

4185
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.931
<v Speaker 5>He'll do it.</v>

4186
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:02.764
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give a fuck.</v>

4187
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:05.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm envious of that and that in that like</v>

4188
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:09.790
<v Speaker 5>it's good.</v>

4189
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:10.830
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of beef.</v>

4190
01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 5>It's got to feel really good to be untethered.</v>

4191
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4192
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:13.510
<v Speaker 5>Like to,</v>

4193
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:14.343
<v Speaker 5>to be like,</v>

4194
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:15.460
<v Speaker 5>you know what man,</v>

4195
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.480
<v Speaker 5>I got no fears.</v>

4196
01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Not to say I,</v>

4197
01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:18.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4198
01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:19.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking filled with fears.</v>

4199
01:50:19.331 --> 01:50:20.164
<v Speaker 5>Everyone knows that.</v>

4200
01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:22.030
<v Speaker 5>But like I've got no fears,</v>

4201
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:22.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4202
01:50:22.610 --> 01:50:23.443
<v Speaker 5>do my thing.</v>

4203
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:23.670
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4204
01:50:23.670 --> 01:50:24.250
<v Speaker 5>I'll uh,</v>

4205
01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:24.820
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4206
01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:25.653
<v Speaker 5>and like I remember right,</v>

4207
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:28.300
<v Speaker 5>like we were having a conversation about notes,</v>

4208
01:50:28.301 --> 01:50:32.100
<v Speaker 5>comedy central's given and Ari's take was well the wrong,</v>

4209
01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:36.070
<v Speaker 5>but just so impervious to critique the wrong,</v>

4210
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:37.023
<v Speaker 5>I know what I'm doing,</v>

4211
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:40.210
<v Speaker 5>but just almost like Winston Churchill like walking down the street</v>

4212
01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.670
<v Speaker 6>problem when you have a vision for a show,</v>

4213
01:50:42.930 --> 01:50:45.760
<v Speaker 6>then a bunch of people come along and they have their own vision and they tried</v>

4214
01:50:45.761 --> 01:50:49.210
<v Speaker 6>to get the greasy little fingers on your vision and change it and add their</v>

4215
01:50:49.211 --> 01:50:50.830
<v Speaker 6>little TJ's to the fucking soup.</v>

4216
01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:51.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4217
01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.130
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4218
01:50:52.130 --> 01:50:52.591
<v Speaker 5>and I told him,</v>

4219
01:50:52.591 --> 01:50:53.160
<v Speaker 5>I told him,</v>

4220
01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.550
<v Speaker 5>I told him my notes did I just gotten from the network from comedy central.</v>

4221
01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4222
01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:57.660
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

4223
01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:58.493
<v Speaker 5>don't do it.</v>

4224
01:50:58.690 --> 01:50:59.730
<v Speaker 5>But it was like I felt like going,</v>

4225
01:50:59.850 --> 01:51:00.000
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

4226
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.090
<v Speaker 6>no good to do something that's your,</v>

4227
01:51:02.130 --> 01:51:06.090
<v Speaker 6>you collaborate creatively when you do one of those things with people that</v>

4228
01:51:06.091 --> 01:51:06.960
<v Speaker 6>aren't creative.</v>

4229
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.340
<v Speaker 6>Like they might be creative but they're not stand up comics.</v>

4230
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:13.890
<v Speaker 6>So if they're telling a standup comic,</v>

4231
01:51:13.891 --> 01:51:16.590
<v Speaker 6>like you have a vision of what you want it to be and they're telling you that</v>

4232
01:51:16.591 --> 01:51:17.071
<v Speaker 6>you're wrong,</v>

4233
01:51:17.071 --> 01:51:18.090
<v Speaker 6>you should do it a different way,</v>

4234
01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.710
<v Speaker 6>that's going to be a disaster.</v>

4235
01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:22.810
<v Speaker 6>Every time I experienced that on the man show we,</v>

4236
01:51:22.890 --> 01:51:27.890
<v Speaker 6>we got in the most fucking insane arguments over nonsense where Doug would come</v>

4237
01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.290
<v Speaker 6>into the room pulling his hair and you'd be like,</v>

4238
01:51:31.291 --> 01:51:34.020
<v Speaker 6>I can't fucking believe this is something we're arguing over.</v>

4239
01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:34.741
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4240
01:51:34.741 --> 01:51:35.461
<v Speaker 6>and I would go,</v>

4241
01:51:35.461 --> 01:51:36.211
<v Speaker 6>what are they saying?</v>

4242
01:51:36.211 --> 01:51:37.230
<v Speaker 6>And he would tell me what they were saying.</v>

4243
01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:38.610
<v Speaker 6>Well that can't be real.</v>

4244
01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:39.480
<v Speaker 6>That's really what it is.</v>

4245
01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:39.991
<v Speaker 6>One of them,</v>

4246
01:51:39.991 --> 01:51:40.950
<v Speaker 6>I think I've told this before,</v>

4247
01:51:40.951 --> 01:51:43.470
<v Speaker 6>but we had a game show called make me hard.</v>

4248
01:51:44.050 --> 01:51:45.600
<v Speaker 6>We'd have a bunch of different things happen.</v>

4249
01:51:45.601 --> 01:51:48.390
<v Speaker 6>The guy had a box over his dick with a light would go on when he got a boner.</v>

4250
01:51:48.391 --> 01:51:49.420
<v Speaker 6>So we'd have like midgets eaten.</v>

4251
01:51:49.421 --> 01:51:50.071
<v Speaker 6>Banana is Ding,</v>

4252
01:51:50.071 --> 01:51:50.221
<v Speaker 6>Ding,</v>

4253
01:51:50.221 --> 01:51:50.431
<v Speaker 6>Ding.</v>

4254
01:51:50.431 --> 01:51:50.611
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4255
01:51:50.611 --> 01:51:51.391
<v Speaker 6>it's really stupid.</v>

4256
01:51:51.391 --> 01:51:52.590
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

4257
01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:53.370
<v Speaker 6>they didn't,</v>

4258
01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:54.570
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't let us use hard.</v>

4259
01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.830
<v Speaker 6>We had to call it stiff,</v>

4260
01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:57.570
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4261
01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.710
<v Speaker 6>crying argument,</v>

4262
01:51:58.740 --> 01:51:59.573
<v Speaker 6>like crying.</v>

4263
01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:00.240
<v Speaker 6>Like it's,</v>

4264
01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:00.450
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4265
01:52:00.450 --> 01:52:01.560
<v Speaker 6>it's gone too far.</v>

4266
01:52:01.561 --> 01:52:02.394
<v Speaker 6>Like what,</v>

4267
01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:03.840
<v Speaker 6>what is this?</v>

4268
01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:04.681
<v Speaker 6>When Joey Diaz,</v>

4269
01:52:04.681 --> 01:52:08.700
<v Speaker 6>we had Joey Diaz introduce us and Joey Diaz came out naked with timberlands on</v>

4270
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:10.140
<v Speaker 6>let's get this party started.</v>

4271

4272
01:52:11.611 --> 01:52:12.444
<v Speaker 6>That's what we wanted to do.</v>

4274
01:52:15.031 --> 01:52:16.620
<v Speaker 6>female executives crying.</v>

01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:54.254
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

4308

<v Speaker 3>you don't think it's funny.</v>

4312
01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.800
<v Speaker 3>You want everything to be all clever.</v>

4313
01:53:00.801 --> 01:53:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Like it would work really great at the UCB and everybody would golf clap.</v>

4314
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>

4315
01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:11.080
<v Speaker 3>You want props for putting together a really smart and diverse show.</v>

4316
01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not what we're here to do.</v>

4317
01:53:13.221 --> 01:53:16.910
<v Speaker 3>We're here to just make the shit that we think is going to be the funniest.</v>

4318
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:18.440
<v Speaker 3>And we can't do that with you.</v>

4319
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 3>You're an albatross,</v>

4320
01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.140
<v Speaker 3>you're a bundle of wood,</v>

4321
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:22.040
<v Speaker 3>you're a burden.</v>

4322
01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:22.873
<v Speaker 3>Some woman,</v>

4323
01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:25.291
<v Speaker 3>that's a burden.</v>

4324
01:53:25.291 --> 01:53:26.124
<v Speaker 3>Some woman,</v>

4325
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:28.700
<v Speaker 3>100% and it didn't,</v>

4326
01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:29.990
<v Speaker 3>it just so happened that she was a woman.</v>

4327
01:53:29.991 --> 01:53:30.920
<v Speaker 3>It was a guy that was crying.</v>

4328
01:53:30.921 --> 01:53:31.754
<v Speaker 3>I would smack him.</v>

4329
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

4330
01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:35.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4331
01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:36.231
<v Speaker 3>the I think,</v>

4332
01:53:36.231 --> 01:53:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

4333
01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4334
01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.060
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

4335
01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:42.980
<v Speaker 3>That's why the youtube option is the best option or an online option is the best</v>

4336
01:53:42.981 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>

4337
01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:47.000
<v Speaker 3>That's why podcasts are so superior,</v>

4338
01:53:47.001 --> 01:53:50.300
<v Speaker 3>a form of expression than anything you're ever going to find on network</v>

4339
01:53:50.301 --> 01:53:53.450
<v Speaker 3>television because whether it's good or whether it's bad,</v>

4340
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 3>it's ultimately all coming from you.</v>

4341
01:53:55.311 --> 01:53:56.180
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

4342
01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:56.630

<v Speaker 4>Oh it's Kramer.</v>

4417
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:01.920
<v Speaker 4>You know what somebody did the other day,</v>

4418
01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:02.970
<v Speaker 4>somebody put out,</v>

4419

4420
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:08.030
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of outtakes from Seinfeld and you got to see like we're [inaudible]</v>

4421
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:08.580
<v Speaker 4>Kramer.</v>

4422
01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh he fucking sizzled.</v>

4423
01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:14.130
<v Speaker 4>If anyone was like laughing,</v>

4424
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:15.083
<v Speaker 4>he would be like,</v>

4425
01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.313
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

4426
01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.240
<v Speaker 4>He was a hated working on news radio,</v>

4427
01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.261
<v Speaker 4>news radio.</v>

4428
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:20.041
<v Speaker 4>We fucking like,</v>

4429
01:56:20.041 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I did a scene with Andy Dick where I think we probably broke like 10 times.</v>

4430
01:56:24.661 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 4>It was there like 10 times to get through it because Andy was so funny.</v>

4431
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Like we do the things I would,</v>

4432
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:30.870
<v Speaker 4>I would bite myself,</v>

4433
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:33.390
<v Speaker 4>I'd bite the inside of my mouth to get to hurt.</v>

4434
01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.530
<v Speaker 4>So I wouldn't laugh.</v>

4435
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 4>I would do all sorts of different things so that I wouldn't crack up.</v>

4436
01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:38.290
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>

4437
01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:38.670
<v Speaker 4>you're going to,</v>

4438
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 4>if it's a funny show,</v>

4439
01:56:39.650 --> 01:56:40.170
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

4440
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:41.003
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna Laugh.</v>

4441
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I could've never done news radio.</v>

4442
01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I was watching the videos.</v>

4443
01:56:43.181 --> 01:56:45.090
<v Speaker 4>It's looked like he didn't give a fuck about the scene.</v>

4444
01:56:45.091 --> 01:56:49.800
<v Speaker 4>He was waiting for his moment and he's waiting for his time to come in and shine</v>

4445
01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:51.270
<v Speaker 4>and he didn't care that,</v>

4446
01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4447
01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 4>with Julia Louise Dreyfus and Jerry Seinfeld for laughing,</v>

4448
01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:57.120
<v Speaker 4>they're all laughing and yucking it up.</v>

4449
01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:58.410
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to be a part of that.</v>

4450
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.060
<v Speaker 4>He just wanted to do his thing.</v>

4451
01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:01.023
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

4452
01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:02.220
<v Speaker 4>If you watch it,</v>

4453
01:57:02.221 --> 01:57:03.910
<v Speaker 4>you watch him just go and like,</v>

4454
01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:05.190
<v Speaker 4>not even joking like,</v>

4455
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:06.000
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4456
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:06.810
<v Speaker 4>stop it.</v>

4457
01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:07.643
<v Speaker 4>Stop it.</v>

4458
01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:09.060
<v Speaker 4>You're ruining this.</v>

4459
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Like he fucking seems like they all had some weird things going on.</v>

4460
01:57:12.631 --> 01:57:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Like George George's wife who died in this show died because they,</v>

4461
01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:16.800
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

4462
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:17.670
<v Speaker 4>he didn't like her,</v>

4463
01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:18.720
<v Speaker 4>like acting with her.</v>

4464
01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:19.261
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4465
01:57:19.261 --> 01:57:20.094
<v Speaker 4>she sucks.</v>

4466
01:57:20.130 --> 01:57:21.150
<v Speaker 4>So they killed her off.</v>

4467
01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:21.720
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

4468
01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4469
01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:24.060
<v Speaker 4>I should have that is possible though,</v>

4470
01:57:24.061 --> 01:57:24.391
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4471
01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:27.310
<v Speaker 4>You could have a husband or a wife on a show and the there are a Goddamn</v>

4472
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:29.190
<v Speaker 4>nightmare and you're stuck with those people.</v>

4473
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.840
<v Speaker 4>That's a five years,</v>

4474
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:31.201
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

4475
01:57:31.201 --> 01:57:32.370
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>

4476
01:57:32.371 --> 01:57:36.720
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who did a sitcom and he had like a girlfriend on a sitcom that</v>

4477
01:57:36.721 --> 01:57:37.270
<v Speaker 4>was supposed to be,</v>

4478
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.711
<v Speaker 4>and he was like,</v>

4479
01:57:37.711 --> 01:57:38.910
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate her.</v>

4480
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Like she's so she's such a cunt,</v>

4481
01:57:41.490 --> 01:57:41.761
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4482
01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:42.870
<v Speaker 4>and he didn't know what to do.</v>

4483
01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Fortunately it didn't last.</v>

4484
01:57:44.071 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>

4485
01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:47.160
<v Speaker 4>they have issues like that and you can,</v>

4486
01:57:47.161 --> 01:57:48.340
<v Speaker 4>you could run into issues like,</v>

4487
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 4>and also people change with success.</v>

4488
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:53.670
<v Speaker 4>Like the show starts getting really good and then they want a lot of money.</v>

4489
01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:54.480
<v Speaker 4>I've heard,</v>

4490
01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:59.070
<v Speaker 4>I've heard those crazy stories of people coming in to renegotiate and plopping</v>

4491
01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 4>their feet up on the executives desks and just letting them know they're the</v>

4492
01:58:02.791 --> 01:58:03.930
<v Speaker 4>center of the show.</v>

4493
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:05.010
<v Speaker 4>I'll never be that guy.</v>

4494
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I know those guys,</v>

4495
01:58:06.241 --> 01:58:06.571
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4496
01:58:06.571 --> 01:58:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy who got his whole show canceled because he said some nasty shit to</v>

4497
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:12.780
<v Speaker 4>an executive that was a woman.</v>

4498
01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:14.660
<v Speaker 4>He literally said the,</v>

4499
01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:14.821
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4500
01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:14.941
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4501
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:16.710
<v Speaker 4>the to paraphrase,</v>

4502
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:17.933
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4503
01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I am the creative genius behind the show and you are a dumb cunt.</v>

4504
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:24.480
<v Speaker 4>That was his words.</v>

4505
01:58:24.570 --> 01:58:25.080
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4506
01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:25.591
<v Speaker 4>And they went,</v>

4507
01:58:25.591 --> 01:58:26.430
<v Speaker 4>that's a wrap.</v>

4508
01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:29.940
<v Speaker 4>They cancel the show the next day and he was only like a few episodes away from</v>

4509
01:58:29.941 --> 01:58:30.774
<v Speaker 4>syndication.</v>

4510
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.550
<v Speaker 4>You'll never see that show in syndication.</v>

4511
01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:33.451
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

4512
01:58:33.451 --> 01:58:35.670
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you after the show's over afterwards over,</v>

4513
01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:36.533
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>

4514
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:37.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to shit on the guy,</v>

4515
01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:40.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's a publicly known that he's,</v>

4516
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:40.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4517
01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:41.603
<v Speaker 4>he's insane.</v>

4518
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:41.990
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

4519
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 6>I think it's also like why did you become an actor in the first place?</v>

4520
01:58:45.761 --> 01:58:48.280
<v Speaker 6>Why did you become a standup for a lot of people's,</v>

4521
01:58:48.281 --> 01:58:53.281
<v Speaker 6>they want validation because they were rejected and they have this hole in their</v>

4522
01:58:53.321 --> 01:58:54.154
<v Speaker 6>soul.</v>

4523
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:56.730
<v Speaker 6>They need to fill up with love and intention and they,</v>

4524
01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 6>they didn't get enough of it when they were developing.</v>

4525
01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 6>So they have this overwhelming mall.</v>

4526
01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:02.591
<v Speaker 6>There's a need,</v>

4527
01:59:02.591 --> 01:59:07.591
<v Speaker 6>there's a gaping volcano that just swallows couches and more and they just need</v>

4528
01:59:08.651 --> 01:59:09.210
<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>

4529
01:59:09.210 --> 01:59:10.630
<v Speaker 6>He can't fill that fucker up.</v>

4530
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:14.860
<v Speaker 6>And then once they get what they always wanted and they're still not happy,</v>

4531
01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:18.010
<v Speaker 6>they don't know what the fuck to do and a lot of them become tyrants.</v>

4532
01:59:18.730 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 5>But here's the problem.</v>

4533
01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:21.123
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I,</v>

4534
01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:26.190
<v Speaker 5>what percentage of that group do you think does that that cause I got a little</v>

4535
01:59:26.411 --> 01:59:28.750
<v Speaker 5>bit of that fucking sink hole.</v>

4536
01:59:29.410 --> 01:59:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm a stand up.</v>

4537
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:32.450
<v Speaker 5>I bloody does goal.</v>

4538
01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.940
<v Speaker 5>That's what gets you into the game.</v>

4539
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:34.960
<v Speaker 5>I have no interest in,</v>

4540
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:36.590
<v Speaker 5>and we were talking about this before you walked in.</v>

4541
01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:38.500
<v Speaker 5>I have no interest in um,</v>

4542
01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:39.990
<v Speaker 5>propaganda or,</v>

4543
01:59:39.991 --> 01:59:41.380
<v Speaker 5>or being famous,</v>

4544
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:43.780
<v Speaker 5>being famous for the sake of being famous.</v>

4545
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:46.180
<v Speaker 5>Although I'll fuck around with the concept of it.</v>

4546
01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:47.193
<v Speaker 5>I have no like,</v>

4547
01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be Kim Kardashian.</v>

4548
01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:49.001
<v Speaker 5>I'd,</v>

4549
01:59:49.001 --> 01:59:50.810
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather be a respected stand up.</v>

4550
01:59:50.890 --> 01:59:54.670
<v Speaker 5>So what's the difference then between that fucking that,</v>

4551
01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:55.401
<v Speaker 5>that sinkhole,</v>

4552
01:59:55.401 --> 01:59:56.770
<v Speaker 5>that sucking in all,</v>

4553
01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:01.780
<v Speaker 5>all of you versus like us guys who I really love the art form.</v>

4554
02:00:01.781 --> 02:00:02.614
<v Speaker 5>I really love</v>

4555
02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:07.310
<v Speaker 6>differences between like Larry David and Kramer,</v>

4556
02:00:07.730 --> 02:00:08.840
<v Speaker 6>like Larry David.</v>

4557
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:09.890
<v Speaker 6>Is it creative,</v>

4558
02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:11.270
<v Speaker 6>brilliant man.</v>

4559
02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:12.260
<v Speaker 6>And he's genius.</v>

4560
02:00:12.261 --> 02:00:14.990
<v Speaker 6>That show curb your enthusiasm is fucking genius.</v>

4561
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:19.700
<v Speaker 6>And it's all him poking fun at himself and finding the best possible comedic</v>

4562
02:00:19.701 --> 02:00:20.660
<v Speaker 6>angle of everything.</v>

4563
02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:21.890
<v Speaker 6>It's hilarious.</v>

4564
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:24.020
<v Speaker 6>He's always the loser in every episode.</v>

4565
02:00:24.021 --> 02:00:24.381
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

4566
02:00:24.381 --> 02:00:24.621
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4567
02:00:24.621 --> 02:00:25.431
<v Speaker 6>it's God damn.</v>

4568
02:00:25.431 --> 02:00:26.270
<v Speaker 6>It's a brilliant,</v>

4569
02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:31.300
<v Speaker 6>brilliant show and he by all accounts is a very level guy like very intelligent</v>

4570
02:00:33.321 --> 02:00:34.011
<v Speaker 6>is not need.</v>

4571
02:00:34.011 --> 02:00:37.730
<v Speaker 6>He just wants to do the best work he can do and brilliant.</v>

4572
02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:38.930
<v Speaker 6>Brilliant.</v>

4573
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:39.920
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely brilliant.</v>

4574
02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.220
<v Speaker 6>That's the difference between a guy like him and a guy like Kramer and my</v>

4575
02:00:43.221 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 6>thoughts on Kramer only from watching him do stand up because I was there.</v>

4576
02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:47.540
<v Speaker 6>It was terrible.</v>

4577
02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:50.030
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't a guy that was into Seinfeld for whatever reason.</v>

4578
02:00:50.031 --> 02:00:50.960
<v Speaker 6>I never watched that show.</v>

4579
02:00:50.961 --> 02:00:54.110
<v Speaker 6>I only watched a couple episodes of it ever and it was a good show.</v>

4580
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:56.780
<v Speaker 6>It's just there was only so many things you can watch,</v>

4581
02:00:56.810 --> 02:01:00.260
<v Speaker 6>you know and you get when you have south park or married with children or</v>

4582
02:01:00.261 --> 02:01:02.630
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is on your plate that you watch a lot of,</v>

4583
02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:04.010
<v Speaker 6>you can only watch so many shows.</v>

4584
02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:04.971
<v Speaker 6>For whatever reason.</v>

4585
02:01:04.971 --> 02:01:06.860
<v Speaker 6>Seinfeld wasn't the show that I watched all the time,</v>

4586
02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.860
<v Speaker 6>although the ones that I did watch were always really hilarious,</v>

4587
02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.990
<v Speaker 6>but I got to see him do standup at the store and he was fucking awful.</v>

4588
02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.330
<v Speaker 6>It was like a guy who had nothing prepared and just went up there with like a</v>

4589
02:01:20.331 --> 02:01:23.870
<v Speaker 6>reputation and some pratfalls and it didn't make any sense.</v>

4590
02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:26.120
<v Speaker 6>Like it wasn't like he was trying to work out some bits.</v>

4591
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:29.690
<v Speaker 6>Like you'll see a guy come in and try to work out some shit and like even like a</v>

4592
02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.450
<v Speaker 6>famous person will come in like a Paul riser or something like that will come</v>

4593
02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:35.180
<v Speaker 6>into a club and they'll try to work out some shit.</v>

4594
02:01:36.150 --> 02:01:36.420
<v Speaker 6>Son.</v>

4595
02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:37.820
<v Speaker 6>When he was doing and we use,</v>

4596
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:38.371
<v Speaker 6>we was doing,</v>

4597
02:01:38.371 --> 02:01:38.870
<v Speaker 6>it was just,</v>

4598
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 6>didn't make any sense.</v>

4599
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I saw him at the Improv like the weekend before,</v>

4600
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.700
<v Speaker 3>the weekend before the disaster disaster and it was an uncomfortable,</v>

4601
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 3>it was bad.</v>

4602
02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Like you literally,</v>

4603
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:52.310
<v Speaker 3>he felony lander on his glass and broke his class.</v>

4604
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Like he did like a prat fall and broke his glasses and all,</v>

4605
02:01:54.741 --> 02:01:55.401
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking this,</v>

4606
02:01:55.401 --> 02:01:56.390
<v Speaker 3>did he just cut his hip?</v>

4607
02:01:56.420 --> 02:02:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Like is he going to be bleeding now or it was like legit falls.</v>

4608
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4609
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.500

4612
02:02:04.491 --> 02:02:06.980
<v Speaker 3>you got to see Kramer's on stage right now.</v>

4613
02:02:06.981 --> 02:02:10.430
<v Speaker 3>He's acting all fucked up like he seems like he's on something.</v>

4614
02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.380
<v Speaker 3>He's with some girl that she's wasted two and then he got offstage,</v>

4615
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:16.310
<v Speaker 3>went to laugh factory.</v>

4616
02:02:16.311 --> 02:02:17.144
<v Speaker 3>It all happened.</v>

4617
02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Jamie ran across the street with TMZ with the video.</v>

4618
02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Bret Ernst was there,</v>

4619
02:02:23.410 --> 02:02:25.270
<v Speaker 3>came over to the store after,</v>

4620
02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:28.550
<v Speaker 3>cause I got there at the comedy store right after he had gone wacky at the</v>

4621
02:02:28.551 --> 02:02:31.600
<v Speaker 3>comedy store and there was a buzz around and Brian called me up and bunch of</v>

4622
02:02:31.601 --> 02:02:33.770
<v Speaker 3>other people were talking about how fucking coked up he was.</v>

4623
02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And so then he went down the laugh factory and had his meltdown and Brent earns</v>

02:03:04.530 --> 02:03:05.030
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

4652

<v Speaker 3>being captured doing something like crazy like that and then putting it on the</v>

<v Speaker 3>Here's the night when I called you.</v>

4658
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:26.060
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think the baby phase,</v>

4659
02:03:26.061 --> 02:03:27.240

<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

4662
02:03:29.031 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Babyface,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Brian and Kramer.</v>

4664
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:32.343
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4665
02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:33.190
<v Speaker 3>that was the first.</v>

4666
02:03:33.190 --> 02:03:33.490
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4667
02:03:33.490 --> 02:03:34.220
<v Speaker 3>so true.</v>

4668
02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.053
<v Speaker 3>See if you can,</v>

4669
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:39.770
<v Speaker 3>what are the top five instances of cameras coming out of this at a comedy club</v>

4670
02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.060
<v Speaker 3>that a comic that had to do a Monday morning,</v>

4671
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:45.103
<v Speaker 3>Mia Copa.</v>

4672
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Cause you got Kramer,</v>

4673
02:03:47.730 --> 02:03:48.620
<v Speaker 3>who is the other ones?</v>

4674
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:51.890
<v Speaker 3>We got tosh but Taj didn't really do a mia culpa.</v>

4675
02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:52.410
<v Speaker 3>He even,</v>

4676
02:03:52.410 --> 02:03:53.240
<v Speaker 3>he even him,</v>

4677
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.110
<v Speaker 3>his apology,</v>

4678
02:03:54.111 --> 02:03:54.471
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

4679
02:03:54.471 --> 02:03:55.970
<v Speaker 3>that woman did not record it.</v>

4680
02:03:55.971 --> 02:03:56.990
<v Speaker 3>No one recorded it.</v>

4681
02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:00.560
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the problem was her version of the facts were completely</v>

4682
02:04:00.561 --> 02:04:01.160
<v Speaker 3>distorted.</v>

4683
02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:01.670
<v Speaker 3>So then you,</v>

4684
02:04:01.670 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 3>you disregard,</v>

4685
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:06.530
<v Speaker 3>she wrote a whole blog about her heckling and his response to her heckled.</v>

4686
02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.730
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially what happened.</v>

4687
02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:08.360
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4688
02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.170
<v Speaker 3>but he acknowledged that he did.</v>

4689
02:04:10.190 --> 02:04:11.001
<v Speaker 3>He definitely acknowledge it,</v>

4690
02:04:11.001 --> 02:04:13.460
<v Speaker 3>but it was right there.</v>

4691
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4692
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:15.910
<v Speaker 3>here's the here and I'll,</v>

4693
02:04:15.911 --> 02:04:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to whittle it down to this.</v>

4694
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:22.870
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference then between like Daniel Tosh and Tracy Morgan and Patton</v>

4695
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Oswald,</v>

4696
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:28.910
<v Speaker 3>acknowledging there they're getting fucking blogged about versus Michael Kramer.</v>

4697
02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Is it the fear,</v>

4698
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:32.930
<v Speaker 3>the culture of fear?</v>

4699
02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.360
<v Speaker 3>What did Patton Oswald do?</v>

4700
02:04:35.450 --> 02:04:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Cotton Oswald,</v>

4701
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:37.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4702
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:38.340
<v Speaker 3>someone</v>

4703
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:42.630
<v Speaker 5>was videotaping and when he yelled at her at the whatchamacallit and,</v>

4704
02:04:42.631 --> 02:04:43.464
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4705
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:45.390
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

4706
02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:46.201
<v Speaker 5>shut up.</v>

4707
02:04:46.201 --> 02:04:48.990
<v Speaker 5>And then he kicked her out and he was a dick to her and then she had to leave</v>

4708
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:51.930
<v Speaker 5>and then he had to just someone Google Patton Oswald.</v>

4709
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

4710
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.881
<v Speaker 3>we don't need to.</v>

4711
02:04:52.881 --> 02:04:53.330
<v Speaker 3>We don't do,</v>

4712
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.791
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

4713
02:04:53.791 --> 02:04:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4714
02:04:54.230 --> 02:04:54.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4715
02:04:54.531 --> 02:04:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I think patent Jamie and cut my camera.</v>

4716
02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Cut The camera.</v>

4717
02:04:58.970 --> 02:05:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Bert Kreischer smoking marijuana caught screen camera.</v>

4718
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.851
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

4719
02:05:04.851 --> 02:05:05.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4720
02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:06.340
<v Speaker 3>as Joey Diaz was,</v>

4721
02:05:06.341 --> 02:05:06.500
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4722
02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:07.340
<v Speaker 3>this is not pedophile.</v>

4723
02:05:07.341 --> 02:05:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Small town with the church.</v>

4724
02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:09.741
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

4725
02:05:09.741 --> 02:05:09.940
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

4726
02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:10.610
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

4727
02:05:10.610 --> 02:05:13.500
<v Speaker 5>so I count Tracy Morgan and Patton Oswald and Daniel Tosh and the,</v>

4728
02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.020
<v Speaker 5>and the Michael Kramer Shit,</v>

4729
02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.113
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4730
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 5>Dave Chappelle has a,</v>

4731
02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:20.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe have it as a solution to all this.</v>

4732
02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4733
02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Hannibal came up with a solution first.</v>

4734
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:24.480
<v Speaker 3>He started using it after the bill Cosby thing.</v>

4735
02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:25.973
<v Speaker 3>That bag,</v>

4736
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:29.370
<v Speaker 3>you can give a bag to people and they put their cell phones in it so they can't</v>

4737
02:05:29.371 --> 02:05:32.130
<v Speaker 3>record while they're in there and they saw but how many fucking,</v>

4738
02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:33.060
<v Speaker 3>what if they have a cell phone?</v>

4739
02:05:33.061 --> 02:05:33.894
<v Speaker 3>Their sock,</v>

4740
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.700
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna check their whole body or cell phones.</v>

4741
02:05:35.701 --> 02:05:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I think like they're talking about big theaters that Chappelle would be and</v>

4742
02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:39.720
<v Speaker 3>where they would have the,</v>

4743
02:05:39.721 --> 02:05:39.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4744
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:43.980
<v Speaker 3>the security that the metal detectors you have to has metal detectors at</v>

4745
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.570
<v Speaker 3>theaters.</v>

4746
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4747
02:05:44.851 --> 02:05:45.631
<v Speaker 3>UFC has,</v>

4748
02:05:45.631 --> 02:05:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4749
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:47.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll have them in big theaters nowadays.</v>

4750
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Arena though,</v>

4751
02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:50.910
<v Speaker 3>most of the theaters that we perform it,</v>

4752
02:05:50.911 --> 02:05:54.120
<v Speaker 3>like if I perform at a place that's got 3000 seats or something like that,</v>

4753
02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:56.040
<v Speaker 3>they don't have metal detectors do that.</v>

4754
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever walked through the door,</v>

4755
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 3>walk to the door?</v>

4756
02:05:58.110 --> 02:05:59.620
<v Speaker 3>He denied a second ego.</v>

4757
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Ego's a death metal,</v>

4758
02:06:01.471 --> 02:06:01.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4759
02:06:01.651 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 3>that that kind of arena place probably has,</v>

4760
02:06:03.721 --> 02:06:03.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4761
02:06:03.961 --> 02:06:05.340
<v Speaker 3>security and stuff like that.</v>

4762
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.181
<v Speaker 3>I'm much time do we have left?</v>

4763
02:06:06.181 --> 02:06:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Do I have another time for another drink?</v>

4764
02:06:07.290 --> 02:06:07.710

02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I say this and I know there's a lot of crossover fans.</v>

4839
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:10.990
<v Speaker 3>If you are a broken fan and you're not listening to Doug's podcast,</v>

4840
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.470
<v Speaker 3>you're missing out a huge portion of,</v>

4841
02:08:14.471 --> 02:08:16.900
<v Speaker 3>of just of what a podcast should be.</v>

4842
02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:18.730
<v Speaker 3>His podcast is so fucking good.</v>

4843

4844
02:08:20.170 --> 02:08:21.370
<v Speaker 3>He's great at fucking everything,</v>

4845
02:08:21.371 --> 02:08:21.701
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

4846
02:08:21.701 --> 02:08:24.370
<v Speaker 3>his podcast is so bummed out that he lives in the middle of nowhere.</v>

4847
02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:26.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about taking a road trip to visit.</v>

4848
02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Memorable to do a Superbowl party.</v>

4849
02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:29.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4850
02:08:29.351 --> 02:08:31.270
<v Speaker 3>just to roll it out because it's not that big.</v>

4851
02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big anymore.</v>

4852
02:08:32.141 --> 02:08:32.801
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

4853
02:08:32.801 --> 02:08:33.221
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>

4854
02:08:33.221 --> 02:08:36.910
<v Speaker 3>now we're talking about it right now on a podcast maybe there he released the</v>

4855
02:08:36.911 --> 02:08:38.050
<v Speaker 3>address online.</v>

4856
02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:39.221
<v Speaker 3>What if?</v>

4857
02:08:39.221 --> 02:08:39.761
<v Speaker 3>What if I go,</v>

4858
02:08:39.761 --> 02:08:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

4859
02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:41.650
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to compound.</v>

4860
02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.300
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get another hundred people.</v>

4861
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 3>It'd be chaos.</v>

4862
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:46.420
<v Speaker 3>His treats would be overrun with retards.</v>

4863
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:48.303
<v Speaker 3>Ears.</v>

4864
02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I can get as a dress.</v>

4865
02:08:49.841 --> 02:08:50.680
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

4866
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Here's Stan hopes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

4870
02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I've successfully ignored it for quite a while and it's actually,</v>

4871
02:08:57.881 --> 02:09:01.300
<v Speaker 3>and I actually had a doctor say that he's ignored his for 30 years.</v>

4872
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Then I wrote back to exactly what I wanted to see.</v>

4873
02:09:05.110 --> 02:09:05.920
<v Speaker 3>It's fine,</v>

4874
02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 3>unless you plan on lifting anything.</v>

4875
02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:09.580
<v Speaker 3>If you want to carry a sand bag up a hill,</v>

4876
02:09:09.581 --> 02:09:12.730
<v Speaker 3>you might have a problem with that thing cause it'll tear further and is it your</v>

4877
02:09:12.731 --> 02:09:13.541
<v Speaker 3>stomach wall?</v>

4878
02:09:13.541 --> 02:09:13.901
<v Speaker 3>Terrorists.</v>

4879

4880
02:09:14.231 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 3>your intestines will poke out more and the whole couldn't get bigger depending</v>

4881
02:09:18.881 --> 02:09:20.170
<v Speaker 3>on how much you strained yourself.</v>

4882
02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4883
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:22.810
<v Speaker 3>You can get just to get it fixed.</v>

4884
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4885
02:09:23.190 --> 02:09:23.720

4887
02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get to a base level.</v>

4888
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Let me give to like two 30 and see where I'm at.</v>

4889
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4890
02:09:29.290 --> 02:09:30.550
<v Speaker 3>How about just get it checked out?</v>

4891
02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I could just get to two 30 just go get a doctor to look at it.</v>

4892
02:09:34.151 --> 02:09:36.190
<v Speaker 3>They'll probably be able to tell you right away and then you can go,</v>

4893
02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:36.611

<v Speaker 3>Horses can't go over 225 pounds.</v>

4908
02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Just like giant horse.</v>

4941
02:11:02.201 --> 02:11:04.750
<v Speaker 5>fucking battle for you if someone rolls in the bedroom.</v>

4942
02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:05.470
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4943
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:06.850
<v Speaker 5>I really felt like Jon snow.</v>

02:11:08.981 --> 02:11:09.191
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4948
02:11:09.191 --> 02:11:10.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting here with Priscilla.</v>

4949
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:11.620
<v Speaker 5>Mona is a little shit dog,</v>

4951
02:11:15.761 --> 02:11:16.900
<v Speaker 5>just staring at the door,</v>

4955
02:11:21.641 --> 02:11:22.240

<v Speaker 5>Like my wife would never do that.</v>

4958
02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Female dogs are super protective.</v>

4959
02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.350
<v Speaker 5>They're really good at that.</v>

4966
02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:37.870
<v Speaker 5>how defensible that is.</v>

4967
02:11:40.650 --> 02:11:41.160
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4968
02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:43.270
<v Speaker 5>but the three ones,</v>

02:11:43.730 --> 02:11:45.250

4974
02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:00.130
<v Speaker 5>Like with guns,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the great equalizer.</v>

4979
02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I need to get a gun.</v>

4980
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:07.880
<v Speaker 4>And it's about time.</v>

4981
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:09.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a good goal for everybody.</v>

4982
02:12:09.201 --> 02:12:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Is scared of people thinking.</v>

4983
02:12:11.031 --> 02:12:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Now when you have like the San Bernardino thing that happened is that people are</v>

4984
02:12:14.601 --> 02:12:16.920
<v Speaker 4>just going to be ready and armed and,</v>

4985
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to turn into some sort of a,</v>

4986
02:12:18.771 --> 02:12:20.060
<v Speaker 4>a military state.</v>

4987
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.781
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4988
02:12:20.781 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 4>how many of these things can that,</v>

4989
02:12:21.681 --> 02:12:21.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4990
02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:23.180
<v Speaker 4>two of them happen yesterday.</v>

4991
02:12:23.181 --> 02:12:24.260
<v Speaker 4>Here's another weird thing.</v>

4992
02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't know that there was a second arm mass shooting and killing and</v>

4993
02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:30.344
<v Speaker 4>Georgia.</v>

4994
02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:30.950
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

4995
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4996
02:12:31.130 --> 02:12:31.371
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4997
02:12:31.371 --> 02:12:33.920
<v Speaker 4>it was near Atlanta on the same day,</v>

4998
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:35.383
<v Speaker 4>same day.</v>

4999
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 4>There was a four people were killed in Georgia,</v>

5000
02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:38.800
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

5001
02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Was it in Atlanta?</v>

5002
02:12:39.970 --> 02:12:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5003
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.750
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

5004
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:41.583
<v Speaker 5>It was in Atlanta.</v>

5005
02:12:44.710 --> 02:12:45.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5006
02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:45.360
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5007
02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:50.260
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things that I do not know if there was a fucking solution for.</v>

5008
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.930
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5009
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:55.660
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those weird things where you look at the amount of guns that exist.</v>

5010
02:12:55.930 --> 02:13:00.850
<v Speaker 4>You look at the amount of people that there are e mount of disenfranchised</v>

5011
02:13:00.851 --> 02:13:02.650
<v Speaker 4>people with mental illnesses.</v>

5012
02:13:02.651 --> 02:13:04.750
<v Speaker 4>The amount of people that are religious fanatics,</v>

5013
02:13:04.751 --> 02:13:09.700
<v Speaker 4>the amount of people that are just fucking bat shit crazy.</v>

5014
02:13:10.210 --> 02:13:14.620
<v Speaker 4>And when you deal with 350 million people,</v>

5015
02:13:14.650 --> 02:13:16.630
<v Speaker 4>which is I think what the United States is now,</v>

5016
02:13:16.631 --> 02:13:21.100
<v Speaker 4>somewhere between 300 and 350 you're going to,</v>

5017
02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.070
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a certain amount of nutty fucking people.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's this almost no avoiding it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's so much pressure and stress and life is difficult for you're,</v>

02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:56.130
<v Speaker 6>It's like everything is in place and you still freak out.</v>

5031
02:13:56.370 --> 02:14:00.750
<v Speaker 6>Imagine some guy who's married to some monster who works for a tyrant,</v>

5032
02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:02.520
<v Speaker 6>who lives in a Shithole,</v>

5036
02:14:10.951 --> 02:14:12.690
<v Speaker 6>all day constantly.</v>

5037
02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 6>And there's a lot of people like that out there,</v>

5038
02:14:15.511 --> 02:14:15.791
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5039
02:14:15.791 --> 02:14:17.490
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that don't get any love.</v>

5040
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:18.181
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

5041
02:14:18.181 --> 02:14:21.090
<v Speaker 6>they have no place in their life where it feels like they're making a</v>

5042
02:14:21.091 --> 02:14:21.924
<v Speaker 6>connection.</v>

5043
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.860
<v Speaker 6>They've missed,</v>

5044
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:25.260
<v Speaker 6>they've been slammed in the walls at every term.</v>

5045
02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:27.000
<v Speaker 6>They have a dumb job.</v>

5046
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:29.370
<v Speaker 6>They don't give a fuck about that a robot can do.</v>

5047
02:14:29.730 --> 02:14:34.680
<v Speaker 6>They're idiots and they just realize it and they're fucking horrified and</v>

5048
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:36.000
<v Speaker 6>they're angry and they're,</v>

5049

<v Speaker 6>parents and shitty circumstances and shitty genetics,</v>

<v Speaker 6>shitty life experiences,</v>

5053
02:14:47.791 --> 02:14:48.750
<v Speaker 6>bullying,</v>

5054
02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:49.351
<v Speaker 6>rape,</v>

5055
02:14:49.351 --> 02:14:50.580
<v Speaker 6>molestation,</v>

5056
02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:51.630
<v Speaker 6>alcoholism,</v>

5057
02:14:51.631 --> 02:14:52.464
<v Speaker 6>racism,</v>

5058
02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:56.160
<v Speaker 6>constantly over and over and over and over and over and over.</v>

5059
02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:57.660
<v Speaker 6>And they somehow survive.</v>

5060
02:14:57.661 --> 02:14:59.280
<v Speaker 6>To get to the point where they get their hands on a gun.</v>

5061
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.560
<v Speaker 6>That's what we're dealing with.</v>

5062
02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.670
<v Speaker 6>That's what we're dealing with.</v>

5063
02:15:02.671 --> 02:15:07.671
<v Speaker 6>We're dealing with is humans freaking out and finding a way to kill the humans</v>

5064
02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.250
<v Speaker 6>to focus on the mechanism in which they're doing that with.</v>

5065
02:15:11.970 --> 02:15:14.160
<v Speaker 6>We're missing a giant piece of the puzzle.</v>

5066
02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.940
<v Speaker 6>There's too many fucking guns for sure.</v>

5067
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:20.490
<v Speaker 6>It's too easy to get a gun for sure.</v>

5068
02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:21.331
<v Speaker 6>You should have,</v>

5069
02:15:21.331 --> 02:15:21.511
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5070
02:15:21.511 --> 02:15:22.344
<v Speaker 6>I have guns.</v>

5071
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:23.940
<v Speaker 6>You should have to take tests.</v>

5072
02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:25.050
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

5073
02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:29.520
<v Speaker 6>You should have to be some very stringent requirements on your capabilities.</v>

5074
02:15:29.521 --> 02:15:29.661
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

5075
02:15:29.661 --> 02:15:29.841
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

5076
02:15:29.841 --> 02:15:33.360
<v Speaker 6>we should know exactly how you do know what the safety is.</v>

5077
02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:35.760
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what's a safe way to point the gun?</v>

5078
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:37.590
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how to load it correctly?</v>

5079
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:38.580
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how to clean it?</v>

5080
02:15:38.581 --> 02:15:39.414
<v Speaker 6>You clean it,</v>

5081
02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.800
<v Speaker 6>but you just have this ultimate weapon of destruction and you don't have to have</v>

5082
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:45.450
<v Speaker 6>any knowledge of how to use it at all.</v>

5083
02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:46.590
<v Speaker 6>But to have a car,</v>

5084
02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:48.360
<v Speaker 6>you have to show that you could turn,</v>

5085
02:15:48.450 --> 02:15:50.160
<v Speaker 6>you could hit the brakes,</v>

5086
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:51.720
<v Speaker 6>you can hit the blinkers.</v>

5087
02:15:51.721 --> 02:15:53.250
<v Speaker 6>You have to show all of this competency.</v>

5088
02:15:53.251 --> 02:15:53.661
<v Speaker 6>You have to host,</v>

5089
02:15:53.661 --> 02:15:56.700
<v Speaker 6>show all this knowledge of all the laws and all the rules.</v>

5090
02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:59.160
<v Speaker 6>You don't need to show none of that thing to get a gun.</v>

5091
02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 6>All you have to do is just not be a criminal.</v>

5092
02:16:02.730 --> 02:16:03.563
<v Speaker 6>That's all I have to do.</v>

5093
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.370
<v Speaker 6>Don't be a criminal.</v>

5094
02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:04.921
<v Speaker 6>Are you a criminal?</v>

5095
02:16:04.921 --> 02:16:05.880
<v Speaker 6>We're going to do a little check on you,</v>

5096
02:16:05.881 --> 02:16:06.714
<v Speaker 6>Mr. Crusher.</v>

5097
02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:06.901
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5098
02:16:06.901 --> 02:16:07.680
<v Speaker 6>you're not a criminal,</v>

5099
02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.513
<v Speaker 6>but here's your gun.</v>

5100
02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:09.210
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

5101
02:16:09.210 --> 02:16:10.021
<v Speaker 6>question number two.</v>

5102
02:16:10.021 --> 02:16:10.854
<v Speaker 6>Are you an idiot?</v>

5103
02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:12.140
<v Speaker 6>Are you,</v>

5104
02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:14.400
<v Speaker 6>and who's to decide who's to decide?</v>

5105
02:16:14.490 --> 02:16:15.323
<v Speaker 6>Who the fuck are you?</v>

5106
02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:16.201
<v Speaker 6>Cause I'm an idiot too.</v>

5107
02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:17.034
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people,</v>

5108
02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:19.800
<v Speaker 6>I would say a lot of people are idiots and they would be it.</v>

5109
02:16:19.810 --> 02:16:21.300
<v Speaker 6>It's to me and to them,</v>

5110
02:16:21.301 --> 02:16:24.330
<v Speaker 6>there'd be some people that they know that would be stupid as fuck with his</v>

5111
02:16:24.331 --> 02:16:25.410
<v Speaker 6>levels of people.</v>

5112
02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:25.981
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

5113
02:16:25.981 --> 02:16:27.330
<v Speaker 6>And you and I are not at the top.</v>

5114
02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:28.493
<v Speaker 6>We're just not.</v>

5115
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 6>There's people out there that invented Wifi</v>

5116
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:35.590
<v Speaker 4>and they're using lasers to give us fucking satellite communication and all the</v>

5117
02:16:35.591 --> 02:16:38.770
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit that you and I know of that we could never invent on our own.</v>

5118
02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:41.260
<v Speaker 4>There's some people out of their way fucking smarter than us,</v>

5119
02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

5120
02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:42.700
<v Speaker 4>and they're making that shit.</v>

5121
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:44.950
<v Speaker 4>That's the reality of life.</v>

5122
02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

5123
02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:53.420
<v Speaker 5>They're a little too high for this conversation.</v>

5124
02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:55.213
<v Speaker 5>Too High,</v>

5125
02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:56.451
<v Speaker 5>too high,</v>

5126
02:16:56.451 --> 02:16:57.830
<v Speaker 5>too high to break it down.</v>

5127
02:16:57.860 --> 02:16:58.430
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5128
02:16:58.430 --> 02:16:59.263
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5129
02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you know what scares me the most about the San Bernardino killing?</v>

5130
02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Why is it didn't surprise me that that's what scares me the most.</v>

5131
02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:06.970
<v Speaker 4>What scares me the most is like,</v>

5132
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:07.300
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5133
02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.133
<v Speaker 4>another one.</v>

5134
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:09.460
<v Speaker 4>It seems like almost every day now.</v>

5135
02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I like every day it's been something almost,</v>

5136
02:17:12.470 --> 02:17:12.651
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5137
02:17:12.651 --> 02:17:16.820
<v Speaker 5>they have that calendar out that the calendar shows that it's like literally 13</v>

5138
02:17:16.821 --> 02:17:18.710
<v Speaker 5>days a month that there's mass shootings,</v>

5139
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:20.540
<v Speaker 5>isis advent calendar.</v>

5140
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is for real?</v>

5141
02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:22.371
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5142
02:17:22.371 --> 02:17:23.870
<v Speaker 5>I maybe I don't do enough research,</v>

5143
02:17:24.470 --> 02:17:26.630
<v Speaker 5>but like it just seems so crazy.</v>

5144
02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5145
02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:30.050
<v Speaker 5>here's the problem is exactly what you've said is I love,</v>

5146
02:17:30.890 --> 02:17:31.723
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

5147
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:33.560
<v Speaker 5>Something's wrong with our system,</v>

5148
02:17:33.561 --> 02:17:34.390
<v Speaker 5>with the guns there,</v>

5149
02:17:34.390 --> 02:17:35.330
<v Speaker 5>that something needs to be done.</v>

5150
02:17:35.331 --> 02:17:39.200
<v Speaker 5>Something needs to be changed because we have a lot of fucking mass killings.</v>

5151
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.521
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5152
02:17:39.521 --> 02:17:42.080
<v Speaker 5>and from what I hear from Jim Jefferies Act,</v>

5153
02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:43.100
<v Speaker 5>there's done in Australia,</v>

5154
02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:45.710
<v Speaker 4>well they took the guns away.</v>

5155
02:17:45.711 --> 02:17:46.760
<v Speaker 4>They had a mass killing,</v>

5156
02:17:46.761 --> 02:17:48.620
<v Speaker 4>I think quite a while.</v>

5157
02:17:48.750 --> 02:17:51.800
<v Speaker 5>Jim Jefferies want to say was in the eighties Jim Jefferies has a very,</v>

5158
02:17:51.810 --> 02:17:51.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5159
02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:54.540
<v Speaker 5>viral bit that every time there's a mass shooting,</v>

5160
02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.520
<v Speaker 5>he gets another 12 million views.</v>

5161
02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:56.741
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

5162
02:17:56.741 --> 02:17:56.961
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

5163
02:17:56.961 --> 02:17:57.751
<v Speaker 5>and I love Jim,</v>

5164
02:17:57.751 --> 02:17:58.321
<v Speaker 5>I'm not shitting on it,</v>

5165
02:17:58.321 --> 02:17:59.100
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

5166
02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:01.170
<v Speaker 5>but like it is about that fact.</v>

5167
02:18:01.171 --> 02:18:03.810
<v Speaker 5>There was one mass shooting and they all took their guns back and they've never</v>

5168
02:18:03.811 --> 02:18:05.910
<v Speaker 5>had another killing mass shooting Australia.</v>

5169
02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5170
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:12.150
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with a place that has way less people.</v>

5171
02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:13.720
<v Speaker 4>Here's Australia,</v>

5172
02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:17.230
<v Speaker 4>20 million people and mostly in two cities.</v>

5173
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 4>There's very few people.</v>

5174
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:21.080
<v Speaker 4>So was that his leg,</v>

5175
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 4>country of Australia is pretty massive as well.</v>

5176
02:18:23.351 --> 02:18:23.531
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5177
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:24.220
<v Speaker 4>It's gigantic.</v>

5178
02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:27.340
<v Speaker 4>It's the same size as the contiguous.</v>

5179
02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.233
<v Speaker 4>That's how they say it.</v>

5180
02:18:28.470 --> 02:18:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Continuous or continuous thought the entirety of the United States of America.</v>

5181
02:18:33.250 --> 02:18:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Same size,</v>

5182
02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:37.840
<v Speaker 4>same size essentially.</v>

5183
02:18:37.930 --> 02:18:39.720
<v Speaker 4>And they've got the politicians about laying there.</v>

5184
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5185
02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:41.313
<v Speaker 4>Less.</v>

5186
02:18:41.770 --> 02:18:44.350
<v Speaker 4>Less than La.</v>

5187
02:18:44.350 --> 02:18:44.470
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

5188
02:18:44.470 --> 02:18:46.480
<v Speaker 4>He's got 20 million people plus Mexicans.</v>

5189
02:18:46.510 --> 02:18:46.751
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5190
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:47.584
<v Speaker 4>Let's be honest.</v>

5191
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:48.940
<v Speaker 4>What are the real numbers?</v>

5192
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.221
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5193
02:18:49.221 --> 02:18:50.051
<v Speaker 4>I was going to be through the phone.</v>

5194
02:18:50.051 --> 02:18:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I love Mexicans.</v>

5195
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:53.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hating on illegal immigrants.</v>

5196
02:18:53.321 --> 02:18:54.940
<v Speaker 4>I love people that are willing,</v>

5197
02:18:54.941 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 4>documented workers,</v>

5198
02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:56.920
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call them.</v>

5199
02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:58.360
<v Speaker 4>I call them Mexicans.</v>

5200
02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:03.540
<v Speaker 4>I love people that have the courage to do something illegal to better their</v>

5201
02:19:03.761 --> 02:19:04.260
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

5202
02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:04.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5203
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:05.800
<v Speaker 4>And I think a lot of them are great.</v>

5204
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:07.050
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of them aren't.</v>

5205
02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:09.370
<v Speaker 4>They embody what America's supposed to be.</v>

5206
02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:12.250
<v Speaker 4>American is supposed to be this place where you can go and you could make it,</v>

5207
02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:13.220
<v Speaker 4>you know this,</v>

5208
02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:14.800
<v Speaker 4>this spot where it's freedom.</v>

5209
02:19:14.801 --> 02:19:15.070
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

5210
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:20.070
<v Speaker 4>you don't get suppressed by just fucking generation after generation of people</v>

5211
02:19:20.381 --> 02:19:21.101
<v Speaker 4>doing it wrong.</v>

5212
02:19:21.101 --> 02:19:22.900
<v Speaker 4>You can get the fuck out of Mexico and Woo.</v>

5213
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:24.063
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

5214
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:25.720
<v Speaker 4>and you get to America and just hustle.</v>

5215
02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Just go to work.</v>

5216
02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

5217
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:28.850
<v Speaker 4>just go after it.</v>

5218
02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.170
<v Speaker 4>It's jobs out there.</v>

5219
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Get them.</v>

5220
02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:32.420
<v Speaker 4>But then what about the Syrian refugees?</v>

5221
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:33.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5222
02:19:33.141 --> 02:19:33.401
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5223
02:19:33.401 --> 02:19:34.030
<v Speaker 4>it's good to bullshit.</v>

5224
02:19:34.030 --> 02:19:34.761
<v Speaker 4>Fucking doesn't want them.</v>

5225
02:19:34.761 --> 02:19:35.121
<v Speaker 4>Well listen,</v>

5226
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:36.410
<v Speaker 4>it's against our question.</v>

5227
02:19:36.450 --> 02:19:37.161
<v Speaker 4>That's against what,</v>

5228
02:19:37.161 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 4>what makes us up could not welcome.</v>

5229
02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5230
02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:40.183
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

5231
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.730
<v Speaker 4>those are the people that are leaving the bad people.</v>

5232
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:44.781
<v Speaker 4>Like where are we?</v>

5233
02:19:44.781 --> 02:19:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Assuming that everybody over there is bad.</v>

5234
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:49.760
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that because then that's a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

5235
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.920
<v Speaker 4>If you won't let them in and you don't treat that,</v>

5236
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:54.620
<v Speaker 4>I give them open arms like just because they're Muslims.</v>

5237
02:19:54.621 --> 02:19:55.670
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

5238
02:19:55.690 --> 02:19:55.851
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5239
02:19:55.851 --> 02:19:56.590
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

5240
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Some of this,</v>

5241
02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:59.810
<v Speaker 4>how the attackers in Paris were Syrian refugees,</v>

5242
02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:02.620
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not upset.</v>

5243
02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5244
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:04.830
<v Speaker 4>well a hundred percent for whatever I fucking,</v>

5245
02:20:04.831 --> 02:20:04.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5246
02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:05.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't,</v>

5247
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:06.111
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

5248
02:20:06.111 --> 02:20:10.310
<v Speaker 4>I think what they got to look out for his young radicalized single men,</v>

5249
02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:17.420
<v Speaker 4>that's what the entirety of this movement seems to be as he's radicalized young,</v>

5250
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:18.561
<v Speaker 4>younger men.</v>

5251
02:20:18.561 --> 02:20:23.561
<v Speaker 4>Like that Jihadi John Guy was like a former rapper from England and he joined</v>

5252
02:20:23.901 --> 02:20:24.441
<v Speaker 4>Isis.</v>

5253
02:20:24.441 --> 02:20:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of people that are joining this.</v>

5254
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:28.940
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange,</v>

5255
02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:29.750
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

5256
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange.</v>

5257
02:20:30.771 --> 02:20:33.470
<v Speaker 4>Like girls are joining and they're getting killed.</v>

5258
02:20:33.890 --> 02:20:34.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5259
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.670
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

5260
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:38.480
<v Speaker 4>one of the girls recently got beaten to death and another one got murdered.</v>

5261
02:20:38.481 --> 02:20:39.314
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5262
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:41.090
<v Speaker 4>what is going on?</v>

5263
02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:43.790
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was closeted homosexuals.</v>

5264
02:20:43.791 --> 02:20:46.680
<v Speaker 4>At first I thought tariffs were,</v>

5265
02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I thought they were all just closeted homosexual come after him.</v>

5266
02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Kreischer don't say my worried about comp.</v>

5267
02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:54.680
<v Speaker 4>You've worried about comedy central,</v>

5268
02:20:54.681 --> 02:20:56.000
<v Speaker 4>but you know worried about saying that.</v>

5269
02:20:58.100 --> 02:20:58.940
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

5270
02:20:59.010 --> 02:21:00.140
<v Speaker 4>You've been drawing Muhammad.</v>

5271
02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:01.413
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

5272
02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:07.240
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

5273
02:21:07.650 --> 02:21:08.483
<v Speaker 4>A lot of like,</v>

5274
02:21:08.530 --> 02:21:12.790
<v Speaker 4>like like homosexuality so kept down there like maybe they're just guys that are</v>

5275
02:21:12.791 --> 02:21:13.624
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

5276
02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:14.201
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5277
02:21:14.201 --> 02:21:15.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's what it is.</v>

5278
02:21:15.191 --> 02:21:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Sitting in a cave like,</v>

5279
02:21:16.091 --> 02:21:16.461
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

5280
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:17.740
<v Speaker 4>I call blow you and the guys are like,</v>

5281
02:21:17.741 --> 02:21:18.041
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

5282
02:21:18.041 --> 02:21:18.311
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

5283
02:21:18.311 --> 02:21:18.941
<v Speaker 4>I saw it blow up.</v>

5284
02:21:18.941 --> 02:21:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Let's go blow each other up.</v>

5285
02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh no dairy you.</v>

5286
02:21:22.810 --> 02:21:24.280
<v Speaker 4>It's just radical ideologies,</v>

5287
02:21:24.281 --> 02:21:24.790
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5288
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:25.623
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>

5289
02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:26.570
<v Speaker 4>The idea,</v>

5290
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:28.630
<v Speaker 4>this is the fact that there could be anything out there,</v>

5291
02:21:28.690 --> 02:21:29.380
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

5292
02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:30.130
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

5293
02:21:30.130 --> 02:21:31.360
<v Speaker 4>call it whatever you want.</v>

5294
02:21:31.390 --> 02:21:32.051
<v Speaker 4>Don't call it,</v>

5295
02:21:32.051 --> 02:21:33.400
<v Speaker 4>don't even call it a name.</v>

5296
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:35.290
<v Speaker 4>Just think about whatever it is,</v>

5297
02:21:35.291 --> 02:21:39.940
<v Speaker 4>the energy and the influence that leads someone to go shooting a bunch of random</v>

5298
02:21:39.941 --> 02:21:40.774
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

5299
02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the problems with labeling things when we start saying,</v>

5300
02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:44.621
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5301
02:21:44.621 --> 02:21:46.270
<v Speaker 4>this was a mass shooting,</v>

5302
02:21:46.271 --> 02:21:48.340
<v Speaker 4>this was a religious killing.</v>

5303
02:21:48.341 --> 02:21:50.470
<v Speaker 4>This was a jihadi cell.</v>

5304
02:21:50.470 --> 02:21:51.080
<v Speaker 4>This was,</v>

5305
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.320
<v Speaker 4>we'd give it all these titles and names,</v>

5306
02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:56.650
<v Speaker 4>but just separate yourself from culture,</v>

5307
02:21:56.651 --> 02:22:00.520
<v Speaker 4>like pretend you're an alien or something and you're looking at this,</v>

5308
02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:03.640
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at this from afar and you're just looking at this as some sort of</v>

5309
02:22:03.641 --> 02:22:04.960
<v Speaker 4>an equation or something like that.</v>

5310
02:22:04.961 --> 02:22:06.280
<v Speaker 4>You're watching what's going down,</v>

5311
02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:07.390
<v Speaker 4>like what is it,</v>

5312
02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:07.961
<v Speaker 4>what's going down?</v>

5313
02:22:07.961 --> 02:22:10.180
<v Speaker 4>Like what is it that can,</v>

5314
02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:15.330
<v Speaker 4>these things down here can convince themselves by manipulation of communication.</v>

5315
02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:18.220
<v Speaker 4>So they've got a way to talk to each other.</v>

5316
02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:22.660
<v Speaker 4>They've got a way to relay ideas and they've got a way to reinforce opinions and</v>

5317
02:22:22.661 --> 02:22:23.494
<v Speaker 4>ideas later,</v>

5318
02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:25.000
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years old,</v>

5319
02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 4>and they got a way that</v>

5320
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:31.490
<v Speaker 6>it's so strong that it can make some of them explode and just go around,</v>

5321
02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:36.360
<v Speaker 6>kill random people and think somehow or another they're doing it for the greater</v>

5322
02:22:36.361 --> 02:22:37.140
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

5323
02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:37.973
<v Speaker 6>So they'll,</v>

5324
02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:41.160
<v Speaker 6>through this I this ancient ideology,</v>

5325
02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:42.720
<v Speaker 6>this is whatever it is,</v>

5326
02:22:42.721 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 6>call it whatever you want,</v>

5327
02:22:43.591 --> 02:22:48.180
<v Speaker 6>but through through this influenced by some people's minds that's projected</v>

5328
02:22:48.181 --> 02:22:50.190
<v Speaker 6>somehow or another into another person's mind.</v>

5329
02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:52.770
<v Speaker 6>And it convinces that person to kill random people.</v>

5330
02:22:52.771 --> 02:22:54.090
<v Speaker 6>Forget about what you call it.</v>

5331
02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:59.360
<v Speaker 6>Forget about whether it's Islam or Christianity or Mormon is or Scientology.</v>

5332
02:23:01.051 --> 02:23:02.280
<v Speaker 6>Forget the names,</v>

5333
02:23:02.281 --> 02:23:03.114
<v Speaker 6>forget it.</v>

5334
02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:06.660
<v Speaker 6>Just forget even the language that has been spoken in,</v>

5335
02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:10.830
<v Speaker 6>look at it in terms of what are the noises that are made by the humans that</v>

5336
02:23:10.831 --> 02:23:14.320
<v Speaker 6>create the reaction and one of those norms is with those noise.</v>

5337
02:23:14.321 --> 02:23:15.121
<v Speaker 6>What are those words?</v>

5338
02:23:15.121 --> 02:23:16.710
<v Speaker 6>One of those written things represent,</v>

5339
02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:18.260
<v Speaker 6>they represent like,</v>

5340
02:23:18.700 --> 02:23:18.910
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

5341
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 6>like almost like a living idea,</v>

5342
02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:26.400
<v Speaker 6>a living idea that wants to express itself like through the filter of the</v>

5343
02:23:26.401 --> 02:23:27.720
<v Speaker 6>language and the culture.</v>

5344
02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.770
<v Speaker 6>Like what is it?</v>

5345
02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:33.800
<v Speaker 6>What is it that causes something to want to get people to go after?</v>

5346
02:23:35.701 --> 02:23:40.020
<v Speaker 6>People that are opposed to this idea or that have differing ideas and killed</v>

5347
02:23:40.021 --> 02:23:40.320
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

5348
02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.510
<v Speaker 6>Just killed them by parenting.</v>

5349
02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:43.710
<v Speaker 6>It's all bad parenting.</v>

5350
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:45.900
<v Speaker 6>Isis is the worst parenting in the road.</v>

5351
02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:47.250
<v Speaker 6>If you think about it,</v>

5352
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:48.084
<v Speaker 6>that's what it is.</v>

5353
02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:50.580
<v Speaker 6>The right and we might,</v>

5354
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:52.560
<v Speaker 6>it just might be a point to that.</v>

5355
02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:53.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5356
02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:54.480
<v Speaker 6>there might be a point to it.</v>

5357
02:23:54.481 --> 02:23:57.360
<v Speaker 6>It will to all the ancient cultures,</v>

5358
02:23:57.361 --> 02:23:58.194
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5359
02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:01.230
<v Speaker 6>Like if you think about people that made a break,</v>

5360
02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:03.540
<v Speaker 6>like those are the ones that seem to be the healthiest.</v>

5361
02:24:03.541 --> 02:24:04.980
<v Speaker 6>Like the Australians.</v>

5362
02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:06.330
<v Speaker 6>They made a break from England.</v>

5363
02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:07.530
<v Speaker 6>They got in a boat,</v>

5364
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:08.660
<v Speaker 6>they got kicked out there,</v>

5365
02:24:08.661 --> 02:24:09.494
<v Speaker 6>a prison colony.</v>

5366
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.811
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5367
02:24:09.811 --> 02:24:11.010
<v Speaker 6>So they made him get in a boat,</v>

5368
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:13.650
<v Speaker 6>go over to Australia and live there.</v>

5369
02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:14.220
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5370
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:15.810
<v Speaker 6>That's essentially how Australia started.</v>

5371
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:16.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5372
02:24:16.650 --> 02:24:17.610
<v Speaker 6>but look at them.</v>

5373
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:19.230
<v Speaker 6>The fucking amazing.</v>

5374
02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:20.850
<v Speaker 6>Their cities are incredible.</v>

5375
02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:22.740
<v Speaker 6>The people are cool as fuck.</v>

5376
02:24:22.890 --> 02:24:26.130
<v Speaker 6>They're generally like really easy to talk to and friendly.</v>

5377
02:24:26.310 --> 02:24:27.270
<v Speaker 6>They're smart.</v>

5378
02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:27.660
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

5379
02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:27.931
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

5380
02:24:27.931 --> 02:24:29.580
<v Speaker 6>Melbourne was amazing.</v>

5381
02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:32.610
<v Speaker 6>It's like a like almost didn't want to tell people about it.</v>

5382
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:33.811
<v Speaker 6>I'm almost over here.</v>

5383
02:24:33.811 --> 02:24:34.111
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

5384
02:24:34.111 --> 02:24:34.890
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

02:24:34.890 --> 02:24:35.610
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>

5386
02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:37.560
<v Speaker 6>where else is there like this in the world?</v>

5387
02:24:37.650 --> 02:24:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Oh Dude.</v>

02:24:42.061 --> 02:24:42.900
<v Speaker 5>hotter sister.</v>

5392
02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:45.300
<v Speaker 5>You sit down at Thanksgiving and you're like,</v>

5393
02:24:45.301 --> 02:24:46.350
<v Speaker 5>mother Fucker,</v>

5394
02:24:46.351 --> 02:24:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know she was coming,</v>

5395
02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:48.730
<v Speaker 6>but look what it is.</v>

5396
02:24:48.731 --> 02:24:48.971
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

5397
02:24:48.971 --> 02:24:49.301
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

5398
02:24:49.301 --> 02:24:53.860
<v Speaker 6>it's a civilization that emerged or culture that emerged out of a break from an</v>

5399
02:24:53.861 --> 02:24:54.491
<v Speaker 6>old culture.</v>

5400
02:24:54.491 --> 02:24:54.901
<v Speaker 6>They started,</v>

5401
02:24:54.901 --> 02:24:57.070
<v Speaker 6>they kind of had a reset and they started fresh.</v>

5402
02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:00.250
<v Speaker 6>The people that are stuck in the spots that are super ancient.</v>

5403
02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:04.150
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with this pattern repeating itself over and over again.</v>

5404
02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:05.260
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to break.</v>

5405
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:09.090
<v Speaker 5>So what you're saying is like all my friends that when I go down to Tampa,</v>

5406
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:13.140
<v Speaker 5>then they're left Tampa and they're kind of still using racial slurs.</v>

5407
02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:16.110
<v Speaker 5>What that is is on a global scale,</v>

5408
02:25:16.111 --> 02:25:20.280
<v Speaker 5>people that have never left that area for thousands of years exactly is he just,</v>

5409
02:25:20.281 --> 02:25:21.570
<v Speaker 5>it's just ignorance.</v>

5410
02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 5>So your experience begets</v>

5411
02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:27.370
<v Speaker 6>a kind of openmindedness.</v>

5412
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.761
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5413
02:25:27.761 --> 02:25:28.900
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's just,</v>

5414
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:33.990
<v Speaker 6>it's very difficult to break out of the hive if you're in a hive mind of people</v>

5415
02:25:34.841 --> 02:25:37.930
<v Speaker 6>that are essentially thinking the same way they did when Alexander the Great was</v>

5416
02:25:37.931 --> 02:25:38.764
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>

5417
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:39.910
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>

5418
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:40.743
<v Speaker 6>it's hard.</v>

5419
02:25:40.810 --> 02:25:43.120
<v Speaker 6>Like Afghanistan is a perfect example.</v>

5420
02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:44.710
<v Speaker 6>There's really only one city.</v>

5421
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.251
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5422
02:25:45.251 --> 02:25:48.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't know much about Afghanistan honestly because I really haven't been</v>

5423
02:25:48.401 --> 02:25:48.970
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

5424
02:25:48.970 --> 02:25:51.430
<v Speaker 6>but I've talked to many people that have been there,</v>

5425
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:53.020
<v Speaker 6>soldiers that have fought there,</v>

5426
02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:58.210
<v Speaker 6>and I've absorbed as much as I could what they were trying to say and tried to</v>

5427
02:25:58.211 --> 02:25:58.991
<v Speaker 6>figure it out.</v>

5428
02:25:58.991 --> 02:26:03.991
<v Speaker 6>But essentially what it seems like is you have one city and then you have these</v>

5429
02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:07.930
<v Speaker 6>strange areas that are controlled by warlords.</v>

5430
02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:09.310
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of them,</v>

5431
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:13.300
<v Speaker 6>they have like these areas where it's not just like,</v>

5432
02:26:13.301 --> 02:26:13.590
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5433
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.880
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

5434
02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:15.550
<v Speaker 6>like what I'd imagine Iraq to be.</v>

5435
02:26:15.610 --> 02:26:17.260
<v Speaker 6>It's insanely mountainous,</v>

5436
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:18.160
<v Speaker 6>insane.</v>

5437
02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:20.140
<v Speaker 6>Like just like a small town in,</v>

5438
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:21.043
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

5439
02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:21.520
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5440
02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:22.151
<v Speaker 6>say Butler,</v>

5441
02:26:22.151 --> 02:26:24.520
<v Speaker 6>Ohio would be a control by a warlord.</v>

5442
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:25.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5443
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:26.590
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5444
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5445
02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:27.970
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5446
02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:29.060
<v Speaker 6>No targets do.</v>

5447
02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:29.201
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5448
02:26:29.201 --> 02:26:29.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5449
02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:30.790
<v Speaker 6>John Mccain,</v>

5450
02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 6>I remember this was trying to impart that on,</v>

5451
02:26:33.850 --> 02:26:34.330
<v Speaker 6>on uh,</v>

5452
02:26:34.330 --> 02:26:38.120
<v Speaker 6>Barack Obama when they were debating when they were running for President Mccain</v>

5453
02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.160
<v Speaker 6>and Sarah Palin and he said the exact same words that I would just said.</v>

5454
02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:47.260
<v Speaker 6>Like that's where I got it from him and initially installed until I started</v>

5455
02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:49.420
<v Speaker 6>looking into it and talking to these guys that went over there.</v>

5456
02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:52.840
<v Speaker 6>They said it's like the same as when Alexander the Great was around.</v>

5457
02:26:53.130 --> 02:26:54.220
<v Speaker 6>And that's what Mccain said.</v>

5458
02:26:54.221 --> 02:26:55.330
<v Speaker 6>He said to Obama like,</v>

5459
02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:56.380
<v Speaker 6>this is your,</v>

5460
02:26:56.381 --> 02:26:58.030
<v Speaker 6>you don't understand Afghanistan.</v>

5461
02:26:58.031 --> 02:26:59.680
<v Speaker 6>You're saying we're just going to send troops in there.</v>

5462
02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:01.700
<v Speaker 6>You can't just do that like that.</v>

5463
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:04.090
<v Speaker 6>This is like the rocky mountains.</v>

5464
02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:05.530
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's fucking crazy.</v>

5465
02:27:05.530 --> 02:27:09.220
<v Speaker 6>It's all mountains and these guys were living out there and caves and made these</v>

5466
02:27:09.221 --> 02:27:10.960
<v Speaker 6>Taliban guys living in Cains.</v>

5467
02:27:10.961 --> 02:27:14.350
<v Speaker 6>You've got these dudes are war lords and they got like 20 wives and then giving</v>

5468
02:27:14.351 --> 02:27:16.030
<v Speaker 6>them Viagara to get them to talk.</v>

5469
02:27:16.270 --> 02:27:20.050
<v Speaker 6>They give these guys Viagara to rat on the Taliban at.</v>

5470
02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:20.470
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

5471
02:27:20.470 --> 02:27:21.101
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

5472
02:27:21.101 --> 02:27:21.934
<v Speaker 6>That's how they would give.</v>

5473
02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:23.320
<v Speaker 6>That's how I would get them to talk.</v>

5474
02:27:23.530 --> 02:27:24.760
<v Speaker 6>They would give them Viagara.</v>

5475
02:27:24.850 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like something on the Internet.</v>

5476
02:27:26.201 --> 02:27:27.220
<v Speaker 6>That's what we know.</v>

5477
02:27:27.221 --> 02:27:32.221
<v Speaker 6>This is one of the government's main uses of bribery or main a main main items</v>

5478
02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:35.560
<v Speaker 6>that they would bribe people with.</v>

5479
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:36.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5480
02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:38.500
<v Speaker 6>because he's guys who get like 60 and they got 20 wives,</v>

5481
02:27:38.501 --> 02:27:39.610
<v Speaker 6>they can't fuck him anymore.</v>

5482
02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:41.111
<v Speaker 6>And then someone,</v>

5483
02:27:41.111 --> 02:27:42.940
<v Speaker 6>American GI comes along and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Let's take a lift up at the light.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what I know.</v>

5502

<v Speaker 6>Little blue pills among the way CIA wins,</v>

5505
02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:12.040
<v Speaker 6>I thought I was having a stroke that came on so fast.</v>

5506
02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:12.670
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>

5507
02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:15.040

5508
02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:18.790
<v Speaker 6>60 odd years and his bearded face bore the creases of a man burden with the</v>

5509

<v Speaker 6>duties as tribal patriarch and husband to for</v>

5543
02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:20.211
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

5544
02:29:20.211 --> 02:29:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I always hear about the boner post.</v>

5545
02:29:21.431 --> 02:29:21.591
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5546
02:29:21.591 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I get them because I'm in a wheelchair and the retard strength,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want you to like have these.</v>

5548
02:29:26.781 --> 02:29:30.020
<v Speaker 3>So he gave me a whole box of them and I took one,</v>

5549
02:29:30.021 --> 02:29:30.290
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

5550
02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:30.561
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5551
02:29:30.561 --> 02:29:33.230
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the retard strength.</v>

5552
02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

5553
02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:35.270
<v Speaker 3>really strong.</v>

5554
02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Like they're like,</v>

5555
02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:36.350
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5556
02:29:36.350 --> 02:29:37.850
<v Speaker 3>you know that nothing normal level.</v>

5557
02:29:37.890 --> 02:29:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5558
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:39.283
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5559
02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:40.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what that says.</v>

5560
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:41.743
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>

5561
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I think he said that really having a hard time understanding what you're saying.</v>

5562
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:46.343
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

5563
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:47.563
<v Speaker 3>I'm stone.</v>

5564
02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:51.800
<v Speaker 3>So he gave me the high,</v>

5565
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 3>high end versions of them and I took them and being used to the only the kinds</v>

5566
02:29:56.361 --> 02:29:57.440
<v Speaker 3>that you get at the store,</v>

5567
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:59.990
<v Speaker 3>they're like really like bitch versions,</v>

5568
02:29:59.991 --> 02:30:03.020
<v Speaker 3>like of what you can get at seven 11 for $6.</v>

5569
02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I just think that what you're getting at seven 11 is a lot of illegal steroids</v>

5570
02:30:06.891 --> 02:30:07.220
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

5571
02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:08.031
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

5572
02:30:08.031 --> 02:30:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Like you're taking something and you're just getting jacked up on testosterone.</v>

5573
02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:12.093
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5574
02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

5575
02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:13.720
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying if you want to,</v>

5576
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:14.051
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

5577
02:30:14.051 --> 02:30:14.810
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

5578
02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:15.770
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

5579
02:30:15.771 --> 02:30:17.790
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to fuck like a 21 year old and you're like,</v>

5580
02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I better do something right here.</v>

5581
02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying go with that one.</v>

5582
02:30:21.921 --> 02:30:23.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying is like,</v>

5583
02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the,</v>

5584
02:30:25.431 --> 02:30:26.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5585
02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:27.050
<v Speaker 3>the results.</v>

5586
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I think it sounds like you're right,</v>

5587
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:29.383
<v Speaker 3>it's swollen.</v>

5588
02:30:29.390 --> 02:30:32.450
<v Speaker 3>It would be a good idea to get that stuff tested.</v>

5589
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Find out exactly what's in it because I guarantee you they're not consistent.</v>

5590
02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

5591
02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:36.801
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

5592
02:30:36.801 --> 02:30:38.960
<v Speaker 3>And if you're just getting like just random shit from,</v>

5593
02:30:38.961 --> 02:30:42.500
<v Speaker 3>who knows where the lesion fake Viagra.</v>

5594
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:45.710
<v Speaker 3>But after looking at 4,000 different reports from the FDA,</v>

5595
02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:48.980
<v Speaker 3>they're all just like the worst steroids and it's just a teeny,</v>

5596
02:30:48.981 --> 02:30:50.360
<v Speaker 3>but it steroids in your Dick,</v>

5597
02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:50.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5598
02:30:50.841 --> 02:30:55.020
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it's you're pumping it in like a needle in your arm and I'm not a</v>

5599
02:30:55.021 --> 02:30:55.910
<v Speaker 3>UFC fighter.</v>

5600
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:57.220
<v Speaker 3>The stronger steroids,</v>

5601
02:30:57.221 --> 02:30:57.920
<v Speaker 3>there's some pretty,</v>

5602
02:30:57.920 --> 02:30:59.720
<v Speaker 3>well I don't see some of the stronger,</v>

5603
02:30:59.870 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 3>there's some really strong ones that you,</v>

5604
02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:01.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5605
02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 3>you eat their orals.</v>

5606
02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I think one of them,</v>

5607
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:06.770
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not correct,</v>

5608
02:31:06.771 --> 02:31:07.281
<v Speaker 3>there's just one.</v>

5609
02:31:07.281 --> 02:31:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I knew this bodybuilder guy was insane and he would take some shit called Anna</v>

5610
02:31:10.850 --> 02:31:11.820
<v Speaker 3>drawl 50,</v>

5611
02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:14.960
<v Speaker 3>which is supposed to be like one of the more liver toxic ones,</v>

5612
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:16.820
<v Speaker 3>but I can't remember whether it was,</v>

5613
02:31:16.821 --> 02:31:17.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5614
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 3>whether it was a one you ate or when you</v>

5615
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:20.873
<v Speaker 4>injected,</v>

5616
02:31:21.060 --> 02:31:22.590
<v Speaker 4>but the guys that were beyond that,</v>

5617
02:31:22.591 --> 02:31:22.781
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

5618
02:31:22.781 --> 02:31:23.431
<v Speaker 4>this buddy of mine,</v>

5619
02:31:23.431 --> 02:31:23.940
<v Speaker 4>he took it,</v>

5620
02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:25.000
<v Speaker 4>he was a serious body,</v>

5621
02:31:25.001 --> 02:31:25.740
<v Speaker 4>but there was also,</v>

5622
02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:26.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5623
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:28.650
<v Speaker 4>he became a Jiu Jitsu black belt and if saw him now,</v>

5624
02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:31.980
<v Speaker 4>you would never believe that he was a serious bodybuilder because he's like</v>

5625
02:31:31.981 --> 02:31:32.820
<v Speaker 4>really lean,</v>

5626
02:31:32.821 --> 02:31:33.840
<v Speaker 4>almost like a runner.</v>

5627
02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:34.921
<v Speaker 4>It's like a tall guy,</v>

5628
02:31:34.921 --> 02:31:37.410
<v Speaker 4>like maybe six to really strong,</v>

5629
02:31:37.411 --> 02:31:38.041
<v Speaker 4>like super,</v>

5630
02:31:38.041 --> 02:31:41.430
<v Speaker 4>super tight grip and great Jujitsu.</v>

5631
02:31:41.730 --> 02:31:42.270
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

5632
02:31:42.270 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 4>he was on this stuff,</v>

5633
02:31:43.141 --> 02:31:44.370
<v Speaker 4>this antique draw 50 shit.</v>

5634
02:31:44.610 --> 02:31:45.061
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

5635
02:31:45.061 --> 02:31:46.350
<v Speaker 4>some guy said something to him at a,</v>

5636
02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:47.370
<v Speaker 4>at a red light.</v>

5637
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:51.630
<v Speaker 4>And he said he didn't even realize what was happening until he was reaching</v>

5638
02:31:51.631 --> 02:31:53.220
<v Speaker 4>through the guy's window,</v>

5639
02:31:53.250 --> 02:31:54.330
<v Speaker 4>beating the shit out of him.</v>

5640
02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Like he sort of like woke up in the middle of beating the shit out of this guy,</v>

5641
02:31:59.191 --> 02:32:00.090
<v Speaker 4>parked his car.</v>

5642
02:32:00.091 --> 02:32:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Like some guy yelled at,</v>

5643
02:32:00.931 --> 02:32:01.141
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5644
02:32:01.141 --> 02:32:02.040
<v Speaker 4>fuck you old man,</v>

5645
02:32:02.041 --> 02:32:02.874
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

5646
02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:06.260
<v Speaker 4>And he snapped and said he didn't even read it.</v>

5647
02:32:06.261 --> 02:32:07.170
<v Speaker 4>And that's when he realized like,</v>

5648
02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:07.441
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5649
02:32:07.441 --> 02:32:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

5650
02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:08.940
<v Speaker 4>I can't be doing this anymore.</v>

5651
02:32:09.250 --> 02:32:10.200
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

5652
02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:12.600
<v Speaker 4>And he got away with it somehow or another,</v>

5653
02:32:12.601 --> 02:32:15.900
<v Speaker 4>he didn't get arrested or I don't know what he did to the guy.</v>

5654
02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:17.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this was Jujitsu training.</v>

5655
02:32:19.050 --> 02:32:20.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say the guy's name,</v>

5656
02:32:20.281 --> 02:32:22.010
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think this is when he was training Jujitsu.</v>

5657
02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:23.040
<v Speaker 4>So I think it was before,</v>

5658
02:32:23.041 --> 02:32:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it was just bodybuilding.</v>

5659
02:32:25.210 --> 02:32:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

5660
02:32:26.311 --> 02:32:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5661
02:32:26.490 --> 02:32:26.850
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

5662
02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:27.990
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's when you eat.</v>

5663
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:29.520
<v Speaker 4>I think that's an oral one.</v>

5664
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:34.760
<v Speaker 4>So if they took that stuff and put it in his fucking little dick pills that</v>

5665
02:32:35.341 --> 02:32:36.000
<v Speaker 4>might have a,</v>

5666
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.890
<v Speaker 4>it might have quite significant pop.</v>

5667
02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:38.980

02:33:02.941 --> 02:33:03.780
<v Speaker 7>a really great interview.</v>

5686
02:33:03.781 --> 02:33:04.620
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting.</v>

5687
02:33:04.621 --> 02:33:05.454
<v Speaker 7>If you're in a comedy,</v>

5688
02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:06.580
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't say it's amazing,</v>

5689
02:33:06.770 --> 02:33:08.550
<v Speaker 7>amazing opening eye opening,</v>

5690
02:33:08.551 --> 02:33:10.770
<v Speaker 7>how crazy it is.</v>

5691
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:10.941
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5692
02:33:10.941 --> 02:33:12.870
<v Speaker 7>that's who we were dealing with for a long time.</v>

5693
02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:13.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5694
02:33:13.090 --> 02:33:16.170
<v Speaker 7>that's the number one reason why I came back to the comedy store.</v>

5695
02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:18.480
<v Speaker 7>So I was just starting to group that.</v>

5696
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:20.970
<v Speaker 7>I was just on his podcast yesterday.</v>

5697
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:22.770
<v Speaker 7>I was the next person after Tommy,</v>

5698
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:26.850
<v Speaker 7>and that interview made me so mad that I kind of blew up a little bit on on his</v>

5699
02:33:26.851 --> 02:33:27.331
<v Speaker 7>podcast,</v>

5700
02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:28.740
<v Speaker 7>but what did you really talk about?</v>

5701
02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:33.170
<v Speaker 7>Boner pills and you can actually buy the ingredient,</v>

5702
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:35.820
<v Speaker 7>like a lot of ingredients on the Amazon and stuff like that,</v>

5703
02:33:35.821 --> 02:33:38.520
<v Speaker 7>that will give you the same results as like a boner pill that are healthy and</v>

5704
02:33:38.521 --> 02:33:40.100
<v Speaker 7>stuff like that as like sink.</v>

5705
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:41.950
<v Speaker 7>Can I stop you right here because I don't,</v>

5706
02:33:42.010 --> 02:33:43.500
<v Speaker 7>I've never needed it by Agra,</v>

5707
02:33:43.650 --> 02:33:45.720
<v Speaker 7>but I have friends that I like you that I can't imagine.</v>

5708
02:33:45.721 --> 02:33:47.520
<v Speaker 7>Need Avaya grow or a boat or pill.</v>

5709
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:48.331
<v Speaker 7>What does it do?</v>

5710
02:33:48.331 --> 02:33:48.750
<v Speaker 7>Does it?</v>

5711
02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:49.110
<v Speaker 7>Oh No.</v>

5712
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:51.570
<v Speaker 7>All I needed something that doesn't make me come as fast.</v>

5713
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:52.470
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

5714
02:33:52.470 --> 02:33:52.621
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

5715
02:33:52.621 --> 02:33:53.454
<v Speaker 7>That's different.</v>

5716
02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:55.273
<v Speaker 7>Alcohol.</v>

5717
02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:55.861
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

5718
02:33:55.861 --> 02:33:56.490
<v Speaker 7>I meant well,</v>

5719
02:33:56.490 --> 02:33:57.151
<v Speaker 7>I'm with my wife.</v>

5720
02:33:57.151 --> 02:34:01.320
<v Speaker 7>Like I would love something that made me not climax so quickly.</v>

5721
02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:02.173
<v Speaker 7>The hall,</v>

5722
02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:07.230
<v Speaker 7>well that doesn't work obviously the last time I find that lasts for three</v>

5723
02:34:07.231 --> 02:34:07.620
<v Speaker 7>hours.</v>

5724
02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:08.520
<v Speaker 7>Everybody's different.</v>

5725
02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:11.650
<v Speaker 7>But what does a biker dude,</v>

5726
02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:12.493
<v Speaker 7>is it like,</v>

5727
02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:14.110
<v Speaker 7>do you have a problem getting a hard to no,</v>

5728
02:34:14.111 --> 02:34:14.230
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

5729
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:15.040
<v Speaker 7>I don't</v>

5730
02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Vaso dilator.</v>

5731
02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:17.470
<v Speaker 4>It's what's is.</v>

5732
02:34:17.471 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 4>It's banned in the Olympics as a performance enhancing drug because it has a</v>

5733
02:34:21.161 --> 02:34:23.440
<v Speaker 4>beneficial effect on athletic performance,</v>

5734
02:34:23.441 --> 02:34:25.900
<v Speaker 4>a measurable effect on athletic performance,</v>

5735
02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:27.520
<v Speaker 4>and then it has something to do.</v>

5736
02:34:27.610 --> 02:34:28.810
<v Speaker 4>I might butcher this,</v>

5737
02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:33.610
<v Speaker 4>but with your body's production of nitric oxide,</v>

5738
02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:34.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what it is.</v>

5739
02:34:34.511 --> 02:34:39.511
<v Speaker 4>That stuff that's in like an o two Max and all these comp things and that stuff</v>

5740
02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:45.120
<v Speaker 4>apparently has a beneficial effect on a muscle and athletic performance that</v>

5741
02:34:45.431 --> 02:34:46.810
<v Speaker 4>nitric oxide stuff.</v>

5742
02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:48.050
<v Speaker 4>So you don't need it to,</v>

5743
02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:48.760
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

5744
02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.080
<v Speaker 4>you can get it to happen.</v>

5745
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5746
02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.570
<v Speaker 4>but it's not that it doesn't,</v>

5747
02:34:52.690 --> 02:34:53.800
<v Speaker 4>what is the way it works?</v>

5748
02:34:53.801 --> 02:34:56.660
<v Speaker 4>It's not that like Brian would just automatically get a harder out of nowhere.</v>

5749
02:34:56.661 --> 02:34:57.640
<v Speaker 4>It's just like will it,</v>

5750
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:01.120
<v Speaker 4>you'd still have to be in the presence for the girl that you thought was</v>

5751
02:35:01.121 --> 02:35:03.340
<v Speaker 4>attractive and you do it.</v>

5752
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:05.440
<v Speaker 4>It's just like you would normally,</v>

5753
02:35:05.470 --> 02:35:05.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5754
02:35:05.891 --> 02:35:06.521
<v Speaker 4>be attractive,</v>

5755
02:35:06.521 --> 02:35:07.690
<v Speaker 4>started making out with someone,</v>

5756
02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:11.020
<v Speaker 4>but your Dick would get hard as a fucking crow bar.</v>

5757
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:14.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything is dialed up to 10 it's like more like a swollen,</v>

5758
02:35:14.621 --> 02:35:15.950
<v Speaker 4>like a snake bite or big.</v>

5759
02:35:15.951 --> 02:35:16.784
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing.</v>

5760
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:18.520
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing is that it's a yes,</v>

5761
02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:20.800
<v Speaker 4>your dick is maximized.</v>

5762
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:22.350
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing is that it,</v>

5763
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:23.710
<v Speaker 4>it's your whole body.</v>

5764
02:35:24.130 --> 02:35:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Your whole body is experiencing this.</v>

5765
02:35:26.021 --> 02:35:27.790
<v Speaker 4>Like your muscles are experiencing this.</v>

5766
02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:29.560
<v Speaker 4>All of your muscles are experiencing this.</v>

5767
02:35:29.561 --> 02:35:30.730
<v Speaker 4>It's not just your deck.</v>

5768
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:32.140
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's not my goal.</v>

5769
02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.520
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really do anything for you.</v>

5770
02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:34.271
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5771
02:35:34.271 --> 02:35:34.451
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5772
02:35:34.451 --> 02:35:35.284
<v Speaker 4>it's not that,</v>

5773
02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:36.780
<v Speaker 4>that does not what I'm saying.</v>

5774
02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:38.890
<v Speaker 4>If you use it and run,</v>

5775
02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:41.700
<v Speaker 4>like if you did exercise and you did something,</v>

5776
02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:43.390
<v Speaker 4>you would have like more endurance,</v>

5777
02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:45.130
<v Speaker 4>you'd have more work output.</v>

5778
02:35:45.490 --> 02:35:49.090
<v Speaker 4>It could benefit you to a point in at least some way,</v>

5779
02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:51.460
<v Speaker 4>in a measurable way that the Olympic Committee is like nap.</v>

5780
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

5781
02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:52.771
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

5782
02:35:52.771 --> 02:35:54.040
<v Speaker 4>you can't have it in your system.</v>

5783
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:55.630
<v Speaker 4>I know cyclists have used it,</v>

5784
02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:56.510
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5785
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:57.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5786
02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:57.671
<v Speaker 4>if I took one,</v>

5787
02:35:57.671 --> 02:36:02.671
<v Speaker 4>I would just feel like a rock star in that my dick was bigger and I could fully</v>

5788
02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:06.370
<v Speaker 4>engorged like to the fullest.</v>

5789
02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:06.641
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

5790
02:36:06.641 --> 02:36:07.200
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

5791
02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:11.170
<v Speaker 4>I like at massage parlor is because you usually are too nervous.</v>

5792
02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Like where'd that girl is?</v>

5793
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:12.821
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5794
02:36:12.821 --> 02:36:16.000
<v Speaker 4>like working and you can't get hard or without touching herself,</v>

5795
02:36:16.001 --> 02:36:17.740
<v Speaker 4>you're just laying near your Dick's Grush.</v>

5796
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:19.060
<v Speaker 4>But when you flip over,</v>

5797
02:36:19.061 --> 02:36:21.850
<v Speaker 4>you want to have at nice healthy Dick's so she can take care of you.</v>

5798
02:36:22.050 --> 02:36:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5799
02:36:22.290 --> 02:36:23.950
<v Speaker 4>And so boner pills really help out.</v>

5800
02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Like in situations like that where you wouldn't have boner about encouraging</v>

5801
02:36:28.331 --> 02:36:29.530
<v Speaker 4>people to take those things,</v>

5802
02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:32.740
<v Speaker 4>you don't know who's gonna make the next batch.</v>

5803
02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:36.460
<v Speaker 4>This is the reality of having supplements that aren't really,</v>

5804
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:38.770
<v Speaker 4>they're not really examined the,</v>

5805
02:36:38.771 --> 02:36:39.640
<v Speaker 4>you just sell them.</v>

5806
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:42.880
<v Speaker 4>You know what the worst thing that happens is someone catches the fact that you</v>

5807
02:36:42.881 --> 02:36:44.080
<v Speaker 4>have a prescription drug in there,</v>

5808
02:36:44.081 --> 02:36:45.430
<v Speaker 4>like a Cialis or something like that.</v>

5809
02:36:45.940 --> 02:36:47.050
<v Speaker 4>And this is according to Aubrey.</v>

5810
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I asked him about it and he understands like the,</v>

5811
02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:54.370
<v Speaker 4>the rules on things like this and he said that what they do is they essentially</v>

5812
02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:58.450
<v Speaker 4>just find you and these people reopen under a different name and they just go</v>

5813
02:36:58.451 --> 02:36:59.231
<v Speaker 4>right back at it.</v>

5814
02:36:59.231 --> 02:36:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5815
02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:02.590
<v Speaker 4>Because they develop a reputation where people like Brian,</v>

5816
02:37:02.591 --> 02:37:03.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5817
02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:04.390
<v Speaker 4>they go in,</v>

5818
02:37:04.391 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 4>there's a little thing with the fucking lighters and the breath mints and the</v>

5819
02:37:07.361 --> 02:37:08.051
<v Speaker 4>boner pills.</v>

5820
02:37:08.051 --> 02:37:09.040
<v Speaker 4>They're right there at that.</v>

5821
02:37:09.041 --> 02:37:09.970
<v Speaker 4>Those things work.</v>

5822
02:37:10.390 --> 02:37:11.320
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're selling them.</v>

5823
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Then they're not placebos.</v>

5824
02:37:13.241 --> 02:37:17.420
<v Speaker 4>They fucking work and it's easy to get that stuff from China or wherever the</v>

5825
02:37:17.421 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 4>fuck they get it from Russia.</v>

5826
02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know whether they got to watch out some of the China,</v>

5827
02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:22.303
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5828
02:37:22.310 --> 02:37:25.970
<v Speaker 4>fake Viagra and stuff can actually contain like poison recently.</v>

5829
02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:27.111
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying,</v>

5830
02:37:27.111 --> 02:37:27.560
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

5831
02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:28.400
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>

5832
02:37:28.430 --> 02:37:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Don't be fucking around with that.</v>

5833
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:34.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean I had some stuff that I can still buy today that makes me trip.</v>

5834
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:35.600
<v Speaker 4>Like I started seeing visuals,</v>

5835
02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:37.880
<v Speaker 4>so I stopped with that one.</v>

5836
02:37:37.881 --> 02:37:39.300
<v Speaker 4>But I want to know what that,</v>

5837
02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:40.131
<v Speaker 4>that one is.</v>

5838
02:37:40.131 --> 02:37:42.920
<v Speaker 4>So I've been waiting for the FDA to that one.</v>

5839
02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:47.660
<v Speaker 4>That's what Anderson Silva got pop for when he got popped for steroids.</v>

5840
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:48.980
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't taking steroids.</v>

5841
02:37:48.981 --> 02:37:52.130
<v Speaker 4>He was taking a Viagra that was like from China.</v>

5842
02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:56.150
<v Speaker 4>And when they had made this stuff in the laboratory,</v>

5843
02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:00.530
<v Speaker 4>it was somehow or another contaminated by steroids.</v>

5844
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:02.030
<v Speaker 4>And he had to admit this,</v>

5845
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:02.870
<v Speaker 4>but this is,</v>

5846
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:04.730
<v Speaker 4>I know this from people in this camp,</v>

5847
02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:06.350
<v Speaker 4>like they were talking about things.</v>

5848
02:38:06.570 --> 02:38:07.730
<v Speaker 4>This isn't a made up story.</v>

5849
02:38:07.731 --> 02:38:09.680
<v Speaker 4>It's embarrassing and it's crazy.</v>

5850
02:38:09.681 --> 02:38:14.300
<v Speaker 4>But it's totally true when you buy stuff like from these random companies and</v>

5851
02:38:14.301 --> 02:38:15.134
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

5852
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:19.190
<v Speaker 4>there are some that do an awesome job of making sure that all of the</v>

5853
02:38:19.191 --> 02:38:19.731
<v Speaker 4>ingredients,</v>

5854
02:38:19.731 --> 02:38:21.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever you're buying from them are pure.</v>

5855
02:38:21.470 --> 02:38:22.670
<v Speaker 4>But there's some that just,</v>

5856
02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:24.620
<v Speaker 4>they don't bother to clean out the machinery.</v>

5857
02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:29.980
<v Speaker 4>So like if you have a vitamin B 12 and right before you had the vitamin B 12</v>

5858
02:38:30.051 --> 02:38:30.620
<v Speaker 4>order,</v>

5859
02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:31.850
<v Speaker 4>they had some other stuff in there,</v>

5860
02:38:31.851 --> 02:38:33.110
<v Speaker 4>some vitamin C or whatever.</v>

5861
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:37.160
<v Speaker 4>It could easily get mixed up in to a measurable amount and the amount that will</v>

5862
02:38:37.161 --> 02:38:38.390
<v Speaker 4>show up in a drug test.</v>

5863
02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:39.440
<v Speaker 4>It's possible.</v>

5864
02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:40.400
<v Speaker 4>It's totally possible.</v>

5865
02:38:40.401 --> 02:38:40.970
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>

5866
02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:42.590
<v Speaker 4>And when you looked at Anderson's results,</v>

5867
02:38:42.591 --> 02:38:45.020
<v Speaker 4>like he tested positive before the fight,</v>

5868
02:38:45.021 --> 02:38:50.021
<v Speaker 4>like outside of training and then he tested negative like I think at the weigh</v>

5869
02:38:51.051 --> 02:38:55.310
<v Speaker 4>ins and then positive or something along those lines.</v>

5870
02:38:55.311 --> 02:38:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Then positive after the fight.</v>

5871
02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:57.650
<v Speaker 4>It was like a,</v>

5872
02:38:57.650 --> 02:38:57.921
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

5873
02:38:57.921 --> 02:38:59.150
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make any sense.</v>

5874
02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:00.630
<v Speaker 4>And they were trying to figure out how,</v>

5875
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:02.030
<v Speaker 4>how was this happening?</v>

5876
02:39:02.031 --> 02:39:02.841
<v Speaker 4>Like this doesn't make any sense.</v>

5877
02:39:02.841 --> 02:39:06.440
<v Speaker 4>Like the steroids should stay in your system for a longer period of time.</v>

5878
02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:08.630
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense that they would be there at one time,</v>

5879
02:39:08.631 --> 02:39:09.590
<v Speaker 4>not be there another time.</v>

5880
02:39:09.591 --> 02:39:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Like what was the variable?</v>

5881
02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:15.350
<v Speaker 4>And then Anderson had to like come out and have like a press conference and said</v>

5882
02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:19.720
<v Speaker 4>that I took this weird Viagara shit and that's why the,</v>

5883
02:39:19.721 --> 02:39:20.930
<v Speaker 4>the tests were so odd.</v>

5884
02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:22.460
<v Speaker 4>What a weird world it is.</v>

5885
02:39:22.461 --> 02:39:25.820
<v Speaker 4>The world of like trying to figure out what you can get away with and what you</v>

5886
02:39:25.821 --> 02:39:27.890
<v Speaker 4>can't get away with a beat someone's ass better</v>

5887
02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:32.270
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't we were rolled the where you going to fucking figure out that it was</v>

5888
02:39:32.271 --> 02:39:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Viagra pills?</v>

5889
02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Well that's all I went to was like,</v>

5890
02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:35.780
<v Speaker 4>I guess he tested it.</v>

5891
02:39:35.810 --> 02:39:36.830
<v Speaker 4>What am I allergic to?</v>

5892
02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:38.210
<v Speaker 4>Type thing where you're like,</v>

5893
02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:39.470
<v Speaker 4>what did I have?</v>

5894
02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:40.453
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck,</v>

5895
02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.200
<v Speaker 4>I had this indigestion one day.</v>

5896
02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:44.310
<v Speaker 4>What was that until was like as a peanuts.</v>

5897
02:39:44.311 --> 02:39:44.601
<v Speaker 4>So you're like,</v>

5898
02:39:44.601 --> 02:39:45.434
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

5899
02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:46.770
<v Speaker 4>it was what a crazy world is.</v>

5900
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:47.601
<v Speaker 4>As you're telling the story,</v>

5901
02:39:47.601 --> 02:39:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't read your shirt and I went,</v>

5902
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:51.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you posted it,</v>

5903
02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:54.230
<v Speaker 4>but Roy Jones Jr is easily,</v>

5904
02:39:54.231 --> 02:39:55.130
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

5905
02:39:55.131 --> 02:39:58.190
<v Speaker 4>watching him fight the most beautiful fighter that ever lived.</v>

5906
02:39:58.310 --> 02:39:58.491
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5907
02:39:58.491 --> 02:39:58.820
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

5908
02:39:58.820 --> 02:39:58.971
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5909
02:39:58.971 --> 02:40:01.340
<v Speaker 4>if I had to choose my all time favorite boxer,</v>

5910
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:04.460
<v Speaker 4>either be Roy Jones Jr on Mike Tyson.</v>

5911
02:40:04.490 --> 02:40:06.710
<v Speaker 4>Those are my two all time favorite boxers.</v>

5912
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Tyson's knockout sizzle is fucking phenomenal.</v>

5913
02:40:10.191 --> 02:40:12.620
<v Speaker 4>But Roy Jones jr fighting.</v>

5914
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:13.561
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5915
02:40:13.561 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 4>both of them</v>

5916
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:17.850
<v Speaker 6>were just fucking incredible and in a different way.</v>

5917
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:18.061
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5918
02:40:18.061 --> 02:40:22.750
<v Speaker 6>Tyson was incredible and like a violent storm and Roy Jones Jr was just a</v>

5919
02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:23.311
<v Speaker 6>virtue.</v>

5920
02:40:23.311 --> 02:40:23.581
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

5921
02:40:23.581 --> 02:40:28.581
<v Speaker 6>So who could do shit that nobody else could do and reinvented how to engage Roy</v>

5922
02:40:28.770 --> 02:40:29.041
<v Speaker 6>Jones Jr,</v>

5923
02:40:29.041 --> 02:40:29.251
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5924
02:40:29.251 --> 02:40:30.540
<v Speaker 6>barely threw jabs,</v>

5925
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:30.961
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5926
02:40:30.961 --> 02:40:35.520
<v Speaker 6>John's would throw a lead left hook that was as fast as anybody else's jab and</v>

5927
02:40:35.521 --> 02:40:38.280
<v Speaker 6>he would crack Tudes with that shit off the back leg.</v>

5928
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.260
<v Speaker 6>And he would hit dudes and you would see their reaction to the speed of Roy's</v>

5929
02:40:43.261 --> 02:40:44.160
<v Speaker 6>punches and they'd be like,</v>

5930
02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.290
<v Speaker 6>oh my God.</v>

5931
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:50.190
<v Speaker 6>When they realize what a different level he was on.</v>

5932
02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:54.540
<v Speaker 6>Like one of my favorite Roy Jones Jr fights was Roy Jones jr versus Vinnie.</v>

5933
02:40:54.541 --> 02:40:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Patsy Enza because Vinny Pazienza because yeah,</v>

5934
02:40:57.721 --> 02:40:59.400
<v Speaker 6>he was going way up in his weight class.</v>

5935
02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:02.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean Vinnie was a much smaller guy and he said,</v>

5936
02:41:02.121 --> 02:41:02.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5937
02:41:02.371 --> 02:41:04.440
<v Speaker 6>he got real big and juiced up and he's,</v>

5938
02:41:04.770 --> 02:41:05.041
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5939
02:41:05.041 --> 02:41:05.880
<v Speaker 6>he's tough as shit,</v>

5940
02:41:05.881 --> 02:41:07.140
<v Speaker 6>but he was just too short.</v>

5941
02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:08.520
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't built for the weight class.</v>

5942
02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:13.290
<v Speaker 6>Vinnie pass came any fast fought Roy Jones and it was the only round ever where</v>

5943
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:17.790
<v Speaker 6>the copy box numbers showed the opponent landing zero punches,</v>

5944
02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:19.493
<v Speaker 6>zero.</v>

5945
02:41:20.130 --> 02:41:24.600
<v Speaker 6>Roy just lit him up like a Christmas tree and did whatever he wanted to the</v>

5946
02:41:24.601 --> 02:41:25.434
<v Speaker 6>point where</v>

5947
02:41:26.730 --> 02:41:28.410
<v Speaker 6>Vinny couldn't manage a single punch.</v>

5948
02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.910
<v Speaker 6>It had never been recorded before.</v>

5949
02:41:30.210 --> 02:41:31.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it has sense,</v>

5950
02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.360
<v Speaker 6>but that's how good Roy Jones was at the time and Roy Jones was beating his ass.</v>

5951
02:41:36.361 --> 02:41:38.730
<v Speaker 6>He knocked him down and he turned to the referee saying,</v>

5952
02:41:38.731 --> 02:41:39.750
<v Speaker 6>please stop this.</v>

5953
02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:40.831
<v Speaker 6>And the referee said,</v>

5954
02:41:40.831 --> 02:41:41.250
<v Speaker 6>nope,</v>

5955
02:41:41.250 --> 02:41:41.881
<v Speaker 6>keep fighting.</v>

5956
02:41:41.881 --> 02:41:42.210
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

5957
02:41:42.210 --> 02:41:43.043
<v Speaker 6>all right.</v>

5958
02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:47.600
<v Speaker 6>So he dove in with an uppercut cracked and like lifting him up in the air and,</v>

5959
02:41:47.601 --> 02:41:47.851
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5960
02:41:47.851 --> 02:41:49.140
<v Speaker 6>and planted them on the ground.</v>

5961
02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:50.070
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

5962
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:52.050
<v Speaker 6>He was a fucking,</v>

5963
02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:54.390
<v Speaker 6>when he was at his prime dude,</v>

5964
02:41:54.391 --> 02:41:56.040
<v Speaker 6>he was a marvel,</v>

5965
02:41:56.250 --> 02:41:58.020
<v Speaker 6>a marvel of movement.</v>

5966
02:41:58.290 --> 02:42:00.990
<v Speaker 6>Like he had a level of movement to him.</v>

5967
02:42:01.230 --> 02:42:06.180
<v Speaker 6>Like you can say that Bernard Hopkins might've been more fundamentally sound or</v>

5968
02:42:06.181 --> 02:42:06.541
<v Speaker 6>Julio,</v>

5969
02:42:06.541 --> 02:42:09.530
<v Speaker 6>Cesar Chavez might've had like a,</v>

5970
02:42:09.531 --> 02:42:10.860
<v Speaker 6>a more uh,</v>

5971
02:42:10.861 --> 02:42:15.190
<v Speaker 6>a more gritty in your face game cause Roy would kind of hang on the outside to</v>

5972
02:42:15.191 --> 02:42:18.000
<v Speaker 6>pick his shots and decide what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.</v>

5973
02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:22.200
<v Speaker 6>But when it comes to like movement does the best,</v>

5974
02:42:22.210 --> 02:42:22.770
<v Speaker 6>however,</v>

5975
02:42:22.770 --> 02:42:23.491
<v Speaker 6>nobody moved.</v>

5976
02:42:23.491 --> 02:42:24.210
<v Speaker 6>Like that guy,</v>

5977
02:42:24.210 --> 02:42:25.080
<v Speaker 6>nobody moved.</v>

5978
02:42:25.081 --> 02:42:25.914
<v Speaker 6>Like that guy,</v>

5979
02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:26.211
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5980
02:42:26.211 --> 02:42:28.500
<v Speaker 6>Jones jr there's a video of him,</v>

5981
02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:33.830
<v Speaker 6>this guy throws a punch and he counters with a a right left like a straight</v>

5982
02:42:34.171 --> 02:42:34.981
<v Speaker 6>right and oh no,</v>

5983
02:42:34.981 --> 02:42:35.261
<v Speaker 6>it was a,</v>

5984
02:42:35.261 --> 02:42:37.220
<v Speaker 6>a left hook and a right hand like that.</v>

5985
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:38.370
<v Speaker 6>And he counters with,</v>

5986
02:42:38.371 --> 02:42:39.360
<v Speaker 6>it's so fast,</v>

5987
02:42:39.361 --> 02:42:42.270
<v Speaker 6>like you can't even believe it's real and it's just like one of those little</v>

5988
02:42:42.271 --> 02:42:45.690
<v Speaker 6>quick vine clips and you just watch them go by that and you just,</v>

5989
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:49.170
<v Speaker 6>and the guy's like central nervous system just shut off.</v>

5990
02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:51.420
<v Speaker 6>There was a time for a few years.</v>

5991
02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:54.360
<v Speaker 6>Well he was just unstoppable force.</v>

5992
02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:55.253
<v Speaker 6>I missed it.</v>

5993
02:42:55.770 --> 02:42:57.000
<v Speaker 6>I missed it there man.</v>

5994
02:42:57.570 --> 02:42:58.170
<v Speaker 6>I was there.</v>

5995
02:42:58.170 --> 02:42:59.280
<v Speaker 6>I was watching the whole time.</v>

5996
02:42:59.550 --> 02:43:00.383
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't believe it.</v>

5997
02:43:00.810 --> 02:43:03.330
<v Speaker 6>He was so much better than everybody else at the time.</v>

5998
02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:04.830
<v Speaker 6>So much faster.</v>

5999
02:43:04.970 --> 02:43:07.560
<v Speaker 6>It was ridiculous when he fought James Toney,</v>

6000
02:43:07.770 --> 02:43:08.460
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

6001
02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:09.570
<v Speaker 6>he fought James.</v>

6002
02:43:09.571 --> 02:43:10.680
<v Speaker 6>Tony does the,</v>

6003
02:43:11.890 --> 02:43:13.750
<v Speaker 6>he fought the killer from Detroit.</v>

6004
02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:18.530
<v Speaker 6>He fought James Tony who was just a slick boxer with nasty knockout powers.</v>

6005
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:19.450
<v Speaker 6>Tough Shit.</v>

6006
02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:23.830
<v Speaker 6>And Roy Jones Jr just showed him another level of movement.</v>

6007
02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:25.000
<v Speaker 6>Just another level,</v>

6008
02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:26.373
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

6009
02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:27.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6010
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:28.120
<v Speaker 6>Dropped his hands.</v>

6011
02:43:28.121 --> 02:43:32.170
<v Speaker 6>And then Tony dropped his hands like in response and then Roy leaps in with a</v>

6012
02:43:32.171 --> 02:43:34.420
<v Speaker 6>left cook cracks right in the Chin and drop some.</v>

6013
02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:36.290
<v Speaker 6>And it was like this,</v>

6014
02:43:36.310 --> 02:43:36.610
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

6015
02:43:36.610 --> 02:43:37.000
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

6016
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.290
<v Speaker 6>don't fucking do what I'm doing,</v>

6017
02:43:38.291 --> 02:43:39.040
<v Speaker 6>bitch.</v>

6018
02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:41.500
<v Speaker 6>Like he was just on such a different level.</v>

6019
02:43:42.250 --> 02:43:42.730
<v Speaker 5>How's row?</v>

6020
02:43:42.730 --> 02:43:44.500
<v Speaker 5>How Royal House Roy Jones Jr.</v>

6021
02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:44.651
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6022
02:43:44.651 --> 02:43:45.520
<v Speaker 5>it's funny that I say that.</v>

6023
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.983
<v Speaker 5>I knew</v>

6024
02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:50.053
<v Speaker 5>I was good at</v>

6025
02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:52.300
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

6026
02:43:52.300 --> 02:43:54.220
<v Speaker 5>This is him and Vinny Pazienza band.</v>

6027
02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:56.830
<v Speaker 5>This was worth around where he gets to that zero.</v>

6028
02:43:56.980 --> 02:43:57.251
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6029
02:43:57.251 --> 02:43:57.810
<v Speaker 5>this is</v>

6030
02:43:57.810 --> 02:43:58.643
<v Speaker 6>fourth round.</v>

6031
02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:02.640
<v Speaker 6>There's glass jar and the Vinny Pazienza was a tough guy.</v>

6032
02:44:02.641 --> 02:44:04.530
<v Speaker 6>He knocked out my friend Dana Rosenblatt,</v>

6033
02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:08.430
<v Speaker 6>who is a guy that I used to train with back in the day in Boston under Joe Lake</v>

6034
02:44:08.970 --> 02:44:09.361
<v Speaker 6>was they,</v>

6035
02:44:09.361 --> 02:44:09.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6036
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:11.700
<v Speaker 6>a boxing coach that I knew from back then.</v>

6037
02:44:11.701 --> 02:44:13.820
<v Speaker 6>So I was a big fan of any patsy ends.</v>

6038
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:14.940
<v Speaker 6>He's tough as shit,</v>

6039
02:44:15.210 --> 02:44:18.090
<v Speaker 6>but he was really like way out of his weight class.</v>

6040
02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:20.130
<v Speaker 6>Roy was so much bigger than him,</v>

6041
02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:21.121
<v Speaker 6>so that Vinny,</v>

6042
02:44:21.121 --> 02:44:23.970
<v Speaker 6>even though he was a big guy because he had all that muscle on him,</v>

6043
02:44:23.971 --> 02:44:27.690
<v Speaker 6>his actual frame was nowhere near the frame of Royce,</v>

6044
02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:27.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6045
02:44:27.961 --> 02:44:29.100
<v Speaker 6>he was more like a guy.</v>

6046
02:44:29.490 --> 02:44:32.610
<v Speaker 6>He fought a lot of like really tough guys that lower weight class too.</v>

6047
02:44:32.611 --> 02:44:33.271
<v Speaker 6>But you look at them there,</v>

6048
02:44:33.271 --> 02:44:34.620
<v Speaker 6>he looks almost like a bodybuilder.</v>

6049
02:44:34.970 --> 02:44:35.650
<v Speaker 5>He does.</v>

6050
02:44:35.650 --> 02:44:36.500
<v Speaker 5>Finney pass.</v>

6051
02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:36.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

6052
02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.920
<v Speaker 5>and his training partner came out to a show that I did in,</v>

6053
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6054
02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:45.290
<v Speaker 5>New Jersey with Mr Sandman.</v>

6055
02:44:47.390 --> 02:44:48.230
<v Speaker 5>I think I want to say.</v>

6056
02:44:48.231 --> 02:44:49.064
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

6057
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:50.200
<v Speaker 5>Dude is crazy watching</v>

6058
02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:51.033
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

6059
02:44:51.310 --> 02:44:52.810
<v Speaker 6>You forget how fast Roy was.</v>

6060
02:44:53.890 --> 02:44:55.420
<v Speaker 6>There's just no one liked him at the time,</v>

6061
02:44:55.421 --> 02:44:55.840
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6062
02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:56.201
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

6063
02:44:56.201 --> 02:45:00.190
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that really messed with Roy was that when Roy Nelson was in</v>

6064
02:45:00.191 --> 02:45:01.090
<v Speaker 6>his prime,</v>

6065
02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:04.390
<v Speaker 6>there was a guy named Gerald Mcclellan and Gerald Mcclellan was,</v>

6066
02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:07.060
<v Speaker 6>I want to say he was a light heavyweight champion.</v>

6067
02:45:07.570 --> 02:45:08.410
<v Speaker 6>Gerald McClellan.</v>

6068
02:45:08.411 --> 02:45:09.190
<v Speaker 6>How do I know that name?</v>

6069
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:12.550
<v Speaker 6>Gerald McClellan was a famous boxer who was a world champion.</v>

6070
02:45:12.551 --> 02:45:13.540
<v Speaker 6>I want to say light heavyweight,</v>

6071
02:45:13.541 --> 02:45:13.901
<v Speaker 6>but I might,</v>

6072
02:45:13.901 --> 02:45:15.160
<v Speaker 6>I might be incorrect.</v>

6073
02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:17.440
<v Speaker 6>And Gerald was,</v>

6074
02:45:17.441 --> 02:45:18.100
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6075
02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:20.830
<v Speaker 6>one of the guys from the Croc Jim under manual Stewart.</v>

6076
02:45:21.170 --> 02:45:21.490
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6077
02:45:21.490 --> 02:45:23.260
<v Speaker 6>He was just Merkin people,</v>

6078
02:45:23.261 --> 02:45:23.591
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6079
02:45:23.591 --> 02:45:24.550
<v Speaker 6>He was a nasty,</v>

6080
02:45:24.551 --> 02:45:25.540
<v Speaker 6>he was so good.</v>

6081
02:45:26.050 --> 02:45:28.150
<v Speaker 6>And he fought this dude named Nigel Benn.</v>

6082
02:45:28.190 --> 02:45:29.470
<v Speaker 6>They fought in Italy or in,</v>

6083
02:45:29.471 --> 02:45:30.000
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6084
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:30.370
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6085
02:45:30.370 --> 02:45:31.203
<v Speaker 6>England rather.</v>

6086
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:34.690
<v Speaker 6>And it was his why I believe it was England wild,</v>

6087
02:45:34.691 --> 02:45:36.070
<v Speaker 6>crazy ass fight.</v>

6088
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:40.240
<v Speaker 6>And a Nigel Benn went through the ropes in the first round and cheer on</v>

6089
02:45:40.241 --> 02:45:41.830
<v Speaker 6>Mcclellan was just putting it on him.</v>

6090
02:45:42.310 --> 02:45:44.080
<v Speaker 6>And then later in the fight,</v>

6091
02:45:44.081 --> 02:45:45.100
<v Speaker 6>something happened.</v>

6092
02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:45.820
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

6093
02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:48.700
<v Speaker 6>there was like a clash of heads and Nigel Benn went,</v>

6094
02:45:48.701 --> 02:45:49.211
<v Speaker 6>or a,</v>

6095
02:45:49.211 --> 02:45:52.540
<v Speaker 6>and then Jeremy Mclellan went down to one knee and then he quit the fight and</v>

6096
02:45:52.541 --> 02:45:52.841
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>

6097
02:45:52.841 --> 02:45:53.591
<v Speaker 6>we can't believe this.</v>

6098
02:45:53.591 --> 02:45:54.424
<v Speaker 6>The fights over.</v>

6099
02:45:54.730 --> 02:45:59.200
<v Speaker 6>And then he collapsed in his corner and he had some serious brain bleeding man</v>

6100
02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:00.131
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

6101
02:46:00.131 --> 02:46:00.431
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6102
02:46:00.431 --> 02:46:03.220
<v Speaker 6>went to the hospital and they did their best to alleviate it.</v>

6103
02:46:03.221 --> 02:46:05.140
<v Speaker 6>But to this day he's blind.</v>

6104
02:46:05.170 --> 02:46:06.310
<v Speaker 6>He can't walk.</v>

6105
02:46:06.430 --> 02:46:07.720
<v Speaker 6>He's in a wheelchair,</v>

6106
02:46:07.930 --> 02:46:08.800
<v Speaker 6>he's all fucked up.</v>

6107
02:46:08.801 --> 02:46:09.531
<v Speaker 6>He has a very,</v>

6108
02:46:09.531 --> 02:46:10.280
<v Speaker 6>very short</v>

6109
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:11.690
<v Speaker 3>memory of life,</v>

6110
02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:11.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6111
02:46:11.991 --> 02:46:12.310
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

6112
02:46:12.310 --> 02:46:16.490
<v Speaker 3>of who he was and his capacities been like radically diminished.</v>

6113
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6114
02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:18.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6115
02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:18.770
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>

6116
02:46:18.770 --> 02:46:21.020
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy that people were saying one day,</v>

6117
02:46:21.021 --> 02:46:21.621
<v Speaker 3>Roy Jones,</v>

6118
02:46:21.621 --> 02:46:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Jr and Gerald Mcclellan are going to fight.</v>

6119
02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:24.710
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be crazy.</v>

6120
02:46:24.711 --> 02:46:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Cause Jerrel was a monster.</v>

6121
02:46:26.570 --> 02:46:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Gerald was a monster and now you know that Gerald got fucked up.</v>

6122
02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it affected Roy Jones.</v>

6123
02:46:34.370 --> 02:46:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it affected him like psychologically where he realized like,</v>

6124
02:46:37.461 --> 02:46:37.671
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

6125
02:46:37.671 --> 02:46:38.990
<v Speaker 3>that could happen to that guy.</v>

6126
02:46:39.290 --> 02:46:40.400
<v Speaker 3>That can happen to me too,</v>

6127
02:46:40.810 --> 02:46:41.121
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

6128
02:46:41.121 --> 02:46:43.760
<v Speaker 3>And so he fought a lot more smart,</v>

6129
02:46:43.850 --> 02:46:45.080
<v Speaker 3>took less risks,</v>

6130
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:45.710
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

6131
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:46.730
<v Speaker 3>But how many concussions,</v>

6132
02:46:46.731 --> 02:46:47.271
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

6133
02:46:47.271 --> 02:46:47.591
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about,</v>

6134
02:46:47.591 --> 02:46:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I started this before.</v>

6135
02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:50.630
<v Speaker 3>How many concussions do you think is too many?</v>

6136
02:46:51.350 --> 02:46:53.450
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question because I've had,</v>

6137
02:46:53.451 --> 02:46:54.590
<v Speaker 3>I definitely had seven,</v>

6138
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

6139
02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:56.900
<v Speaker 3>And he's a grown man.</v>

6140
02:46:56.901 --> 02:46:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Has to at least have five</v>

6141
02:47:01.220 --> 02:47:02.540
<v Speaker 3>by the time you're 18.</v>

6142
02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6143
02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:05.680
<v Speaker 3>I definitely had at least by,</v>

6144
02:47:05.681 --> 02:47:06.830
<v Speaker 3>but by the time I was 18,</v>

6145
02:47:06.831 --> 02:47:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I think I gave one to myself the other day.</v>

6146
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:10.160
<v Speaker 3>I bent down,</v>

6147
02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I told you about this.</v>

6148
02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been down in my happy,</v>

6149
02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:13.370
<v Speaker 3>like a sleigh bed thing,</v>

6150
02:47:13.371 --> 02:47:14.204
<v Speaker 3>like a wooden thing.</v>

6151
02:47:14.250 --> 02:47:18.050
<v Speaker 3>It just cracked my head really hard on the corner and like picking up a shoe,</v>

6152
02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:18.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

6153
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:19.790
<v Speaker 3>and I saw the flash of light.</v>

6154
02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I just laid down.</v>

6155
02:47:20.751 --> 02:47:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6156
02:47:21.010 --> 02:47:21.231
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

6157
02:47:21.231 --> 02:47:22.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not passing or not passing out.</v>

6158
02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:23.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6159
02:47:23.271 --> 02:47:24.590
<v Speaker 3>You probably give yourself a concussion.</v>

6160
02:47:24.591 --> 02:47:25.424
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6161
02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6162
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6163
02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.750
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to talk to a test.</v>

6164
02:47:30.260 --> 02:47:32.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you had to ballpark it.</v>

6165
02:47:33.050 --> 02:47:33.171
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6166
02:47:33.171 --> 02:47:33.500
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>

6167
02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:34.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll ballpark mine that.</v>

6168
02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I've had a couple for sure.</v>

6169
02:47:35.810 --> 02:47:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I've definitely had a couple,</v>

6170
02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:39.250
<v Speaker 3>but like I think everyone's had a car.</v>

6171
02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:39.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I've,</v>

6172
02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:41.240
<v Speaker 3>I've had a couple of go to the hospital,</v>

6173
02:47:41.241 --> 02:47:42.000
<v Speaker 3>a couple,</v>

6174
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:42.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6175
02:47:42.590 --> 02:47:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I've had two definitive ones ride to go to a hospital for them.</v>

6176
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:50.150
<v Speaker 3>See the problem with sparring all the time is you get them and you don't know if</v>

6177
02:47:50.151 --> 02:47:52.580
<v Speaker 3>you got them or not because you're not going to a doctor.</v>

6178
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:55.760
<v Speaker 3>So there was nights where I would just lay in bed and my head would be</v>

6179
02:47:55.761 --> 02:47:56.594
<v Speaker 3>throbbing,</v>

6180
02:47:56.810 --> 02:47:57.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6181
02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:58.160
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>

6182
02:47:58.430 --> 02:48:02.240
<v Speaker 3>me and some other meat had beaten the fuck out of each other in the gym.</v>

6183
02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Just doing boxing,</v>

6184
02:48:04.581 --> 02:48:06.260
<v Speaker 3>sparring or kickboxing sparring.</v>

6185
02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6186
02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:08.040
<v Speaker 3>that's there.</v>

6187
02:48:08.090 --> 02:48:11.470
<v Speaker 3>There had to be a bunch that had to be like three or four in there.</v>

6188
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:12.830
<v Speaker 3>When your heart problem memory,</v>

6189
02:48:13.390 --> 02:48:14.390
<v Speaker 3>my memory is excellent.</v>

6190
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:15.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6191
02:48:15.410 --> 02:48:15.651
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6192
02:48:15.651 --> 02:48:19.190
<v Speaker 3>and it's only excellent about things I care about though.</v>

6193
02:48:19.310 --> 02:48:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

6194
02:48:19.850 --> 02:48:21.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's just my mind.</v>

6195
02:48:21.230 --> 02:48:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

6196
02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:23.180
<v Speaker 3>when I don't give a fuck about something,</v>

6197
02:48:23.181 --> 02:48:24.230
<v Speaker 3>like it's gone.</v>

6198
02:48:24.350 --> 02:48:24.950
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

6199
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I have developed this over the years.</v>

6200
02:48:26.901 --> 02:48:27.734
<v Speaker 3>It's just my,</v>

6201
02:48:28.130 --> 02:48:28.461
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

6202
02:48:28.461 --> 02:48:28.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6203
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:30.320
<v Speaker 3>style of focusing on things.</v>

6204
02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:31.580
<v Speaker 3>If I don't give a fuck about something,</v>

6205
02:48:31.581 --> 02:48:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't pay any attention to it.</v>

6206
02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I just can't because I know how,</v>

6207
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:36.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6208
02:48:36.021 --> 02:48:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I know how my brain works.</v>

6209
02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:38.600
<v Speaker 3>So what I know about,</v>

6210
02:48:38.601 --> 02:48:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I know about and what I don't give a fuck about.</v>

6211
02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:42.080
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>

6212
02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:42.913
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

6213
02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't just don't remember things.</v>

6214
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I remember things that are super important,</v>

6215
02:48:47.270 --> 02:48:49.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's never like I look at the fucking where my car is.</v>

6216
02:48:49.220 --> 02:48:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>

6217
02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:50.570
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck my car?</v>

6218
02:48:51.230 --> 02:48:51.980
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

6219
02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:52.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6220
02:48:52.281 --> 02:48:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

6221
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

6222
02:48:53.050 --> 02:48:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've had,</v>

6223
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I've definitely feel like I might be on the upside of concussions,</v>

6224
02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:59.880
<v Speaker 3>but do you mean by the other gang?</v>

6225
02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:01.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the higher end of the higher end from,</v>

6226
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:03.163
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6227
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:04.213
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6228
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:06.170
<v Speaker 3>if you're not experiencing any problems,</v>

6229
02:49:06.171 --> 02:49:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't worry about it.</v>

6230
02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 3>I think experiencing</v>

6231
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.570
<v Speaker 4>problems would be pretty obvious.</v>

6232
02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:10.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6233
02:49:10.410 --> 02:49:15.410
<v Speaker 4>Once you start having like real problems like memory problems or if you heard of</v>

6234
02:49:15.421 --> 02:49:15.930
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6235
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:19.680
<v Speaker 4>the guy who was the quarterback for the Chicago bears.</v>

6236
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Jim McMann.</v>

6237
02:49:20.430 --> 02:49:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6238
02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:21.710
<v Speaker 4>For Tinder.</v>

6239
02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:23.010
<v Speaker 4>Perry was that the test?</v>

6240
02:49:23.011 --> 02:49:23.880
<v Speaker 4>If I could remember his name,</v>

6241
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:25.620
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to remember his name as I was saying it,</v>

6242
02:49:26.010 --> 02:49:26.970
<v Speaker 4>but he was the,</v>

6243
02:49:26.971 --> 02:49:27.271
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6244
02:49:27.271 --> 02:49:27.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6245
02:49:27.481 --> 02:49:28.350
<v Speaker 4>the star of the Superbowl.</v>

6246
02:49:28.351 --> 02:49:30.780
<v Speaker 4>That guy was an animal and now he's all fucked up.</v>

6247
02:49:30.781 --> 02:49:33.390
<v Speaker 4>There was a sports illustrated article I read about them when they're talking</v>

6248

6279
02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:31.960
<v Speaker 5>Like if they said just jump on your side.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He'll hold a football and jump on your side.</v>

6281
02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:37.600

6282
02:50:38.110 --> 02:50:38.891
<v Speaker 5>In a lot of ways,</v>

6283
02:50:38.891 --> 02:50:39.410
<v Speaker 5>you've got to think</v>

6284
02:50:39.410 --> 02:50:44.410
<v Speaker 4>like playing football is one of the most courageous sports because at least in a</v>

6285
02:50:44.691 --> 02:50:48.080
<v Speaker 4>fight you only have one dude and if you're better than that guy,</v>

6286
02:50:48.081 --> 02:50:49.520
<v Speaker 4>you can control the action.</v>

6287
02:50:49.521 --> 02:50:50.590
<v Speaker 4>If you understand what's going on,</v>

6288
02:50:50.610 --> 02:50:52.250
<v Speaker 4>you can control it to a certain extent.</v>

6289
02:50:52.310 --> 02:50:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6290
02:50:52.940 --> 02:50:56.540
<v Speaker 4>Like Bernard Hopkins is still fighting into his fifties right?</v>

6291
02:50:56.541 --> 02:50:57.380
<v Speaker 4>He's 50 now.</v>

6292
02:50:57.410 --> 02:51:00.500
<v Speaker 4>He's still fighting and he's still like at a world class level.</v>

6293
02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:03.770
<v Speaker 4>You know he beat some guy when he was 49 for a title.</v>

6294
02:51:04.110 --> 02:51:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6295
02:51:04.310 --> 02:51:05.061
<v Speaker 4>this is insane,</v>

6296
02:51:05.061 --> 02:51:05.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6297
02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:05.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6298
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:06.343
<v Speaker 4>Why does he do that?</v>

6299
02:51:06.350 --> 02:51:08.570
<v Speaker 4>He does it because he can control the action.</v>

6300
02:51:08.571 --> 02:51:12.740
<v Speaker 4>He controls it like he makes sure that he's in the right position at all times.</v>

6301
02:51:12.890 --> 02:51:15.320
<v Speaker 4>He's constantly controlling exactly what's going on.</v>

6302
02:51:16.090 --> 02:51:16.721
<v Speaker 5>Dot Hopkins.</v>

6303
02:51:16.721 --> 02:51:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Is it only black?</v>

6304
02:51:17.410 --> 02:51:18.730
<v Speaker 5>Our wives ever wanted the fuck.</v>

6305
02:51:18.790 --> 02:51:20.770
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

6306
02:51:21.290 --> 02:51:21.911

6442
02:54:11.290 --> 02:54:12.280
<v Speaker 3>what if we had like a,</v>

6443
02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:17.320
<v Speaker 3>like a stripping material just to like fucking make it perfect and you give it</v>

6444
02:54:17.321 --> 02:54:17.770
<v Speaker 3>to a guy,</v>

6445
02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:17.951
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

6446
02:54:17.951 --> 02:54:21.540
<v Speaker 3>once a month jack off of this new Dick will be like fucking captain Griffin.</v>

6447
02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Brand new.</v>

6448
02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6449
02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.760
<v Speaker 3>but I think you would miss your veins,</v>

6450
02:54:25.610 --> 02:54:26.443
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6451
02:54:26.470 --> 02:54:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6452
02:54:26.860 --> 02:54:28.300
<v Speaker 3>If you had just like a smooth,</v>

6453
02:54:28.301 --> 02:54:30.520
<v Speaker 3>weird fake cylinder looking deck,</v>

6454
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:32.860
<v Speaker 3>even if it felt good like an Andy Warhol Dick,</v>

6455
02:54:33.370 --> 02:54:34.090
<v Speaker 3>what do you prefer?</v>

6456
02:54:34.090 --> 02:54:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Here's perfect example.</v>

6457
02:54:35.170 --> 02:54:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you prefer big stretched out fake tits or big real tits?</v>

6458
02:54:41.980 --> 02:54:42.071
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6459
02:54:42.071 --> 02:54:42.390
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

6460
02:54:42.390 --> 02:54:43.900
<v Speaker 3>real big.</v>

6461
02:54:44.470 --> 02:54:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

6462
02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Because a real cause when you've tried to go to the nipple,</v>

6463
02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:48.500
<v Speaker 3>it slips away from you.</v>

6464
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Like someone tried to get to a different arcade,</v>

6465
02:54:50.051 --> 02:54:52.540
<v Speaker 3>grabs your dick and it feels like a FedEx tube</v>

6466
02:54:55.790 --> 02:55:00.790
<v Speaker 3>this perfectly round and smooth and you just want to fucking stick a fishing rod</v>

6467
02:55:01.241 --> 02:55:02.074
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

6468
02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I said a tube for mailing things.</v>

6469
02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:06.081
<v Speaker 3>That's not a dick.</v>

6470
02:55:06.081 --> 02:55:06.351
<v Speaker 3>Dick's,</v>

6471
02:55:06.351 --> 02:55:07.430
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be uneven.</v>

6472
02:55:07.431 --> 02:55:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Just like nipples.</v>

6473
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

6474
02:55:09.050 --> 02:55:11.660
<v Speaker 3>if you got like if you look at a girl's nipple,</v>

6475
02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:12.503
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

6476
02:55:12.670 --> 02:55:14.090
<v Speaker 3>if you get really close to it,</v>

6477
02:55:14.091 --> 02:55:15.290
<v Speaker 3>like a magnifying glass,</v>

6478
02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:16.550
<v Speaker 3>it's chaos.</v>

6479
02:55:16.700 --> 02:55:17.990
<v Speaker 3>It's all sorts of stuff going on there.</v>

6480
02:55:17.991 --> 02:55:19.370
<v Speaker 3>The skin is all crazy.</v>

6481
02:55:19.371 --> 02:55:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

6482
02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:24.760
<v Speaker 3>like the butt of an artichoke artichoke heart mark and says loose Morgan Freeman</v>

6483
02:55:25.431 --> 02:55:26.420
<v Speaker 3>moles or whatever.</v>

6484
02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:26.791
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

6485
02:55:26.791 --> 02:55:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Smalls are these little dots all around it,</v>

6486
02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

6487
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:31.700
<v Speaker 3>But it's beautiful in its imperfection.</v>

6488
02:55:31.701 --> 02:55:33.680
<v Speaker 3>That's like half of the thrill of it.</v>

6489
02:55:33.890 --> 02:55:36.650
<v Speaker 3>If it was just completely doll,</v>

6490
02:55:36.651 --> 02:55:40.780
<v Speaker 3>like and smooth on the nipple and then smooth and the area,</v>

6491
02:55:40.781 --> 02:55:44.240
<v Speaker 3>oh La and then the breasts where there's no veins,</v>

6492
02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:45.253
<v Speaker 3>there was it,</v>

6493
02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:46.910
<v Speaker 3>it was just smooth,</v>

6494
02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:47.480
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

6495
02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:48.980
<v Speaker 3>like a bowl of Jello,</v>

6496
02:55:49.010 --> 02:55:50.030
<v Speaker 3>like a Broadway show.</v>

6497
02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:50.390
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

6498

<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

6499
02:55:50.750 --> 02:55:52.190
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking robot man.</v>

6500
02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:53.180
<v Speaker 3>You know we didn't want that.</v>

6501
02:55:53.210 --> 02:55:54.030
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't want that.</v>

6502
02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:54.863
<v Speaker 3>Might look at it though.</v>

6503

6505

6506
02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:03.261
<v Speaker 3>The dirtiness,</v>

6507

02:56:52.310 --> 02:56:53.260
<v Speaker 3>Sock mark.</v>

6538
02:56:53.310 --> 02:56:54.980
<v Speaker 3>So I just got back from Columbus,</v>

6539
02:56:54.981 --> 02:56:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Ohio and you're not allowed to be naked there.</v>

6540
02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:59.030
<v Speaker 3>And so all the girls had pastries,</v>

6541
02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.880
<v Speaker 3>but they would have like darker nipple looking pasty.</v>

6542
02:57:01.881 --> 02:57:04.290
<v Speaker 3>So it looked like they all just had really big area,</v>

6543
02:57:04.291 --> 02:57:06.380
<v Speaker 3>all that dark Ariel and now it's ridiculous.</v>

6544
02:57:06.381 --> 02:57:11.030
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a thin rubber sheet over the outside of your nipple and if you</v>

6545
02:57:11.031 --> 02:57:13.850
<v Speaker 3>go outside you could just take her shirt off cause it's legal in Columbus,</v>

6546
02:57:13.851 --> 02:57:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Ohio to just take your shirt off outside.</v>

6547
02:57:15.770 --> 02:57:17.480
<v Speaker 3>But when you're inside at the Strip club,</v>

6548
02:57:17.481 --> 02:57:18.200
<v Speaker 3>you have to put page.</v>

6549
02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:19.190
<v Speaker 3>These are in Columbus.</v>

6550
02:57:19.191 --> 02:57:20.880
<v Speaker 3>It's legal to be topless if you're a woman,</v>

6551
02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:22.590
<v Speaker 3>been there for forever.</v>

6552
02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:22.940
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6553
02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:24.170
<v Speaker 3>you can just walk around with nuts.</v>

6554
02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:25.130
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

6555
02:57:25.131 --> 02:57:26.150
<v Speaker 3>What a dumb business.</v>
