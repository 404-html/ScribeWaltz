WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
They're friendly that that's like the biggest compliment ever.
Ready?
Wait,

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.020
Neil may all love flash flashlight.
That voice is the voice of Neal Brennan.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.750
If you don't know where we going he be right now.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.770
He was a co creator of the Chappelle show.
Shut up.

5
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:20.460
Don't [inaudible] on that.
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't hate.
There's a lot to do.

6
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.890
It's just because you can get ahold of a guy on Twitter.
Go.
Yeah,

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.270
we know you were the full post,
your Kolbe fucking creator,
whatever you were,

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:32.220
dude.
Yeah.
Next,
next day.
What else did you do?

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.620
People don't want to hear that man.
They don't want to hear that.

10
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.980
The actual truth.
Meanwhile,
if it was them,
God damn,

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.810
they never stopped talking about.
Yeah.
People look,
if they don't,

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.040
if you don't know Neil Brennan,

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.920
he deserves to be recognized for what he has accomplished.

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.150
I just serve that bitch.
He also deserves a free flashlight.
Would you like one?

15
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.120
Yeah,
I would love one.
I got good one for you.
A fresh new one.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.700
A new package of them were sponsored by the first slide.

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.920
There's nothing in that one,
Brian,

18
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.020
because you sucked it out like a fucking Weirdo.

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.030
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and entering

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.910
the code name,
Rogan,

21
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.960
you will save yourself 15% off on excellent masturbation tool.

22
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.690
It's a real good product.
And Gentlemen,
if it wasn't,

23
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.630
we wouldn't get behind it here at the Joe Rogan experience.

24
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.280
We're also brought to you by on it.
That's o,
n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain,

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.620
which is a cognitive enhancing supplement.

26
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.730
If you want to learn all about the various things that we have,
shroom tech,

27
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.900
sport,
shroom,
tech,

28
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:32.901
immune and five eights the room part shroom is at quarter steps mushroom.

29
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.510
So for one of them,
I don't know what the immune,

30
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.130
the immune one is cause it's not [inaudible].
No,
no,
no,
no.
I thought it was just

31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.890
selling that you imagined.
How dare you know it's uh,

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.220
there's certain mushrooms that they found that people eat in high altitudes to

33
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:54.660
help them deal with the low air out there and enables your body somehow or

34
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.600
another to process oxygen more effectively.

35
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.550
And it's mixed with other stuff that's really good for you too.

36
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.690
Like it's got a lot of B12 in it.
So together it's a good pre workout supplement.

37
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.360
I take it before Jujitsu or four kettlebells or something like that,

38
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
like 45 minutes before I,
I definitely think
it's awesome.

39
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.580
It's the best because it doesn't take a long time.
No,
you can get blasted out.

40
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.310
I'm minutes lasted bro.
Whoa.
You are,
you are.
We're,

41
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.230
we're on it.
We're making kettlebells as well and that should be really soon.

42
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.680
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would like to preorder.
We got,
dude,
I'll get you some.
We got,
uh,

43
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.620
we're going to have regular kettlebells.

44
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:32.700
We are going to make them the best we can make them and ship them the cheapest

45
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:35.000
we can ship them and sell them the cheapest we could sound.

46
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.010
That's the goal with that is that,
cause I,
I went and bought,

47
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:42.750
they're super expensive.
I bought one,
it's like a dollar a pound dog.

48
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:47.220
Pound's normal.
So 70 pounds,
like a $70 purchase for this one piece of metal.

49
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.430
The Real Bitch,
ladies and gentlemen is shipping these things.

50
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.640
That's where it's going to,
well that's what I went to the valley and bought one.

51
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.740
Yeah like I,

52
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.500
cause I wanted to ship it so we're going to have two different lines kettlebells

53
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.010
and here's what's up.
We're going to have the regular kettle bells that were,

54
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:08.011
we're going to sell and make as as inexpensive but high quality.

55
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.310
It has to be high quality first.
It has to be done to the right dimensions.

56
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.330
It has to,
the grip has to be the right size.
There's a,

57
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.180
that all has to be taken into account for first and then we have to sell it as

58
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.640
cheap as possible and ship it as cheap as possible.

59
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.070
The idea is to make it as the most,
the mic.

60
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.820
I'm like the most affordable kettle bells that are the best quality you can get.

61
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.900
That's the goal.

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.870
That's 100% of the problem says we don't have to advertise anywhere else.

63
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.300
We're going to see like you know,
I think people respond to it.

64
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:36.940
And have you seen prototypes of them?
I'm like are you already have one?

65
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.800
I'll show you.
They have one here.
Okay.
Cause the line is I I have sweaty palms.

66
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.170
Yeah,
that's good.
Uh,
yeah it is good.
But it sort of slipped.

67
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.020
So that's why I'm saying it's good.
It'd when it's wet I,
I sometimes when I'm,

68
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.620
when I'm concentrating on specific techniques,
I'll chalk up my hands.

69
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.840
I'll use like weight lifted truck.
It really helps.

70
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.110
It stores all the sweat and you just rub it down and chalk it up before each
set.

71
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.950
But when you're sweaty it forces you to grip and harder.

72
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.810
And I think it's really good for your hand strength.

73
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.070
So lately I've been not using the powder and just trying to concentrate on just

74
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.190
gripping and even harder.
And I think I have really sweaty hands,

75
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.520
but I think it actually improves my grip strength.
It's,
you know,

76
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.440
but you also gotta worry,
you throwing a 50 pound kettle bell fucking,

77
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.740
because I do it in my living room.

78
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.520
I have a tiny gym that I lift weights and it's like as small as this office.

79
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.290
So I'll fucking,
if I slip it,
does that happen a lot?
No,
no.

80
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.820
They should not have one of those.
Made my grip a hundred times,

81
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.450
not a hundred times,
but for Jujitsu,

82
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:37.780
it's made my grip way better than it ever was before because I'm regularly

83
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:42.190
throwing these 70 pound things around with each hand and there's so much inertia

84
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:44.710
and there's so much,
like when you're catching it,
you're catching.

85
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.240
This is a fat metal bar with a cannon ball behind it.
That's the point.
Yeah.

86
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.940
It builds your whole body to work as one unit when everybody does,
you know,

87
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.870
if you lift weights,
like lifting weights is great.

88
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.300
If you want to get your biceps bigger,
do curls you want to get.
You know,

89
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.280
it's all simple.
Everybody knows how to do it right,

90
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.340
but when you're doing that normal bodybuilding stuff,

91
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.930
you're isolating all your muscles,

92
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:09.040
which is really weird and it doesn't ever happen like that in the wild.
You know,

93
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.020
if you're using your body,
you're never in,

94
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.170
you never in a jungle doing like tricep extensions.

95
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.920
It's most people are training for the wild.
Correct.
You're moving around.
Yeah.

96
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.540
The life you're moving around as one unit.
Okay.
And if you want to get strong,

97
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.600
you should get strong.
The idea behind it is as one unit.

98
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.900
So when you're doing kettle bells,
you're whole body is working.

99
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.970
I got to say kettlebells taking my ass from maybe a three and a half to a seven

100
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.790
dads.
So strong.
It says nobody's looking.
I mean you're as a seven,

101
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.480
seven sir.
You walked in front of me.
Okay.
And you sat down and I can't,

102
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.640
unless you're sagging you sagging.
No,

103
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.070
but I hadn't come out thing I had anything.
Nothing white guys at Sag.

104
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.160
I think I was on the door.
I think I was knocking on the door.

105
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.010
You're thinking about doing until I read four hour body.
Ah.
And

106
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 1>then I started doing kettle bells.
That mean,
I mean like sagging your pants.
Oh,</v>

107
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:06.920
like hip hoppy.
Ah,
I think at this point it's a little corny.

108
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.370
It's ridiculous.
I mean I it didn't bother.
Yeah,
I was probably one of them.

109
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.660
Although I will pry,
I do pride myself on having never really been jived out.

110
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.340
He never drive down.
Not really like the little,
maybe for a second,

111
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.900
like in [inaudible] 92 what was the most embarrassing statement you might've

112
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.810
said in 92 I had a,
I had a public enemy jacket and 92.
Okay.

113
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.810
Which,
you know,
was a little corny and I had a,
uh,
but that was about it.

114
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:34.490
I mean it wasn't like,
oh,
crazy.
Well,

115
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.410
I probably would have bought a public enemy jacket if they had one by one today.

116
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.880
If it was like now you would,
but this was on there like descent.
Oh,
uh,

117
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.240
I would say that I would say the n word a lot.
Oh,
really?

118
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.110
Just around like my hours are black,
black dude.
Yeah.
Any way was I was,
yeah.

119
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:55.190
It was like feeling my own white devil.
I've been around those white dudes.

120
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.710
It'll say nigger around a black guy and I'm like,
Yo,
you heard,

121
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:00.290
what are you doing man?
Do you try and start some shit here?

122
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.970
Like what are you pretending that that's not like inflammatory problem?

123
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.690
Just supposed to let it go.

124
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.800
We're just supposed to let it go because you're cool about it.
Come on.
Silly.

125
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.060
That's a,
that's a highly charged word.
No,
that was my thing.
Yeah.
Anyway,
trucks,

126
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:18.020
you play on it.
Dot Call.
That was the commercial.
Go check out our shit.
Go Online.

127
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.400
Let's start.
It's going to do something here.

128
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:23.600
I'm telling you these kettlebells and your ass.
Yeah,
it's amazing workout.
Um,

129
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.210
I love it.
It's the number one strength thing that I do.

130
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.650
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and and it,
and enter in the code name for Rogan.

131
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.060
I think the,
the kettle bells aren't gonna be ready for like a week or so,
but uh,

132
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.210
we'll let you know as soon as they are.
All right.
Freaks.

133
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.380
Let's start this bitch and in the code name Brogan,

134
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.830
get yourself 10% off everything,
every,
all order.

135
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:43.970
And if you order 30 pills on the first order,
it's 100% money back guarantee.

136
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:46.550
If you try it,
you don't like it,
you're like,
this is bullshit.

137
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.060
We're way more concerned with no one feeling like they got whipped,
ripped off.

138
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.210
The cool thing is I ordered and they sent like all sorts of little supplement

139
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:54.560
with it and like it's not,

140
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:57.620
you don't just get the thing that you got did they send you like the different

141
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:01.220
stuff,
like like a new mood or something along those lines of tons of like,
hey,

142
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:04.880
try a few of these and it's called the highest quality shit you can get online.

143
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.940
Google nootropics,
folks,
check in,
look into it.
You know,

144
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:10.730
don't just make an impulse buy.
You should really read up on it.

145
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.920
There's some fascinating pro and con.
All right,
that's it.
Start the podcast.

146
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.360
Neal Brennan's here,
Ladies and gentlemen.

147
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.970
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

148
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.110
<v 1>Diaz representing.</v>

149
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:31.840
I'm going to go watch Nick Diaz compete in the grappling match.
Brian,

150
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:36.100
you want to come and film it?
May 12th in Long Beach.

151
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.070
Nick Diaz is gonna fight up.
Braulio a steamer.

152
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.870
This world champion Brazilian Jujitsu black belt and they're going to have a

153
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.950
grappling only match.
Weird.
Yeah,
that'd be dope.
Hey,
what is powerful?

154
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.240
I've seen you texted me.
Powerful.
Powerful.

155
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.850
It's sort of a catchall silly as awful Neal Brennan,

156
00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:00.210
and so I'm letting you know you're powerful.
I'm giving you energy,

157
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.200
I'm firing you up.
You know I'm,
I'm happy to be around you.
Yeah.

158
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.180
When you say that to someone,
you're happy to be around them.

159
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.870
Powerful Neal Brennan,
right?
Powerful.
Brian Rep Dan.

160
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:14.750
I don't use it at that much.
I've used the shit out of that text form.
Yeah,

161
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.420
you powerful to me on the spread out that positivity.
That's what it is.

162
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.950
It sounds Corny to say.
Spread out that positive,
sarcastic.
No,

163
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:27.510
it's being silly.
It's fun.
Powerful,
fun.
Powerful is is like,
it's like,

164
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.890
it's like positive fun.
Can I know like whoever name a guy named,

165
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.830
Gosh,
trying to Taylor Thomas,
powerful.
Jonathan Taylor.
Thomas.
Then kid

166
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.830
don't hate on Jonathan Taylor.
Come on men's at the bomb.

167
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.590
What happens to guys like that?
They go and do lifetime movies now,
does it?

168
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.920
I think he's one of those guys that Pr,

169
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.030
I think I could be completely wrong that he did the school thing where he's
like,

170
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:55.890
you know what?
I'm going back to school.
I'm doing it for him.

171
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.250
That's the thing to do.
You don't rely on,
there was,

172
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.110
I think the kid from Jerry Maguire got into like a Dui.

173
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.720
Oh yeah,
I had him on podcast recently.
Did he really?
Yeah,

174
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.340
he got a Dui and I remember and like an accident and I remember he was driving a

175
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:14.540
Saturn and I was like,
come on show business.
Wow.

176
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.260
Do better than give that fucking kid a Saturn.
He was,
he grew up really good.

177
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.950
Like he,
his parents and him are really close and stuff like that.
Now he's like,

178
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:27.790
does Jujitsu.
He's been doing Jiu Jitsu since he was a kid.
Which kid is this?

179
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.320
Jonathan?
I want to say the lip.
Nikki did.
Frons buddy.

180
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.550
Ron,
did you get to together to,
cause apparently he's good.

181
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.390
He's a real cool guy.
Real Nice Guy.
Really well brought up.
Listen,

182
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.330
some guys get through it.
We had Ricky Schroder on here.
Remember how nice he was.

183
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:47.820
Yeah,
he's real,
he's evangelical.

184
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.240
He's almost like born again a little bit,
but he's,

185
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:55.420
he's kind of mellowed off that now.
Um,
they were like pretty hardcore.
Well,

186
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.860
it's his business,
whatever,
but he's,
um,
he's a super nice guy.

187
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.700
He's just in,
somehow or another,
he made it through,
you know,

188
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.780
he made it through as a fucking,

189
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.290
he said he had a weird way of describing it when he was on the podcast.
He said,

190
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:11.940
he has never not been famous.
She goes,
it's all I've ever known.
He goes,

191
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:12.930
it's weird and everything,

192
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:16.800
but it's all I've ever known because I've had some ups and downs and trying to,

193
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.550
you know,
figure out how to deal with it.
But that is,
that's his whole life.
Yeah,

194
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.960
I guess so.
Fuck,
that's nuts.
That's,

195
00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:26.110
so that was a really fascinating conversation.
Being famous.

196
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:31.020
Do you compare it to not being famous very much anymore?
Um,
meaning like,

197
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:34.560
do you go like,
fuck,
do you want today to go,
fuck,
I wish I could just,

198
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.700
I wish it were 1990 I wish I had the identity of 1990 no.

199
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:39.780
You know how I look at it?

200
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.080
It's just a bunch of people being nice for the most part.
It's like,

201
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:46.260
what are you putting out there?
How I have opinions about things.

202
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:50.040
And I joke around about things like the last bad energy that I got was when I

203
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:54.070
was making fun of some dude in the country music awards but was standing in

204
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:58.750
front of a jet plane of country music song with jeans that had like cut rips on

205
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.410
them.
Right?
Like on purpose,
like all over them.
And I was like,
come on,
that's,

206
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.570
that's fucking ridiculous.
You were on Twitter.

207
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.420
I couldn't stop goofing on him goofing on those genes.

208
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.990
And then I was even admitted that I wear a fanny pack and I have a wallet chain

209
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.220
and I'm still goofing on that.

210
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.460
Like that's the stupidest fucking jeans were like one day we're going to look

211
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:20.530
back on those genes.
This is country music,
man.

212
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.500
Country Music is supposed to be Merle haggard,
Johnny Cash.

213
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.460
And that's like real country music.
This is like,
this is not,

214
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:29.850
that's not real country.
You're standing in front of a judge.

215
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.610
The fuck are you doing in front of a jet?
What are you doing?
Like in a hangar,

216
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.420
like he's playing overseas,
like mirror.
This was like overseas with the boys.

217
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.090
I'm gonna get in front of I suppose troops.
Oh he ain't,

218
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.540
they felt like an f 15 something.
Exactly.
And it's like what?

219
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.710
What are you doing there?
I don't know if the whole show was in front of a jet,

220
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.080
they might've done the whole country moves.
Right.
If it's from a jet,

221
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.710
which would have been awesome.
I don't know if the sets changed,
you know?

222
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:56.440
I really have no idea.
I only watched it for a little bit,
but it was,

223
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.940
I made a joke that country music awards hates black people so much.

224
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.250
They won't even use black microphones because it was a red microphone.

225
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.930
I was like this last time he saw a red microphone.
Yeah.
That is funny.

226
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:11.470
Cause I will shit on stuff online and I'm like,

227
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.500
well am I at a certain like we're comics,

228
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:18.250
but then at a certain point it's like when Bingo I d I don't want to make fun of

229
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:21.160
that or I don't know.
It's hard man.

230
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:24.220
Because I always wanted to say what's funny and what I would say amongst my

231
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:28.510
friends who wouldn't judge me like that,
that we could all be talking like,

232
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.700
like perfect example,
Amy Schumer,

233
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:33.660
when Amy Schumer's on yesterday and we were talking to her,
we were,

234
00:13:33.661 --> 00:13:38.050
we were joking around about her mother possibly being a cunt.
And I'm like,

235
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.820
how often do you,
you know,

236
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:42.950
you can just always go there when you're with a bunch of comics,

237
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.100
you're all just sitting around shit on each other.

238
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:48.340
You could always go to some terrible place and we don't really think you mean
it.

239
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.200
I'm not going to call you on.
We know.

240
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:53.680
You're just trying to be funny by saying something fucked up.
But that's,
yeah,

241
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:58.300
that's like with the,
the,
uh,
we talked about the n word last time,
but I was,

242
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.820
I was thinking about how comics,

243
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:03.670
I was thinking today how my brother Kevin Comedian,

244
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.060
Kevin Brennan and a tell when I was like in high school,

245
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.990
had a joke where if they would like be on the phone and they go like,
hey,

246
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:13.540
what's the weather like?
And it'd be like terrain.

247
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:16.820
And that'd be like fucking daggers,
right?

248
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.920
Somehow the black house on fire by remote control,
the weather.

249
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.300
Oh,
stupid and hilarious.
Right?
It was like,
no,

250
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.940
of course you don't mean it.
And also the ID,
you're making fun of the idea that,

251
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.470
but most people just don't,

252
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.950
I sound iron so they just don't get hired and they won't,

253
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.510
they're not able to look at life with layers.
Right.

254
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.460
And they can't see that at the bottom of it.
It's supposed to be about intent,

255
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.720
you know?
And this is,

256
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.550
this is not just about white guys that are throwing nay.
Yeah,
no,

257
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:52.130
it's just like,
or like you'll just go like what a,
yeah,

258
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.820
<v 3>you got to know when someone is joking.
When it's obvious there's,</v>

259
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.350
I mean there's certain people,

260
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.550
some people will say things in a crowd and like you'll be the only one that

261
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:04.580
laughs and there'll be like eight or nine people that are really pissed off.

262
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.050
Come on.
He said something like Gilbert with the,
with the,

263
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.130
with the Geico ads and all the Gilbert's jokes about the tsunami.

264
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:16.950
We're fucking hilarious.
They were hauling liquor.
That was as he was falling,

265
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.230
I was watching them in real time going like,
boy these are fucking funny jokes.

266
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.430
And then he'd gotten in trouble.
Oh well he went too quick

267
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.180
too quick and you couldn't even do that now you can't do tsunami.
But they,

268
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.380
if you couldn't do it now because people don't remember it.

269
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.360
Did you hear about the Florida Marlins guy who got so mad about days?

270
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.470
It's so ridiculous because I actually,
Twitter definitely like it.

271
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.190
Shouldn't he be protected by the First Amendment?
Tell people the story.

272
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.200
The story was he said that he gave her the space.
First of all,

273
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.450
everything he says is fucking batshit crazy.

274
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.340
He's got one of the funniest Twitter feed licensed Twitter.
What is it again?

275
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:03.020
How do you spell that?
O z.
Z.
I.
E g.
U.
I.
L.
L.
E.

276
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.500
N but go back like two months cause he just go like,

277
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.240
Hey just GL what?
G U I.
L.
L.
E.
N.
A.

278
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.360
Anyway he said something in an interview where,

279
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:16.430
and he's great because he just won't apologize for Shit.

280
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:21.140
So he said something in an interview in Time magazine has been,
you'll,
uh,

281
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.400
that he,
he admired,
um,
Castro.

282
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.390
Now what he was saying was he admired him because the guy I admire Castro in

283
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:34.160
certain respect,

284
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.420
the fact that Castro has outlasted this many people as a comic,
I'm like,

285
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:43.070
that's fucking hilarious.
Like this,
the entire world is against this guy.

286
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.660
And he's like,
no,
you can send me exploding cigars.
Nope,
you can fuck it.
I mean,

287
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:51.200
he's a,
he's a,
he's tyrannical.
He's a dickhead.
It's,
uh,

288
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.770
but the fact that I respect his endurance,

289
00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.110
a guy that can last 60 years.
Yeah.
Like,
and well,
he even,

290
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.670
he even said he's a bad motherfucker.
Oh yeah,
no,
exactly.
The words he used,

291
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:08.060
he said he's a bad motherfucker,
I think,
you know,
and he's just a lot.

292
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:11.730
Joey DSOC the same shit.
And Joey Diaz was born in Cuba.
He'll tell you,

293
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.200
it looks at Castro's a bad motherfucker.
I still run and shit down there.
Yeah.

294
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.780
Yeah.
It's like when Bill Maher said that the uh,
tsunami,

295
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.470
he got suspended five games,

296
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.500
the coach of a baseball team for saying that Castro was great or something.

297
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:27.880
What's a bad motherfucker?

298
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.430
Cause he said that he's been in power for so many years and people tried to

299
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:33.820
remove him.
He's a bad motherfucker.
It's like he said,

300
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.660
you didn't say like he's doing wonderful things and he's misunderstood and

301
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.750
humanitarian and political strategy.
No,
he just said he's a bad motherfucker.

302
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.650
You're telling me that a guy who's in professional sports can't call a guy who's

303
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.040
a dictator for how long has he been a dictator?
60 years.
You can't call

304
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.090
<v 4>that guy a bad motherfucker.</v>

305
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.060
Well that's the thing is like you called Gingiss contraband motherfucker.

306
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.840
He can write.
That wouldn't be a problem at all.
You know why gangs Kang is dead.

307
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.870
Right,
exactly.

308
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.090
<v 3>And also there's not a huge Chinese contingent of Moreland fence.</v>

309
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.810
That's the biggest problem.

310
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.810
That's the biggest problem is that most of the fans of the Marlins are Cuban ex

311
00:18:10.811 --> 00:18:12.720
pat,
or not most,
but a lot of the like

312
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.680
<v 4>agree with him.
He would,
he what he said wasn't out of line,</v>

313
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:20.460
but he wasn't in supportive Castro.
He's acknowledging that this guy,
you know,

314
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.440
look at it.
Look,
when people talk about Al Capone,

315
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.030
they don't speak in glowing terms,

316
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.990
but they go to the Al Capone Stories of Chicago are pretty legendary.

317
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.760
Al Capone was a bad motherfucker.
He's obviously an evil person,
you know,

318
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.560
happies dead,
all that good stuff.

319
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.560
<v 3>Well,
yeah,
that's the thing.
It's like people like Michael Corleone.
Yeah.</v>

320
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.880
What the fuck?
But yet they like stories.
They like theoretical soprano was great.

321
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.010
I love,
they don't like that.

322
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:49.140
I think is interesting is how far fader he even killed.
He walks by,

323
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:53.660
people think he's a bad writer.
King Kong stepped on people.
He's a charmer.

324
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.540
He's an antihero.
Fucking you.
One of the groups.
Any error.
Well done.

325
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.280
Hannibal Lecter fucking eight people right at the end of fucking ha.

326
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.260
He got having a little friend to dinner and you're,

327
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.100
I'm having an old friend for dinner and you're like,
you fucking right.

328
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:06.290
You're going to have it all in front of February.

329
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.960
That is my motherfucker right there.
Yeah.

330
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.580
That fucking awful.
Uh,
uh,
but the,

331
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.250
the question is how far,
like,

332
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.170
so that speech is not protected because I actually twittered like is he not

333
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:21.840
protected by the first moment?
And they were like,
no,
we only protects you from,

334
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.520
cause I said,
if you criticize Castro in Cuba,
you get punished.

335
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.300
And if you compliment him in America,
you get punished.
Which is like,

336
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.740
so that's freedom.
It's kind of,
uh,
and people were saying,
well,

337
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:38.220
it's his first amendment right.
It's protected the government,

338
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:41.670
he can't get arrested for it.
But if you signed a contract,

339
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:46.650
your company can say whatever they want,
but it's odd because like,

340
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.710
but if you got chance transgender surgery,

341
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:53.820
they couldn't fire you or suspend you or,
you know what I mean?

342
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:58.160
Like there's shit that you can do that's protected,
uh,

343
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.960
you if you say gender,
whatever,

344
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:04.170
if you did something crazy.
I think there's like,

345
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.820
certain things are legal.
There's certain things are protected.
Uh,

346
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.840
if you went to like a,
um,
like if you mark you,

347
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.920
if someone marched for against a fucking getting,

348
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.300
getting her mark marched him or like occupy Wall Street for instance,

349
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.370
they could get fired.
I guess by this logic.

350
00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:30.000
It's like if you say it like Castro and then if you say,

351
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:31.710
I want to occupy Wall Street,

352
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.770
you could get fired and there's nothing you can do about it,

353
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.970
which is just kind of feels,

354
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.210
<v 4>well it didn't get fired.
He got some versus spent.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,</v>

355
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.900
but without pay I'm assuming.
Yeah.

356
00:20:40.901 --> 00:20:45.310
I think the idea is that he obviously has an enormous voice as opposed to a

357
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:48.160
regular guy with a regular job.
And then he's saying is

358
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.210
<v 0>influential and that they can't show supportive of it because it's,
you know,</v>

359
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.530
it's right.

360
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:56.500
But what's the difference between that and Lebron and those guys putting their

361
00:20:56.501 --> 00:21:01.000
hood up and releasing that picture?
I think there's a big difference,

362
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.290
but what is it?
Cause I don't know what the difference is.

363
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.960
One is in resistance to what they think is an injustice that was committed by a

364
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:11.140
guy who's a bit sketchy.
Right.
And you know,

365
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:13.120
and they want to make sure that someone's brought to justice.

366
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:17.140
And the other one is a guy expressing his,
you know,
his

367
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.320
[inaudible].
Why I admire one,

368
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.550
I don't understand the connection.

369
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.210
I admire one aspect of that guy's personality is what they're saying.

370
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.810
They're saying he is.
What is what is giving him his props?

371
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:35.320
I don't even think they're admiring.
No,
I'm saying GN is saying I'm giving,

372
00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:40.040
I admire,
I admire the part of him that was,
has,
has it has lasted this long.
He,

373
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.570
that's the bad mother fucker part.
Yeah.
He's in the fact that he's a pimp.
He's,

374
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:44.290
uh,
he's done.

375
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:49.030
He's managed to stay in control as a dictator so long.

376
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.921
You know,
it's,

377
00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:54.040
it's amazing how long when you hear about like a Kim milled young that whatever

378
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:56.410
his name was,
Kim Jong Il,
the guy who died.

379
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.150
You think about how long that guy and what kind of damage that God in his

380
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:05.950
fucking regime has done to that poor country.
You're like,
wow,
it's amazing.

381
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.110
But someone can do that.
That that actually can,
you know,
you watch,

382
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.310
you watch game of Thrones or watched that and she'll watch it.

383
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.200
When you think about the idea of kings,
you know,
it's a,

384
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.940
it's amazing that someone is still to this day can rocket king style,
you know,

385
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:22.000
but there are guys like Castro's rocking it king style.

386
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.240
You can call him whatever you want.
That's the Goddamn King of Cuba.
You know,

387
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:28.540
you look at Kim jail,
that's the God damn king of North Korea.

388
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:32.410
I don't care what you want to call him,
president l wonderful l greatness.

389
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.890
You know what did the honorable whatever you want to call them.
That's okay.

390
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.680
I guess my question to the Lebrons and Alpha Male,
I get that,

391
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.710
but I'm saying at what point would Lebron and uh,

392
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.230
the heat get,
where does it cross the line to like,
we can suspend you.

393
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.090
Why would that ever make them be able to suspend,
be suspended?
If they said,

394
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:55.830
I like cast,
I respect Castro.
He didn't even say anything.
No,

395
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.780
but I'm saying taking a photo,
but I'm saying talk far.

396
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.630
At what point does it become objectionable?

397
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.460
If you say you like Hitler,
a dictator,
Hitler of course,

398
00:23:06.461 --> 00:23:09.160
it's the obvious.
Everybody that's the uh,

399
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:14.110
when you like you like a dictator or you stand in support of,

400
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.930
um,
a kid that was wearing his hood would,
I mean I'm not,

401
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.300
I'm not making a false equivalency.

402
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:23.500
I'm just wondering where does one become objectionable?

403
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.890
Uh,
if he had said,
I kind of like,

404
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.460
I think there's so many people that are in support of the Trayvon Martin,

405
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.590
what's his name is [inaudible] Martin,
Trayvon Martin,

406
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.740
and there's George Zimmerman character that they just arrested today.

407
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.810
There's so many people in supportive and investigation into that and there's so

408
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:46.070
many people that felt like injustice that

409
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.130
<v 4>occurred and that that kid had gotten killed and it could only have all been</v>

410
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:51.060
avoided.
There were so many people that would,

411
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.630
it's like becomes the court of public opinion.

412
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:53.911
<v 3>Right?</v>

413
00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:58.710
But that's what public opinion is like if we almost live in like a snitch ocracy

414
00:23:58.711 --> 00:24:00.090
where it's like,
ha,

415
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.200
like we're the guy released the KENO video and then we're like,
literally,

416
00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:07.620
you can almost feel people's pleasure when that guy was jerking off on the

417
00:24:07.621 --> 00:24:11.220
sidewalk.
We're like,
fucking,
we got and we got another one.

418
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.870
We fucking weed fucked you up so badly with just scrutiny.

419
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.960
I feel like the light has never been the hotter.
Right?

420
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.840
Like the cultural spotlight of like we're all and it becomes low hanging fruit

421
00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:27.810
to make fun of this guy.
The Coney guy of like fucking,

422
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.770
you didn't have your fucking back strain and Kone.
She's done this for years.

423
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.750
<v 4>Yes,</v>

424
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.900
but if you even have it in you somewhere that you might get to a point where

425
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:43.640
you're running around naked,
jerking off in the street,
acting gay as fuck.

426
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.620
I'd like to see that.
Please.
Okay.
And I'm,

427
00:24:46.621 --> 00:24:51.621
I'm happy when some pressure cooker situation out some fucking crazy bitch

428
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.740
because that's what that guy is because you can do that to me all day long

429
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.270
unless you're dosing me up.

430
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.170
I'm not running through the streets jargon off banket that's never come up.

431
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.730
There's never been a day without.
He had been a concern.
That's good.

432
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.150
Think it's like cultural vetting is like,

433
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:13.151
that is most certainly he failed that he failed life's intelligence test 100% he

434
00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:18.440
failed in several factors.
He felt first of all by making this,

435
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.610
this whole campaign,

436
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:24.600
which was not quite informed or what wasn't quite accurate with the fact that

437
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.620
like where this guy was the right time and what had been done and what's being

438
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:28.454
done right now.

439
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.240
And then on top of it there was a huge amount of money that wasn't going to the

440
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:35.600
actual classics,
some insane amount of money.

441
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.780
And then there was the other dude who was his partner who was joking around

442
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:40.700
about it and they caught him.
Right video joking around.

443
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.710
There was so many things about it where it just screamed like a brilliant plan.

444
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.570
They put it all sucked.
Did brilliant plan to disguise a moneymaking venue,

445
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.950
a venture rather inside some sort of a charitable organization.

446
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.840
That's what everybody got upset about.
Right.

447
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.250
<v 3>I feel like there was,
that was uh,
if there,
if it's a football field,</v>

448
00:26:01.251 --> 00:26:04.520
I'm on the 40 yard line of thinking it was basically good.

449
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.910
Do you know what I mean?
Like I thought it was more good than

450
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.470
<v 4>had.</v>

451
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.340
I think it's certainly generated money that wouldn't have been generated without

452
00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:16.210
it.
And awareness towards that cause you know,

453
00:26:16.211 --> 00:26:18.250
it goes to where do you think it should be?

454
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:22.210
Should it be a regulation thing or should it be just a court of public opinion?

455
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.720
It's like,

456
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.630
I don't want to compare these two because they're two very different things,

457
00:26:25.631 --> 00:26:27.970
but in a sense it's the same.

458
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.720
Louis C K released a comedy special online for five bucks.

459
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.190
Now that means that no one can release a comedy special for 20 bucks.

460
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.860
You can't do it online because Louie Ck,

461
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.680
who's widely recognized as one of the very best,

462
00:26:41.681 --> 00:26:44.130
if not the best standup working today,
he

463
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.430
<v 3>said five bucks for his shit.
Right?
So that means it's five bucks for your shit.</v>

464
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.360
And that's how that's,
I think that's a good way to establish it.
Right?

465
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.040
I think that's,
that's a good way.

466
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.920
And it is your way of saying that we're going to start charging for the Joe

467
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.980
Rogan podcast.
I'm seeing the court of public opinion with this guy,

468
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.560
looked at it and said,
okay,

469
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:05.130
we think it's a good cause to shine the light on someone who definitely did some

470
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:07.680
terrible shit.
So there's a lot of good in what you did,

471
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.800
but why are you making so much money off that?

472
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.960
That's what the court of public opinion is right about this guy.

473
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.130
And that's where the scrutiny cracked him.
And that's when he ran out naked.

474
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:23.100
I would venture that no one really gave a fuck about the kids to begin with.

475
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.050
It was like a nice story.
You just go,
yeah.

476
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:28.470
But meanwhile there's homeless fucking kids outside my window and I'm like,

477
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:31.680
hey look,
you should move from invisible kids anyway.
Yeah.

478
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.020
I think no one really cared.

479
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.100
I don't think anyone really cared about the plight of the kids cause there's

480
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:42.420
plenty of,
I think it's like a story that you go,
Hey,

481
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:45.900
I did you hear the story and then you get in,
you get engaged.

482
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.680
And I so I think that people never really cared.

483
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:52.860
And then I also think people never really cared that he was making money.

484
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:53.370
I think.

485
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.760
I think there was a friend to people that truly care about kids' rights and

486
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:58.050
African issues and shit like that.

487
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.920
And there's a sliver of people that care about,
uh,

488
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.460
transparency in fundraising,
uh,
operations.

489
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.240
And then everybody else is just like,
where are we going now?
Fuck him.

490
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.640
Fuck this guy.
Fuck it,

491
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.020
<v 4>thank did.
This is what happens.
People care.</v>

492
00:28:14.021 --> 00:28:17.830
But they have their own life to deal with.
And that's where it really comes in.

493
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.700
It's,
there's a lot of people that,
yeah,
I care about Africa.
Of course I do.

494
00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:22.870
When I look at this,

495
00:28:22.871 --> 00:28:26.530
this idea that you see these children living in fucking dirt huts and they have

496
00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.090
no water,
it was 2000 of the world has been awful.
Shit.
It's terrible.
Of course.

497
00:28:31.091 --> 00:28:35.560
Third of the world's straight up.
Anthony Bordain did some show on Mozambique,

498
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.010
you know,
and he was a traveling through Mozambican.
I'm watching the show.

499
00:28:39.011 --> 00:28:43.810
I'm like,
this is crazy,
man.
They have no running water.
They have no electricity.

500
00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:47.740
They have no nothing.
They have like these grass shacks,
you know,
these,
I mean,

501
00:28:47.741 --> 00:28:51.850
they're essentially living not much differently than people live thousands and

502
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.850
thousands and thousands of years ago.
And they're getting by,

503
00:28:54.851 --> 00:28:56.490
I mean they're having kids and they're,

504
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.680
they're getting enough food to eat and they're keeping the whole process going.

505
00:28:59.681 --> 00:29:04.510
But you're like,
wow,
that's a,
that's amazing.
Then in 2012 that's,
that's going,

506
00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:06.700
I do care.
But then you also have your own,

507
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.200
<v 3>oh you care.
But it's like what are you going to do and what can I,</v>

508
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:11.820
it's such a massive problem.

509
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.840
<v 4>Every,
oh sorry.
I feel like everybody play footsies with Brian.
Um,</v>

510
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:21.170
I feel like everyone has something that they're compelled to do in this life.

511
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.950
And I think that some people are compelled to charity and I think those people

512
00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:27.600
should do charity.
You know,
I don't,

513
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.200
I don't think it's a selfish thing to pursue your own goals entirely and to only

514
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:40.200
try to be around and experience of things that you're actually enjoying in this

515
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:41.980
life.
I think there's people that are

516
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.500
<v 0>not compelled to do that and they should be allowed to do that and they should</v>

517
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:49.480
be allowed to pursue charities,
donate money.
And I do,
but I,
you know,

518
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.470
I can't get involved to the point where he eats my life up cause I think it

519
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:54.790
would,
it would easily,

520
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.740
I could easily get my life eaten up by trying to,
you know,
help kids.

521
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:04.330
If you helped a bunch of kids and you saw them,
you know,
get over something,

522
00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:06.400
certain illnesses,
you're famine,
whatever.

523
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:10.000
If you actually were there and experienced it with them and then kept going and

524
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:12.970
then became friends with them and had some sort of relationship with those kids,

525
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.790
Jesus Christ,
it would could completely consume your life.
He'd be like,

526
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:20.670
I got to help Africa.
I go to the back.
What's the thing?
That's what the,

527
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.810
apparently the deal was if you love them,

528
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:27.220
if they became like your little brothers.
Of course,
of course.

529
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:32.221
I mean the real issue is we need to get her own fucking politicians to do that.

530
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.200
What about,
what do you make of the pressure cooker though?

531
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:40.450
What do you make of the thing?
Like until like when Zimmerman was gone,
I thought,

532
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:42.350
oh,
he's going to kill himself.
Yeah.

533
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.550
I'm surprised Jerry Sandusky hasn't killed himself.
Jerry Sandusky.

534
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:49.040
He's a horrible person to complete scumbag.
There aren't.
So I'm,

535
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.900
these are bad examples.
I think the,
I think people that just get torn,

536
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.620
like celebrities that get TMZ to the point where they just tack camera people.

537
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.550
There's certain,
then you see them,
they just can't take it anymore.

538
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.890
And I don't consider it vetting.
I just consider it.

539
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:06.610
It's like if the Cultural Tabel ism is so out of control,

540
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.530
I think there's certainly that.
Um,
I think people are also so angry.

541
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.070
They're looking for an enemy.
You know,
people are so angry at the economy.

542
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.280
There's something like 40% of all kids that live between 18 and I think 34

543
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.840
they're living with their parents in their thirties.

544
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.180
They're living with their parents 40%.

545
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.310
That's something that's seems like you haven't

546
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.390
made me cereal.
Mama,
you leave my house.
I just want to clean my house.

547
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.290
My dog for walks silly.
You live in America,
you lucky bitch.
Ah,
yeah.

548
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:46.120
Mozambique.
Go Watch it.
Watch it.
You won't be such a whiny bitch.
And you're like,

549
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.890
oh well you're lucky.
Speed Internet.

550
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:52.510
He got that shit like that does as as a grown adult dusting and cleaning the

551
00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:56.140
toilet.
It's such,
it's so Mozambique watch the episodes.
Is that good for you?

552
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.640
You can learn a lots of the Anthony Bourdain show that we were just talking

553
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:03.790
about.
The one that gets the guy that wears the thumb ring,
he used to,

554
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.020
he tweeted about it.

555
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.660
I tweeted him and Bordain who was the only guy that I've ever met with a thumb

556
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:11.770
ring that I didn't want to strangle,

557
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.240
but he said I got rid of that shit a long time ago and he wrote a age limit for

558
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:18.870
that shit and the Hashtag what did,
yeah,
but that's any else that happened?

559
00:32:18.871 --> 00:32:21.310
One that this like tribal things around his belly button or was that somebody

560
00:32:21.311 --> 00:32:23.850
else?
No,
he doesn't have a thing around is he might,

561
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:27.310
he's got a c minus at the house.
He's got a snake.
Him and his.

562
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:31.540
Why Anthony Kiedis snake on their arm.
It might be him.
Yeah,
tribal.
Right.

563
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.540
There's something about doing a tattoo around your belly button that makes me go

564
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.420
and have,
like when those dangling piercings,
he'd like little dangling one.

565
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.360
<v 1>Does any guy ever pulled that off?
No.
No,
but it'd be awesome.
Okay.</v>

566
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:47.350
Here's what the,
here's my question please.
The,

567
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.480
the question is guy like us again,

568
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.870
I think it's bad that he gets fined.
I think he,
I had,

569
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:58.280
I think it's ultimately bad for the country.
I just wish people could,
it's,

570
00:32:58.281 --> 00:33:03.281
people are not corporate fucking spokespeople.

571
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.260
Do you know what I mean?
And that's the thing is everyone's become that.

572
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.040
We talked about the Tracy thing last time and everyone's just in a constant

573
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:14.900
state of a Po.
Anytime you tweet something,
there's like,
wow,

574
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.210
the fuck can you say that?
And it's like,
so yeah,
we were,
we were,
you know,

575
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.700
Mike and I,
and,
and I,
you strike me as kind of got it.

576
00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:25.820
It's never going to apologize for anything you said,
I don't think.
Well,
you know,

577
00:33:25.821 --> 00:33:30.520
I'll let people know what my intentions are.
I'm not gonna apologize,
but if I,
I,

578
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.483
you know,

579
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.340
wasn't gonna apologize to people that were mad that I said the guy was a silly

580
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:38.500
bitch for wearing ripped jeans.
Fake ripped jeans.
That's the,

581
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.810
that's some silly bitch shit.
That's just what it,

582
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.940
what were they and what was their,
their case mad at me like,

583
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.700
oh you get your careers in the toilet.
You need to get attention in this way.

584
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.720
There's a lot of that.
There's a lot of,
they would point out what,

585
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.670
how your careers in this shit or which is most so I get someone needs.

586
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.000
Meanwhile I got more Twitter friends and him.
Hey,

587
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.290
how bout just called Joe Fat.
That works the best.
Fat is a good one.

588
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.430
We were at the comedy store one night.
Some chick w w was on camera.

589
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:10.730
We caught it on camera check wouldn't stop calling me fat.

590
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.770
Talking about six pack.
He pulls up his shirt.
That hurts.
That hurts though.

591
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:20.720
Cause you think about Chappelle used to call me fat boy jokingly preposterous.

592
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.810
No,
I know,
but it was next to him.

593
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:28.730
I technically was had fast and like so it doubled and it gets you a little

594
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:30.160
crazy.
Fad is a big one for him,

595
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.050
but this was a girl that was trying to make me feel bad and I was like,

596
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:35.510
this doesn't even make sense.
He owned her so hard.

597
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:40.511
It was like a scene in the movie was a douchey movie poster.

598
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.610
The villain that's supposed to fill out your six pack.

599
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.940
There's something about showing someone your abs always she stand down or no,

600
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:50.680
she got robbed.
Yeah,
it turned it into Jello.
What'd she was just like,

601
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.020
yeah,
the kids shred this.
Come on

602
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.120
via.
Yeah,
but do you want,
I just don't,

603
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:03.680
I don't want people to turn into every,
not every one's running for office.

604
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.480
Just put out good shit man.
Gene.
But then Sam,

605
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.680
you want to make fun of the guy's pants?
Yeah.
You put some of,

606
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.850
I was saying that's the only bad thing that ever get back.
I get that.

607
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.290
Most of the time it's all positive.

608
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:19.620
You put out good shit and you get good shit back.
You put out good energy.
Good.

609
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.510
You get it back.
I just think it's like,
you know,
mark could be right.

610
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.360
I mean he got fired 10 years ago,
but who bill Maher,
Bill Maher and,
and uh,

611
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.970
even the rush Limbaugh thing,
like rush Limbaugh said,
hey,

612
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.540
piece of shit as far as I'm concerned.
So they just don't listen to them.
But I,

613
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.040
and,
and losing advertisers,
I get,
I guess

614
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.710
<v 0>it's just,
I dunno know the rush limbo story.</v>

615
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.890
There was a girl who was trying to get the government,
the state,

616
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:47.640
whoever the fuck pays that insurance that she was getting.
Who has who?

617
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.800
I was Georgetown University.
Okay.

618
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.180
She wanted them to pay for her birth control and rush limbo and it's part of

619
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:55.320
your health care as part of a healthcare.

620
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.280
And Rush Limbaugh had argued that if our tax dollars were going to go into it,

621
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:04.370
then we should be able to watch you have sex and you have so much sex.

622
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.550
Yeah.
Like then we should be able to watch that.
Should be basically,

623
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:10.200
she's a prostitute.
You know,
like you're,

624
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:14.310
you're having sex for money to bath salts army.
He's a big drunk guy.
Right.

625
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:19.140
Well he was,
he was doing mad oxies.
Yeah,
to the point where he went deaf.

626
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.970
Alex Jones described to me the process of oxycontin overdose.

627
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.720
It actually makes guys go deaf.
Cause you remember when rush went deaf?
No.

628
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:30.810
I mean I remember when he was big into oxy,
but oh,
he went deaf.

629
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.180
He went to the point where he,
his show,

630
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:36.840
it's suffered because he couldn't hear what people were saying to him sometimes

631
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.470
and he could understand that he couldn't hear his own voice so it didn't sound

632
00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:40.770
right.

633
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.400
It sounded off and it went for a long time before he got an operation and then

634
00:36:44.401 --> 00:36:48.090
he got it fixed and they did something.
I think they gave him an inner ear plant.

635
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.760
I think he's got an implant.
God that,

636
00:36:49.761 --> 00:36:53.750
that helps us just foxing going deep.

637
00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:00.450
They said he was up to over 90 a day.
God dammit.
Oh my goodness.

638
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.130
Oh my goodness.
90 fucking pills a day.

639
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:08.930
Homeboy was cranking though orphan and I was going to have that source,

640
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.260
keep it and get him and shit.

641
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.620
He was getting all kinds of different doctors to hook them up with it.

642
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:18.540
It gets me.
It gets me now.
Have you done shit like no,
no,
no,
no.

643
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:19.530
I'm sure it would get you though.

644
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.320
I have no doubt in my mind that the Oxycontin's we'd get me.

645
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.550
I think they get everybody.
I mean,

646
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:25.290
I think I would be strong that I would get off them,

647
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.980
but I definitely think that if I was hanging around with a bottle of them and a

648
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.700
swollen foot and I took one and then also I'm like,
oh,

649
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:35.850
this was awesome and then you get hooked.
Really?

650
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.430
No one has anything were really bad to say about it other than me.

651
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:40.410
Addiction like that.
No one has her hands.

652
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.990
I've heard someone say that made them really nauseous,

653
00:37:42.991 --> 00:37:45.900
but that's what heroin does to a lot of people make some really nauseous.

654
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.940
That's the only thing.
But they say it feels amazing.
Just fucking,

655
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.870
I feel like I get hooked on coke.
We're speed.
I've never even tried coke.

656
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.720
I've barely seen it.
I'd maybe seen it a dozen times.
Whoa.

657
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.230
I just remembered doing kind of crazy ass dream about you buddy.
Whoa,

658
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.960
that's not real coke.
This gentleman.
It's powdered sugar.

659
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.020
We didn't have sugar for coffee,
but not only had I had powdered sugar,

660
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.880
which doesn't really work,
they never,
never goes down.
Yeah,

661
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:18.840
it's funky.
I had a fucked up dream about you,
dude.
Sweet.
What is it?

662
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:23.640
You were doing marijuana mixed with math and you were telling me that it's,

663
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:27.990
the latest thing is kids do,
they smoke marijuana and meth together.
I was like,

664
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:29.870
what are you talking about?
And you were like,
well,

665
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.950
I would never smoke meth bites and need.
Yeah,

666
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.440
like I would never smoked meth by itself,
but when I mixed them together,
dude,

667
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.303
it's amazing.

668
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 1>And I was like trying to get you to stop smoking,
man.
Wow.</v>

669
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.390
You were hooked on Meth.
Would you say mead need?
What do we be called?
Yeah,

670
00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:47.320
she just made that up.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.

671
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:48.940
But I mean that might actually be what it is.

672
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.470
Could you imagine if I started something?
I think many,

673
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.510
I think math would completely overpowered.
I would imagine in women.

674
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.620
It wouldn't be funny though if like somehow another marijuana became a white

675
00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:03.330
knight and your brain fighting off the meth consciousness and you see,
oh,

676
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.940
fucking virtual battle of the positive and negative substances Duking it out in

677
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:10.330
your head.
It cause if you take like math with mushrooms,
how does that work?

678
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.390
You know what's funny is I had an ex that did,

679
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.500
she was a meth addict before we dated and she's all,

680
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:21.460
let's tell him about all that stuff.
She's like,
my teeth weren't my for great.

681
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:25.140
She goes,
my skin never looked better.
Wow.
Like it wasn't bad.

682
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.380
She haven't gotten that deep yet.

683
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.720
Takes a while before your body turns into a fucking Prune Silva.

684
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.600
<v 3>Some people doesn't tell me.
It'll just fucking,
they turn and it's like,</v>

685
00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:38.580
that'll do it.
She was she a functional math head?
A vague,

686
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.320
I didn't know her.
I think vape.
Not especially she,
here's a,
here's an irony.

687
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:48.000
She lived,
you know how you always hear about Indians living off of casinos?

688
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.800
She lived on for casino.
Wow.
She was native American seminal.

689
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.850
She lives off the hard rock in uh,
in the one that Anna Nicole died.

690
00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.730
Oh Shit.
The one in Fort Lauderdale.

691
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.670
<v 1>Did you ever play like cowboy and Indian with her?</v>

692
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.900
<v 3>We would get into some pretty tend it,
share it.
I cut,
I conquered her.</v>

693
00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:11.680
Like I actually get,
I moved in to replace.
Did you gave her a,

694
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.740
gave her a blanket with smallpox on it?
Um,

695
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:19.740
no we never,
it was actually a good religion.
We were in love.
Joe.
What happened?

696
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.290
She started going to um,
black clubs

697
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.190
to going to cheese,
sort of going to,

698
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.930
she started getting her masters and she started getting her master's in

699
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:38.190
psychology and at the beginning of the class the teacher was like,
Yo,

700
00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:41.430
just so you know,
none of your relationships are going to last.
Oh Wow.

701
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.830
And she said that she was like,
somebody else broke up today.

702
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.790
Somebody else broke up today.

703
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.100
And then slowly but surely it was like that six months in we were kind of done

704
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.780
cause she was just uncovering stuff about herself and like I didn't,
you know,

705
00:40:54.781 --> 00:40:59.100
she liked women,
she hates men.
Like,
just stuff that was like,
oh,

706
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.600
she's all right women and she hates,
she wanted to date women.
Oh Shit.

707
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:08.490
By herself.
And uh,
by,
cause I asked if we could do it together.
Bam.

708
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.060
She wanted,
she went,
yeah,
she wanted to date women and she's like,

709
00:41:12.061 --> 00:41:13.200
I fucking hate men.

710
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.300
<v 1>Oh No,
it's stuck.
Yes.
All of those.
Uh,</v>

711
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.920
if for now,
but that's a mess.
Anybody who says they hate women's a cunt,

712
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.510
you're a guy and you're like,
oh,

713
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.350
women or eight women will get the fuck away from me.
Crazy bitch.
You what?

714
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.540
You hate everyone of a certain gender.
Well guess what?

715
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:34.430
Same thing if you hate men,
go fuck you dumb bitch.

716
00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:37.610
You think I asked to be born a man?
You know,
just relax.

717
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.500
Not everyone's going to ask for sure.
Being a man's way better,

718
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.210
especially being a manly man.
Cause I mean to be a real Joe Rogan,

719
00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.200
you can't get mad at someone for their gender,

720
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:51.730
you silly ass hole and it's accepted women.

721
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.250
But you're not allowed to sat up case.
Oh,
I've dude,
I've,

722
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:57.740
I've had conversations with women before that have said,
you know,

723
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:01.400
men this and men that,
and I'm like,
God damn,
can you give me a chance?

724
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.930
I'm a person,
you know,

725
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:07.190
everyone's just a person you would throw in me into half the planet.

726
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.310
It's just so ridiculous and did to say that you've got,
I,

727
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.210
if she didn't mean like she hates all men everywhere.
She just,

728
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.310
you could live like I have deep seated mistrust of men.

729
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.210
You could live in a committed relationship.
I mean,
like,

730
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.930
I haven't had any positive,

731
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.330
she hadn't had any positive male deep relationships.
Well,

732
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.650
you know,
how fucking old was she?
How many people had she been around 47 years?

733
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:37.610
Young?
Uh,
no,
she was,
I don't know if she was 47 years old.

734
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.340
Could have been stuck in some students.
She was in a lot of bad spot.

735
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.900
Therapy's pretty fucked up.
Anyway,
I did it in college.
Same thing.

736
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:48.080
She was a fucking mess,
like alcoholic,
just crazy.

737
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:50.810
Always getting in fights with her family and all these other people.

738
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:54.110
And then she went to the therapy at therapist and every time she would come
back,

739
00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:54.800
she goes,
like,

740
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.040
therapist tells me we need to break up that you're just a really bad person.

741
00:42:58.041 --> 00:42:59.750
And I'm like,
well,
he's probably full of shit.

742
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.160
It tells a really distorted that's not using therapy the right way.

743
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.250
Stupid asshole.
Or you're a bad person.
You could live right.

744
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.880
You could live a thousand lives as a man and still not understand what it would

745
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.380
be to live a life of a woman.
You don't understand it.
You're not a woman.

746
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.500
And as soon as the guy understands that and accepts that,

747
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.820
he'll be way happier when you try to make a woman think like a man.

748
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:27.390
That shit is impossible.
The same as a man.
Trying to think like a woman.
It's,

749
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.550
and I think both are,

750
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.960
I actually think women are slightly more guilty of trying to get men to think

751
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.620
like women.
We,
yes,
there's more power.
It can.
Yeah.

752
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.100
They can just go like no need to change.
If a guy does that,

753
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:44.160
he's like a Dick and whatever he guy is in a good,
uh,

754
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.410
relationship that I admire.
The girl's friends hate him

755
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.430
right where it's like,
cause he's such a fucking asshole.

756
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.780
He's happy to do what he wants.
And He,
and it's like,
yeah,
that's you.
He has it.

757
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.570
I used to say to girls,
uh,
I,

758
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:04.010
you're making me feel like a guest in my own life where,
and that would,

759
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:07.130
that would get them where they were like,
I understand what you mean now.

760
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.760
Cause it was like,
Yo,
I don't,
I wasn't looking for a coach.

761
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:12.530
I wasn't looking for like someone,

762
00:44:12.531 --> 00:44:17.531
I need someone to come in and fucking change my taste and change my interest and

763
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:21.650
change my wardrobe and my diet and just like,
but that's,
but they do,

764
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:26.000
I think some women,
um,
try to think that that's like a way to go.

765
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.260
Well I think there's also a struggle for power that goes on with people in

766
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:32.010
relationships.
Everyone,
you know,

767
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.490
<v 4>thanks there.
They should be the one that decides where we go and what to do.</v>

768
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:38.280
And some people take that shit more serious than others and some people would

769
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:41.550
just not very intelligent or emotionally developed.
And so they,

770
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.230
they run on crude tracks and they just fucking bang into each other.

771
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:47.530
Every time they have relationship,

772
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:51.180
it's cars just slam into each other and they argue about shit and then they make

773
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:53.570
up and that's all those stupid fucks live their life.
Yeah.

774
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:54.690
I think there's a lot of that.

775
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.300
I think that what percentage of people do you think are stupid?

776
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.270
It's a giant number.
Cause I'm in it,
I'm in it and you know,
I mean I,

777
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.050
I always look at how the whole bit,

778
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:06.120
but I used to do about how people like to think they're smart,

779
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.510
but really we're just buying shit from smart people and memorizing shit that

780
00:45:10.511 --> 00:45:11.850
smart people have really figured out.

781
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.690
This is gigantic body of knowledge and anybody thinks they're smart.
It's dumb.

782
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:17.840
It's fuck.
Well that's what I was,
I had this argument the other day about it.

783
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:22.710
Don't you want to live forever to learn everything I do?
Who knows?

784
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.210
You say that,
but what if after this is way better now after this?
Yeah.

785
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:31.440
You don't know that I don't talk about onsite talking complete nonsense.

786
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:35.710
I get up,
I go,
I would just sense based on what I did,

787
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.430
there was nothing.
It's good.
I'm going back to where I was,

788
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.170
which is before 73 I don't think any of it ends.
I think it changes.

789
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:47.130
I think it all becomes something completely different and energy never dies off.

790
00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:48.870
It just moves on to another state.

791
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.660
And I think that the whole cycle of the universe,

792
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:54.510
we want to think of it as like there was a birth to the universe and it's going

793
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:57.930
to be an end of the universe.
You know?
That's why they think of the Big Bang,

794
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:58.411
you know the whole,

795
00:45:58.411 --> 00:46:01.290
there was at one point in time it was smaller than the head of a pin and it was

796
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.190
a giant burst.

797
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.050
I think it's never ending and I think that our ideas of it are all based on her

798
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:09.090
own biological limitations.

799
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.920
And I think the biological life is a trip.
I think it's an experience.

800
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:18.450
I think the biological life doesn't necessarily represent what is possible in

801
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:22.890
reality and I think it's one stage of existence and I think we probably had

802
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:27.330
other stages of existence.
I think w are what our real true consciousness.

803
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.470
It gets wrapped around language and it gets wrapped around culture and it gets

804
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:34.290
wrapped around personal experiences and how they interpret them and how they

805
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.840
remember shit that other people have figured out and written down.

806
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.400
But at the end,
in the root of that,

807
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:42.090
that could take place in a hundred thousand million different forms.

808
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.660
It doesn't have to exist as a human animal making noise with your mouth.

809
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.840
That consciousness could exist in other dimensions.
I consciousness,

810
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.420
whatever the fuck it is that's at the underlying,

811
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:56.610
the underlying energy that makes the body move in certain directions and choose

812
00:46:56.611 --> 00:46:57.780
to manipulate objects,

813
00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.880
whatever the fuck that is at the root of all that could exist as a dolphin,

814
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:05.880
could exist as a killer whale could exist as a,
you know,

815
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.360
some really smart octopus.
Who the fuck knows?

816
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:14.690
I think for sure what we are right now is in a evolving species.

817
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:19.140
It's changing.
It's,
it's,
it's becoming something different.

818
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.960
Look,
man,
I hope you're right.
I like I,
I hope cause I am going to die.

819
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:28.110
Yes.
Uh,
I just hope there's,
there's an after Paul,

820
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:30.700
I think we're becoming something different and along the way,

821
00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:33.850
I think whatever the fuck it is that we're,

822
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.600
the human race is going to eventually evolve into,
I think,

823
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.020
I think we're on some sort of a crazy cycle.
That's what I think.

824
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:45.430
I think we're on some sort of an infinite loop cycle and I think are limited

825
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:49.180
interpretation of like people dropping off the face of the earth and

826
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:53.740
disappearing and leaving our lives.
It leads us to believe that this is it.

827
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.620
This is this one thing and this is it.

828
00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:01.090
You breathe in one day your heart will stop beating and then it ends may be

829
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.560
maybe not.
Maybe you're a fucking caterpillar that's becoming,

830
00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:06.300
going to become a butterfly ranger.

831
00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:11.301
I'm Amy or some weird fucking animal that travels dimension to dimension in

832
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:17.020
completely different forms.
We've seen that happen in physical state,

833
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.801
in life.

834
00:48:17.801 --> 00:48:22.330
We've seen caterpillars and salamanders and all these fucking different things

835
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:24.670
become a completely different thing.

836
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:29.560
We've seen them physically met a morph and change.
Why would we,

837
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.100
why would we assume that consciousness couldn't do the exactly the same thing?

838
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.220
Why wouldn't we assume that reality can't do exactly the same thing?

839
00:48:36.221 --> 00:48:41.221
I think it's super possible that were some crazy technological caterpillar and

840
00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:46.100
that we're going to one day press saga,
fucking button,
alright.

841
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.310
And all of our experiences of life and death and love and infatuation and

842
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.760
fascination and appreciation and all those different things are really just,

843
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.740
it's just more motivation for you to keep moving forward and forward and forward

844
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:04.741
to push this technological machine that society runs on the real,

845
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:09.340
the real underpinnings,
what's really impacting the universe.

846
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:12.970
It's not people magazine and Kim Kardashians ass,

847
00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.950
but that is there to distract you long enough to keep buying the new droids.

848
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:18.341
Getting,

849
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:23.230
the more technology we create and the more minerals we mind and the more we push

850
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:26.860
the boundaries of what we can do and control in the universe,

851
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:29.230
the more we get closer to whatever the fuck we're becoming.

852
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.830
Completely locked into an addiction with our cell phones and our computers.

853
00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:36.470
If I'm online,
if I'm like in a hotel and the,
the,
the,
the,

854
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.880
the Internet goes out for an hour.
I fucking,

855
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.130
<v 3>yeah,
I've been doing,</v>

856
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:46.250
I started doing a joke the other day about how my phone has completely turned me

857
00:49:46.861 --> 00:49:50.670
into a dick.
I'm a fucking asshole like me.

858
00:49:50.671 --> 00:49:55.140
And as far as like being rude and just fucking like,
fuck you companion.
I'm,

859
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.830
I got everyone else in front of me and I'd rather spend time with them.

860
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.100
I have enough girls pictures on my phone.

861
00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.430
I was telling her event that I could publish two months of a magazine.

862
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.550
Girls like send you pictures.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause they know you're single.
Ah,
yeah.

863
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.420
But girl,
I mean that's not just like out of nowhere,
it's like girls,

864
00:50:12.421 --> 00:50:15.750
I'm Chen and it's over years.
But I'm saying like,
uh,

865
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.390
like if I told somebody,
if I,

866
00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:21.660
if my phone turned up in the 18 hundreds in a town,

867
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:26.520
the town elders would burn the town down because they'd be so freaked out by

868
00:50:26.521 --> 00:50:28.100
just the amount of filth on my

869
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.220
<v 1>phone.
And that's the thing.
It's like you do get hooked having to,</v>

870
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:35.020
I wanted to bring up,
I went to the,
uh,

871
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:39.680
the flotation,
I went to float labs.
Yeah.
Me Crash.
I did.
Yeah.

872
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:41.860
I met crash crashes and interesting individual.
Yeah.

873
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.730
I went a nine days ago and it was a,
it was pretty great.

874
00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:51.170
It,
that's what made me re like my,

875
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.560
my epiphany and I'm sure you don't get epiphany's every time,

876
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:56.540
but my epiphany laying there was like,

877
00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:01.990
I need to experience some love and I got to get a dog to do that.

878
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.450
Why you said dog?
Ah,
cause I find uh,
work your way up to him.
Yes.

879
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.360
Literally.
That's the,
that's the plant.
Wow.
It's like work my way up.

880
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.220
How fucked up are you?
I'm on a one to 10,

881
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.030
10 being 10 being like you're unfixable.
Oh,

882
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:23.360
I don't think I'm on fixable.
I think I'm like a six and a half.
Six and a half.

883
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:27.580
That's still strong.
Oh,
you have a strong,
wow.
I'm new.

884
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.960
Start my love experiences with a dog.

885
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.810
I know it sounds crazy,

886
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.370
but I'm only 37 so you can still pull it together.
It's not too late.

887
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:40.490
Come from behind champion.
Yeah,
exactly.
It's possible.

888
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:42.640
I've been lapped by life and I'm going to lap it.

889
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.080
Randy coture didn't have his first fight until he was 34.
So think about,

890
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:50.120
do want borrow Pekinese uh,
no,
but I feel like that could,

891
00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:52.870
I feel like it could help.
You can totally borrow mine.

892
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.490
Brian's got the most loving dog in the world.
You could try it.

893
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:58.440
You can borrow it for a little while.
How big is it?
Tiny.
This thing,

894
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:02.390
I don't like those little dogs.
They all this shivering and if I didn't do that,

895
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.230
it doesn't do,
they seem freaked out.
Freaked out dog.
A guard dog.

896
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.810
It's not scary to you at all.
It's not scary to you at all.

897
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:11.000
It's thinking about super affectionate because look at it is,

898
00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:14.010
it's not like a like a dog.
It was like,
oh shit,
a person's here.

899
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.380
You want to make a documentary about it?

900
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:20.180
Nobody's meaning I love Auger with the dog because look,
I heard Twitter.

901
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.260
It's Twix.
He vixen.
It's a sweet,
it's a sweet dog.
Um,

902
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.870
really one of the nicest dogs on the face of the earth.

903
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.640
But you were never in love.
What was it?

904
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.470
You weren't in love till you met your wife.
Right.

905
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.510
<v 4>I don't really like to talk about that on the air,
sir.
All right,
fair enough.</v>

906
00:52:34.511 --> 00:52:36.850
This has been a few loves lost along the way.
Got It.

907
00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:40.120
I don't want to bring up any personal experiences that involve other people that

908
00:52:40.121 --> 00:52:44.470
I'm staring at us with.
Yeah.
But look,
um,
yeah,
I've been in love.
But the real,

909
00:52:44.471 --> 00:52:48.550
the real reality of life though is you have to get your own shit together before

910
00:52:48.551 --> 00:52:52.150
you're capable of having any sort of a relationship because relationships will

911
00:52:52.151 --> 00:52:56.860
eventually expose who you really are.
That I agree with.
That is,

912
00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:01.240
you want to talk about vetting that I don't see like we don't deserve someone

913
00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:03.310
who's got their shit together.
If you don't have your shit together.

914
00:53:03.311 --> 00:53:04.600
And that's why it always falls apart.

915
00:53:04.601 --> 00:53:07.780
That's why you wind up treating him like shit.
You don't deserve them.
You know?

916
00:53:07.781 --> 00:53:12.781
You have to come to a state as a human being where all your experiences that you

917
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.370
give to this other person are all like as nice as possible.

918
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.690
You're always,
yeah,
always.
It's complimentary as possible,

919
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:24.940
as friendly as possible,
as affectionate as possible.

920
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.980
And as soon as you get out of that state,
as soon as you,
you know,
if you,

921
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:33.000
the only way you can get there is you gotta you gotta really be happy with who

922
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:36.030
the fuck you are because if you're not happy with who you are and what you're

923
00:53:36.031 --> 00:53:37.830
doing and how you feel about yourself,

924
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.040
and then you start attaching your happiness to this one person.

925
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:44.550
Like the only time I feel good is when I'm around,
which is crazy.
Like,
bitch,

926
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:46.380
get your own shit together first.

927
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.060
You can't just be entirely dependent upon one person for your own happiness.

928
00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.690
And the only way you can truly be happy in a relationship,

929
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.560
I feel like is if two people can be independent of each other,

930
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.330
still enjoy each other's company.

931
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.690
<v 3>It's the,
my therapist wants to explain,
it's like concentric circles,</v>

932
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.690
like in the middle is the relationship where you overlap,

933
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.370
but you've got to also be nice to each other.
And that's hard.
I learned.
Yeah,

934
00:54:11.371 --> 00:54:16.290
that's the thing that I learned because I'm from like dumb,
the youngest of 10.

935
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.600
And so it's like in there wasn't at all,
I mean yet,
not my,

936
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:25.590
yeah.
Yes and no.
Like certain ones like older brothers and sisters did,

937
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.300
but 10 kids is too many.

938
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:31.920
My mother admitted it and she also admitted that our father didn't love us at

939
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:36.010
all.
Oh,
okay.
But sounds awful.
Sounds awful.

940
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:40.740
Is Awful,
but make when when I heard that,
I was like,
thank you.

941
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:44.950
I fucking knew it.
Do you know what I mean?
I knew he didn't love it.
Yeah.
Wow.
No,

942
00:54:44.951 --> 00:54:49.570
it,
what a Dick.
And so what does he do a box stitches.

943
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:54.120
He,
he started another family?
Uh,
no,
he's,
uh,
he's,
he,

944
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.020
he's actually,
he's like,
he's 80.
He's old.
So he's just hanging out.

945
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:02.310
You like a whoever talked to him?
We talk sparingly.

946
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.640
Wow.
Uh,
talk to them.
Here's a good example.
Uh,

947
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:09.960
at my brother in law's funeral,
which was in July,
um,

948
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.860
he,
uh,
my nephew,

949
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:17.880
my dad's sort of infirmed and my nephew was like trying to help them down the

950
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.980
stairs.
My Dad goes,
don't touch me.

951
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.770
And then he walks the more down the steps and he goes,
if I fall,

952
00:55:22.771 --> 00:55:26.940
it's going to be your fault.
It's just like a crazy guy.
Oh.
Uh,
like a crazy,

953
00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:31.800
angry Irish dude.
Um,
so,
so,
uh,

954
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.050
what,
so what I've found is that,
that you kind of need,

955
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:40.170
I just feel like I need to rebuild all that shit like,
and,
and what I found with,

956
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.390
all right,
so this is what I was getting at.
Uh,

957
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:47.410
I was seeing a girl who had to go to the hospital for some like infection thing,

958
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.700
pussy infection.
Let's come on back.
You talking about love and then I'll talk,

959
00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.170
<v 4>you said,
you know,
you said infection thing.
I mean to me again,</v>

960
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.730
<v 3>I didn't,
I haven't denied but I'm hanging out.
Okay.
Um,</v>

961
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.660
and a Olis man and um,

962
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.420
so she's in a hospital and I was like,

963
00:56:07.421 --> 00:56:10.330
but at this point we kind of weren't seeing each other anymore and she was like,

964
00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:13.450
I'm at the hospital and myself.
And I was like,
you know what,
let me just go.

965
00:56:13.451 --> 00:56:16.240
It was like two 30 in the morning.
I'm like a son.
I was like,

966
00:56:16.241 --> 00:56:17.860
let me just go spend,

967
00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:22.890
like I made a concerted effort to show this person love and what I was,

968
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.500
<v 1>I felt really good about it.</v>

969
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.370
Meaning it made me fucking feel good to love somebody,

970
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.630
but it's so not my natural disposition.

971
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.100
Well you probably grew up with a bunch of defense mechanisms.
Yeah.

972
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:42.190
I am a walking defense mechanism that's Chappelle wants to describe me is just

973
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:44.590
walking through life,
just keeping everyone at a distance,

974
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:49.570
which I think is a fair description.
Yeah.
I think Matt,
I think we will.

975
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:52.330
We'll all,
every human that I know has been that state,

976
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:55.990
at least at one point in their life,
you know you're going to get burned.

977
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.980
You know,
if you get burned,
you're going to,
you know,
not only that you got,

978
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.450
there's no fucking handbook on how to drive relationships.

979
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:08.080
So you're essentially just get out there and you fucking put the pedal to the

980
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:10.260
metal and you crash right into the fucking trees,
right?

981
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.460
You don't know how to drive.
You don't know what you're doing.

982
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.270
When you see people and they're dating and they get together and then three days

983
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:18.680
later they're with each other 24 hours,
his dog,

984
00:57:18.681 --> 00:57:22.300
and they go to the store to buy clothes and they just fuck all day.
Like,

985
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:25.360
what are you guys really running from?
What's going on here?

986
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:29.760
This is what they did.
They hit the fucking pedal to the metal,
get a wave,

987
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:33.820
that car where we were.
That's not the fastest way around the race track.

988
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:34.300
You know,

989
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:38.680
the fastest way around the race track is you take every turn with precision.

990
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:42.670
You watch what the fuck you're doing and you don't go too fast.
But they,

991
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:43.480
but again,

992
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:47.740
people don't know what that is cause I actually have the opposite thing where I

993
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:52.030
take everything with precision to a fault where I'm very like,
no,

994
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:55.960
I boundaries and you will not sleep over and I will not.

995
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.640
I mean like that's an exaggeration.

996
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:00.270
But I had that sounds like a lot of fun and the wonder why I haven't upheld

997
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:05.180
pretty great.
Sounds like a great guy.
If that Indians listening.
Um,

998
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:09.850
uh,
no,
that was the thing.
It's like she is man,
she would,

999
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.290
she'd think it was fun.
Um,
the,
uh,
but,
but that's the thing is I was very,

1000
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.280
because I had,
I didn't understand boundaries,
so I would do the pedal,

1001
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:20.110
the metal thing and then I'd be like,
I got to do the opposite of that.

1002
00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.160
So I'd be very cautious and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the pedal

1003
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:28.720
to the metal thing.
Turns out great.
Who knows?
Sometimes it turns out great,

1004
00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:31.510
but do you honestly know when it's turned out great?

1005
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.260
Do you know anyone where they just fucked for month and it was just fucking,

1006
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:39.880
just physical if you,
yeah,
I know.
Look,
man,
sometimes it works.

1007
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:43.420
I know people that are super happy together.
I've,
I've,
I know a few.

1008
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.980
It's just you got to get lucky man and well that's the other guy.

1009
00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:48.790
He got all fucking get Scott to get lucky.
You've got to get so lucky,

1010
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:52.310
but you also gotta be worthy of that luck.
You know,
you,

1011
00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:55.270
you got to have your own shit together to the point where you're fun to be

1012
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:57.910
around the,
you're a nice person.
You actually,
you,

1013
00:58:57.911 --> 00:58:59.910
you contribute to the relationship,
right?

1014
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:01.360
It's not like you're sucking off of someone.

1015
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.530
Have you ever had a girl that you dated that wouldn't stop fucking complaining

1016
00:59:05.531 --> 00:59:09.130
about everything?
No matter why I did it to grow,

1017
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:12.220
it was this,
God is traffic.

1018
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.690
Are you driving slow on purpose?
What is going on?
Its car smells.

1019
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.410
I smell something.
Yeah.
Was this song who wrote these lyrics?
God,

1020
00:59:21.411 --> 00:59:22.070
there's nothing on

1021
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.470
<v 3>this radio.
I think that's a sign of stupidity.</v>

1022
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.730
I always say that people are constantly talking about physical sensations.

1023
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:33.230
It's a little bit,
my back hurts.
Yup.
Oh fuck.
Is your hand cold?

1024
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.780
Ah,
this fucking smells in here.

1025
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.570
But it's also a pattern you get stuck in a negative pattern.

1026
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:44.710
One of the most in my past historic girls of of negativity was she was a smart

1027
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:48.320
girl.
She was,
yeah.
Her whole family who's negative,

1028
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:50.750
they're just cunts fucking snap at each other.

1029
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:54.650
Every everybody just like you over there and meet your thing.
Oh yeah,

1030
00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.153
I can be around that.

1031
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.530
No you can't do that to me cause the other guy we started playing as people with

1032
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:03.740
like do you think I can't go negative t I'm a fucking comic and I can just

1033
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:06.650
fucking,
how dare you tell me to turn it on and I'll do it.

1034
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.900
I just don't want to do,
I don't want to be like that.

1035
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.710
You just threatened her with your intellect to see how he does that.
Your rocks.

1036
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.130
It keeps my friends more way more guys.

1037
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:19.310
I threatened way more guys with it whenever guys.
Yeah,
whenever guys are like,
ah,

1038
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.140
why would you threaten?
What do you,

1039
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:25.100
what happens when guys talk all busters when guys are ball busters I go,

1040
01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:28.250
look man,
you can bug.
You can keep us from my boss.

1041
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.060
And I know you think it's like jovial and jocular and all that shit,

1042
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.320
but I'm telling you,
once I go negative,

1043
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.660
it's not going to be cute and it's going to be fucking withering and I'll be

1044
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:42.680
relentless about it.

1045
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.100
So just stop now because I think guys don't got to way to communicate.

1046
01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:48.710
And it's like,
I don't communicate that way.
Like what kind of guys?

1047
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:52.970
Or what are they doing?
You chill.
Um,
now what are they doing?
I mean,

1048
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:53.930
they're just gonna like Nice,

1049
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.700
like even that like standup thing of like Nice fucking shirt.
Fheg dude.

1050
01:00:57.701 --> 01:01:00.320
Like just,
and it's like,
what is he fucking sweatshirt?

1051
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.180
Just when you walk on stage,

1052
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:05.770
I don't know if you go to the comedy club and like comics will,
and it's,

1053
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.430
you're not even wearing anything egregious.

1054
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:11.870
You're not wearing cut pants in front of a jet,
right?
You're wearing,

1055
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.180
you're not just creating the greatest sin on earth,

1056
01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:17.670
which is wearing cut pants in front of a jet is egregious.
Um,

1057
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.080
and I'll just go like,
look,
man,
stop.
Like,
warn them.
Yeah.

1058
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah.
I'm,
uh,
I'm,
I'm a big Warner because whenever people like slamming,

1059
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.900
it's like,
do you think I can't fucking slam?
I can slam the president in a,

1060
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:36.360
in a fucking clever way.
You think I can't slam you?
Hmm?

1061
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.670
You pieces you well,
there's a lot of people that just like to play.

1062
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:44.030
There's a little bit,
but I just think it's,
I think it's founded in a negativity.

1063
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.940
I don't think it's,
I don't think anyone means,

1064
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.970
so like I've said like how much money when people go,
Joe,
you set for life.

1065
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.520
They're not rooting for you to be set for life.
That's,

1066
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:57.350
that's indeed what that semi aggressive,
that's exactly what I mean.

1067
01:01:57.351 --> 01:02:00.710
It's like no one wants that for you.
They want to go,
fuck you.

1068
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:05.340
You fucking blew your money,
Bro.
If I were you,
I totally,
and if you're,

1069
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.350
if you aren't set for life,
then they're like this,
this Gacaca Joe Room.

1070
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:12.560
You have nice eyes,
lashes.
Thanks a lot.
So thank you very much.

1071
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:15.280
Is that what you like?
Long Island?
Just notice it.

1072
01:02:15.281 --> 01:02:20.060
He has really prominent eyelash.
Thanks a lot man.
He gets mad.

1073
01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.330
<v 1>So I'm going to go positive on you if you're not careful.
Careful dude.</v>

1074
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.670
He'll just fucking columnists were a lot.
Got It.
Yes.

1075
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:29.570
You look like a skinny George Zimmerman.
How about that?

1076
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.700
So what do you think about this thing now that they grabbed the Zimmerman?
Dude,

1077
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.060
you think it's going to calm everybody down?
Uh,
yeah.
I uh,
I think,
yeah.

1078
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.920
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't think so.
I don't think that they,
they,
they,
yeah,

1079
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.010
but I don't think they were going to bring a trial because people want one.

1080
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:53.310
I think the woman,
the prosecutor was like looked at the,

1081
01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.940
I think the local PD was awful.
I mean,
there were Shitty,

1082
01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:01.650
even the way they walked him in where they walked him in,
like he was a cop.
Like,

1083
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:03.030
Hey,
you want to go ahead?

1084
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.900
One of them walks around them so that he's behind all of the cops.
It's like,

1085
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.470
is that how you treat suspects as you fucking just walk them in?

1086
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:14.340
They're not pushing them.
Then I like hearing them fucking,
yeah.

1087
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:17.470
Jason stayed them Dole.
Those [inaudible]

1088
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.210
kills all of them.
It's all on tape.
That'd be fun.

1089
01:03:21.211 --> 01:03:24.840
You don't know that he's not transporter.
Imagine,
remember.
Yeah.

1090
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:28.860
Remember transporter.
I still,
I always thought you should have movies like that.

1091
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:32.120
I don't want to do those.
You said that last time.
Thank you.
I've always taught,

1092
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.850
I've always uh,
I even killed a meeting once.

1093
01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:38.820
I had a meeting with these people about a martial arts type thing and I said I

1094
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:41.520
don't want to do anything that looks for dare to us.
I go,
I don't want to,

1095
01:03:41.521 --> 01:03:46.060
I would never fight a retard wagon train where there's 10 [inaudible] you can

1096
01:03:46.061 --> 01:03:50.780
say all their,
cause everybody was really crazy.

1097
01:03:50.781 --> 01:03:53.590
I did with zookeeper that scheduling conflict

1098
01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.930
fun.
I'll do it.
Kids movie in a heartbeat that look to a martial arts movie.
Man.

1099
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:04.210
I know I would not want to do a movie where I run the observation that when

1100
01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:08.250
you're in those movies they don't work cause everyone waits to fight.

1101
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.550
There'll be eight years and they'll wait one at a time to get their ass beat.

1102
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.810
That's ridiculous.
And it just all jumping.
You go to Worldstar hip hop.
Okay.

1103
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:20.720
You want to find out,
go to Worldstar hip hop.com and you deal.

1104
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.220
We'll see a lot of evidence how people fight.
This is what happens.

1105
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.040
You get punched in the face,
you've gone unconscious,
your head bounces off,

1106
01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:29.760
the concrete,
people proceed to kick you and then they take your clothes off.

1107
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.610
That's,
that's a real fight.
Stupid.
Yeah.
All right.
That's what people should say.

1108
01:04:33.611 --> 01:04:38.100
This is nonsense about one guy waiting into a crowd of folks and just fucking

1109
01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.210
annihilated.
Pavel.
Respect to stance.
If you're going to dance,
people were like,

1110
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.790
Hey,
one of the time,
Patrick Swayze eyebrow cut.

1111
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:47.310
We're just dribbles a little bit by the face.

1112
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.100
Was it the last ice house critical is that we were talking about this where like

1113
01:04:50.101 --> 01:04:52.390
the worst is when they get knocked out and then they,

1114
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:56.730
they're still punching and co
like a rag doll head.

1115
01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.990
Her [inaudible].
Oh,
but like actual street.
Did you see the lights of the ball?

1116
01:05:00.991 --> 01:05:05.210
Just a couple of why watched a little bit of it.
It's horrible noises.

1117
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.330
Head made when it hits the concrete because it's like,
no,

1118
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.800
but it was hollow because his mouth was open a little bit like a Pumpkin.

1119
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.710
He got caught.
He got hit by the world.
It's like,
that's what it's like.

1120
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:18.100
It's like the world at 20

1121
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.990
<v 4>miles an hour.
It's ridiculous.</v>

1122
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.170
<v 3>Have you ever broken up something like that?
No.
Yeah.
I'd like to think I would,</v>

1123
01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:26.720
but there's a part of it.
It's like,
I think I would just go like,
yeah,

1124
01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:31.760
<v 4>be careful.
Do you?
You,
you,
you could get jumped and taken right into that.</v>

1125
01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:34.340
The first most important thing is it was not a lot of people.

1126
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:37.310
The most important thing is to get the fuck out of here and call the police.

1127
01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.000
That's what the most important thing is.
If you want to jump in,
if there's,

1128
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.990
I mean,
how many people are there?

1129
01:05:41.991 --> 01:05:44.570
10 15 people and you don't think someone's going to sucker punch you too.

1130
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:47.270
They just sucker punched this dude and putting them out.
You ready to go?

1131
01:05:47.271 --> 01:05:50.700
Scrap with 10 people?
How confident are you?
Stupid.
You know?
I mean,

1132
01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.680
even if you get in there and try to,
to saving and say,
hey listen,
this is a,

1133
01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:59.780
this is fuck crazy.
Leave him alone.
I mean,
you,
you've got to gauge the situation,

1134
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.170
gauge how they respond to it.
You better be ready to run for your fucking life.

1135
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.880
That's some real shit.
You know,

1136
01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:08.510
the people that are good people have to understand that there's not,

1137
01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.530
the whole world is not populated by good people.
Right.

1138
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.150
There's a lot of people out there that our mother fuckers,

1139
01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.650
and they'll do crazy shit to you.

1140
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:20.340
<v 3>Well,
it's also interesting how quickly it just becomes like,
and a mob.
Yeah.</v>

1141
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.900
Like just fucking something in the brain just goes,

1142
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:27.960
<v 4>if you are white and they're black,
and in that situation,
that was clearly,</v>

1143
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:30.510
they crack that dude.
And then you,

1144
01:06:30.511 --> 01:06:35.340
you hear them deciding altogether to just rob him and take his shit.

1145
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.390
And if you tried jumping into that man that you were your,
with that guy,

1146
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.480
you're going to be with that guy.
Even if you just protest what they're doing.

1147
01:06:42.481 --> 01:06:43.314
It's not like you're a pro.

1148
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:44.620
<v 3>What if I say,
look guys,</v>

1149
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:48.640
I cocreated Chappelle shall be reasonable about this.

1150
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:53.680
I have some DVDs,
not on me,
but I can give you all give me your mailing address.

1151
01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.180
Then they just start fucking you.
Yeah.
I mean that's

1152
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.020
actually fucking actually fucking that.
They'd be like,
listen,

1153
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:03.880
we got to take this opportunity to fuck,
but that's the,

1154
01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:08.170
you know what's funny is that's the interesting thing about the same part of

1155
01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:08.890
people that just goes,

1156
01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:13.890
and mob is the same part of people that go and comedy club laughing.

1157
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:19.270
It's the same to me.
It's the same mechanism.
What?
It's the same.

1158
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:24.250
It's just your brain decides we're laughing and that's funny and I'm going to

1159
01:07:24.251 --> 01:07:29.200
attack.
I think it's the limbic system,
I think,
and you just go on and go,
yeah,

1160
01:07:29.201 --> 01:07:31.360
but laugh.
I don't know.
I don't,
again,

1161
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:36.280
I understand that's based on just going straight wild crazy.

1162
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:41.050
But you know what I mean about when he'll do a joke that,

1163
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:45.190
and someone in the crowd is,
you have like a pocket of dissenters.

1164
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.180
They make the show worse for everyone around them.
Right,
right.

1165
01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:52.930
And they don't do anything.
They're just,
they have energy.

1166
01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.880
I just think it's like some human energy shit.

1167
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:57.400
I think it's like some animalistic humanity.

1168
01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:59.110
<v 4>I did live audiences,
man,</v>

1169
01:07:59.111 --> 01:08:01.720
we've all experienced that where someone is sitting in the front and they

1170
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:04.540
looking at you funny and they cross their arms and you'll even say,

1171
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.030
I'm like seeing the shaking their head like got to funnel for me.

1172
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:10.150
I've seen some that people will do that until like fuck with you.

1173
01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:12.910
It's like like the people that would stand in front of you if you were playing

1174
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:16.100
pool and they stand in front your shot and like make faces kind of shark you.

1175
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.690
That's exactly what they would do at a comic club.
Like when you do,

1176
01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.080
you watch basketball and dudes are in front of the mat and they're doing that

1177
01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:23.090
thing.
It's guys do that all the time.
There's people that,

1178
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:25.880
people that are always going to want to see if they can fuck with you.

1179
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:27.350
Especially if they,
I think it's awesome.

1180
01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.490
<v 3>They haven't been a comedy clubs many times cause I think a lot of people go to</v>

1181
01:08:30.491 --> 01:08:33.430
come to come.
He's like,
all right,
we better make me laugh cause I paid money.

1182
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:38.050
It's kind of like a,
almost like a job.
It's just that,
that Billy Wilder,

1183
01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:42.100
the director said that,
that uh,
audience members are individually,
they're idiots,

1184
01:08:42.101 --> 01:08:46.900
but together they're a genius.
Meaning the collective unconscious thing.

1185
01:08:46.901 --> 01:08:51.160
Like,
like if,
if I,
I do a joke where I say,

1186
01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:55.000
uh,
I'm Vegan,
it's easy to be Vegan in la,

1187
01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:58.420
but the rest of the country mountains walk minus will walk up to people and go,

1188
01:08:58.421 --> 01:09:02.800
hey,
where do faggots eat?
Okay,
simple joke.
Funny.
Basically a knock,

1189
01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:07.540
knock joke about,
now I'm the,
I'm not being homophobic,
I'm not doing anything.

1190
01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:12.430
Most of the time they're laughing before they can go,
hey,

1191
01:09:12.431 --> 01:09:16.960
wait a minute.
That's kind of,
he said Faggot.
That's kind of homophobic.

1192
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:21.340
How do I feel about that?
And that's what all of comedy is kind of like that.

1193
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.150
And it's,

1194
01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:24.880
and I believe it's the same thing with a lynch mob where it's just like,

1195
01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:29.110
and were a mob before they go.
Maybe a guy that we just punched out,

1196
01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.790
maybe we don't take his pants like they're just doing it.

1197
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.780
<v 4>I don't think that was the case.
I think he was around a bunch of criminals.
Oh,</v>

1198
01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:42.680
you think so?
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
There's a Shitload of criminals in Baltimore.

1199
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:46.730
Crime in Baltimore.
Baltimore's through the phone.
Yeah,
I agree.
No,

1200
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.750
that was a drunk guy who was out with a bunch of criminals and they decided to

1201
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:52.430
beat the fuck out of them and steal shit from him.

1202
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.680
And that wasn't the first time they made the fuck out of somebody.

1203
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.040
That was the first,
it wasn't the first time they stole shit from me.
That's the,

1204
01:09:58.041 --> 01:10:00.800
that's what that was.
I,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

1205
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.640
I don't think it's anything but that it's real simple.
I think it probably,

1206
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:08.110
maybe two of them were criminals and eight of them were like got in on a moment.

1207
01:10:08.111 --> 01:10:11.780
We got dark pockets of humanity and that guy was strolling drunk through a dark

1208
01:10:11.781 --> 01:10:14.120
pocket of humanity and they fuck,
they fucked up.

1209
01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.610
<v 3>What I would say is there's dark pockets in every single human.</v>

1210
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.190
<v 4>Yes,
it's possible.</v>

1211
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:24.220
But you have to have the certain combination of neglect and abuse as a child and

1212
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:26.210
abuse by your environment.
And Abuse.

1213
01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:30.300
You have to have a certain amount of disconnect with the idea of community and,

1214
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.450
and brothership and fellowship and love.

1215
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:36.080
You have to have enough fucked up shit in your life that you don't go the

1216
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:40.070
natural way.
Humans that are raised with love and humans that are raised,

1217
01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:42.390
you know,
in a good community,
that's,
that's what they,

1218
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.330
they try to appreciate and cultivate.
And when you're not and you lash out,

1219
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:47.780
I mean,
it's a,

1220
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.070
it's almost always because somebody did a fucking terrible job of raising some

1221
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:53.060
kid.
Oh yeah.

1222
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:57.190
I've been some other place where everybody around was terrible for kids and

1223
01:10:57.230 --> 01:11:01.370
these toxic access pools,
occasionally they shit out excellence.
You know,

1224
01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:04.700
when someone will just,
would try so hard to get away from it.
They become this,

1225
01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:08.810
you know,
mega mogul type character or you know,
some super rapper dude.

1226
01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:11.840
I mean in or a fighter or an athlete or something like that.
But I mean,

1227
01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:14.280
essentially that's,
that's uh,
it's a dark,

1228
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.740
<v 0>horrible pocket of humanity where anything could go wrong.</v>

1229
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.580
And that's one of the main,
if you want to cry racism in this country,

1230
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:25.200
the real reality that that's some of the most racist shit I think.

1231
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.280
I think system when,
yeah,
when you see,

1232
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:32.010
when you see a problem area like that and you just dismiss it as a bunch of lazy

1233
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:36.180
people,
you're dismissing babies,
man,
you're dismissing them.

1234
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:41.330
That is clearly in a way it's either dishonest or it's racist.

1235
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.690
It's one of the other,

1236
01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.490
because you are ignoring the fact that these bundles of potential human beings

1237
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.820
are being brought into this fucked up situation and instead you want to

1238
01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:55.170
concentrate on some minerals on the other side of the world or some Taliban

1239
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:58.820
dudes that may or may not even exist.
You know?
I mean how many,

1240
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:01.870
how many of them are there really are,
we are 300 of them.

1241
01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:05.730
Isn't there just a bunch of fucking people where you're in their yard and they

1242
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:06.583
have put Joe,

1243
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:11.590
they have over 200 horses and and he spearheaded pickup truck at least appears

1244
01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:15.900
they have.
They ate at last coming of eight sphere.
Fuck man.

1245
01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:20.930
And just think about all the potential that could be saved if we put the

1246
01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:24.420
resources that we're putting into going to these other countries.

1247
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:27.180
That giant fuck,
well that's the thing.
Yeah.
It's like tape,
like Bill Gates,

1248
01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:31.590
ending malaria at that money and took all those people and hired them.

1249
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:34.590
Instead of giving them jobs as soldiers,
giving them,

1250
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:39.750
give them jobs as community rebuilders provide the same kind of jobs that could

1251
01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:41.820
be available to a million soldiers,

1252
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
could easily be better spent in this country to having community builders have a

1253
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.480
million fucking people that you send throughout the terrible spots in this

1254
01:12:51.481 --> 01:12:54.960
country and they rebuild the infrastructure of community centers.

1255
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.920
They set up afterschool things for kids and mentoring for kids that get kids

1256
01:12:58.921 --> 01:12:59.131
around,

1257
01:12:59.131 --> 01:13:02.730
people who can be good role models and they teach them better than they're

1258
01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:05.970
getting in these fucked up schools where you might as well be going to prison or

1259
01:13:05.971 --> 01:13:08.220
do you believe in the idea of like welfare queens,

1260
01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:11.910
meaning women that live exhibits but,
but I don't see,

1261
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:16.730
but to me it says it's a spectrum of humanity,
man.
Yeah,
no,
I agree mom.
At all.

1262
01:13:16.731 --> 01:13:20.460
About,
but I think that that's how people that are against what you're saying.
No.

1263
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.410
Here's the problem with people that are babies don't deserve to be fucked over.

1264
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:29.430
That's the real problem is that we are not taking into account the babies were,

1265
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:33.570
we're putting one of the most difficult tasks to the world and we're taking

1266
01:13:33.571 --> 01:13:37.320
someone who can't even take care of themselves and we're helping them take care

1267
01:13:37.321 --> 01:13:42.000
of themselves so that they can keep raising this baby in the most fucked up way

1268
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:42.834
possible.
Right.

1269
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.160
When really what we should do is try to educate them and try to come in and help

1270
01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:51.270
them and try to figure out what the fuck can be done to put this person in some

1271
01:13:51.271 --> 01:13:55.590
sort of a positive state.
So just so somehow or another you can raise this baby,

1272
01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:58.800
right?
That,
that,
that person's done.
That person's,
yeah,

1273
01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:02.410
she's 45 and she's been on welfare whole life and she's addicted to crack.

1274
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.870
She's done.
You can try and help her if you want,
but you can say that baby.
Well,

1275
01:14:06.871 --> 01:14:10.200
that's what I that don't even saint some ways like do you want,

1276
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:11.800
I almost see is like

1277
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.720
<v 3>a buyout of people.
Like you're going to be a terrible cvs employee,</v>

1278
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.690
so you're going to be a drag on the economy.
We're going to buy you out,

1279
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.140
we're going to pay you to stay home basically and just make 240 bucks a week and

1280
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:29.110
we'll give you milk and sugar and all the shit you need to eat.
But we don't,

1281
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:32.460
you're not good for the economy.
You're all,
you're just bad.
It's worse.

1282
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:35.950
But I also think that another,
another thing that when people on the,

1283
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:39.250
generally on the right say that there's all these welfare queens and stuff,

1284
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:40.870
it's like,
you know,
and they got so many babies,

1285
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:44.270
you know what would help them not have babies?
Birth control.
It was,

1286
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.830
you gave them some fucking birth control.
Yeah.
But even if you do that,

1287
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:49.180
there's going to be some people that I know.

1288
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:52.930
I'm not saying nobody's going to have babies.
I'm saying they,
it's the,

1289
01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.090
it's like the,
well,
you had the baby,
now you got to do it.

1290
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.950
It's like if you gave her rubbers or if you gave her,
uh,
the pill,

1291
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:05.100
<v 0>you'd have less babies who we have to figure out a way to make our community</v>

1292
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.310
somehow or another,
our,
our,
our existence here,
at least in this country.
I mean,

1293
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:10.320
we can't control the whole world,

1294
01:15:10.321 --> 01:15:14.750
but I think in this country we're capable of getting to a place where we w we

1295
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:19.350
have accepted things and standards for our communities and if we just

1296
01:15:19.351 --> 01:15:23.190
concentrated the amount of effort we spend on military shit,

1297
01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.390
on trying to figure out how to stop kids from growing up,
fucked up,

1298
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:29.290
how to come in and help him,
how to,

1299
01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.120
how to come in and catch them while they're young,
while they're not a mess yet.

1300
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:37.440
That's the,
that's really,
it'd be no one is looking at that.

1301
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:42.120
They're allowing all the multiple autistics and they just allow nature to run

1302
01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.460
its course.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
And then it's like you,

1303
01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:48.150
you a big kicked someone in the Shin and they'd go,
what are you limping for?

1304
01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.580
It's like they're born into this terrible thing and then you go,

1305
01:15:50.581 --> 01:15:55.380
you're fucking lazy.
No,
they're born into this.
They,
even if they weren't lazy,

1306
01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:56.430
they,

1307
01:15:56.430 --> 01:16:00.540
they're in such a shitty system that you have to be 10 times more motivated to

1308
01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:03.750
get out of it.
It's,
I've been around a lot of dudes,

1309
01:16:03.751 --> 01:16:07.860
especially when I was really young that the grew up in the projects and then had

1310
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:10.830
like a lot of the kids that I used to do martial arts tournaments with,

1311
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.400
they came from really fucked up place and it was super depressing sometimes when

1312
01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:18.640
I'd go to visit them and go to where they,

1313
01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:23.010
where they lived and they had a lot of anger inside because of that.

1314
01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.310
There was a lot of like frustration because of that nade got out of it with

1315
01:16:26.311 --> 01:16:29.730
martial arts and they become productive members of society.

1316
01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.190
But when they would tell me some of the stories of this shit,

1317
01:16:32.191 --> 01:16:36.930
they had to go through bad.
The crime is and their projects and how scary it is.

1318
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:40.590
You can't have anything sticking out of your pockets.
I'll rip your pockets open.

1319
01:16:40.591 --> 01:16:42.330
Yeah.
Like whoa man.

1320
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:45.770
<v 3>And then the week before they've even gotten to white people.
Yeah.</v>

1321
01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.250
You know what I mean?
Like that's before that.
That's the,
yeah,
we,

1322
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.110
I got a podcast called the champs.
It's on Itunes,
good,
whatever.
And uh,

1323
01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:56.070
we only have,
uh,
we,
we only have a,

1324
01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.540
we only have black ass on cause I've just never had a boring conversation with a

1325
01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:00.930
black dude.

1326
01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:05.030
We've had an Jose Conseco and bought ever had a boring conversation with a blog.

1327
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:07.710
Almost never.
Almost,
no,
I'm not saying never.

1328
01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:10.010
But I find that more of conversation with black dudes

1329
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.720
<v 1>are interesting and uh,
inspiring and,</v>

1330
01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:18.160
and uh,
and just fucking engaging then.

1331
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:21.020
Then why I know if you'd do is you'd walk away from No.
Yeah,

1332
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:23.660
of course there's a few,
I'm sure there's exceptions.

1333
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.210
I'll get a few do as a child a quarter and change that statistic.

1334
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:30.650
But that's the thing is white people,
like they don't spend any,

1335
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.740
the thing that I always say is it's important that most of black dudes,

1336
01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:35.810
I know that like did something with their lives,

1337
01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:39.800
spent time with white people at a young age because it's important to get

1338
01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:44.450
demystified.
Demas have white people demystified.
You Go,
oh,

1339
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.700
it's not,
they're not all out together either.
Not all white devil.
Yeah,

1340
01:17:47.701 --> 01:17:50.440
they're not,
they're just living their life.
They're not,
uh,

1341
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:53.330
they're also not these big Paul Bunyan ask fucking,

1342
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.570
they're not these phantoms that control everything and that they're just people

1343
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.550
they're trying to live like I am.
And vice versa.

1344
01:17:58.551 --> 01:17:59.960
It's good for white people to hang out with white people,

1345
01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.070
but the amount of just shit the average black dude has to deal with on a regular

1346
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.030
basis,
just,
just as part of the culture.
It's just like,
ugh.

1347
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.400
So discussing like Lowell Shinar calves and just every single interaction

1348
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:17.750
banging some hot,
real hot blonde white girl.
Oh,
forget it,
Joe.
Yeah.

1349
01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:21.560
We actually talked about this yesterday with Amy Schumer where she was talking

1350
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:24.540
about how many of black girls have that,
you know,

1351
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:29.390
anger at black men for not dating a black girl like mad.

1352
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.250
And I'm like,
that's like one of the few,

1353
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:35.500
like blatantly open pieces of racism we allow,
you know,
that's,

1354
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:40.440
that's like as racist as he can get.
You shouldn't be dating white girls.
Well,
no,

1355
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:42.620
no.
It's crazy.
It's like we need to,

1356
01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:45.890
we're all the same and we need to overcome about how fucking dare you.

1357
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.620
I've always error you.
Like we're not all the same.

1358
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:50.270
Like it turned out we're not all the same.

1359
01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.160
These bitches are evil and you got yourself to worry about and where the human

1360
01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:58.940
race and if you fall in love with a Filipino lady,
it's nothing wrong with that.

1361
01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:02.660
All right.
You know,
and just because your girlfriend.
Yeah,
it's nonsense.

1362
01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:07.280
Who the fuck is anybody to tell anybody who did date?
Well,
generally the,

1363
01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.920
generally the problem is white.
Black girls don't like white dude.

1364
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.430
Whereas black dudes,
white girl,
tough shit.
No,

1365
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:16.940
I know a lot of open yourself up to more shit.

1366
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:19.220
How do you think Chinese dudes feel if they only like white?

1367
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.610
They got a hard ride.
They got to feel real hard to get a white chick.

1368
01:19:22.611 --> 01:19:25.940
If you're Chinese,
dude,
yeah,
I do a job and a lot of them pull it off.

1369
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.620
Don't get me wrong.
It's not a,
it's not a common thing.
Yeah.

1370
01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:34.760
I do a joke where I say,
uh,
I'd say I used to ask people that were mixed.

1371
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:37.160
They were half white and half Asian,
which parent is white race.

1372
01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.450
But it's a stupid question because I realize that the dad was never Asian

1373
01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:45.190
fucking ever.
That's not true.
I,
it's not,

1374
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.840
you'll find one person,
but mostly it's like I met her when I was in Korea.

1375
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:54.320
There's always like this,
the uh,

1376
01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:58.220
well cause also white girls don't like Asian dudes cause white goes,
don't like,

1377
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.770
cause they don't like short dudes.
But what if is a big one?
There's,

1378
01:20:00.771 --> 01:20:02.690
I know a lot of guys,
I know there's some sec.

1379
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:05.060
You've got to be a sexy fucking Asian to get white girls.

1380
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:09.930
You gotta be a Bruce Lee.
You've got to be a fucking,
uh,
Kevin Shay.

1381
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:14.280
He got me a,
a,
a Bobby leak and Jong Kim.
I mean,
you gotta be,

1382
01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:18.690
you gotta be a Jeremy Lin.
You gotta be as sexy fucking Asian.

1383
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:22.920
That's wild,
isn't it?
Yes.
It's probably the hardest road for White Pussy,
right?

1384
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:27.510
Asian.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
yeah.
I was going to say Mexican dude.
What's the hardest?

1385
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:30.450
What is it?
What is it was the hardest?
If you want to get a black check,

1386
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:35.880
Asian guys.
Well,
Hey,
probably Asian guy and some guys.
Wow.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1387
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:40.020
Could you see Beyonce going out with a,
an Asian guy?
Could you ever see that?

1388
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:44.760
Sure could not even.
Sure.
Good.
And Joe sure could.

1389
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.500
Yeah.
Might even be a clean slate.
But Bruce Lee,
I fucking,
you gotta be bad.

1390
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.830
Had happened.
Some weird place like Scottsdale,
Arizona or something.

1391
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:55.080
It's hilarious.
Tanning Salon.

1392
01:20:55.140 --> 01:21:00.090
So they're just both a little off and she gets a thrill out of the fact she

1393
01:21:00.091 --> 01:21:04.110
hangs out with this dude who speaks Mandarin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe.

1394
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:07.170
Maybe her dad was like,
really in a Kung Fu.
Yeah.
There's what again,

1395
01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:10.680
it's gotta be like,
Shit.
Yeah.
But I would have said I don't,
yeah,
it sucks.

1396
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.860
It's just one of those things.
It's just like,
man,

1397
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.100
there's nothing we can do about it.
Yeah.
It's just history.

1398
01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.980
Although having said that,
I've met during gangs,
cons,

1399
01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:24.980
time to bring it back to that,
that they Asian dudes could get posted because it,

1400
01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.830
first of all because they were taking it,
but also because they,

1401
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.630
that was the paradigm of masculinity.
That's interesting.
That's fun.

1402
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.780
That's really fascinating.
So what happened that,
that,
that change,

1403
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:42.000
what is it all cold?
That's why I always find that when I go to Europe,

1404
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:46.560
it's odd that in America it's,
take it to me it's like a,

1405
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:51.450
granted that black dudes are cool and create a lot of culture.

1406
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:55.590
And in Europe it's kind of like no soccer.

1407
01:21:55.690 --> 01:22:00.300
The number one sport they prefer like techno music to hip hop.

1408
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.100
Yeah.
There's a lot of like,
so there's no,

1409
01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:05.370
they like don't even get like black fashion isn't a thing.

1410
01:22:05.371 --> 01:22:06.480
They all wear tight pants.

1411
01:22:06.481 --> 01:22:11.481
Like whereas here there's a huge strain of black cultural dominance that you go

1412
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:14.970
to the urban,
it's just,
it just fucking evaporates.
Um,

1413
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.360
but I think it is that like what's the,
what,

1414
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:22.290
what do people conditioned to think is good?
Yeah.
Really?
Well.

1415
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:26.360
Why by sexually?
That doesn't make sense to me because sexually to me it's,

1416
01:22:26.361 --> 01:22:29.370
it's always clear with what men like men like the same thing,

1417
01:22:29.371 --> 01:22:33.360
every God damn turn and there's a few Weirdos and want stick figures and fat

1418
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:37.890
women men.
What's the magic ratio of the two to one hips to waste?
Much of it is,

1419
01:22:37.891 --> 01:22:40.050
it's natural and ratio.
It was a lady that I was,

1420
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:43.440
I was in Beverly Hills today and there was this lady and she was probably in her

1421
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:47.760
forties deep door forties which I try to be respectful and not have like ugly

1422
01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:51.270
feelings about women who were older than me.
When I look at her,
she was

1423
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:56.070
so nice.
She had these like thin,

1424
01:22:56.130 --> 01:23:01.050
she had this thin waist in this house.
You could tell this bitch goes to the gym.

1425
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.790
You could tell she worked out hard.

1426
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:06.160
Like she was like really well kept and you just look,
just

1427
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.580
<v 0>look at her body like instantly or wow.
Like that sex.</v>

1428
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.720
Like that's what she looks like.
Sadness.
You're built for sex.
She looks like sex.

1429
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:18.250
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's,
that's,
that's just like,
but again,

1430
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:24.280
like tall guys saw the shoulders that I'm talking to in general.
They like,

1431
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.950
do you know what they like?
They like strength.
They're like,
yeah,

1432
01:23:26.951 --> 01:23:31.390
this is a gold genetic strength.
Yes.
And they also like social worth.

1433
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:36.190
They liked frank strength is absolutely,
that's monetary strength.

1434
01:23:36.191 --> 01:23:38.540
They want,
they want whatever it looks attractive to mate.

1435
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.540
It's the same thing that men want a woman that can fucking protect their baby in

1436
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.990
utero.
And then why,
why not Asian?

1437
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:50.670
Because they're not tall and they don't have,
generally speaking not to all.

1438
01:23:50.671 --> 01:23:54.790
And they don't have broad shoulders,
but shots.
Yeah,

1439
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:58.780
they do social skills.
So it is,
no,

1440
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:05.350
it can be smaller.
Second,
well way it just there.
I don't know.

1441
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:09.010
They're just like any of the agents that I know,
they're,
they're very,

1442
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.610
they're very foreign.
Like,
like,
like when it comes to just calming,
you know,

1443
01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.650
pop culture,
pop anything or these are you talking about American,

1444
01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:22.670
Asian American agents that I know that we're having conversations with them.

1445
01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.420
It's very different than having like a conversation with like,
uh,
an Asian chick.

1446
01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:32.260
Do you think that it's because they came from the parents of immigrants and

1447
01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:35.590
their parents were like super strict that there's a little of that.

1448
01:24:35.591 --> 01:24:37.450
I mean you're,
you're making a big generalization obviously.

1449
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:40.090
I knew a lot of just talking about the people I know Bobby Lee,

1450
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.840
he's taught like that.
Bobby Lee's pretty cool.
Right?
You know,

1451
01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:46.270
there's a lot of Asians that are like totally down and cool.

1452
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.560
I know several of them

1453
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.670
I know more than are actually cool and I like that are,
you know,

1454
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.340
a lot of fats but cool that girls would want to date him.
Cool though.

1455
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:00.730
Or more like,
hey,
they're cool if I went and talk about video games and stuff.

1456
01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:02.320
Cool.
If I wanted to just hang out with them.

1457
01:25:02.321 --> 01:25:05.590
I know when I think about the dudes that I know that are Asian,

1458
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:10.420
I know a lot of girls arts guys.
I know a lot of Asians,
boots from martial arts.

1459
01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:11.800
I,
and I know a lot of them.

1460
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.670
If I want to talk about the most percentage of Asian dudes with white

1461
01:25:15.671 --> 01:25:19.630
girlfriends,
it's usually martial arts.
That makes complete sense.

1462
01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:24.360
It's a show.
It's a fun there.
Peacocking there and they're fit.

1463
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:29.230
And they were Bruce Lee Brown sweatsuits over where they go and sit for a six

1464
01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:32.230
pack penis,
which is easy to get in her mouth.

1465
01:25:32.231 --> 01:25:35.980
And it's like there's no real easy super and he's happy about it and he doesn't

1466
01:25:35.981 --> 01:25:37.960
care.
It feels good for him.
Uh,
yeah,

1467
01:25:37.961 --> 01:25:40.210
it was really just getting her pussy eating anyway.

1468
01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.190
I mean surely doesn't even like sex that much.
Yeah.

1469
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.250
So them works stereotypes aside.

1470
01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.170
But I think I have a friend that was,
um,

1471
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.560
she was raised by a very strict father to the point where when she got older,

1472
01:25:56.561 --> 01:26:00.760
like all of her boyfriends became,
uh,
she wouldn't date Asian guys.

1473
01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:05.270
It was all white guys,
only white guys.
And um,
her father was like,

1474
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.600
I just guess just such a like stereotypical over the top,

1475
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.240
like,
you know,
authoritarian,

1476
01:26:14.241 --> 01:26:19.241
like really strict Asian father and it just completely whacked around to the

1477
01:26:19.851 --> 01:26:24.620
idea of ever dating an Asian guy.
And if that's the case,
if it's like,

1478
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:27.950
that's a part of their culture.
Like I know like my friends are Korean.

1479
01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:29.090
Like I had a buddy who was Korean.

1480
01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.630
I have never met anybody who worked harder in my life.
That's the thing.

1481
01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.270
There's not,
there's no machismo about the culture.

1482
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:38.960
It's just basically like quiet hard work.
Oh my God.
Yeah they did.

1483
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:43.190
They're not in a bragging at all in chains or not ended up showing getting nice

1484
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:47.660
cars just like we're planning for the next generation.
My friend,
junk sick,

1485
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:51.290
John Chang,
we did taekwondo together.
He went up on the national team.

1486
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.370
He was a national champion and he was in fucking medical school and he took a

1487
01:26:55.371 --> 01:26:58.640
little bit of time off from medical school to to,
to compete.

1488
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.790
Never met a guy.
Works out hard vacuum.
Good example.
Yeah,

1489
01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.920
the just fucking or some shit.
And he's the Gulf

1490
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.500
of Thailand develop aids

1491
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.650
and he lives in the fucking,

1492
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.630
the place by the Beverly center with eight of his cousins of does he really

1493
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:25.280
know?
Like when they come for fights they stay at the Palazzo,
Hey,
what you doing?

1494
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.020
Why would you say they show it on the they cause they show it on that show.

1495
01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.300
Oh that's so stupid.
And there's a gate.
Why would they do that?

1496
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:35.840
How many would nutty people are waiting outside for him every day and fight him

1497
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.630
to fight them.
They'll go ahead and go ahead and they go to the,

1498
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.700
he goes to wildcard jam.
They know where he goes.

1499
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.010
That's the kind of thing when you're that kind of bad ass,
it's like,

1500
01:27:43.150 --> 01:27:45.050
all right to go,
what are you going to do?
We filmed him,

1501
01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:50.051
I went there for Tasha show and Tasha was gonna let Manny Pacquiao punched him

1502
01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:54.230
in the head.
And uh,
I was as corner man.
And uh,
you know,

1503
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:58.210
he really hit him.
Really?
He was very nice about it.
Like you,

1504
01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:00.540
the first couple of times he hit him,
he like barely hit him.
Right.

1505
01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:03.950
And then we're going to say gingerly,
no,
I was searching for a word,

1506
01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:07.180
but generally would apply.
That's a good word.
Um,
but the,

1507
01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:10.880
the amount of people that were there,
it was insane.

1508
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:15.410
The amount of people there,
there,
there is a Tasha show.

1509
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.630
They were there because that's where Manny Pacquiao train.

1510
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.220
And I mean this was I guess like a year ago,
maybe less than a year ago.

1511
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:23.950
Maybe less than two year program.
Um,

1512
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:27.500
and so he's only gotten even more popular since then.

1513
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:31.040
I mean he's got damn superhero.
Yeah.
There's a restaurant,

1514
01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:32.920
a Thai restaurant that you eat at downstairs.

1515
01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.060
It's got all pictures of him on the wall because that's where he eats.

1516
01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:39.170
They know it or yeah,
you can find many package.
Yeah,
you can find them.

1517
01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:42.070
What are you going to,
so that's the end.
He's a humble dude.
Oh,

1518
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.360
he's the nicest guy ever.
He's a sweetheart.
Uh,

1519
01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.980
that is that weird thing that fighters have where it's that that you're like,

1520
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:51.350
where you don't really brag.
Well,

1521
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:54.200
I think when you get to be the point of Manny Pacquiao,
why would he brag?

1522
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:58.550
I mean that guy probably can't believe.
How do you make of his life as well?

1523
01:28:58.551 --> 01:29:02.010
That's sort of part of it is his shtick.
And it's also

1524
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.430
<v 4>a part of it is why he's become so successful.
And it's also part of it,</v>

1525
01:29:05.431 --> 01:29:07.470
it's his environment.
And if you look at it,

1526
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:10.620
I mean there's no better example than those shows,

1527
01:29:10.621 --> 01:29:14.730
those HBO series when they follow him,
because if you follow his life,
man,

1528
01:29:14.731 --> 01:29:19.660
his father was in jail.
Okay?
His father talks mad shit to them.

1529
01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:23.100
They talk mad shit to act like he's,
he's saying to his father,
he goes,

1530
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:24.960
you ain't nothing.
You ain't never nothing.
You Ain't,

1531
01:29:24.961 --> 01:29:26.640
you ain't no champion who never know champion.

1532
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:29.940
And he says it to his father's face on camera and you know,

1533
01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:32.880
he shuts down his father.
It makes them look like shit on camera.

1534
01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:33.601
And then as you know,

1535
01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:38.420
his is his uncle Rogers the same way and they just talk mad shit to each other.

1536
01:29:38.421 --> 01:29:41.850
And Roger just kind of,
he's a on trial for domestic abuse.

1537
01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:44.280
He beat some girl loving that.
That's the environment.

1538
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:48.120
And then Floyd smack some girl and you know,
he's got to go to jail for 90 days.

1539
01:29:48.121 --> 01:29:51.990
Then letting them fight first.
You know,
I mean it's really,
that's a crazy life.

1540
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:54.720
He's that,
that's part of his environment.

1541
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:57.150
But look how goddamn discipline that dude is.

1542
01:29:58.450 --> 01:30:01.980
Floyd will get up,
he'll go out clubbing,
drinking water,

1543
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.600
and then with his jeans on,

1544
01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:07.920
he'll run like one 30 in the morning just to say it gets his truck to draw his

1545
01:30:07.921 --> 01:30:08.500
driver,

1546
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:12.210
whoever the fuck he's got working for him to drive the car behind him and he'll

1547
01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:13.290
just go run home.

1548
01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.360
<v 3>Do you think that's characterological meaning,</v>

1549
01:30:16.361 --> 01:30:19.300
do you think it's just in him meaning edit certain point?

1550
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:23.230
It's like that So-and-so's disciplined.
It's almost like they're not,

1551
01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.040
they're just there.
It's just how their brain is like,
they're just like Floyd.

1552
01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:28.980
It's not even,
it's like I just got to fucking wrong.

1553
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.650
<v 4>No,
no,
he's not that crazy.
I think he's doing the work.</v>

1554
01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:36.190
I think he's just addicted to success and I think he knows exactly what he has

1555
01:30:36.191 --> 01:30:39.340
to do to be as good as he is,
which is better than almost anybody.

1556
01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:44.670
And I think his technical skill is only only a eclipse by his work ethic.

1557
01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.760
And that's what people don't understand.
He's got great technical skill.

1558
01:30:48.761 --> 01:30:51.640
He's a great boxer.
He doesn't ever seen him fight live.
Oh yeah,
he's,

1559
01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:53.890
he's on a different speed.
Yeah,
he's,
well,

1560
01:30:53.891 --> 01:30:58.120
he's also so accurate and it's timing is fucking genius and he knows how to

1561
01:30:58.121 --> 01:31:01.120
control a fight and he knows how to pace himself.
He knows how to do anything.

1562
01:31:01.121 --> 01:31:04.480
But one of the big things about that dude is he never gets tired.

1563
01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:08.590
That guys never even remotely tired.
You never even see him slow down.

1564
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:09.271
You know he's,

1565
01:31:09.271 --> 01:31:13.120
he's never in a war where he has to dig down deep because someone's been rocking

1566
01:31:13.121 --> 01:31:15.970
him.
Know when he starts seeing fighters in those fights,
they're covering up,

1567
01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:18.850
bouncing off the ropes.
The last time you saw that flow back

1568
01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.760
<v 3>guy that he ended up knocking out when the guy put his hands down,</v>

1569
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:24.740
[inaudible] was giving them a lot.

1570
01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.210
<v 4>No,
no he wasn't.
He wasn't hitting him with shit all he was hitting him with.</v>

1571
01:31:28.211 --> 01:31:32.370
It was headbutts.
That guy was,
oh,
I agree.
I agree.
He throws a lot of punches.

1572
01:31:32.371 --> 01:31:37.050
But Floyd is a goddamn expert at moving with punches and about sliding away from

1573
01:31:37.051 --> 01:31:40.860
punch.
The only guy ever hit him clean that I've ever seen in a modern fight.

1574
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:44.070
Not when he was younger,
when he's first starting out.
But in a recent fight,

1575
01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:46.770
it sugar Shane Mosley caught him with a right hand or rock done.
But you know,

1576
01:31:46.771 --> 01:31:51.350
you guys fucking calms himself down.
Puts a song.
Nope.
Nope buddy or rock.

1577
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.193
He got cracked.

1578
01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:56.960
<v 3>I like that.
That counts as like he got to hit those guys get knocked out.</v>

1579
01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:01.120
We're the one time he got hit,
they all get hit.
But he got hit right.

1580
01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:02.050
No I get in the pool.

1581
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:06.260
But that's how fast he is is that you're bringing up like in one time in 1998 a

1582
01:32:06.261 --> 01:32:09.520
guy actually landed a punch clean.
Exactly.

1583
01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:12.430
I saw him fight Hatton and somebody else and you just got like,

1584
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:14.550
this isn't even a,
they're not even in the same way.

1585
01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:18.470
<v 4>He's way too good for them.
He's way too good and hadn't started getting tired.</v>

1586
01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:21.510
I mean it hadn't was a tough guy but high and was also a partier.

1587
01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:26.020
Fuck hat.
And after he got out of the game,
he got real big.

1588
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:28.730
I started doing cocaine.
Got Call with it.
Yeah.

1589
01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:33.110
So which is so sad when he see fighters that like they get out of the game and

1590
01:32:33.111 --> 01:32:35.540
then they just,
they don't know what the fuck to do and they go crazy.

1591
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:37.730
It happened at Joe Louis,
it happened to,

1592
01:32:37.731 --> 01:32:42.380
you know Sonny Liston and habit to a lot of them they don't want to do is just

1593
01:32:42.381 --> 01:32:45.800
get fucking nutty there.
What a wild ride they'd been on their whole life.

1594
01:32:45.801 --> 01:32:47.240
Then all of sudden you say,
okay,
no more than

1595
01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:51.710
<v 3>crazy.
There's this,
there should be a farm or something.
I mean for real I'm like,</v>

1596
01:32:51.711 --> 01:32:53.060
what do you do with Mike Tyson

1597
01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:59.090
related violence and we have no use for it other than in that one thing that you

1598
01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:00.710
can only really do until you're 27

1599
01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:05.580
<v 4>well Mike Tyson actually I believe has a one man show in Vegas now is what I've</v>

1600
01:33:05.581 --> 01:33:06.420
been hearing.
I've been hearing.

1601
01:33:06.421 --> 01:33:10.380
It's really good and what it is is he just sits down and tells stories of his

1602
01:33:10.381 --> 01:33:14.040
life just like that.
But they put a structure to it and they know,

1603
01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:17.730
they know like he knows like how to do it and apparently is a great stage

1604
01:33:17.731 --> 01:33:22.380
presence and apparently it's really compelling because that's great.
It's great.

1605
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.130
Yeah.
Was sitting there with boxing history when,
how old are you?

1606
01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:28.040
38 I was,

1607
01:33:28.210 --> 01:33:33.210
I'm 44 when I was in 1986 I was 19 years old and I remember when Mike Tyson

1608
01:33:35.281 --> 01:33:37.620
fights would come on when I was,

1609
01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:40.530
I remember when Mike Tyson fights would come on.

1610
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.870
Everybody would fucking gathering room.
They would all gather round.
It was,

1611
01:33:44.871 --> 01:33:47.220
it was something different.
It wasn't like,
Hey,

1612
01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.380
there's a boxing match this weekend.

1613
01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:54.200
<v 3>Even Marvin Hagler come on.
Marvin Hagler fan were assaults.</v>

1614
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:58.080
Primal.
Yeah.
There was something like where they're going to let a dog attack.

1615
01:33:58.350 --> 01:34:02.420
Like there's something,
an animal is going to like something horrifying.

1616
01:34:02.421 --> 01:34:03.130
It's going to happen.

1617
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:06.040
<v 4>He's a part of the sports history.
There was no one,</v>

1618
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.530
no one I think today can appreciate how dominant he was when he was in his
prime.

1619
01:34:10.531 --> 01:34:12.310
Yeah,
especially amongst the general public.

1620
01:34:12.311 --> 01:34:14.650
There's a few people that question whether or not,

1621
01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:16.630
you know he's ever fight a guy like Carl the truth.

1622
01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:20.980
Williams had a really good jab,
apparently had great training sessions with him,

1623
01:34:20.981 --> 01:34:23.290
and it was like call the truth is the guy to beat Tyson.
Right?

1624
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.660
But then by the time Tyson got to Carl the truth,
he fucked him up.
He was cut.

1625
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:28.980
Tyson was on a completely different level by that point.

1626
01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:33.040
<v 3>Well that they were all
out in 40 seconds.
Well,</v>

1627
01:34:33.041 --> 01:34:36.780
Larry Holmes and people will get mad and it's like,
well,
he's that fucking good.

1628
01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:39.800
<v 4>Larry Holmes was older when he fought them,
you know,
so I won.</v>

1629
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:41.890
I would have loved to have seen a prime Larry Holmes.

1630
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:44.470
Larry Holmes gave him a hard time with the jab in the first round,

1631
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.400
but in the sac around Tyson just started moving his head more,
found its rhythm,

1632
01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:51.700
eventually caught him with a monster,
punched,
dropped him,

1633
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:56.290
and then knocked him out in a really fucked up way where his leg went backwards

1634
01:34:56.291 --> 01:35:00.050
behind them.
And then ain't,
I remember that it was really,
well,

1635
01:35:00.051 --> 01:35:03.500
you looked at it was like his leg.
It's fucked.
And uh,
you know,

1636
01:35:03.501 --> 01:35:07.970
Larry Holmes was a long time heavyweight champion.

1637
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:10.790
Nobody had ever done that to Larry.
Guys are beating Larry,

1638
01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:14.020
but nobody ever had done that to him.
Yeah.
So that kind of was like,

1639
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.260
he's such a historic,
he made dudes look retarded.
There was scary.

1640
01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.520
<v 3>He would literally make them look like they would pass out in a way.
It's like,</v>

1641
01:35:21.521 --> 01:35:24.970
Yo do crazy shit.
People don't need to see that.
Like,

1642
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.890
oh look like a drunk they making you make women men look like drunk ants.

1643
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:33.880
<v 4>Yeah.
But when he won the title,
he did that.
Remember who the fuck did he fight?</v>

1644
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:37.480
That guy who was a bourbon bourbon want to be being a reverend and shit and

1645
01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:40.870
doing a bunch of other nutty shit.
I think he got murdered too.

1646
01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.800
Why do I know he did a lot?
I feel like there's a lot of shit got murdered.

1647
01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:48.380
<v 3>Uh,
I don't think,
I can't rule that out.</v>

1648
01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:49.900
<v 4>Yeah,
that's very possible.</v>

1649
01:35:49.901 --> 01:35:52.990
But the idea of Mike Tyson telling you all those stories,

1650
01:35:52.991 --> 01:35:56.020
what it was like to be that guy,
you know,

1651
01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:58.990
back then when he was on top of the fucking world.

1652
01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.840
I mean he was a fucking monster.

1653
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.130
<v 3>The other thing about Mike Tyson is he's a,</v>

1654
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:08.090
he's the Mike Tyson of self loathing as well.
Meaning he'll just be like,

1655
01:36:08.091 --> 01:36:11.780
I'm a piece of shit.
And it's like,
whoa man.
But it's,
there's something.

1656
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:13.760
So arresting about somebody saying that.

1657
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:17.480
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
Trevor Barbara was murdered man.
Yeah,</v>

1658
01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.160
he won the title from Trevor Berbick.
You remember that?
Um,

1659
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:24.960
one thing that Tyson did for the movie where he's talking about his mindset as

1660
01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:26.400
he was walking to the cage,

1661
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:28.700
<v 3>uh,
and they were telling they raped him.</v>

1662
01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.230
<v 4>No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He was walking and he was like,
he goes,</v>

1663
01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:35.990
I'm walking to the cage.
I'm nervous.
I'm nervous and thinking about this,

1664
01:36:35.991 --> 01:36:37.940
I'm looking at the crowd,
I'm looking at him,

1665
01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:40.100
I'm trying to make eye contact and then they get clothes.

1666
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:44.120
I get more and more confident.
I get calmed down,
I'm a god.

1667
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.480
And he just an it would be when it's just like the way he said it,

1668
01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:49.040
like he just be like,
oh yeah,

1669
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:53.700
what the fuck would it feel like if you had got it and if you're traveling in a

1670
01:36:53.701 --> 01:36:58.040
rot.
When he fought Leon Leon when he fought Michael Spinks,

1671
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:59.480
that was a one of the,

1672
01:36:59.481 --> 01:37:02.480
one of the big fights Tyson's career and Michael Spinks was a former light

1673
01:37:02.481 --> 01:37:05.330
heavyweight champion who had gone up to heavyweight and Pete and Larry Holmes by

1674
01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:08.870
decision,
but there was a look in his eyes when they were reading it.

1675
01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:09.311
You know when the,

1676
01:37:09.311 --> 01:37:11.540
when the guy was going over the rules and they were looking at each other.

1677
01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:15.110
Mike Tyson was just chomping back and forth and just staring at the way he wears

1678
01:37:15.111 --> 01:37:15.944
his towel.

1679
01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.440
They need kind cut a hole in a towel and you hear that quote attributed to that

1680
01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:25.400
walk in and you think about that fight and what it must've been like to be

1681
01:37:25.401 --> 01:37:30.020
Michael Spinks in the room with at that moment the most impressive heavyweight

1682
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:32.480
fighter in the history of the sport in my opinion.

1683
01:37:32.850 --> 01:37:36.530
You've got to judge a guy on what he does to the tough fights when he's in his

1684
01:37:36.531 --> 01:37:39.650
prime at his best.
And Mike Tyson in his prime at its best,

1685
01:37:39.651 --> 01:37:41.990
which is run through dude.
That's what I wonder.

1686
01:37:41.991 --> 01:37:46.970
What do you think happens if he fights Ali at his prime?
It's not a match,
right?

1687
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.460
No,
I think he might.
I think he might get Ollie.

1688
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.320
I think he just gets him in the first round.
I think it would get them,
you know,

1689
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:55.980
Henry Cooper knocked down Ali and had him badly hurt and custom auto had

1690
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:00.420
<v 0>or no,
rather um,
oh,
what the fuck's his name?
The guy that just died,
uh,
are uh,</v>

1691
01:38:00.421 --> 01:38:05.370
Bundini entity.
Jesus Christ.
Oh,
Bert Sugar.
No,
no,
no,

1692
01:38:05.371 --> 01:38:10.290
no,
no,
no,
no.
W who is,
um,
sugar ray Leonard is a trainer.
Angelo Dundee.

1693
01:38:10.630 --> 01:38:14.970
Angelo didn't Dundee cut his gloves so that they would have time to recover.

1694
01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:17.340
They,
he got back to the corner and they cheated.

1695
01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:21.060
They cut his fucking gloves cause he got knocked down by Henry Cooper.
You know,

1696
01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.910
Ali later as he got older,
got way better.

1697
01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:27.360
But if they bolted fought like when they were both the same age when Tyson was

1698
01:38:27.361 --> 01:38:30.900
21 and Ali was 21 Tyson when it killed him,
he was,
yeah.

1699
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:34.930
Or even like the Thrilla in Manila or like the or the the,
the foreman won one.

1700
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:37.200
You know,
a lot of people don't want to think of,
you know,

1701
01:38:37.201 --> 01:38:39.340
Ali in the later years because he got,
you know,

1702
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:42.690
battered and broken up and they're absolutely right.
But even at his best,

1703
01:38:42.810 --> 01:38:45.600
he still got caught.
He got caught by something and he never got,

1704
01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:47.280
he never fought anybody like Tyson.

1705
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:50.610
He never fought anybody like the Tyson that fought Marvis Frazier.

1706
01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:55.620
Jesus fucking Christ.
No vacuuming,
Gary.
That was,
it was,
it was like,

1707
01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:00.000
it was like the Christians and the lions.
It was fucking crazy.
No one's,

1708
01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:02.570
no one's confusing Muhammad Ali with Myers Frazier.

1709
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:05.760
But I'm saying some of those might have got through and if some of those got

1710
01:39:05.761 --> 01:39:09.600
through,
that would have been the end in my mind.
Foreman would give them a fight.

1711
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:13.200
Fuck yea.
Wood for wood from Africa.
Fuck yeah.

1712
01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:17.960
From when we were kings fired back a heavy bag and she was just like,

1713
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.940
well you know,
that's the thing.
A good thing you could say about Ali as well,

1714
01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:23.940
cause I only had an incredible Chen.
I'll leak,
could fuck it,
take it,

1715
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:24.803
he could take it.

1716
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:27.480
But nobody ever hit him with the kind of combinations to Tyson was capable of

1717
01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:31.380
throwing Tyson through ungodly things that had never existed in the heavyweight

1718
01:39:31.381 --> 01:39:35.130
division before.
Nobody had ever ripped the body to the head like the way he did.

1719
01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:36.420
Well,
he would throw that right,

1720
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.530
right hook to the body and then that writing opera cut and his whole body would

1721
01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:46.210
involve
the dolphin thing where it's just like,
you know,

1722
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:49.350
there's a lot of boxing people would totally disagree with me and they say,
oh,

1723
01:39:49.351 --> 01:39:52.920
it's so disrespectful to Muhammad Ali and he was the greatest.
He was amazing.

1724
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:56.620
But I think things evolve and athletes evolve and you,

1725
01:39:56.621 --> 01:40:00.090
you got to excel if you want to try to put them era to era and say,
well if,

1726
01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:04.740
what if Mohammed Ali grew up during Tyson's Aaron's,
right?
He would be,

1727
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:05.790
he would have been better.

1728
01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:08.400
Muhammad Ali would have been better if you grew up in that generation it would,

1729
01:40:08.401 --> 01:40:11.220
and that's not,
that's not bullshit.
And Muhammad Ali was an amazing athlete,

1730
01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:14.850
but he was an amazing athlete in the 1960s if he was an amazing athlete in the

1731
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:18.720
year 2000 he'd be even fucking better.
For sure I you're set.

1732
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:22.830
But if you look at them as far as like it's just a window of time and compare.

1733
01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:26.220
If you could somehow or another get them in a room and the same physical state

1734
01:40:26.221 --> 01:40:26.791
that they have those,

1735
01:40:26.791 --> 01:40:30.150
cause those guys are the wait guys are ripped now is completely different.

1736
01:40:30.151 --> 01:40:32.100
Tyson was on another level.
Dude,

1737
01:40:32.101 --> 01:40:34.680
he was on another level and he didn't sustain it and he did.

1738
01:40:34.681 --> 01:40:38.190
He definitely imploded.
He went through,
but when he was on man,

1739
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:42.420
dudes would be terrified of him.
Bruce Seldon went down to a miss.

1740
01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:46.990
He hit him and then Bruce Selden winged left hook on him and he fucking stumbled

1741
01:40:46.991 --> 01:40:47.880
as the ropes.
He fell.

1742
01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:53.050
That might've been like some Kung Fu fear shit where he just knew the end was

1743
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:54.364
coming.

1744
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.840
<v 3>You know,
you do any,
cause I read this book called 10 minute toughness,</v>

1745
01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:04.110
which this reminded me of and it's a book about positive visualization just in

1746
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:09.460
whether it's,
it's for athletes and cause I asked an athlete friend of mine like,

1747
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:11.530
do you do any,
any sports psychology thing?

1748
01:41:11.531 --> 01:41:15.890
Cause I realized from stand up I was like,
I have no uh,

1749
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.340
not defense make but I have no,

1750
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:22.360
I just go like the it basically what happened was I would be in a bad mood and I

1751
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:26.860
mean like I'm going to bomb and then I'd go and bomb.
We're enough.
I would just,

1752
01:41:26.861 --> 01:41:29.700
I could feel it,
I could feel that I was going to vote.

1753
01:41:29.701 --> 01:41:33.700
It was like you have to be able to overcome that.
The feeling of like,
I don't,

1754
01:41:33.701 --> 01:41:37.510
I'm in a bad mood and then like,
so I basically,

1755
01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:40.990
it's a simple 10 minute toughness and it's basically just about positive

1756
01:41:40.991 --> 01:41:43.270
visualization of said task,

1757
01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:47.200
whether it's batting basketball,
you know,

1758
01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:50.770
someone said half friend's really into it.
Yeah.
But I found it's really helpful.

1759
01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:54.670
Um,
and,
and you also hear fighters and you hear,
you hear,

1760
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:56.110
I know athletes to do it and they,

1761
01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.520
and Palae used to lay down for half an hour before every game and just visualize

1762
01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:03.730
it.
A Michael Jordan Tiger Woods,
same thing

1763
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.540
<v 4>for sure.
That would help.
Yeah,
absolutely.
100%.</v>

1764
01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:12.090
Anytime you can equate that thing in your mind with you having success in it,

1765
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.170
it's going to implement it.

1766
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:17.760
You do it in your head and then so when you go and do it,

1767
01:42:17.761 --> 01:42:21.240
you're basically just executing.
I do Jujitsu in the isolation tank.

1768
01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:24.120
I'd do it all the time.
I do it in my head.
I go,

1769
01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:27.720
I go over techniques like our force myself to go over a whole series of

1770
01:42:27.721 --> 01:42:29.910
techniques.
So like I'll,
I'll,
um,

1771
01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:32.940
I'll just get into a state in the isolation tank and then I said,
okay,

1772
01:42:33.210 --> 01:42:36.990
let's break down some guard positions and then I just go over guard positions in

1773
01:42:36.991 --> 01:42:38.280
my head and where am I?

1774
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:41.520
Where's this arm disarm is wrapping around the knee and pulling it down.

1775
01:42:41.521 --> 01:42:43.560
Whereas this,
this hand,
this hand is,

1776
01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:47.160
we really try to sensation and then I go through the whole move.

1777
01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:49.800
I go through the whole thing in my head cause I know what it feels like to do
it.

1778
01:42:49.801 --> 01:42:50.634
I've done it all.

1779
01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:54.270
So then I just go through all the moves in my head and I can practice and they

1780
01:42:54.271 --> 01:42:59.271
say that you practicing in that manner is actually sometimes better for you than

1781
01:42:59.791 --> 01:43:04.200
the actual physical act of practicing and as far as like rate of improvement.

1782
01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:04.620
Sure.

1783
01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:07.480
<v 3>Yeah.
No,
I know.
That's what's great about it is that I,</v>

1784
01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:08.910
and I don't even fuck around when I say this,

1785
01:43:08.911 --> 01:43:11.760
I've gotten 25% better in three months.

1786
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:15.070
<v 4>Well when you go back to the tank,
do that.
Okay,</v>

1787
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.040
good visual is visualize your shows like in a tank,

1788
01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.320
but you should never be thinking you're going to bomb.

1789
01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:25.050
You always is that you're the luckiest fucking person ever because you're going

1790
01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:28.840
to go get paid to talk.
Yeah.
That's a,
you're a professional comedian,

1791
01:43:28.841 --> 01:43:31.890
which is craziness.
The fact that somehow or another you,

1792
01:43:31.891 --> 01:43:34.690
you hit the lottery with choosing something,

1793
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:38.380
going after it and then actually achieving success with it in the point of you

1794
01:43:38.381 --> 01:43:40.570
actually get paid to do something that's fun.

1795
01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:44.410
Where's the majority of the world gets paid to do something they don't want to

1796
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.170
do.
That's why they get money.
They get money because nobody wants to do it.

1797
01:43:47.171 --> 01:43:49.300
Or because if they do want to do what they need to be compensated,

1798
01:43:49.301 --> 01:43:51.950
because it's not the ideal shit be doing.
Right,
right.

1799
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.130
<v 3>You know,
maybe it's good work,
maybe you enjoy it.
But if you had your choice,</v>

1800
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:58.790
he might be fishing.
Well,
the guy who gets paid to go fishing,
that guy won,

1801
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.160
you know,
white trash.

1802
01:44:01.161 --> 01:44:05.340
So you're driving to go fishing.
Okay,
you're getting paid.

1803
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.360
You got to stink on,
you just have an emotional stink on you and you're like,

1804
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:14.270
they're going to fucking smell it.
And that's where I talked about that genius,

1805
01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:15.381
the group,

1806
01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:18.830
the collective unconscious thing where it's like they can just smell it.

1807
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:23.760
<v 4>That's also,
I think where you need love.
Neil Brennan A.</v>

1808
01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.810
Yeah.
Dot.
And you and I have always been cool with each other.

1809
01:44:25.811 --> 01:44:29.590
I know you have had like disagreements with people and I've had disagreements

1810
01:44:29.591 --> 01:44:32.170
with people,
but I think when we met each other way,

1811
01:44:32.171 --> 01:44:34.960
way back in the day at Boston comedy,

1812
01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:38.200
we were always cool with each other because I realized I'm like,
Oh,

1813
01:44:38.201 --> 01:44:43.090
here's one of those dudes that people probably fucked with a lot and he seems

1814
01:44:43.091 --> 01:44:48.070
really smart.
He's worried that you might fuck with them,
but he seems cool.

1815
01:44:48.071 --> 01:44:50.860
So I'll just assure him that I'll never fuck with them.
Right.

1816
01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:52.210
That will get along nice.

1817
01:44:53.490 --> 01:44:56.190
<v 3>Yeah,
that's true.
I always felt like,
uh,</v>

1818
01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:01.220
a amount of respect from you that wasn't commensurate with my position in life

1819
01:45:02.611 --> 01:45:05.830
at that time.
Well that's your two guys that stick out.

1820
01:45:05.850 --> 01:45:08.820
You and Jon Stewart that were very nice.

1821
01:45:09.010 --> 01:45:13.260
They were very nice before.
That was a thing to be,
that's how you,

1822
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.880
<v 4>no,</v>

1823
01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.880
how pissed he was that CNN bullshit when he went on and in Carmen's guys hacks

1824
01:45:18.981 --> 01:45:21.680
and you know,
and it was angry and wasn't funny at all.

1825
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:23.780
When you realize how nice that guy is,

1826
01:45:23.781 --> 01:45:26.030
like to get that guy to go and do something like that.

1827
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.520
I've done his show a couple of times or they do the daily show.

1828
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:29.780
He's like the nicest guy ever.

1829
01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:33.470
So friendly if he's really that pissed off at you or something.

1830
01:45:33.970 --> 01:45:36.230
But I've never thought that anybody is in any,

1831
01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:39.980
I mean there's no positions in life.
I think that's nonsense.
I don't,

1832
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:42.320
I don't buy it for a second,
especially as a comedian.

1833
01:45:42.321 --> 01:45:46.000
Like why would I ever consider that anybody else would be the,
there.

1834
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:47.300
There are no positions.
You know,

1835
01:45:47.301 --> 01:45:49.490
you've got to look at a guy who's got a shit job,
you know,

1836
01:45:49.491 --> 01:45:52.100
he's cleaned the bathroom toilets at a a gas station.
Like,

1837
01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.310
oh well I don't know what happened to him that he got stuck in this situation.

1838
01:45:55.311 --> 01:45:59.770
Right?
I'm going to treat this guy entirely based on how he treats me.
You know,

1839
01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:03.620
if he comes out and he's got a fucking bucket in his hand and you know,

1840
01:46:03.621 --> 01:46:07.340
a a broom and he's just cleaning toilets.
And I asked him,
hey man,

1841
01:46:07.610 --> 01:46:09.590
do you know where the highway is?
And he goes,
yeah,

1842
01:46:09.591 --> 01:46:12.200
go double back there and take that off.
I'm going to say thank you,
my brother.

1843
01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:12.860
Have a good day.

1844
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:16.590
<v 3>I agree.
I mean,
the thing is I try,
it's like,
what does this guy seem like?</v>

1845
01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:17.980
Seems like a good dude.

1846
01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.910
We're going to be good dudes to each other and that's good.
And I don't like,

1847
01:46:21.911 --> 01:46:24.310
then the thing that I like about you being living where you live,

1848
01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:27.460
which is far away from La is going,

1849
01:46:27.461 --> 01:46:31.580
I don't even like being around that sort of nexus of like,

1850
01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.960
you will be treated a certain way and you will not be because you're not you,

1851
01:46:37.451 --> 01:46:39.220
not in movies.
So you don't,

1852
01:46:39.250 --> 01:46:42.940
you get a shitty a parking space and you get a shittier social,

1853
01:46:43.090 --> 01:46:45.850
you're going to feel shitty this whole time there is that

1854
01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:50.460
<v 4>man.
I remember I was,
uh,
over a buddy of mine's Xy,
actually,
Brian Callan.</v>

1855
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:55.350
<v 0>So way back in the day when Brian was a single man and he had this girl that he</v>

1856
01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:59.820
was,
uh,
that he had over his place.
And uh,
I,
you know,

1857
01:46:59.821 --> 01:47:02.100
she was like just real country.
I forgot what it was,

1858
01:47:02.101 --> 01:47:03.720
but Brian was supposed to come with me,

1859
01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:08.070
but he was always like making like triple plans,
you know Brian's.
So I'm like,

1860
01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:10.350
come on man.
What are you going?
What are we going to do?
Are we going to go out?

1861
01:47:10.351 --> 01:47:12.930
Are you going to go out with her and just let me know now?
And she's like,
God,

1862
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.030
she goes,
the way acts,

1863
01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:19.110
you would think he wasn't like the fifth lead on a Sitcom.
She goes,

1864
01:47:19.111 --> 01:47:23.650
you only like the fifth lead.
Relax.
And I'll never forget that.
They never that.

1865
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.200
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I was like,
what are you trying to even know what number I was?

1866
01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:33.060
I don't know what number
call sheet.

1867
01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:36.300
I fucking said I was the fifth lead out of,
cause I was,

1868
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.880
there was eight people on the sick and maybe,

1869
01:47:38.881 --> 01:47:42.950
I guess my name came in five or six or whatever the fuck it was.
She knew it.
My,

1870
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.710
come on.
You know that.
How crazy.
I had a girl laugh at me.
She goes,

1871
01:47:46.711 --> 01:47:48.510
you write for Nickelodeon.

1872
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.840
Like it's a good gig.
I was fucking excited to write for Nicola.

1873
01:47:54.841 --> 01:47:56.070
You know what I mean?
Like I'm fucking,

1874
01:47:56.071 --> 01:47:59.450
any job in Showbiz is fucking a good job as far as I'm concerned.
Show.

1875
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:04.500
Did you write for all that meaning and Kell being in that hive of Showbiz?

1876
01:48:05.461 --> 01:48:07.830
There's too many crazy people in the wrong kind of crazy.

1877
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:10.560
I can't get anything out of that and no one acts natural.

1878
01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:11.770
I don't ever talk about it.

1879
01:48:11.771 --> 01:48:16.470
It's like I always say standing next to a celebrity is like driving next to a

1880
01:48:16.471 --> 01:48:19.290
cop.
Right.
He can't fucking at,

1881
01:48:19.291 --> 01:48:22.710
you can do a facsimile of what you think naturalist,

1882
01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:27.570
but everyone's acting fishy.
Fucking everyone.
So I just try to stay away from it.

1883
01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:31.090
Smart.
Yeah,
it's definitely smart.
You know?
Uh,
you're,

1884
01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:34.540
you're way better off outside the hive.
The hive of a,

1885
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:36.440
of this show Biz culture is just so,

1886
01:48:36.441 --> 01:48:40.140
so oversaturated with insecurity and insanity.

1887
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:44.880
It's just too much nonsense and too much crazy people.
Too much,

1888
01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:49.170
too much need.
Like I don't want it.
I don't want to talk about the business.

1889
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.080
I don't want,
I don't want to talk about any of this.
This is all boring shit.

1890
01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.330
Like this is a crazy world out there and we're,

1891
01:48:55.331 --> 01:48:58.540
we're concentrating on some of the most mundane aspects of it.
Yeah.

1892
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:02.580
Just because it's the latest obsession and you also have to realize when you

1893
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:07.560
have a place like this that is essentially the vortex of all things,

1894
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:09.270
where someone,
all,

1895
01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:13.980
all instances where people get a preposterous amount of attention for no reason.

1896
01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:19.230
It all comes from here.
So all these people who watch all these different shows,

1897
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.470
the housewives shows this show,

1898
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.560
they gravitate towards here somehow or another.

1899
01:49:25.650 --> 01:49:28.710
This is going to be the place where they get on TV.

1900
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:32.100
And there's people right now that are out of their fucking mind.

1901
01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:35.670
They'd been a God damn nightmare to everyone they've ever met their entire life.

1902
01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:38.160
And they're on a bus right now and they're headed over here because they're

1903
01:49:38.161 --> 01:49:39.240
going to get fucking famous.

1904
01:49:39.241 --> 01:49:41.610
They're going to get the jet get out of jail free card.

1905
01:49:41.970 --> 01:49:44.660
They're going to get on a reality show.
Yeah.
And guess what?
I,

1906
01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:46.920
they'll going to get it.
They're going to get on a rally show.
They will.

1907
01:49:46.921 --> 01:49:48.320
They'll get on one.
I

1908
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:51.910
<v 1>have hosted one.
I know how it works.
I know how they cast.
They find someone.</v>

1909
01:49:51.911 --> 01:49:54.930
If that guy can fucking form a sentence and he's energetic and he looks at,

1910
01:49:54.931 --> 01:49:57.850
it might be a narcissist.
Huge narcissist.
Perfect.

1911
01:49:57.851 --> 01:50:01.660
He's like flexing in front of the mirror.
He shaves his socks,
you know,

1912
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:04.820
whatever.
We're socks go hook.

1913
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:08.320
I think any crazy person right now could,

1914
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:11.950
could come here and come here just to try to get famous and that's not a good

1915
01:50:11.951 --> 01:50:13.810
place to live.
You got a good place to live with.

1916
01:50:13.811 --> 01:50:18.220
That's the big percentage of people come here to get famous.
That's unhealthy.

1917
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:22.270
Yeah.
I just try to ignore it and try to,
but you're in the hive,
right?

1918
01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:26.560
Are you in the hall?
I live in Venice.
Yeah.
That's the hive sun,
but not really.

1919
01:50:26.610 --> 01:50:30.250
Not hippy high.
Yeah.
Not compare it to a knock compared to Hollywood.

1920
01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:31.570
If you haven't a lot of knowing of people.

1921
01:50:31.571 --> 01:50:34.090
A lot of annoying people live in Venice.
Yeah,
I agree.

1922
01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:36.230
It's a different kind of anointment.
Yeah,
it's a hippy annoying,

1923
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.450
which I find forgivable.
Yes,
and almost part also ignore.

1924
01:50:40.451 --> 01:50:41.290
I'm in my head.

1925
01:50:41.291 --> 01:50:45.070
It's like I drive there and then Topanga Canyon is a lot like that too.
Right?

1926
01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:49.670
There's a lot of hippie.
Topanga is very hippie.
Yeah.
God bless him.
Yeah.

1927
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:54.280
I'm not really done with that.
They annoy me for the most part.
Yeah.

1928
01:50:54.610 --> 01:50:57.940
Hippies.
Yeah.
We've talked about this,
but you have said with like most hippies,

1929
01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.400
oh yeah,
I'm friends with a lot of hippies,

1930
01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:02.060
but there's a lot of hippies that I don't like.

1931
01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:06.060
I became a an anti hippie person when I lived in boulder and then I got to

1932
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:10.890
experience hippies on a daily basis.
There was,
well,
you being Vegan,
this is like

1933
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:12.223
<v 4>weakness.</v>

1934
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:16.640
There's a lot of weakness and illogical thinking and I've had some conversations

1935
01:51:16.641 --> 01:51:17.810
with hippies,
you know,

1936
01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:22.580
the were know quasi debates about shit and they'd go south real quick.

1937
01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:27.290
There's not a lot of logic behind the real slave one move.

1938
01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.410
The real sloppy,
Lazy Hippie.
You know,

1939
01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:32.720
like you ever hear the people that Peter Schiff always debates at occupy Wall

1940
01:51:32.721 --> 01:51:36.200
Street and he goes down there and talks to the sloppy hippies cause they don't

1941
01:51:36.201 --> 01:51:39.530
really have coherent sentences and it's really,
he's battering them around.

1942
01:51:39.531 --> 01:51:43.180
It's Mike Tyson sparks one of us.
It's not fair.
And the,

1943
01:51:43.181 --> 01:51:46.730
those motherfuckers are the,
there's too many of those.

1944
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:50.780
There's too many sloppy hippies who don't really have a good handle on how

1945
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:53.980
complex different social issues are.
And they will,

1946
01:51:54.110 --> 01:51:57.440
<v 1>why should you add all the money?
Do well,</v>

1947
01:51:57.441 --> 01:52:00.770
that's why you need $500 million,
man.

1948
01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:04.370
What do you need that man?
And he just eviscerates him.

1949
01:52:04.371 --> 01:52:09.371
Peter Shift just explains lead on a Sitcom that was a fucking upgrade.

1950
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:12.270
Stepped.
Well,
you know what?
I haven't,

1951
01:52:12.970 --> 01:52:17.360
but I do get in the tank and think about it.
Yeah,

1952
01:52:17.361 --> 01:52:21.710
that's the,
yeah,
there are two.
There's a lot of fluffy hippies and uh,

1953
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:24.110
and sloppy thinking,
man.
Yeah.

1954
01:52:24.111 --> 01:52:27.050
Well that's what I like about your point of view is that it's humane and

1955
01:52:27.051 --> 01:52:32.000
masculine.
I don't find it as like people go like fucking Europe frat boy.
No,

1956
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:36.350
it's not that easy.
Not a frat boy.
He's fucking jock.
No,

1957
01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:37.400
not that simple.

1958
01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.650
<v 4>I don't even know the rules to football.
How about that?</v>

1959
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:40.940
You have to know what's going on.

1960
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:44.150
People get in trouble and the whistle would blow and shit.
And I'm like,
Whoa,

1961
01:52:44.151 --> 01:52:46.130
what happened?
Who,
what?
Yeah.

1962
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.280
<v 0>I Dunno.
I don't know what a point is.
Why do some,</v>

1963
01:52:49.281 --> 01:52:52.460
why are some things more points sometimes like you know,

1964
01:52:52.461 --> 01:52:54.890
they run across the line of certain point,
but if it goes through the net,

1965
01:52:54.891 --> 01:52:58.370
it's a different point.
Right?
It goes through the goals.
Guess what?

1966
01:52:58.371 --> 01:53:02.810
I don't give a fuck you like,
but you'd like fighting.
Yeah.
That's the only thing.

1967
01:53:02.811 --> 01:53:06.400
Well that and professional pool.
Which most boring as fuck.
Yeah,

1968
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:11.150
like professional basketball.
Dia.
Yeah.
Do you play basketball?
I used him.
Um,

1969
01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.290
and I just like,
it's a fun.
Yeah,
it's a very fast paced,
fast paced.

1970
01:53:15.291 --> 01:53:18.140
A lot of dudes,
there's a,
there's a rhythm to it.
There's some,

1971
01:53:18.141 --> 01:53:20.030
there's a lot of dudes Naylin shit.

1972
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:23.270
I love a dude who fades back for a fucking three point jump shots.

1973
01:53:23.271 --> 01:53:26.340
It just is all net.
I love excellence in any form,

1974
01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:28.910
but it doesn't mean anything to me when that ball goes in the net.

1975
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:32.180
I know it's really hard to do though.
So when I watch it,
it's pretty bad ass,

1976
01:53:32.181 --> 01:53:33.860
but it doesn't sustain me very well.

1977
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:37.820
What's funny is when you see like you watch TV and then you're around the people

1978
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:40.010
and you just go,
oh,
when you go you're,

1979
01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:42.740
you're sitting near the court or whatever and you just like,
oh,

1980
01:53:42.741 --> 01:53:47.510
I understand why they're paid $20 million because this is fucking weird.

1981
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:48.860
They're weird to begin with.

1982
01:53:48.861 --> 01:53:52.970
And then there they figured out this weird skill I would assume.

1983
01:53:52.971 --> 01:53:55.750
I'm amazed like that.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

1984
01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:57.800
Where do you see a guy fight and you're like,
man,
and then you see me,

1985
01:53:57.801 --> 01:53:59.780
you're like,
all right,
what do you mean?

1986
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:04.160
Like if you see a guy fight on tape and then you kind of think one thing and

1987
01:54:04.161 --> 01:54:06.530
then you see him fight live and you're like,
ah,
okay,

1988
01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.700
I might be the only person that has seen more people fight live then seeing

1989
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:13.100
people fight.
I that's,
I thought that as I was saying,

1990
01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.970
I see you did not do a lot of prep.
Well I do.

1991
01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:20.570
I'm Wa my prep really is what I would be doing anyway.

1992
01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:25.820
I'm such a fanatic about MMA that I don't have to do any extra shit.

1993
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:28.960
Like,
and I asked him for shit,
like the UFC will give me shit all the time.

1994
01:54:28.961 --> 01:54:30.040
We'll say,
hey,
I need a,

1995
01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.700
I need some video on like Kennan Borow or something like that.

1996
01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:35.330
I want to watch the videos so they'll uh,
they'll send me some shit.

1997
01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:38.840
So I'm like constantly being like fed stuff,

1998
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:41.610
just out of my own curiosity.
Like I want to see,

1999
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:43.740
I missed one of his fights in WWII.
See,

2000
01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.870
can he send me Miguel Torres when he fought Brian Bolt?
And,
and by doing that,

2001
01:54:47.871 --> 01:54:50.180
that's natural for me.
I just want to,
I want to see those.

2002
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:54.150
I'm always like breaking down like fights in my head as far as like,

2003
01:54:54.230 --> 01:54:59.220
like fights that went on in the past.
Are you think shit,
are you good at all?

2004
01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.040
I ever really predict,
but not predicting,
but I have to be a,

2005
01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:05.570
you have to be pretty over the top for me to not predict,
but I'm saying like,

2006
01:55:05.571 --> 01:55:09.770
do you,
are you,
are you surprised by most outcomes?

2007
01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:14.090
I'm surprised often.
Yeah.
I don't think I could,
uh,
I don't think,

2008
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:17.920
I don't think I could ever guess better than 50,
50.
I don't think it's,

2009
01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:20.900
I'm in maybe shit,
maybe.
I'm never really thought about it.

2010
01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:23.720
I've never really seen,
I try to be as objective as possible.

2011
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:27.260
The Tyson Foreman Ali,

2012
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:30.860
I don't make that ultimate decision.
I tried to,

2013
01:55:30.861 --> 01:55:33.560
I tried to be as objective as possible and it's cause I'm not betting,

2014
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:37.220
I don't have to make that ultimate decision.
So what I do is I sit down and I go,

2015
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:42.040
man,
if he tour gets them,
Vito has got some fast fucking hands of veto,

2016
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:44.010
comes out guns blazing,
might catch them

2017
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:44.701
<v 4>and then I go,</v>

2018
01:55:44.701 --> 01:55:48.660
but what a Vandelay can get this motherfucker and did the second round and what

2019
01:55:48.661 --> 01:55:50.190
have you started landing?
Some leg kicks.

2020
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:54.090
What if he can keep his hands up high and avoid the flurry and somehow or

2021
01:55:54.091 --> 01:55:57.690
another where Vitara what if he turns it into a dog fight,
you know,

2022
01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:00.900
and then you start going back and forth.
But I don't know what's going to happen.

2023
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:04.560
You know,
I never say this is going to happen.

2024
01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.150
I only say this guy should probably be aware of this and that guy should

2025
01:56:09.151 --> 01:56:13.050
probably be aware of that and let's fucking see because it's such a crazy

2026
01:56:13.051 --> 01:56:14.100
fucking sport.

2027
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:18.210
The human jaw was never designed to be punched.

2028
01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:20.490
It was just designed to chew food.
That's it.

2029
01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:24.480
And when you start punching that motherfucker and when you punch heads,

2030
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:28.350
heads were designed to take a certain amount of impact for the lumps and bumps

2031
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:32.220
that you're going to get going through life.
But it's not designed to take one,

2032
01:56:32.221 --> 01:56:35.880
two,
three combinations with a fucking Shin kick at the end of them.

2033
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:40.010
Nobody takes that.
Your,
your,
your brains like what the fuck is happening,
right?

2034
01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:43.420
We hitting an asteroid field like what's going on here?
Your body,

2035
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:46.530
your body's just not designed for finding,
it's so weak.

2036
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.990
And especially in comparison to other animals,
man,

2037
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:53.590
<v 3>are a lot of those guys getting concussed and longterm brain damage fit?</v>

2038
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:54.670
Well,

2039
01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:55.800
<v 4>the steroid,</v>

2040
01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:00.700
there are guys for sure that are going to have some issues with what they called

2041
01:57:00.701 --> 01:57:03.610
pugilistic dementia depending upon when they retire.

2042
01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:07.250
<v 3>Oh,
you followed all the football guys.
Yes,
it's coming.
It's fuck,
I don't,</v>

2043
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:10.630
I think that it's gonna I think it's going to sport will be different in five

2044
01:57:10.631 --> 01:57:13.540
years.
How would they change it though?
I think that they will go,

2045
01:57:13.541 --> 01:57:16.950
someone pointed out,
just put the fucking a diff,
you know the,
the,

2046
01:57:16.951 --> 01:57:21.140
the helmets that uh,
soccer players wear now?
No,
they're not.
How much,

2047
01:57:21.141 --> 01:57:25.670
they're almost like a,
not fleeces soccer players wear helmets.

2048
01:57:25.810 --> 01:57:27.430
Soccer Goalie.

2049
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.730
I saw yesterday wearing one and little kids wearing too because the kids are

2050
01:57:30.731 --> 01:57:32.980
getting concussions from playing soccer.
Yes,

2051
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:36.220
they're getting traumatic brain injury.
But that's what I'm saying.

2052
01:57:36.221 --> 01:57:40.960
Careers that's happening.
But kid yet so,
so I saw a goalie in a,
in a,

2053
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:43.660
in a Manchester and wearing one of those things and I think that that's what

2054
01:57:43.661 --> 01:57:48.100
football will come to.
Wow.
How's that going to stop the traumatic brain injuries?

2055
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:50.800
Ah,
cause if you're not wearing a helmet,

2056
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:54.670
you're not going to go head first into a guy.
So they won't be wearing helmets.
I,

2057
01:57:54.671 --> 01:57:59.660
there'll be wearing,
in my head they were wearing like soft,
like whatever.
This,

2058
01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:01.420
I don't know what the fuck they're called.
They're like,

2059
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.020
they're like soft helmets.
Meaning when guys were leather,

2060
01:58:05.021 --> 01:58:07.660
so like the leather head guys,
they weren't,

2061
01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:10.390
it wasn't as violent because they're protecting their head.

2062
01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:13.510
I completely agree with you.
I completely agree with you in theory,

2063
01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:16.240
but people are so stupid.
I don't think you can sell that.

2064
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:20.640
What I'm worried about is the legal ramifications for sports.

2065
01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:23.530
One of the reasons why they probably couldn't sell it.
You could never sell,
hey,

2066
01:58:23.531 --> 01:58:25.420
the way to protect people's,
give them less protection.

2067
01:58:25.450 --> 01:58:28.280
I think you'll like pick one.
Every win,

2068
01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:31.900
win football players are now just suing the NFL on mass.

2069
01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:33.550
I think that they're going to,

2070
01:58:33.551 --> 01:58:36.580
it's going to be a legal problem and I think the NCAA is going to have the same

2071
01:58:36.581 --> 01:58:40.840
problem.
I think lied every level,
every level of football is going to have it.

2072
01:58:40.841 --> 01:58:42.190
They fucked up down there too.

2073
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:46.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah,
they do.
Right guys get not diagnosed.
Guys can put back in games.</v>

2074
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:48.790
They can't remember.
I didn't even think about college ball.

2075
01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:51.310
I didn't even say in high school.
I mean all the time they get to the pros.

2076
01:58:51.311 --> 01:58:55.150
They probably already experienced it.
Gang and the or the in high school as well,

2077
01:58:55.630 --> 01:58:57.040
like and and so that's the thing.

2078
01:58:57.041 --> 01:59:00.610
It's like they're not going to be able to ensure this shit if there's enough.

2079
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:04.150
It's funny lawsuits for cause.
Just for a few minutes of that conversation,

2080
01:59:04.151 --> 01:59:07.000
I didn't even consider the fact that they had gone through college career as

2081
01:59:07.001 --> 01:59:10.030
well.
I just for whatever reason thought of them as professional athletes,

2082
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:13.230
you know?
Yeah,
I do.
It wasn't even thinking no.
These guys there,

2083
01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:15.730
this is an organized sport.
This isn't like MMA.

2084
01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.940
They actually have to go through a high school career and then a college career.

2085
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:24.010
Think about all the m that's also violent.
Whew.
What a and you know,

2086
01:59:24.011 --> 01:59:27.880
just hope you can get enough out of your body that you can make enough money.

2087
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:31.570
You can squirrel away and live semite comparably in pain for the rest of your

2088
01:59:31.571 --> 01:59:35.320
life when it's over.
Yes.
And that's the thing,
it's a former athlete.

2089
01:59:35.321 --> 01:59:39.220
It's like you want to talk about needing a farm.
Yeah.
I always do a joke.

2090
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:43.150
A buddy of mine who like if you lose,
like whenever I see a former athlete,

2091
01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:44.980
I always feel like they should be with a girl.

2092
01:59:44.981 --> 01:59:47.500
They should be saying to the girl like,
you should've been here eight years ago.

2093
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:51.460
Shit was really popping off them,
but now they're just limping and fucking,

2094
01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:56.080
they're not famous.
They're hunched over.
They got their bodies are fucking shot.

2095
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:59.470
Yeah,
you can get hurt playing football,
man.
That's a,

2096
01:59:59.471 --> 02:00:04.120
that's a way more brutal sport on your body in my opinion,
than MMA.

2097
02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:07.770
MMA is pretty rough.
Don't get me wrong.
I mean it's not a working in it at all,

2098
02:00:07.930 --> 02:00:12.370
but MMA fucking 48 minutes or however long.
Well,
more importantly,

2099
02:00:12.371 --> 02:00:17.371
it's not dudes running at you full speed and then watching their rock and they

2100
02:00:17.491 --> 02:00:22.180
have splotching them Chopin special shoes.
Dig into the dirt bedroom.

2101
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:27.700
Come on man.
And they're on every God damn Mexican supplement known to man.

2102
02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:31.990
I mean these mother fuckers,
when they say that they test the NFL,
yeah,
they test.

2103
02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:34.360
If you talk shit and you get in an argument with somebody,

2104
02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:37.300
they'll fucking pull your purse out and pull your card.

2105
02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:40.390
You think those guys aren't on the juice,
you gotta be out of your mind.

2106
02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:43.360
There's no way humans are that big.
If they are,

2107
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:47.580
we need to find out what the fuck they're putting in burgers.
Why is,

2108
02:00:47.650 --> 02:00:51.730
why have humans grown so much over the past few years and not lost any pesky

2109
02:00:51.731 --> 02:00:55.150
decades
just as fast?
Well,

2110
02:00:55.151 --> 02:00:58.660
there's for sure there's better methods as far as training and they're the more

2111
02:00:58.661 --> 02:01:00.910
sat Tiffany,
but they're not that much.
But I mean,

2112
02:01:00.911 --> 02:01:04.750
that's the thing is it's not fucking,
you can't be fucking six 10.

2113
02:01:04.751 --> 02:01:08.350
Did you ever see Bob Sapp?
No.
You never seen Bob Sapp who is me?

2114
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:13.110
Bob Sapp was the ultimate MMA experiment as far as like,

2115
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:13.960
he was a football player.

2116
02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:18.460
I'm pro football player who became the ultimate MMA experiment in that,

2117
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:23.350
how much can you do?
How much shit can you do?
How big can you get?

2118
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:28.930
And would that overcome technique and skill?
And the answer,

2119
02:01:28.931 --> 02:01:32.340
and a lot of cases was the beginning.
It was,
yes.
He just knocked his job.

2120
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:37.030
Actually,
he knocked,
he beat Ernesto hoost twice.
And so who's,

2121
02:01:37.050 --> 02:01:38.560
this is world famous kickboxer.

2122
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:43.930
Bob Sapp is 370 pounds with a six pack of abs and a body that doesn't even look

2123
02:01:46.401 --> 02:01:49.640
real.
It doesn't look real.
And he throws punches and kicks.

2124
02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:54.650
God Ra coordinated.
Yeah.
I mean fairly coordinated.

2125
02:01:54.651 --> 02:01:58.810
He music clearly like many,
many skill levels below Ernesto hoost.
But Ernesto,

2126
02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:01.740
who's just couldn't deal with the physical power of his own slot.

2127
02:02:01.741 --> 02:02:02.451
It was just too big.

2128
02:02:02.451 --> 02:02:07.451
It was 370 pound man just coming out with those didn't exist before.

2129
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:12.000
Get a guy that big.
Yeah.
You,
if you see him,
I'm gonna,

2130
02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:14.300
I'm gonna pull it up because you just can't believe it.
It just,

2131
02:02:14.301 --> 02:02:16.250
you won't believe that that's a real human being.

2132
02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:20.800
<v 3>You won't believe it.
Uh,
yeah.</v>

2133
02:02:20.801 --> 02:02:25.801
So I'm of the mind that it's gonna it's gonna Change.

2134
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:31.240
You know those Cryo chambers now?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I don't do to that.

2135
02:02:31.330 --> 02:02:35.320
Like the couple Mba guys.
The Sun is actually just bought one.
Yeah.

2136
02:02:35.650 --> 02:02:39.380
A hyperbaric chamber.
No,
it's,
I don't think that's what,

2137
02:02:39.450 --> 02:02:41.080
it's a cryogenic chamber.

2138
02:02:41.770 --> 02:02:46.450
It was guys will freeze there.
Coby does it.

2139
02:02:46.451 --> 02:02:49.540
Dirk does it.
The Sun's just bought one.
Um,

2140
02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:53.230
my buddy Blake Griffin does it and he sent me a video.
You get into,

2141
02:02:53.231 --> 02:02:55.270
you get naked in a,

2142
02:02:55.690 --> 02:02:58.590
basically it looks like just the Chamber Austin Powers.

2143
02:02:59.050 --> 02:03:02.250
<v 0>Cause you can't believe this shit.
And he frees herself.
You can't believe it.</v>

2144
02:03:02.251 --> 02:03:05.970
That's what he looks like when he fights guys.
That's real.
Look at that picture.

2145
02:03:06.090 --> 02:03:09.780
That's real.
That's real.
That's like six foot,
four,

2146
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:13.470
370 pounds.
And he's fighting some poor kickboxer.

2147
02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:16.320
Some poor dude is slaying gloves with that guy.
And that's what he does.

2148
02:03:16.321 --> 02:03:19.050
He gets on top of them,
holds them down and smashes him.

2149
02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:23.850
It's fucking insane.
Yeah.
He did that to Ernesto hoost.

2150
02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:28.800
I mean you,
you look at that image and you go,
how is a human being dead pig?

2151
02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.240
They've never existed that big

2152
02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:35.020
<v 3>before.
Yeah,
no.
So,
so,
uh,
the,
you get no chamber,
the,</v>

2153
02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:38.870
it's negative 300 degrees.
Whoa.
For how long?

2154
02:03:38.930 --> 02:03:43.760
For like 32nd spurts.
For like two minutes.
30 seconds.

2155
02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:47.770
I don't know if it's 30 seconds,
I could be dead wrong.
It's some,

2156
02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.910
and what happens is all of your blood,

2157
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:52.820
your body thinks you're just freezing to death.

2158
02:03:53.150 --> 02:03:58.150
So all of your blood goes to your core and gets replenished in what would

2159
02:03:58.431 --> 02:04:01.070
normally take 24 hours.
Whoa.

2160
02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:05.600
So basically you can work out twice.
You can do two,

2161
02:04:05.601 --> 02:04:10.580
four hour workouts full four hour,
like rejuvenate your body.

2162
02:04:12.150 --> 02:04:14.450
I've never heard of this before.
Cry.
I mean I'll shake it,

2163
02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:19.600
but experiencing a cryogenic chamber cry or cry to cryotherapy.

2164
02:04:19.951 --> 02:04:23.850
Koby Bryant,
there's one in,
uh,
there's one in,
um,

2165
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:27.810
what,
uh,
in like Hancock Park,
the guy has one and the,

2166
02:04:27.811 --> 02:04:30.060
and the NBA teams are starting to use them.
Well,
you know,

2167
02:04:30.090 --> 02:04:33.510
anything that can increase your recovery is where it's at.
You know?
Wow.

2168
02:04:33.511 --> 02:04:38.280
Freezes body and negative 166 degree Cairo

2169
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.780
<v 1>therapy.
That's I say Cryo Cryo therapy.
Wow.
Yeah.
First article about it.</v>

2170
02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.990
That's a fuck man.
That's good.
And you just,
it's like,

2171
02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:50.670
it's fucking bananas,
man.
Wow.
This is nuts man.

2172
02:04:50.671 --> 02:04:53.430
Let's see how long it says they got recovery boots,

2173
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:57.270
which is something that they were,

2174
02:04:57.300 --> 02:05:02.050
if they have it basically is like the,
the um,
the,

2175
02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.410
the thing that when you get your heart rate checked,

2176
02:05:04.411 --> 02:05:08.370
when they blow it up and inflates and tightens your muscles,
guys will wear it.

2177
02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:13.371
The guys in the NBA where those at night for a couple hours and it just goes

2178
02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:17.310
through their law and just fucking there.
They're just machines.

2179
02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.370
That's the thing is they just drink themselves like machines.
Yeah,

2180
02:05:20.371 --> 02:05:23.430
they have to be all.
Okay.
All the Lakers are going on this thing.

2181
02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:27.870
They went to Sara Sacramento.
Go on this thing.
Yeah.
Wow.
Jesus.
Hold on.

2182
02:05:27.871 --> 02:05:31.530
I have video of it.
Do you really?
Not a lot.

2183
02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:33.820
What if that shit breaks and that's how you some guide,

2184
02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:38.900
I heard some guy froze his socks to his feet but that sounds like that sounds

2185
02:05:39.181 --> 02:05:39.871
maybe when I'm done.

2186
02:05:39.871 --> 02:05:43.440
How long it goes for [inaudible] and sweaty feet and you went in there.

2187
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:45.330
Oh you crazy bitch.
Because you imagine

2188
02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:51.870
raising money flows comm 200 degrees below zero where they were kept there for

2189
02:05:51.871 --> 02:05:56.490
three minutes before being released.
What three minutes?

2190
02:05:56.700 --> 02:06:00.030
How's that possible?
Because they don't do it straight through.

2191
02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:02.520
I don't understand that.
Uh,

2192
02:06:02.610 --> 02:06:05.610
they do it in spurts so that you don't fucking freeze.

2193
02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:09.900
Lakers were split into groups of four and placed into a room that was

2194
02:06:09.901 --> 02:06:14.430
approximately 60 degrees below Fahrenheit for one minute.
Okay?

2195
02:06:14.431 --> 02:06:18.330
So they went to a 60 degree below zero room for one to chill,
just to chill.

2196
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:20.910
Once their body's got used to the cold climate,

2197
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.470
the players walked into an adjacent room with a temperature was approximately

2198
02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:30.770
200 degrees below zero when they were kept there for three minutes before being

2199
02:06:32.581 --> 02:06:35.660
released.
All right.

2200
02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:41.580
Like I would not want to do that.
How was that possible?
All right,
here's Blake.

2201
02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.610
Oh my God,
I hit few.
Hit play.

2202
02:06:44.970 --> 02:06:48.120
So if you tried to pee right after that,
you're shooting like slushy.

2203
02:06:48.121 --> 02:06:50.400
Who is this gentleman?
Blake Griffin

2204
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:55.060
<v 3>from the Los Angeles Clippers.
Oh my God.</v>

2205
02:06:55.061 --> 02:06:58.540
He's freezing his dick off.
Literally.
Look at that.
Do you go up to,

2206
02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:01.510
can you insulate your Dick?
How's that work?
I don't think you can grease it up.

2207
02:07:02.070 --> 02:07:04.530
See how maybe you could graze it off.
I'm just worried about crack

2208
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:06.820
<v 1>but like motor oil outright about it cracking.</v>

2209
02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:09.550
Like if somebody hits you in it just shattered and they couldn't repair your

2210
02:07:09.551 --> 02:07:13.060
Dick.
Yeah.
No,
but you see when it hits he goes like,
Woo.

2211
02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:17.340
<v 3>Yeah,
that looks horrendous.
It looks like Austin Powers.</v>

2212
02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:18.900
<v 1>It looks horrendous.
It looks for it.</v>

2213
02:07:18.901 --> 02:07:23.010
And I guess they don't do it to the brain though,
Huh?
Uh,

2214
02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:26.110
yeah.
I guess keep your head the fuck out.
Yeah.

2215
02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:28.200
It keeps the body a under that thing,

2216
02:07:28.201 --> 02:07:30.990
but they don't do it to the brain and I think that might be the key to your

2217
02:07:30.991 --> 02:07:33.690
survival.
That's how you're getting through that.

2218
02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:36.100
This is correct because you could probably go

2219
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.810
<v 4>for that long without much oxygen.</v>

2220
02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:41.470
You're not going to be doing too much breathing while you're a at 200 degrees

2221
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:45.790
below zero.
That's the thing about a cold water that fucks people up to your,

2222
02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:49.660
your,
your desire for oxygen increases dramatically.

2223
02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:53.890
And your ability to hold air in your lungs reduces magic dramatically.

2224
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:57.280
And these are the recovery boots and he's six 10.

2225
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:59.203
<v 6>Wow.</v>

2226
02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:03.740
<v 4>And they look like fucking,
I don't even know how to describe those.</v>

2227
02:08:03.741 --> 02:08:06.510
I've seen those before.
Ryan Parsons turned me on to that shit.

2228
02:08:06.511 --> 02:08:10.240
It's like compressing it compresses sections of your leg.
Yeah,

2229
02:08:10.290 --> 02:08:15.090
I've seen that before.
Is it looks like a,
like a fucking ski bag.

2230
02:08:15.570 --> 02:08:19.050
Yeah.
These guys were athletes on it.
Just completely different level these days.

2231
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:23.730
Um,
and what happens if they come up with genetic engineering?
Man,
that's,

2232
02:08:23.731 --> 02:08:27.300
that's when things are really gonna get bizarre when they have the ability to

2233
02:08:27.301 --> 02:08:31.410
engineer the body to make it faster and make it,
you know,
the,

2234
02:08:31.411 --> 02:08:34.770
with Myostatin inhibitors make it so that your body produces more muscle and

2235
02:08:34.771 --> 02:08:36.000
stay keeps on you.

2236
02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:40.280
<v 3>Well that's what I actually,
yeah,
actually the thought where when,</v>

2237
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:44.990
when I was talking to Ken Sake,
Jose Conseco was on the podcast.
The champs.
Yeah.

2238
02:08:44.991 --> 02:08:47.540
How's that?
You'd study.
It was interesting.
It was really interesting.

2239
02:08:47.541 --> 02:08:51.640
It's just went up.
It's real.
But I was thinking,
I just thought after amps.
Yeah.

2240
02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.630
I the thought afterward that he,

2241
02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:57.110
they should've done a thing in the MLB where you could have one,

2242
02:08:57.111 --> 02:09:01.430
you could have a designated juicer where there was one guy on your team that you

2243
02:09:01.431 --> 02:09:06.431
could bring in who was on fucking Roy [inaudible] and then they could have one

2244
02:09:07.521 --> 02:09:11.960
picture that was on roids cause he was saying that he used to knock pet it up,

2245
02:09:11.961 --> 02:09:16.460
Andy Pettitte,
Apidra.
And they were both juiced up.
Oh.
So it's like,
it'd be like,

2246
02:09:16.461 --> 02:09:20.630
and here comes the fucking,
the Yankees juicer.
Like if they,

2247
02:09:20.631 --> 02:09:24.600
if there was a guy on every team,
you could have one

2248
02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:26.250
<v 4>juicer.
When I was 19,</v>

2249
02:09:26.251 --> 02:09:28.950
I met 10 say go when I was working at the Boston athletic club,

2250
02:09:28.951 --> 02:09:33.000
but didn't meet him as much as I gazed upon his presence person.
And it was,

2251
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:36.260
he was at the peak of his popularity and,
uh,

2252
02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:38.610
he walked into the weight room with the boss.

2253
02:09:38.611 --> 02:09:41.310
I felt like I couldn't fucking believe how big he was.

2254
02:09:41.730 --> 02:09:43.890
He was fucking enormous man.

2255
02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:47.220
He's just cartoonish car fucking tune.
It's,

2256
02:09:47.221 --> 02:09:49.740
you don't realize that when you those baseball outfits.
Yeah.

2257
02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:52.410
Cause those outfits are kind of emasculating.
No,

2258
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:56.100
but if you saw that dude with a tank top on and go,
what the fuck?

2259
02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:59.790
You'd be like what am I?
Yeah,
what am I,
yeah,
he's an enormous

2260
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.700
<v 3>uh,
but yeah,
that's the,
these,
yeah just they fucking,</v>

2261
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:08.620
once they get into that,
cause this is genetic.
That's all legal.

2262
02:10:08.621 --> 02:10:10.270
You're just freezing your butt.
They're going to,

2263
02:10:10.271 --> 02:10:14.530
it's going to get more and more and more and it's going to be,

2264
02:10:14.531 --> 02:10:17.650
it's still remain legal,
right?
Yeah.
It is going to get more.

2265
02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:21.730
Did you see that thing now where they said if you run differently you can cut

2266
02:10:21.731 --> 02:10:25.660
your training time down where if you run in 32nd sprints,

2267
02:10:26.690 --> 02:10:29.450
did he say that it was in the New York Times and then a guy just wrote a book

2268
02:10:29.451 --> 02:10:34.310
about it?
If you,
if you,
you can run for like,
you can burn the same of calories

2269
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:38.150
<v 1>and get your metabolism going and get your heart rate going in basically six</v>

2270
02:10:38.151 --> 02:10:42.980
minutes.
What would normally take 20 if you sprint for 30 seconds,

2271
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:47.150
John,
for 30 sprint jog,
sprint,
jog,
sprint,
jog,
sprint,
jog,
and you're done.

2272
02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:50.290
Really getting your heart,
heart rate up is the thing.

2273
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:54.320
It was at the time was probably six weeks ago.
So you sprint full clip.
Yeah.

2274
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.720
So do you do this on a treadmill or do you do this?
You can do it either.

2275
02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:58.400
You can eat,
I mean,
I think treadmill would be better.

2276
02:10:58.401 --> 02:11:00.580
She would probably do it on an elliptical machine to write.

2277
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:05.000
Just go crazy 30 seconds and,
and stuff.
Uh,
and then jog.
Yeah,

2278
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:10.280
that I,
that is great because it's fucking save time.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2279
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:11.930
You know,
like you were saying about kettle bells,

2280
02:11:11.931 --> 02:11:15.890
you can bang out a workout and get it done in 20 minutes.
You're done.

2281
02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:19.790
I've got a video man and it's a extreme kettlebell cardio DVD.

2282
02:11:20.090 --> 02:11:23.780
I got it from a dragon door.com and when you do this,
this thing,

2283
02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:28.960
it's maybe I can get 45 minutes into this and I'm fucking dead.

2284
02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:33.080
I'm done man.
And you're in great shape for day.

2285
02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:37.490
Like there's kettlebells push ups,

2286
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:42.590
first babies,
they go,
how long did you work out?
Like 45 minutes Max.

2287
02:11:42.710 --> 02:11:45.020
That's all I can do.
They're like,
that's all you could do.

2288
02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:49.130
It does the gym for fucking two hours.
Thug and did my lats did the,

2289
02:11:49.131 --> 02:11:52.910
yeah and then,
but you also don't even know what you ever do.

2290
02:11:52.911 --> 02:11:55.100
The thing with kettlebells where you're like,
why is that sore?

2291
02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.010
I didn't even fucking know anything.
And you're like,

2292
02:11:58.011 --> 02:12:00.500
you're lower thigh will be sore and you're just like,
man,

2293
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:05.150
I guess I did something.
It makes it use Turkish getups you ever do those?

2294
02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.550
Is that that one it looks really stupid.

2295
02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:11.750
You know you lie on your back and you do like a press.
I think that's the one.

2296
02:12:11.751 --> 02:12:15.950
Where are you going to stand up stupid as Fox.
The best thing ever.

2297
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.180
It looks really hard,

2298
02:12:17.181 --> 02:12:20.510
but you just lay on your back with a weight and then you just slowly stand up

2299
02:12:20.511 --> 02:12:23.450
and tell you something to do that with 70 pounds,
hold that,

2300
02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.470
hold 70 pounds up and slowly stand up and do it in a controlled manner and do it

2301
02:12:27.471 --> 02:12:29.390
for like sets of 10 woo,

2302
02:12:30.610 --> 02:12:34.190
Woo doggy body.
Be on fire,

2303
02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:38.000
your lower back and your abs and everything.
Your arm,
your shoulder,

2304
02:12:38.001 --> 02:12:42.290
everything's on fire.
Kettle bells or did,
did Ferris get you on him?
No,

2305
02:12:42.291 --> 02:12:44.510
I've been doing them for years.
I've been doing them for a long time.

2306
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:45.321
Like I didn't know him.

2307
02:12:45.321 --> 02:12:49.850
Like my friend Jamie was a personal trainer and he uh,

2308
02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:51.770
was a real big on these fucking things.

2309
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:54.710
I'd never even heard of them before we started just doing swings.

2310
02:12:54.970 --> 02:12:57.890
Just kettlebell swings.
Yeah.
Amazing.
That's what's great for your back,

2311
02:12:57.950 --> 02:13:01.430
for your ass.
That's what Gabe took my ass from a 3.5 to a seven.

2312
02:13:01.670 --> 02:13:03.610
How many do you do?
What do you do it?
How do you do it?

2313
02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:08.240
Fucking three sets of 60 yeah.
Oh,
you do lightweight and just do a lot of them.

2314
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.140
Do you ever do bodyweight?
No,
but I also,
it's the I am,
I am only 150 pounds.

2315
02:13:12.141 --> 02:13:16.100
So if I do 30 pounds,
right,
that's a lot.
Yeah.
It's not lightweight.

2316
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:18.860
It's like something you do in reps,
the 60.
Now that's a lot.

2317
02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:23.990
But by imagining announcer,
bodyweight squats,
they're amazing man.

2318
02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:26.180
They're called Hindu squats.
If you look at it online,

2319
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:29.960
just Google a Hindu squats on youtube,
but you,
uh,

2320
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.090
it's just full body weight.
You dropped

2321
02:13:32.090 --> 02:13:34.410
<v 4>down and you're actually heals.
Come off the ground.</v>

2322
02:13:34.411 --> 02:13:37.350
You're on the tip of your toes and your ass and you're,
you're,
um,

2323
02:13:37.590 --> 02:13:40.050
ankles collide and then you stand all the way up.

2324
02:13:40.051 --> 02:13:44.400
So you drop all the way down and all the way up and you,
if you watch it online,

2325
02:13:44.401 --> 02:13:46.390
you can see like there's a lot of,
um,

2326
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:49.530
videos that'll show you the correct way to do it.
It's real simple.

2327
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:53.130
But once you understand the movement that it's all about just doing massive

2328
02:13:53.131 --> 02:13:57.740
numbers of them trying to get as you can.
I do a set of 210.

2329
02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.830
It took a long time to get there though.
I started,

2330
02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.970
it would be a hundred and I would have to stop.
I could do 200 before,

2331
02:14:02.971 --> 02:14:07.470
but I had to take like a break.
But now I can do 200 straight,
200 hundreds hard.

2332
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:09.870
But I'm not,
I'm doing two 10 now.
That's my next thing.

2333
02:14:09.871 --> 02:14:13.350
I want to do two 10 I want to build up to 500 that's what I want to eventually

2334
02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:18.370
do.
Yeah.
But I think that's possible.
I think it's a good,
it's a good um,

2335
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:20.880
demonstration of willpower to,
uh,

2336
02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:23.820
it's a good exercise for me cause I like to disassociate when I'm doing

2337
02:14:23.821 --> 02:14:28.480
repetitive exercise.
Things that can cause you to second guess yourself.
Right.

2338
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:30.570
And intense exercise.

2339
02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:35.190
The exercise about quitting intense physical.
I mean,
nobody's in my room,

2340
02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.680
nobody's screaming.
I don't have a drill sergeant.
It's just me.

2341
02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:43.040
So the way I motivate myself is I make myself do shit where I have to silence

2342
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:48.951
that voice of quitting where there's no getting through it unless we do 400 is

2343
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:51.810
just that,
that's what we're doing.
There's nothing,
there's nothing.

2344
02:14:51.811 --> 02:14:54.870
Just concentrate on the number and keep going.
There is no quitting.
It doesn't,

2345
02:14:54.871 --> 02:14:58.380
it doesn't exist.
And as long as I never quit when I'm doing that,

2346
02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.480
then that is just my modus operandi.
That's how,
that's how I operate.
And uh,

2347
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.320
I,
I do it as like an exercise.
That's how it got smoking about negative shit.

2348
02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:08.483
Yeah,

2349
02:15:08.490 --> 02:15:13.020
<v 1>I know.
Now if I smoke one cigarette,
I'm going to smoke 10,000.</v>

2350
02:15:13.710 --> 02:15:17.580
So I just got to stop.
How long did you smoke for 10 years.
I was just like,

2351
02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:20.570
I'm never smoking.
I just made the decision.
I'm never smoking again.

2352
02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:24.870
How much better did you feel when he stomped?
Uh,
it was 10 years ago,

2353
02:15:24.871 --> 02:15:29.220
so I don't even remember.
But yeah,
you feel way better.
More energy,
more like,

2354
02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:34.320
and more everything.
Um,
and that's,
and you just,
just kinda like,
okay,

2355
02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:38.310
I'm not going to smoke again.
Somebody had talked to poor Brian Port Brian,

2356
02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:42.570
someone's got to tell him to quit smoking.
He's smoking.
Just decide not to.
Man,

2357
02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:46.830
you're right.
He won't listen to you.
He doesn't care.
He's,

2358
02:15:46.831 --> 02:15:50.280
he's positive.
He's never getting cancer.
There's no worries.

2359
02:15:50.370 --> 02:15:54.570
I use it for my voice.
Keeps some sexy.
Does it keep me a second,

2360
02:15:54.810 --> 02:15:58.200
my voice and it actually use it for meals.
Like today,

2361
02:15:58.201 --> 02:16:00.390
I'm not even going to have a chance to eat today.
That's a good move.

2362
02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.200
That's for sure.
But now that I,

2363
02:16:04.210 --> 02:16:06.900
you want me to be able to fight off that something I can get behind,

2364
02:16:06.901 --> 02:16:09.240
but he's not even going to be healthy enough to fight off the cancer because he

2365
02:16:09.241 --> 02:16:12.300
used it as a dietary aide.
I gotta take a leak.

2366
02:16:12.330 --> 02:16:14.070
I got to take the king of all leaks.
All right.

2367
02:16:14.071 --> 02:16:17.790
Go ahead and we'll talk about you where you're gone and we'll wrap this shit up

2368
02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:20.460
as soon as you get back.
Cause we've been doing it for like two and a half hours,

2369
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:22.710
right?
Yeah.
We have a nice house show and oh yeah,

2370
02:16:22.711 --> 02:16:26.280
we're in Pasadena in a couple hours.
If you're around,

2371
02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:30.320
if you're not crazy or a stalker,
can't wait to see Thomson [inaudible]

2372
02:16:30.330 --> 02:16:35.020
<v 0>again,
you haven't seen him in awhile.
Tom's grows that shit.
He's a great guy.
Um,</v>

2373
02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:39.760
Fort Lauderdale this weekend,
a Saturday night is a essentially sold out.

2374
02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:44.170
Um,
I think there was a few tickets left for the early show,

2375
02:16:44.171 --> 02:16:47.620
but those might be gone.
Um,
and uh,

2376
02:16:47.650 --> 02:16:52.650
the Friday show has some tickets left and the Sunday show has some tickets left,

2377
02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:54.910
but they're going fast.
It should be a good time to,

2378
02:16:54.911 --> 02:16:57.900
I'm with Dunkin and Dunkin has been in the fucking groove.
He,

2379
02:16:57.910 --> 02:17:02.020
I took him with me to the Louisville Improv and it was amazing.
First of all,

2380
02:17:02.021 --> 02:17:05.710
he was getting standing ovations going on stage,
which is crazy.

2381
02:17:05.711 --> 02:17:08.290
He didn't do the little hall by once.
He's,
he crushed it though.

2382
02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:12.700
He's got a lot of new material to Dunkin is just,
he's so fun to be with you.

2383
02:17:12.701 --> 02:17:17.050
So prolific too.
He's a,
he's going to be a great comedian now.

2384
02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:18.370
I mean he's already a great comedian,

2385
02:17:18.371 --> 02:17:20.750
but I mean I think he's going to be like a great national headlines.

2386
02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:23.140
That next girl,
you think that's going to get them.

2387
02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:27.970
I think that's going to give him now he has a poster for sale.

2388
02:17:27.971 --> 02:17:30.660
Go to his website and buy it.
It's awesome.
I have one in the studio,

2389
02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:35.080
Duncan trussell.com t r u s s e l l a,

2390
02:17:35.081 --> 02:17:39.370
and there's still some tickets available for next Friday's late show at the

2391
02:17:39.371 --> 02:17:42.790
tabernacle in Atlanta.
I got two shows.
I'm felling my special.

2392
02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:45.600
I'm fucking fired up.
Who's ongoing?

2393
02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.640
April 20th Joey Dheas Duncan Trussell and you're going?

2394
02:17:50.890 --> 02:17:53.270
Yeah.
Okay.
Did they get your tickets and everything else?

2395
02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:57.490
You're all set and Mike Maxwell actually made a poster and he's going as well.

2396
02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:00.850
And a,
you could buy that post for I think on maximum.
What is it?

2397
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:05.620
Mike Maxwell may find them on Twitter.
Yeah,
he'll be there tonight too.

2398
02:18:05.621 --> 02:18:10.150
I'm going to sign some pictures,
but yeah,
Mike Maxwell art on Twitter.

2399
02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:14.980
You can find the link to his website and on his website you can find the link to

2400
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:17.650
the poster.
It looks dope.
He's a killer artist.

2401
02:18:17.651 --> 02:18:19.450
He did my poster for the Chicago show.

2402
02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.460
I think he still has a few of those available too.

2403
02:18:21.490 --> 02:18:24.460
He's amazing and great art and a great guy.
Really Fun guy to hang out with,

2404
02:18:24.461 --> 02:18:27.460
so I'm just like that.
He's going to be there in Atlanta.
Good vibes.

2405
02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.450
And can I say my thing?
Me and Joey Diaz are coming to Columbus,
Ohio.

2406
02:18:31.451 --> 02:18:34.830
The first show is sold out,
so they added a second show,
May 17th,

2407
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:38.490
and then May 8th in the woodlands.
Ah,
yeah.
That's a good run.
It's a good one,

2408
02:18:38.491 --> 02:18:43.340
right?
Yeah.
May 18th I think we're in Cleveland.
And then May 19th,
Pittsburgh,
uh,

2409
02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:47.140
the tickets or at desk squad.
Dot.
TV.
Now you,
um,
what does the woodlands,

2410
02:18:47.141 --> 02:18:51.130
what does that,
it's a,
this kid.
It's like just a bar,
but it's got a good room.

2411
02:18:51.131 --> 02:18:53.850
It's got her stand up.
Pretty decent room for standup.
Yeah,

2412
02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:57.220
like a duck Stan hope room,
that kind of plays.

2413
02:18:57.640 --> 02:18:59.680
And they're doing a lot of comedy there.
Yeah,
I think so.

2414
02:19:00.250 --> 02:19:03.160
Dylan Shelton books and he does good shops.

2415
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:05.080
Columbus has like a bit of a comedy scene,
right?

2416
02:19:05.081 --> 02:19:06.760
But mostly because of the punchline,

2417
02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:10.220
because people want to die there and they just wanted to laugh,
so it's loud.

2418
02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:14.560
Is it that bad if you were to go,
I know dude,
Columbia,

2419
02:19:14.561 --> 02:19:17.680
I was just in Ohio.
I was in Cincinnati.

2420
02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:22.300
That shit was pretty grim.
And Gram Chappelle lives in Ohio.

2421
02:19:22.301 --> 02:19:27.050
He was so bored that he's like,
dude,
why don't you return your rental car?

2422
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:28.550
I can drive her from Cincinnati

2423
02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:32.780
<v 1>to Cleveland.
I was like,
God,
that's all right man.</v>

2424
02:19:33.050 --> 02:19:33.883
Why does he live there?

2425
02:19:34.130 --> 02:19:38.290
Cause it's families there and it's a nice place for family raising kids.

2426
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:39.980
Good place.
Right?
But he's just like,

2427
02:19:39.981 --> 02:19:42.210
what do you want a good place for you though?
No,

2428
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.120
I just don't like what the wetter but,

2429
02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:47.240
but if you were to do go there and throw like dating way over your head.

2430
02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.750
Just really difficult to do there.
Yeah,
you can't do that.
Yeah,
they're all,

2431
02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:54.680
nobody's in good shape.
Yeah.
Phaedra.
It's a few of them.

2432
02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:57.680
I mean they got boyfriends.
They'll all come to the show on the alarm,

2433
02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:00.770
the whatever they get locked up.
You know guys,
since we're talking about dates,

2434
02:20:00.990 --> 02:20:05.600
oh Neil Brennan.
Where are you performing?
So tomorrow,
tomorrow,
Thursday,

2435
02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:08.360
April 12th through 14th I'm going to be in Bloomington,
Indiana.

2445
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:46.100
Just keeping out the website because I'm not gonna remember all the branded.com

2446

We'd be here for days.
You're talking about your posters.

2450
02:20:58.450 --> 02:21:02.240
Mac Mac's,
walmart.com.
Uh,
anything else?
Seriously.

2451
02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:04.190
Neil brennan.com.

2452
02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:08.890
[inaudible] Dot com follow me on Twitter doing the comedy store in L'oreal.

2453
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.630
Yeah.
Fabulous Room.
One of them.
One of my favorite rooms.
Well,

2454
02:21:11.631 --> 02:21:14.330
maybe my favorite room in the world.
It might be,
it might be one of the best run.

2455
02:21:14.331 --> 02:21:18.980
I really want to record an album there cause it's 1978 there it does.

2456
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:21.690
Nick depalo recorded his album there.
Did he really?
Yeah,

2457
02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:25.460
it's great when it was his first one.
I believe he recorded it there.
It's great.

2458
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:28.730
It's fucking,
the acoustics are perfect.
Yeah.
It's just,
it's,
it's like,

2459
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:32.360
it's easy to,
that's what I mean.
It's easy,
but it doesn't feel cheap.

2460
02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:36.470
It feels like we're just in a good mood.
You didn't know Fred,

2461
02:21:36.471 --> 02:21:40.880
you never met Fred who uh,
I think Fred's dad who used to run that place,

2462
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:45.200
they fired him some,
some,
I dunno,
some accounting discrepancy or something,

2463
02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:46.220
but he was great.

2464
02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:50.360
He was a comedian and he ran the place and he developed like a lot of local

2465
02:21:50.361 --> 02:21:53.180
comedians were coming there too.
They had a nice local scene.

2466
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:55.940
I think they still do.
Yeah,
I think they do.
Yeah.

2467
02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:59.060
It's probably the only one of the few local scenes in San Diego,

2468
02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:01.930
another club in nuclear cell phone when you had to be a winner.

2469
02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:05.540
The American comedy company.
So is that what it is?
I think I heard good things.

2470
02:22:05.690 --> 02:22:06.640
Yeah.
I haven't heard any of that.

2471
02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:09.830
San Diego's needed a real comedy club for a while.
Yeah.

2472
02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:13.190
Every time I go I do like house of blues or something like that.
Yeah.

2473
02:22:13.310 --> 02:22:16.030
I think the comedy,
sir,
it's a good room.
The hall.
It's a great book,

2474
02:22:16.031 --> 02:22:19.340
but it's not in San Diego.
Yeah,
it's,
well it's,
it's close enough.

2475
02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:21.440
You know what I mean?
But you know,

2476
02:22:21.470 --> 02:22:24.940
the problem is it's the comedy store and I can't work there.
Right,
man,

2477
02:22:24.970 --> 02:22:28.990
you fucked up.
You fucked up Rogan.
Yeah.
Get the fuck Outta here.
You can.

2478
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.900
I'm here to tell you you still can't work then.

2479
02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:33.870
I probably could if I wanted to work there.
I tell you what.

2480
02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:35.470
I think we should just get,

2481
02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:39.390
get drunk and then one night just pop in there out of the blue.
What?

2482
02:22:39.391 --> 02:22:42.000
Do you want to go check on the or do you want to go to jail?

2483
02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:45.210
They will let you in.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
I'm not even interested.

2484
02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:49.120
It's zero desire,
but thank you very much.
That place where the names on the,

2485
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.850
on the market at the laugh factory.
Right,
right next to me.
Jail.

2486
02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:58.830
Laugh factory.
No,
no,
no.
You're not Jimmy Brogan.

2487
02:22:59.910 --> 02:23:04.350
Somebody sent me a picture of your name and my name were the laugh factor.
No,

2488
02:23:04.351 --> 02:23:05.730
I don't have a show scheduled there.

2489
02:23:05.970 --> 02:23:09.750
I don't think it would've been there in over a decade since I've known you.

2490
02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:13.900
I haven't been there in over a decade,
you know,
not that it's bad club.
No,

2491
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:16.080
I'm just trying to think why they to,

2492
02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:19.170
I stopped going to the laugh factory when it got serious at the comedy store

2493
02:23:19.171 --> 02:23:21.600
when I was like,
you know,
regularly at the comedy store,

2494
02:23:21.601 --> 02:23:24.450
Mitzi Aspen and not go there anymore.
So I don't forget,
I wasn't,

2495
02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:28.990
Mitzi was Scott Day actually I tell you about this house,
Sam triple,

2496
02:23:28.991 --> 02:23:32.370
he started doing the nightly show at the comedy store and it started getting

2497
02:23:32.371 --> 02:23:35.550
kind of popular and what's his face from at the laugh factory?

2498
02:23:35.551 --> 02:23:40.200
Started getting the comedy,
doing the naughty show also.
And he's his,
his uh,

2499
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:43.040
sustain went to him.
He's like,
what?
Why he calls it the noughties.
Yeah.

2500
02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:44.070
And he's like,
why are you doing?
He's like,
oh,

2501
02:23:44.071 --> 02:23:47.250
I used to do naughty show in the 80s.
And I'm like,
yeah,

2502
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:51.250
but you're only brought it back because we just started it back up here.
Brogan.

2503
02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:53.730
Sorry.
Back Up.

2504
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:58.790
So what you're saying is the dude is doing another podcast that's doing another

2505
02:23:59.950 --> 02:24:02.400
comedy show with strippers and everything like that.

2506
02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:08.250
Did 90 show and it's its doors down from the comedy store where Sam now does it.

2507
02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:11.190
Well,
I want to be honest with Ya.
I think that's a terrible name.

2508
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:14.160
And I think it only serves Sam,
right?

2509
02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:16.920
That he picked such a stupid name for a show.
Right.

2510
02:24:16.930 --> 02:24:19.810
What it really should do is use this opportunity to go with something,

2511
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:23.800
something that doesn't suck and that way some guy can't just [inaudible].

2512
02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.460
I think he should call it sex squad Warren.

2513
02:24:30.090 --> 02:24:34.890
The show is a fun show to go do.
But that's a terrible God damn name.
Well,

2514
02:24:34.891 --> 02:24:39.120
it's just kind of basic,
so nothing,
it means nothing.
It's just be called naughty.

2515
02:24:39.450 --> 02:24:41.670
Like the Sam trip happy party.
Yeah.

2516
02:24:41.671 --> 02:24:44.550
Something like Sam triple e should be using one of the blowup himself,

2517
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:49.500
not the naughty show.
Sam Tripoli's House of fun.
That would be just as good.

2518
02:24:49.501 --> 02:24:52.890
And by the way,
still use the same mailing list.
Dude.
We'll promote it.
All right,

2519
02:24:52.891 --> 02:24:55.980
Sam,
we're going to help you out of this mess.
Fuck Jamie Masada.

2520
02:24:55.981 --> 02:25:00.090
Let them have that shit by the,
I was doing it in the 80s.

2521
02:25:00.450 --> 02:25:02.190
That's probably what he said to you,
Bobby.
I had,

2522
02:25:02.250 --> 02:25:05.190
I had not the show in the eighties.
Let them have it,
dude.

2523
02:25:05.191 --> 02:25:07.860
Just like you should've let those girls have sex squad.
Let them have,

2524
02:25:08.430 --> 02:25:10.890
let them have it.
It sucks.
I think he'll,

2525
02:25:10.891 --> 02:25:12.950
I think he thought it'd be one choke on it.
Let them

2526
02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.280
go that they could never have had it without you.
How about that?

2527
02:25:17.281 --> 02:25:21.300
The scrum cap is the name of that thing I was trying to describe.
Oh,

2528
02:25:21.301 --> 02:25:24.380
I know what you're talking about.
A rugby.
Yeah.
I wear one of those Jujitsu.

2529
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:28.930
It's got a little pads on it.
Yeah,
but it's mostly a cover my ears.
Yes.
Yeah.
Um,

2530
02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:33.700
yeah,
you die in that those fucking giant dudes a smash,
but not if you're not,

2531
02:25:33.701 --> 02:25:37.170
if they're not wearing play,
we going not going to get people to adjust.

2532
02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:38.890
You're going to have to have a raise,
a whole new generation.

2533
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:43.030
They're going to have to have helmeted non helmeted but then there's going to be

2534
02:25:43.031 --> 02:25:46.750
the one thickheaded dude like some big Samoan guy who just wants a headbutt

2535
02:25:46.751 --> 02:25:47.470
people.

2536
02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:51.250
Why are you throwing me under the bus about this sex but I'm not throwing you

2537
02:25:51.251 --> 02:25:54.790
under the bus.
You wanted to do the first episode you told me to do it.

2538
02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:59.140
I think you should have no negative feelings out there and I think I agree with

2539
02:25:59.141 --> 02:26:03.400
that.
It's this girls look for whatever reason she's got a lot of issues.

2540
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:08.770
I just think that that could have been avoided and you could have come off like

2541
02:26:08.771 --> 02:26:13.630
a a bigger person.
That's all I'm saying but but you're absolutely right.

2542
02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.430
Listen Brian,
you're not,
you're not being honest about that.
No.

2543
02:26:17.431 --> 02:26:19.810
You said I hate you.
I'll do your new show.

2544
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:23.560
You said you need to do one asap and I'll be the first person on and I was like,

2545
02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:23.870
okay,

2546
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:26.470
you know what that was before I found out the other girl came up with the name.

2547
02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:30.170
No,
I told you that too.
I have is the first one that told you that?
No,
no,
no,
no,

2548
02:26:30.171 --> 02:26:33.370
no,
no,
no.
You told me later.
You told me late.

2549
02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:37.270
Absolutely told me later cause it was cause I had to give you a wait a minute.

2550
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:39.640
Wait a minute.
That girl,
wait a minute.

2551
02:26:40.210 --> 02:26:44.200
I told you that the first time that you might've thought you did,
but you did.
No,

2552
02:26:44.201 --> 02:26:47.530
I did Brian.
Cause I'd never not said I didn't come up with a name.

2553
02:26:47.531 --> 02:26:50.860
You can call me a liar when he saying Joe,
poor social skills here,

2554
02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:53.980
there's many way Asian.
That's not to call back tonight.

2555
02:26:53.981 --> 02:26:57.390
Ice has chronicles starts at eight 30 or being a silly person.
Okay.

2556
02:26:58.510 --> 02:27:01.030
I think you should let those girls have that name.

2557
02:27:01.430 --> 02:27:02.720
And I told him what the better.
Nah,

2558
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:07.330
they right now they want to live in the hell of their own consciousness.

2559
02:27:07.331 --> 02:27:09.790
If they're angry at you.
That's right.
You don't want that buddy.

2560
02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:13.240
You don't want her out there with a Voodoo doll because she'd be putting the

2561
02:27:13.241 --> 02:27:17.700
pins.
You want to talk about them ever again.
She give her a big hug.
What would,

2562
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:20.890
what would be a better name than sex squad?
Neil,
you're a creative guy.

2563
02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:22.870
You were the cocreator Chappelle show

2564
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:30.070
podcast with hot chicks.
And what'd you,
what'd you call it?

2565
02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:31.070
I think he's got a,

2566
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:35.800
I like the squad angle because it's death squad and it's about sex and it's a

2567
02:27:35.801 --> 02:27:39.270
podcast about sex.
I know.
Let's talk.
Let's talk about [inaudible].

2568
02:27:40.450 --> 02:27:45.190
No,
no.
Hmm.
How about the,
we like cock patrol.

2569
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:50.070
Yeah.
That I'm with.
No,
no.
Are you still there?
Hmm.

2570
02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:53.920
It's funny that so many podcasts are going to try to try to lean in on that porn

2571
02:27:53.921 --> 02:27:57.110
angle though,
isn't it?
It's interesting.
It's like a natural angle mean we've,

2572
02:27:57.130 --> 02:28:00.940
we've had porn.
It's a,
it's hard to have a bad,
we had Sasha grey on,

2573
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:05.470
she's with a black dude.
Uh,
and uh,
it,
it's fucking interesting.

2574
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:09.100
She's fascinating cause she's actually smart.
Dina del Monte smart too.

2575
02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:12.520
She's crazy.
But she's fun.
She's very smart.
We had her on,
yes.

2576
02:28:12.521 --> 02:28:15.850
Sasha is like a regular cool check.
Yeah.
Isn't that weird?
Yeah.

2577
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.890
Regular cool chick that somehow or another is missing this fuse where she can

2578
02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:21.980
just go take it in the ass

2579
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:22.813
<v 0>in front of the world.</v>

2580
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:27.710
What's weird is it's the oldest formula and radio it having a porn star on on a

2581
02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:31.430
show,
you know as like a guest like Howard Stern,
you know opie and Anthony,

2582
02:28:31.431 --> 02:28:34.880
any kind of local radio station will always have a porn star on,

2583
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.910
but that was even before you actually got to see it,
which is crazy.

2584
02:28:38.130 --> 02:28:40.310
So now you've got like Ustream we're doing,

2585
02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:42.730
they get the naughty show we had the other day we had full on nudity.

2586
02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:44.870
I had to take it off.
You use stream because it was just ridiculous.

2587
02:28:44.930 --> 02:28:48.410
[inaudible] would they do,
which is trying to get you arrested by the way,

2588
02:28:48.411 --> 02:28:51.050
you might get arrested for shit like that.
You have to really be careful.

2589
02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:53.630
I know when you get those crazy bitches and they started fingering each other,

2590
02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:56.420
you can go to jail for that.
Fuck you.

2591
02:28:56.420 --> 02:29:01.210
You can't just PR like broadcast pornography.
Hello?

2592
02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:03.010
Yeah.
You get first of all stream,

2593
02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:04.730
we'll pull you because they don't want to get sued.

2594
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:07.340
But if someone finds out that you're like project,

2595
02:29:07.341 --> 02:29:10.350
like if they find out that there's any sort of significant percentage of people

2596
02:29:10.351 --> 02:29:14.690
on Ustream that are showing people fucking,
oh well,
gosh,
here's a question,

2597
02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:17.750
because they actually weren't really too much of the nitty gritty,

2598
02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:21.710
but they took these stickers and put it on their boobs and then they did a whole

2599
02:29:21.711 --> 02:29:25.100
podcast with the stickers on a boot.
But you think that's fine.
That's fine.

2600
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:29.960
That's one of those weird double standard thing.
Boob made is fine.
It is fine.

2601
02:29:29.961 --> 02:29:33.730
But you've got to,
yeah,
and I think you only need a couple of cover the,

2602
02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:37.190
the point of the nipple.
I think you could show some show area,

2603
02:29:37.450 --> 02:29:40.280
like if you have a star over the nipple itself,

2604
02:29:40.281 --> 02:29:43.130
but the circle of the aerial behind the star,
it's very clear.

2605
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:44.890
I think it's still okay.
See,

2606
02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:48.140
so nuts were so crazy.

2607
02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:53.660
Human beings are so bizarre.
Excuse me.
American American,
when it comes to sex,

2608
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:55.670
we're so nuts.

2609
02:29:56.210 --> 02:30:00.320
The way you could put a star over the nibble.
Well.
How about even this,

2610
02:30:00.321 --> 02:30:04.320
how about girls who were allowed to wear body paint?
They're fucking naked.
Naked.

2611
02:30:05.530 --> 02:30:09.590
It's okay.
I wonder if you could put a nipple sticker on top of a nipple.

2612
02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:12.590
Do you know what I mean?
Like a sticker with a picture of a nipple on it.

2613
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:17.480
If that was with like an ape nipple.
I saw a photo from a friend of mine,

2614
02:30:17.481 --> 02:30:20.480
his Halloween party that he had a few years back with a bunch of girls came over

2615
02:30:20.481 --> 02:30:24.870
with body paint on and like one girl's tits were dogs look made up.
But,

2616
02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:27.310
but there were tits.
Tits would paint on them.
Yeah.

2617
02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:29.590
And it was an every girl knew it and all the,

2618
02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:32.210
he said girls that were there that were dressed in white,
all,

2619
02:30:32.211 --> 02:30:36.200
we're so fucking pissed.
They were so angry.
They were like,

2620
02:30:36.201 --> 02:30:39.140
who are these fucking whores?
Like we don't know that you're naked.

2621
02:30:39.141 --> 02:30:40.160
You stupid bitch.

2622
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:43.220
And he'd get fucking paint on your tent and you think that that's okay.

2623
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:46.640
Being shown up.
It was amazing.
What about [inaudible] have you ever went to,

2624
02:30:47.330 --> 02:30:48.400
what about Mannequin Nipples?

2625
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:50.010
Cause now I've got those mannequins and they all have to be,

2626
02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:53.780
those are totally kosher.
Yeah.
It's not even real.
It's like,
you know,
animated.

2627
02:30:53.781 --> 02:30:56.450
If you drew an animated nipple,
who's,
Oh fuck,
what are you going to say?

2628
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:57.830
Nobody could say anything.
I don't think.

2629
02:30:57.831 --> 02:31:00.830
I don't think that even counts as pornography.
It's definitely not mannequins,

2630
02:31:00.831 --> 02:31:03.590
man mannequins.
It sounded like a sex toy.

2631
02:31:03.591 --> 02:31:06.200
Like if you have like a real dog in the background and you could see the real

2632
02:31:06.201 --> 02:31:10.460
dolls tit,
that's probably,
that's tricky.
But not a mannequin.

2633
02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:13.250
Right?
Yeah.
But even the fact that it's like,

2634
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:17.240
I actually asked this to a bunch of a female audience one time.

2635
02:31:17.241 --> 02:31:20.070
Like if they were robots,
like good

2636
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.530
<v 1>robots in the future and you,</v>

2637
02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:26.790
you caught your husband fucking a robot,
would you be mad?

2638
02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:29.190
Right.
And they were like,
yeah.
And I was like,

2639
02:31:29.191 --> 02:31:32.340
but what if it looked like if it was like a real doll?
And I was like,

2640
02:31:32.341 --> 02:31:36.780
what if it looked like the terminator?
Right.
They had no problem with it.
Yeah.

2641
02:31:36.781 --> 02:31:40.560
I think it's just an ugly robot.
Well that's why people are weirded out.

2642
02:31:40.561 --> 02:31:43.890
If you fuck a fleshlight but they're not weirded out if you masturbate,

2643
02:31:44.140 --> 02:31:48.240
but fuck something,
a physical object.
It has to be like awesome.

2644
02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:52.350
It'd be the fake pussy in a tube.
Like what is that?
Well,
what are you doing?

2645
02:31:52.380 --> 02:31:55.890
What if the future that you had a robot that looked exactly like yourself but

2646
02:31:55.891 --> 02:31:57.420
that you fucked?
I agree.

2647
02:31:57.421 --> 02:32:02.421
[inaudible]

2648
02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:07.350
my sexuality on the rest of the world and I don't want to treat women as
objects,

2649
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:11.010
so I would never have a fake woman.
So in having a fake me,

2650
02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:13.170
essentially what I'm doing is I'm taking the hit,

2651
02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:15.570
I'm taking the hit myself with a vagina and a,

2652
02:32:15.571 --> 02:32:19.320
I'm just knowing that if I was in jail with me,
I'd be a bro and let you fuck me.

2653
02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:24.300
I mean,
it's so weird seeing yourself.
I love kissing yourself.

2654
02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:27.240
Move your fake robot.
I was like an awesome tongue.
It's like,
Oh,

2655
02:32:27.241 --> 02:32:30.800
I love kissing you.
You're pushing your own head down.
You shoved her.
Yeah.

2656
02:32:30.930 --> 02:32:34.950
All right.
I'll suck your dick and your robot.
Oh,
it's me,
bro.
It's me.
It's me,

2657
02:32:34.951 --> 02:32:38.770
dude.
How do you like it?
I know how you like it.
I'm you.
Uh,
all right.

2658
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:39.623
On that note,

2659
02:32:41.810 --> 02:32:42.081
<v 4>Brian,</v>

2660
02:32:42.081 --> 02:32:44.630
I'm sorry if you feel like a three or under the bus for the sock squad thing,

2661
02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:47.690
I didn't mean to buddy.
I don't want you to have any hard feelings.

2662
02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:50.060
I'm just trying to eliminate negativity in all of our lives.

2663
02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.460
I hear your brother and that's why I did.

2664
02:32:52.461 --> 02:32:54.590
I've never had a bad time with either one of those girls.

2665
02:32:54.591 --> 02:32:56.450
I've always had fun with them.
They were always nice to me.

2666
02:32:56.750 --> 02:33:01.520
So I hate to see something that I think could have been possibly avoided by just

2667
02:33:01.630 --> 02:33:03.680
a nice phone call.
Right?
Yeah.
Hey Man,

2668
02:33:03.681 --> 02:33:08.030
I don't know what the fuck happens for real.
I just,
there's no need.

2669
02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:11.120
There's a lot of real beef out there in this world is a lot of real drama.

2670
02:33:11.570 --> 02:33:15.800
Y'all need to unnecessary whites.
Word.
All right,

2671
02:33:15.801 --> 02:33:18.680
you fucking dirty freaks.
That's the end of this week.

2672
02:33:18.740 --> 02:33:20.200

2676
