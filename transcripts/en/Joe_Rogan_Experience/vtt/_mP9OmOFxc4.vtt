<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to meet you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to meet you finally.</v>

6
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep this soccer like a fist from your</v>

7
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

9
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you started a company when you started</v>

10
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you guys first started.</v>

11
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you could've added any</v>

12
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>idea what it would be now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

13
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I always try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize with people when the people</v>

14
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>twitter's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how could it not be crazy?</v>

16
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.450
<v Speaker 1>There's never been anything like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

17
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine trying to predict</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of,</v>

18
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>the president of United States uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter to threaten other countries.</v>

19
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fuck.</v>

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Saw that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw that coming.</v>

21
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>You think it was going to be when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>first did it?</v>

22
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>we were building this thing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and that's how that,</v>

24
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 2>that's how everything starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to use it.</v>

25
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to,</v>

26
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay connected with each other.</v>

27
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>We group text like a group text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We loved our phones.</v>

28
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>We loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

29
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually started this as a hack week</v>

30
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 2>project out of a failed company called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Odeo.</v>

31
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Just podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that super early on.</v>

32
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 2>were really creative folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we weren't that passionate about</v>

34
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:28.281
<v Speaker 2>where podcasting was going in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular domain.</v>

35
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We just got a lot of competition early</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Itunes,</v>

36
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 2>just released their podcast directory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we knew we wanted to work together.</v>

37
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 2>We knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>we love this idea of one button</v>

38
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 2>publishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We love this idea of collaboration.</v>

39
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:46.821
<v Speaker 2>We love this idea of a being anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being able to share what was</v>

40
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

41
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the idea.</v>

42
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

43
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we wanted it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the most beautiful and also</v>

44
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 2>sometimes uncomfortable aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter is it,</v>

45
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really learned what it wanted to be</v>

46
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 2>and the people helped create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything that we hold sacred now,</v>

47
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 2>the at symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hashtag,</v>

48
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 2>the retweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were not invented by me or the</v>

49
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were things that we discovered,</v>

50
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>things that we discovered people using</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just observed it and we,</v>

51
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 2>we noticed what they were trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to talk with one another.</v>

52
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>collect tweets around topics with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag.</v>

54
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody figured out when the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of Hashtag something was created?</v>

55
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

56
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually our lead designer,</v>

57
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Anderson who leads our design of</v>

58
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 2>the cash app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hired him for square uh,</v>

59
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 2>later on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

60
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>he was the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was actually communicating with his</v>

61
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 2>brother and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put at buzz,</v>

62
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 2>his brother's is buzz and it just kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread.</v>

63
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't in mass but people were doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

64
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 2>but what was most interesting is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing,</v>

65
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>but what they wanted to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to address each other and</v>

66
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that changed the company completely.</v>

67
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>That changes the service because I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>from just broadcasting what's happening</v>

68
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>to conversation and to being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to address anyone publicly</v>

69
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 2>out in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which came with it a lot of power and</v>

70
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>also a lot of issues as well.</v>

71
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

72
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>the use of Hashtags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little looking up Hashtag,</v>

73
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fry fest or Hashtag,</v>

74
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime there's something weird that's</v>

75
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>in the news that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a unique way to find things,</v>

76
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>but to go on twitter and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to utilize that.</v>

77
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

78
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this guy just did it just to</v>

79
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>contact his brother.</v>

80
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the symbol of the Hashtag was</v>

81
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Christmas ina and he was trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

82
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to tag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Houston trying to tag around topics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was tweeting about.</v>

84
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that spread,</v>

85
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 2>all we did was made it easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made it more accessible.</v>

86
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 2>We enabled everyone to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

87
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 2>without symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made a page that collected all</v>

88
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 2>mentions of your name with the Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We allowed people to search a</v>

89
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>immediately so you can tap on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>keyword.</v>

90
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>And you would see everyone talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that or tweeting about that specific</v>

91
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these things were just emergent</v>

92
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 2>behaviors that we didn't predict and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they became the lifeblood of the</v>

93
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:33.334
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>

94
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.630
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating to me about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like twitter or even something like</v>

95
00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Speaker 1>youtube is that there's not a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones like it.</v>

96
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.610
<v Speaker 1>There's just this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how does that happen where this one</v>

97
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>thing sort of gets adopted by everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>and takes over and then just becomes</v>

98
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 1>this overwhelmingly massive platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

99
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>there's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Vimeo and there's a few other</v>

100
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>video services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing on the scale of youtube.</v>

101
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing with twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing on the scale of</v>

102
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 1>distributing information in a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short,</v>

103
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>280 character form like that.</v>

104
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.073
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we could plan for it.</v>

106
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we could necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>billed for that.</v>

107
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 2>someone said recently to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 2>gathered a bunch of our leadership last</v>
<v Speaker 2>week in palm springs for an offsite.</v>

111
00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 2>And someone said recently the twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>was discovered.</v>

112
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 2>And I think what's behind all that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

113
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hits something foundational,</v>

114
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.460
<v Speaker 2>it hit something essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my co founder Biz likes to say that</v>

115
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:41.910
<v Speaker 2>twitter can never be uninvented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's here.</v>

116
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 2>It changed everything though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The use of it has been revolutionary and</v>

117
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just this simple idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:53.601
<v Speaker 2>if you could text with the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could actually reach anyone in</v>

119
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the world or anyone could see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking,</v>

120
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>which I think is also the beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about,</v>

121
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>about taxed and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the medium.</v>

122
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 2>You can actually get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the</v>

123
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>world can see that instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a subconscious.</v>

124
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>It becomes this global consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

125
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to some really deep places in</v>

126
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.844
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

127
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>and some of those places are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncommon.</v>

128
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also gets to some really deep places</v>

129
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

130
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

131
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a weirdness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

132
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a weirdness to sending text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly at anonymously,</v>

133
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>and there's so many accounts that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an egg,</v>

135
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many accounts where they're clearly</v>

136
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>designed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like.</v>

137
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes someone will tweet something</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean to me and I'm like,</v>

138
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what this person's up to.</v>

139
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>So I go to their site and it's just them</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting mean shit at people all day</v>

140
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's probably some angry person at</v>

141
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>work and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to find people and fuck</v>

142
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>with them all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you realize,</v>

143
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 1>or when did you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of it,</v>

144
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>and when did you realize that this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost out of your control in terms of</v>

145
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>the scale of it?</v>

146
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

147
00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:08.304
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't,</v>

148
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.780
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't one moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't one moment that it just</v>

149
00:07:12.781 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 2>felt completely resonant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

150
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfolded into the next thing and</v>

151
00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 2>the next use case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just keeps surprising us with how</v>

152
00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 2>people are using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

153
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

154
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

155
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 2>recently I think we've identified some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the areas of the service that we need</v>

156
00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:40.641
<v Speaker 2>to pay a lot more attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter is unique in that it has two</v>

157
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.640
<v Speaker 2>main spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one which is your timeline and those are</v>

158
00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 2>the people that you follow and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 2>when you follow someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've earned that audience and then it</v>

160
00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:57.891
<v Speaker 2>has this other world where anyone can</v>
<v Speaker 2>insert themselves into the conversation</v>

161
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.850
<v Speaker 2>they can actually mention you and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>see that without asking for it,</v>

162
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 2>you can insert yourself into hashtags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a search.</v>

163
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are areas that people have</v>

164
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:16.821
<v Speaker 2>taken advantage of and these are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas that people have gained our</v>

165
00:08:17.401 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 2>systems to in some cases artificially</v>
<v Speaker 2>amplify,</v>

166
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:25.801
<v Speaker 2>but also just to spread a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weren't possible with the velocity</v>

167
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 2>of that they're not possible before.</v>

168
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Now when this is all happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the conversation like at twitter</v>

169
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>when you recognizing that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

170
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>that people are kind of gaming the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

171
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you guys,</v>

172
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>how do you mitigate it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the discussion?</v>

173
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early on it was,</v>

174
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty surface level.</v>

175
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we change some of the APP</v>

176
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more recently we're trying to go a</v>

177
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 2>lot deeper and asking ourselves the</v>
<v Speaker 2>question when people open twitter,</v>

178
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 2>what are we incentivizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we telling them to do when they</v>

179
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.100
<v Speaker 2>open up this app?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We may not explicitly be doing it,</v>

180
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that we're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>

181
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being as clear about it.</v>

182
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>So what does the light button</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentivize?</v>

183
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 2>What does the retweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentivize?</v>

184
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:21.771
<v Speaker 2>What does the number of followers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making that number big and bold</v>

185
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 2>incentivize?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

186
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what we should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if we should incentivize</v>

187
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need to understand what that is.</v>

188
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:39.201
<v Speaker 2>right now we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers</v>

190
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.390
<v Speaker 2>because we don't make it easy for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to follow interests and topics.</v>

191
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 2>It's only accounts we incentivize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

192
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.770
<v Speaker 2>a lot of outrage and how hot takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

193
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the dynamics in the service.</v>

194
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Not allowing a lot of nuance in</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation earlier on,</v>

195
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

196
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.510
<v Speaker 2>pseudonyms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

197
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.520
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

198
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

199
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 2>ability to not use your real name</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentivizes some positive things like</v>

200
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 2>allows for whistleblowers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists who,</v>

201
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might fear for their career or even</v>

202
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 2>worse their life and under certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>regimes,</v>

203
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 2>but also allows for people like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>example you mentioned of just random</v>

204
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 2>fire and a spread of abuse and</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment throughout.</v>

205
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 2>So those are the things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at and how do we,</v>

206
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 2>how do we enable more of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation to evolve?</v>

207
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 2>How do we increase the credibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation of accounts?</v>

208
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we identify a credible voices</v>

209
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 2>within a particular domain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just through this very coarse</v>

210
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 2>grain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue verified badge,</v>

211
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:55.470
<v Speaker 2>but if you're an expert in a particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>topic,</v>

212
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 2>how do we recognize that in real time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and show that so that we can provide</v>

213
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 2>more context to who you're talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you want to engage in a deeper</v>

214
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 2>conversation or just ignore mute or</v>
<v Speaker 2>block them.</v>

215
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>But what is the conversation like while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were at work?</v>

216
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Like when you realized that all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is happening.</v>

217
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realizing that now,</v>

218
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 1>particularly because the president uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>it so often in such a,</v>

219
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his preferred platform for</v>

220
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.710
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even more so than addresses.</v>

221
00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:26.180
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange.</v>

222
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 1>What's the conversation like in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>office when you're trying to figure out,</v>

223
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's our responsibility here?</v>

224
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Like how are we supposed to handle this</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how do we.</v>

225
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

226
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways what twitter is doing is</v>

227
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of its flavoring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public narrative,</v>

228
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.360
<v Speaker 1>its flavoring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we communicate with each other</v>

229
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our culture worldwide.</v>

230
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

231
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 2>the conversation has definitely evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the past we just got super</v>

232
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:57.030
<v Speaker 2>reactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

233
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 2>we were reacting to all the negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we're seeing in that led to</v>

234
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 2>a lot of short term thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

235
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 2>more recently we've just looked much</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper.</v>

236
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 2>We don't react to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the present day where we look for</v>

237
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 2>some of the patterns and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:14.731
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

239
00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a company that,</v>

240
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not just serving the people of this</v>

241
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 2>particular country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

242
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 2>This is global,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have global leaders all around the</v>

243
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>use all around the world using us in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different ways.</v>

244
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

246
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>with higher velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

247
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize more of the power.</v>

248
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some put out statements,</v>

249
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 2>some lead conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's looking at all those dynamics</v>

250
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:46.771
<v Speaker 2>and not trying to hyperfocus on any one</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular one because if we do,</v>

251
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:52.410
<v Speaker 2>we're only building it for one portion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the population are only one perceived</v>

252
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>a present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crisis.</v>

253
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.760
<v Speaker 1>What I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to get at was like,</v>

254
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

255
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.600
<v Speaker 1>when things come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you find out that there's</v>

256
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.890
<v Speaker 1>people from Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the using twitter and they using twitter</v>

257
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:09.800
<v Speaker 1>and posting things like what is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation like,</v>

258
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 1>how do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do about this?</v>

259
00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Do we let them leave this up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

260
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.630
<v Speaker 1>we recognize this as free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we only take it down if they're</v>

261
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.260
<v Speaker 1>calling for murder or hate speech?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

262
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.370
<v Speaker 1>how do you handle that?</v>

263
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it evolves.</v>

264
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean because like we first saw isis</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the world saw isis and we needed to</v>

265
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>change our policy to deal with it.</v>

266
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the initial reaction to it?</v>

267
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 1>So once you realized that people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>

268
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>we're making twitter accounts and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to recruit people and doing</v>

269
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>

270
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:42.050
<v Speaker 1>what was the thought process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

271
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it was a question like what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do about this?</v>

272
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>We haven't experienced this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to.</v>

273
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.471
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

274
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially pioneered.</v>

275
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.693
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

276
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who have experienced in</v>

277
00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:56.690
<v Speaker 2>different forms in different mediums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we reach out to our government</v>

278
00:13:56.691 --> 00:13:57.501
<v Speaker 2>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

279
00:13:57.501 --> 00:14:01.310
<v Speaker 2>our law enforcement partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reach out to our peer companies to</v>

280
00:14:01.311 --> 00:14:03.410
<v Speaker 2>ask if they're seeing the same things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're seeing.</v>

281
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a bunch of civil societies that</v>

282
00:14:06.891 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 2>we talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

283
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Speaker 2>to get their take on it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we try to balance that across,</v>

284
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:13.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:16.400
<v Speaker 2>various spectrums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be a,</v>

286
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more organizations that are more</v>

287
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:25.031
<v Speaker 2>focused on preventing online harassment</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way to the Acu and the eff who</v>

288
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.860
<v Speaker 2>are protecting the first amendment</v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

289
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.620
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to get as many perspectives as</v>

290
00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:33.800
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that and then make some informed</v>

291
00:14:33.801 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also realize that we're probably</v>

292
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:40.631
<v Speaker 2>gonna make some mistakes along the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all we can do to correct some of</v>

293
00:14:41.301 --> 00:14:44.750
<v Speaker 2>that is just be open about where we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's probably where we failed the</v>

294
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:49.751
<v Speaker 2>most in the past is we just haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>open about our thinking process.</v>

295
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what led particular decisions,</v>

296
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:57.401
<v Speaker 2>how our terms of service evolve in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of service as an area in our industry is</v>

297
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mess.</v>

298
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:03.310
<v Speaker 2>No one reads them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

299
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sign up for these services and you</v>

300
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:11.261
<v Speaker 2>quickly hit accept and we expect people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to read these rules of the road,</v>

301
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't read them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And have you ever read them?</v>

302
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I have read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you read facebook's?</v>

303
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on facebook.</v>

304
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facebook,</v>

305
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>

306
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 2>What about instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever read theirs?</v>

307
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

308
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I was in the first 10 users of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of instagram.</v>

309
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

310
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Kevin was a intern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Systrom was an internet at Odeo</v>

311
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.310
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the first investors of</v>

312
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 2>instagram and loved the service side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't think I've ever read their terms</v>

313
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 2>of service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

314
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

315
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Even you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even me,</v>

316
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 2>but I read ours and one of the things I</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed</v>

317
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 2>right away is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you read are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read our terms of service and one of</v>

319
00:15:57.141 --> 00:16:02.141
<v Speaker 2>the first things that we put at the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the page was copyright and</v>

320
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:07.960
<v Speaker 2>intellectual property protections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go down,</v>

321
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 2>you scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see everything about violent threats</v>

322
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:16.391
<v Speaker 2>and abuse and harassment and a safety</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that the company intended</v>

323
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 2>for that to be the order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

324
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.990
<v Speaker 2>we just added things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even a read of that put forth our</v>

325
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:28.300
<v Speaker 2>point of view like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

326
00:16:28.301 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 2>we're actually putting copyright</v>
<v Speaker 2>infringement above the safety,</v>

327
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 2>the physical safety of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to relook at some of these</v>

328
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.500
<v Speaker 2>things and how they've evolved and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they reacted.</v>

329
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.990
<v Speaker 1>But is it above just because it's listed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in second?</v>

330
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean is they're essentially all in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same one sheet there on the one sheet</v>

331
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.230
<v Speaker 1>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you bring it up,</v>

332
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 1>when you discuss it first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really critical?</v>

333
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.310
<v Speaker 1>They're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all part of the terms of</v>

334
00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:51.880
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

335
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think that ordering matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

336
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.870
<v Speaker 1>what do we consider to be most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have to consider physical safety</v>

337
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.970
<v Speaker 1>to the to be the one thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect the most and so I to go threats,</v>

338
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.830
<v Speaker 1>physical threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doxing,</v>

339
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:09.130
<v Speaker 1>doxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that impinges on someone's</v>

340
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.780
<v Speaker 1>physical safety.</v>

341
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.680
<v Speaker 2>An area where I don't think a technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and services like ours have a focused on</v>

342
00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:20.430
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't focused on the f off platform</v>

343
00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:22.350
<v Speaker 2>ramifications of what happens online.</v>

344
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like like here's a good,</v>

345
00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:28.260
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation with this,</v>

346
00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:32.470
<v Speaker 1>a young kid who had the Maggot hat on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the native American gentleman who</v>

347
00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:36.370
<v Speaker 1>was in front of him banging the drum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are calling for this kid's</v>

348
00:17:36.371 --> 00:17:37.690
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want his name.</v>

349
00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:39.550
<v Speaker 1>They want us to address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Kathy Griffin.</v>

350
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle something like that?</v>

351
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's essentially request for</v>

352
00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:45.634
<v Speaker 1>doxing.</v>

353
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

354
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.510
<v Speaker 2>that is a new vector that we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in mass and this,</v>

355
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the cases that bring up</v>

356
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 2>entirely new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have to study it.</v>

357
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:59.250
<v Speaker 2>We have to see how we reacted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened with a network.</v>

358
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this goes back to the incentives,</v>

359
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.970
<v Speaker 2>like we are incentivizing this very</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick reaction and it's taking away from</v>

360
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some more of the like considered work</v>

361
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 2>that we need to do to really diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in the moment.</v>

362
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And it was such an interesting case</v>
<v Speaker 2>study to see how that evolved over just</v>

363
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.603
<v Speaker 2>48 hours.</v>

364
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the most fascinating</v>

365
00:18:26.141 --> 00:18:30.820
<v Speaker 1>new cycles or stories in the new cycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quantitative because it's nuanced.</v>

366
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.620
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many different levels to it.</v>

367
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of like really knee jerk</v>

368
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 1>reactions.</v>

369
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

370
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>but we helped that had to help it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

371
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

372
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.610
<v Speaker 2>that's how some of the dynamics of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>service work,</v>

373
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 2>but those are those things we can</v>

374
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 1>to make sure the service or is it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way people choose to use the service?</v>

375
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a thoughtful person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't just like for instance,</v>

376
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the original image that was distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

377
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 1>came from an account that's now banned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

378
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was discovered that that account was</v>

379
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>a troll account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

380
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 1>how does that happen and what was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought process behind that?</v>

381
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Because the image that they posted was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate image.</v>

382
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.070
<v Speaker 1>It really did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

383
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 1>it was a part of an actual occurring</v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

384
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>So why did you ban the person or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>troll account that put it up?</v>

385
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's likely that it was found.</v>

386
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of what you see on the</v>

387
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:33.590
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twitter and some of the actions that</v>

388
00:19:33.591 --> 00:19:37.430
<v Speaker 2>we take on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where we spend a lot of our</v>

389
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.830
<v Speaker 2>enforcement is actually what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath.</v>

390
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.920
<v Speaker 2>So in many cases we have um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trolls or people like the case that you</v>

391
00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:51.131
<v Speaker 2>mentioned whose sole purpose is just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>harass or abuse or spread a particular</v>

392
00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:59.861
<v Speaker 2>information and oftentimes sees accounts</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be connected or they start one</v>

393
00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:02.450
<v Speaker 2>account that gets banned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start another account,</v>

394
00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:07.451
<v Speaker 2>but we can actually see this through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>network Lens and we can actually see</v>

395
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.120
<v Speaker 2>some of those behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that might have been one of the</v>

396
00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:13.070
<v Speaker 2>reasons I'm not sure in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

397
00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.910
<v Speaker 2>in that particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

398
00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:17.170
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know,</v>

399
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>do you know because of Ip addresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know because of the,</v>

400
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.130
<v Speaker 2>a variety of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it could be,</v>

401
00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:26.210
<v Speaker 2>it could be trying to use the same phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>number or St Mil address Ip addresses,</v>

402
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>device ids,</v>

403
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.340
<v Speaker 2>all these things that we can use to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to judge what's happening within the</v>

404
00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:34.250
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we do have a lot of occurrences of</v>

405
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.850
<v Speaker 2>suspending or temporarily suspending</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts because of activities across</v>

406
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

407
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.353
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

408
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.200
<v Speaker 2>that happens a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I mean,</v>

409
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>what I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that we're helping this right now is</v>

410
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 2>like some of the incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just just imagine seeing that</v>

411
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 2>unfold and when you see someone with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

412
00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 2>it kind of emboldened something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow along and then this mob kind of</v>

413
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there has to be a way for us to</v>

414
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:07.420
<v Speaker 2>incentivize a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more,</v>

415
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.940
<v Speaker 2>more considered and more nuanced</v>
<v Speaker 2>introspection of what's going on.</v>

416
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give everybody mushrooms.</v>

417
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Probably the only way to know how are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to get people to be more</v>

418
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:16.674
<v Speaker 1>considerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

419
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 1>what your engineering social behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

420
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Provided more context,</v>

421
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

422
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Like as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say brexit for example.</v>

423
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

424
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I followed a bunch of accounts that</v>

425
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Boris Johnson,</v>

426
00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 2>who was constantly giving me information</v>
<v Speaker 2>about reasons to leave,</v>

427
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I would probably only see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

428
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Nigel Farrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

429
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 2>And those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>

430
00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of folks just will not follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts that have a completely</v>

431
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:53.200
<v Speaker 2>different perspective or a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

432
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 2>A number of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully journalists do,</v>

433
00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but most people won't do that work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the only tool we give people</v>

434
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 2>follow an account if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

435
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 2>during that time you followed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag,</v>

436
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 2>you follow the Hashtag vote leave 95</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the conversation and the</v>

437
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:16.501
<v Speaker 2>tweets you see are all reasons to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a small percentage that</v>

438
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 2>shows a different perspective and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows a different,</v>

439
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different reasoning.</v>

440
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 2>We don't make it easy for anyone to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that is for anyone to follow</v>

441
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.140
<v Speaker 2>the bit of perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the Hashtag follow topic,</v>

442
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 2>follow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow an interest.</v>

443
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:38.850
<v Speaker 2>And because of that we help build an</v>
<v Speaker 2>echo chamber and something that doesn't</v>

444
00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:45.811
<v Speaker 2>really challenge any perspective and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that we should force that upon</v>

445
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:48.070
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't even make it easy for</v>

446
00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 2>people to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the first place though,</v>

447
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 2>the way you do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you go to the explore tab,</v>

448
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:55.000
<v Speaker 2>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you search for a Hashtag or you tap into</v>

449
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 2>a Hashtag and you can see all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

450
00:22:57.611 --> 00:22:59.080
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's work.</v>

451
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 2>And most people just won't do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll stay in their timeline,</v>

452
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:05.800
<v Speaker 2>they'll see what they need to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can certainly imagine,</v>

453
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you know why if I'm just following a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people who have the exact same</v>

454
00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>take on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just continues to embolden in Bolton</v>

455
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:17.911
<v Speaker 2>bolden and they see nothing of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspective on the exact same,</v>

456
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 2>the exact same situation.</v>

457
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.280
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting to me is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between twitter and</v>

458
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.160
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

459
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's weird that has happened was</v>

460
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 1>there's shitty people on instagram as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

461
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of arguments and things</v>

462
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't overwhelm the,</v>

463
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the initial post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with twitter on a different</v>

464
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

465
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram is a is a post.</v>

466
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really eliciting conversation</v>

467
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and soliciting comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to follow the</v>

468
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there was a conversation.</v>

469
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It sometimes there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

470
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people are going back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth about a particular subject that's</v>

471
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 1>discussed in the initial post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

472
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with with twitter,</v>

473
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.150
<v Speaker 1>it only conference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only conversation,</v>

474
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>but even if there's a photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if somebody posted a photograph on</v>

475
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Speaker 1>twitter and has conversation under it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photograph seems to be like of</v>

476
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 1>secondary importance.</v>

477
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Super Fluid and super messy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

478
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 2>the thing is every on instagram or any</v>
<v Speaker 2>any blog,</v>

479
00:24:26.971 --> 00:24:30.240
<v Speaker 2>you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this post the statement and you have</v>

480
00:24:30.241 --> 00:24:32.880
<v Speaker 2>comments underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with twitter,</v>

481
00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:36.690
<v Speaker 2>everything is on the same surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all one surface.</v>

482
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Kurt Metzger likes that about</v>

483
00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:40.060
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

484
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:45.061
<v Speaker 1>because in twitter egos I post something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all these fucking morons post</v>

485
00:24:45.581 --> 00:24:47.850
<v Speaker 1>something and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Kurt,</v>

486
00:24:47.851 --> 00:24:50.950
<v Speaker 1>he's very animated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like in their shit looks like just</v>

487
00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:52.450
<v Speaker 1>like my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all together.</v>

488
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll pile up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

489
00:24:53.621 --> 00:24:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but if I post something on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

490
00:24:56.291 --> 00:24:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I have this whole thing like this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

491
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

492
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.210
<v Speaker 1>you fucking say whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's no one's reading that.</v>

493
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.470
<v Speaker 1>They're reading the original initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>post and it's clear that there's a</v>

494
00:25:08.471 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 1>differentiation between the initial post</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the secondary post.</v>

495
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:12.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

496
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 2>there's room for both models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

498
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.440
<v Speaker 2>this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most conversations,</v>

499
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not you making a statement and me</v>
<v Speaker 2>just reacting to that,</v>

500
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.280
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our conversation evolves based on what</v>

501
00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:28.590
<v Speaker 2>we say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can interrupt one another,</v>

502
00:25:28.591 --> 00:25:29.720
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.960
<v Speaker 2>we can completely change the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take control of the conversation</v>

504
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.580
<v Speaker 2>and the people who might find that</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting follow it and the folks that</v>

505
00:25:38.581 --> 00:25:43.100
<v Speaker 2>don't just stop listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas you can't do that in a post</v>

506
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.640
<v Speaker 2>comment model.</v>

507
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also text is so limited there.</v>

508
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.411
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

509
00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:52.350
<v Speaker 1>it's great for just getting out actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

510
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's so thinking.</v>

511
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.600
<v Speaker 2>It's just so close to thinking like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no composition,</v>

512
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

513
00:25:57.601 --> 00:25:58.434
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's uh,</v>

514
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.720
<v Speaker 2>that to me is the most beautiful thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about twitter,</v>

515
00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:04.170
<v Speaker 2>but also something that can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

516
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can compose my life on Instagram,</v>

517
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I can compose my thoughts within a</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook post and it can look so</v>

518
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.360
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the best of twitter is just super</v>

519
00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:21.570
<v Speaker 2>raw and it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right to the thinking process.</v>

520
00:26:21.571 --> 00:26:24.510
<v Speaker 2>And I just think that's so beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gets to,</v>

521
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.090
<v Speaker 2>it gets to consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to something deeper.</v>

522
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think that deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

523
00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.920
<v Speaker 2>How is it different than a post on</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram or post on facebook?</v>

524
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.210
<v Speaker 2>The speed demands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.300
<v Speaker 2>the character constraint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed of just demand to a more</v>

526
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.420
<v Speaker 2>conscious present focused thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus stepping back and composing a</v>

527
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:49.021
<v Speaker 2>letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

528
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 2>And composing a letter and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the outcomes.</v>

529
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 2>But oftentimes people do compose it as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>letter and they break it up into</v>

530
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:57.790
<v Speaker 2>separate 280 character posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

531
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:02.310
<v Speaker 2>The blue was the thought process in</v>
<v Speaker 2>going from 1:40 to 80 because the one</v>

532
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 2>thing that I liked about 1:40 is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be verbose.</v>

533
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just,</v>

534
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 2>just ramble and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great for comics because he forces</v>

536
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 2>us to write jokes like with economy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

537
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

538
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found a lot of resonance with what</v>

539
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.390
<v Speaker 2>journalists because the headlines we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>found a lot of resonance with,</v>

540
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 2>with comics because of the rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we found a lot of resonance with hip</v>

541
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>hop as well because of the bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just the structure and the</v>

542
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 2>constraint allowed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that flow.</v>

543
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

544
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 2>the thinking was we looked at um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

545
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages around the world and,</v>

546
00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some languages like German,</v>

547
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 2>140 characters.</v>

548
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 2>You can't really say much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't really say much at all because</v>

549
00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>words are so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some languages,</v>

550
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 2>like Japanese 140 characters is 140</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

551
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 2>And what was interesting about Japan was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan is one of our largest,</v>

552
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 2>our largest countries were bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>

553
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:04.671
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot bigger than facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>and America know what the fuck.</v>

554
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't even use facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

555
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>

556
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I use it in terms of if I post</v>
<v Speaker 2>something on instagram it goes to</v>

557
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:15.050
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I go to facebook it's,</v>

558
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.020
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this seems like twitter to a lot of</v>

559
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 2>arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what twitter seems to be more fun,</v>

560
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.580
<v Speaker 2>if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's,</v>

561
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of chaos when something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite things is when</v>

562
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 2>someone post something stupid and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath it is a bunch of Jeff's say</v>

563
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 2>gifs or jifs.</v>

564
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I say Gif.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody know him?</v>

565
00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Gifts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say gifts.</v>

566
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the jury's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of gifts that are hilarious now.</v>

567
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Like was just mocking someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>relentlessly.</v>

568
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Like that is one of my favorite things</v>
<v Speaker 2>about twitter.</v>

569
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I when someone like Donald trump posts</v>
<v Speaker 2>something ridiculous and then I'll go</v>

570
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 2>and I'll look at the responses like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you care if it's a public</v>

571
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:58.370
<v Speaker 2>conversation and you can see our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>racks,</v>

572
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 2>but like it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interesting thing about twitter is</v>

573
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.610
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not one twitter.</v>

574
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter which can be super toxic.</v>

575
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 2>You have sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

576
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 2>you have NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

577
00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 2>you have mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

578
00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you have a UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

579
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you have k-pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

580

<v Speaker 2>black twitter has jamie's you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>All these different twitters and you and</v>

582
00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:24.450
<v Speaker 2>you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a completely different</v>

583
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 2>experience based on what twitter you</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow in order to participate in.</v>

584
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were are like super</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging,</v>

585
00:29:30.091 --> 00:29:32.010
<v Speaker 2>super funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are,</v>

586
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to walk away from it?</v>

587
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to a certain point where I</v>

588
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 2>couldn't read replies anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

589
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 2>it's just not as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it's that toxic.</v>

590
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of interactions I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people are super positive.</v>

591
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.470
<v Speaker 2>That may mean absolutely like more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 percent,</v>

592
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

593
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time and I don't have time</v>

594
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 2>to be constantly responding to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just didn't.</v>

595
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 2>The sheer numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I got around 3 million ish</v>

596
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 2>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

597
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

598
00:30:02.781 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming.</v>

599
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge believer in serendipity.</v>

600
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

601
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 2>you look at your replies once and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might see something that just strikes</v>

602
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 2>you and that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to read through all of</v>

603
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:15.350
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

604
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you might miss something</v>

605
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 2>groovy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might.</v>

606
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 2>But I also believe that the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing is to come back up.</v>

607
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.700
<v Speaker 2>What I used to do a lot without go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through my mentions and when people</v>

608
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 2>would essentially use it as almost a</v>
<v Speaker 2>news aggregator.</v>

609
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I go through my mentions that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>would post cool stories and then I would</v>

610
00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 2>retweet those and so because people knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would retweet them,</v>

611
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 2>they would send me a lot of cool stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

612
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 2>because of reciprocating a got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool stuff sent my way,</v>

613
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing more out and expand the</v>

614
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:48.721
<v Speaker 2>network and I reinforced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to thank people for</v>

615
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 2>posting cool stuff and they love the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact they would get a retweet and so</v>

616
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 2>they would send me like interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>science stories are very bizarre nature</v>

617
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 2>stories and I just retweet them all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

618
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then after awhile I'm like mmm,</v>

619
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of times.</v>

620
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:09.250
<v Speaker 2>So now essentially what I do is I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>post something and I just kinda like,</v>

621
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I just walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

622
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean that speaks of what we want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentivize more.</v>

623
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 2>We want more people contributing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that back to the network.</v>

624
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Back to the back to the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

625
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:24.610
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it doesn't feel like this today</v>

626
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 2>for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my ideal is someone walks away from</v>

627
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 2>twitter learning something and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually learning something entirely</v>

628
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:35.260
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be a new perspective.</v>

629
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.820
<v Speaker 2>That happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably happens more often than we</v>

630
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.930
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly it.</v>

631
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 2>It's all dependent on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the twitter.</v>

632
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 2>You follow her and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

633
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter is amazing.</v>

634
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.043
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I learned some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

636
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:53.131
<v Speaker 2>I followed a Rhonda Patrick and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sauna and I'm Wim Hoff and ice</v>

637
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:57.810
<v Speaker 2>pass and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

638
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Ben Greenfield and you just follow them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just get all this new</v>

639
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>information about alternative views of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to stay healthy,</v>

640
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 2>how to live longer.</v>

641
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.630
<v Speaker 2>And I can't find that anywhere else in</v>
<v Speaker 2>one place like that.</v>

642
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not just them broadcasting when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they retweet something or when they</v>

643
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:16.690
<v Speaker 2>tweet something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole conversation about it.</v>

644
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:17.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

645
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 2>some people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

646
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>this has not been my experience or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>

647
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 2>this is not true for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or actually have you seen this connected</v>

648
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:29.490
<v Speaker 2>thing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go down this rabbit hole and I,</v>

649
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I learned so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the experience for</v>

650
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:33.340
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

651
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the experience for everyone and</v>

652
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 2>it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's what everyone wants</v>

653
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:39.820
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people just like to go on</v>

654
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>there and</v>

655
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 1>talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone that's trapped in a</v>

656
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:45.080
<v Speaker 1>cubicle right now and they just want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on there and get in arguments about</v>

657
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 1>gun control or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not Nancy Polosi is the devil</v>

658
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it,</v>

659
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 1>it serves a purpose for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that gets strange though is</v>

660
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>who's to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

661
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this concept,</v>

662
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a discussion I should say where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

663
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.190
<v Speaker 1>some people believe that things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter or facebook or any forum where</v>

664
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 1>you're having a public discussion should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be considered almost like a public</v>

665
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anyone has access to the electric</v>

666
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.170
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're,</v>

667
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a racist,</v>

668
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 1>you still can get electricity and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that you should have that</v>

669
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:28.490
<v Speaker 1>same ability with something like twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the same ability with something like</v>

670
00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:31.130
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this is,</v>

671
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 1>we're in uncharted territory and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

672
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you are in uncharted territory.</v>

673
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

674
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.280
<v Speaker 1>no one has been there before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who makes the distinctions when you</v>

675
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 1>see someone that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's saying something that you</v>

676
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:48.791
<v Speaker 1>might think is offensive to some folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not offensive to the person who's</v>

677
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the person who's saying it feels</v>

678
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 1>like they need to express themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is important to say and how do you</v>

679
00:33:55.101 --> 00:34:00.101
<v Speaker 1>decide whether or not this is a valid</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion or if this is air quotes,</v>

680
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 1>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

681
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that are hate speech</v>

682
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 1>and there's sometimes people use the</v>
<v Speaker 1>term hate speech and it's just a cheap</v>

683
00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 1>way to shut down a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

684
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.100
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the simple answer is we look at</v>

685
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 2>conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

686
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 2>we don't look at the speech itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We look at conduct.</v>

687
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 2>We look at how the tool is being used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>

688
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.510
<v Speaker 2>you're right in that like I think when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people see twitter,</v>

689
00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 2>they see and they expect it to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>public square.</v>

690
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.240
<v Speaker 2>They can go into that public square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can say whatever they want,</v>

691
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 2>they can get on a pedestal and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>might gather around them and listen to</v>

692
00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 2>what they have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them might find it offensive and</v>

693
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:42.700
<v Speaker 2>they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference is there's,</v>

694
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.460
<v Speaker 2>there's also this concept of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>megaphone and the megaphone can be</v>

695
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>highly targeted now with twitter as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

696
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the,</v>

697
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not the speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how it's amplified.</v>

698
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:57.400
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's someone in the media,</v>

699
00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's a prominent feminist and</v>

700
00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:04.600
<v Speaker 1>then you have a bunch of people or let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>say just one person and their twitter</v>

701
00:35:04.601 --> 00:35:07.870
<v Speaker 1>feed is overwhelmingly attacking this</v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent feminist.</v>

702
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly attacking her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling her a liar,</v>

703
00:35:10.751 --> 00:35:14.230
<v Speaker 1>calling her this calling that when do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide this is harassment?</v>

704
00:35:14.231 --> 00:35:16.930
<v Speaker 1>When decide this is hate speech when</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you,</v>

705
00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a look at the conduct is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fictional account.</v>

706
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Write fictional person we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

707
00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:24.040
<v Speaker 1>But in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

708
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.350
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would dictate something that was</v>

709
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.640
<v Speaker 1>egregious enough for you to eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>them from your plan?</v>

710
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.713
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

711
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a heavy action.</v>

712
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 2>So that's a last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we look at the conduct.</v>

713
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.940
<v Speaker 2>We look at oftentimes as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the probability of someone who is</v>

714
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 2>harassing one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's highly probable that they're also</v>

715
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.940
<v Speaker 2>passing 10 more people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

716
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 2>So we can look at that behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can look at how many times this</v>

717
00:35:55.801 --> 00:36:00.090
<v Speaker 2>person is being blocked or muted or</v>
<v Speaker 2>reported,</v>

718
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 2>and based on all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that data,</v>

719
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 2>we can actually take some action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also have to.</v>

720
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 2>We have to correlate it with the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of that because people go on and</v>

721
00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 2>they coordinate blocks as well and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinate harassment and they and they</v>

722
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:17.070
<v Speaker 2>coordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

723
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 2>not harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but reporting.</v>

724
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm reporting a particular account to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it shut down into a to take the</v>

725
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 2>voice off the service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are the considerations we have</v>

726
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:28.390
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

727
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.820
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all starts with conduct and all.</v>

728
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes we'll see coordinated</v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct,</v>

729
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 2>whether it be that one person opening</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple counts or coordinating with</v>

730
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.010
<v Speaker 2>multiple accounts that they don't own</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

731
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go after someone and there's a bunch of</v>

732
00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:46.470
<v Speaker 2>vectors that people use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>retweet for that,</v>

733
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quote tweet for that a lot as well.</v>

734
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.560
<v Speaker 2>they'll quote tweet a tweet that someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>finds and they'll say,</v>

736
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.900
<v Speaker 2>look at this idiot twitter to your thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just this mob starts and goes</v>

737
00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 2>and tries to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.140
<v Speaker 2>effectively shut that person down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

739
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:07.250
<v Speaker 2>so there's a bunch of tools we can use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The permanent suspension is the last</v>

740
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>resort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we can do is we</v>

741
00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:14.820
<v Speaker 2>can down rank the replies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So any of these,</v>

742
00:37:14.821 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 2>any of these behaviors and conduct that</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks link linked,</v>

743
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 2>we can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

744
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 2>push farther down in the supply chain.</v>

745
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's all still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you might have to push a button to</v>

746
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:27.440
<v Speaker 2>actually see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have to say,</v>

747
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.600
<v Speaker 2>show more replies to actually see this</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing account or what might look</v>

748
00:37:34.621 --> 00:37:38.570
<v Speaker 2>like harassing language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this manually done or no,</v>

749
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.010
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all,</v>

750
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.020
<v Speaker 2>this is all automated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's automated.</v>

751
00:37:42.021 --> 00:37:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

752
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 2>But how would you the ranking in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

753
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.750
<v Speaker 2>looking at amplification and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the network is automated,</v>

754
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of ranking,</v>

755
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.330
<v Speaker 2>is there a discussion as to whether or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not this person's reply should be down</v>

756
00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:54.350
<v Speaker 2>ranked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you,</v>

757
00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.410
<v Speaker 2>how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a machine learning and deep</v>

758
00:37:57.411 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 2>learning model and they say I and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they learn,</v>

759
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

760
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.840
<v Speaker 2>we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at how these things are doing</v>

761
00:38:05.841 --> 00:38:08.120
<v Speaker 2>and where they make mistakes and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve it.</v>

762
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just constantly improving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly learning.</v>

763
00:38:10.311 --> 00:38:12.650
<v Speaker 2>And does that feel like censorship to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

764
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Like automated censorship doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

765
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.630
<v Speaker 2>who is to decide other than people</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not something is valid?</v>

766
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

767
00:38:21.621 --> 00:38:23.390
<v Speaker 2>we're not looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the speech.</v>

768
00:38:23.391 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 2>In this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at the conduct,</v>

769
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.050
<v Speaker 2>the conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conduct of someone in fast velocity</v>

770
00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:31.850
<v Speaker 2>attacking someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

771
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 2>So those are the things that our</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology allows changes,</v>

772
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 2>the velocity of changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

773
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:43.090
<v Speaker 2>how to broadcast a message that someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really ask for and didn't want to</v>

774
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't touch.</v>

775
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 2>If I follow Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see every single tweet.</v>

776
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.290
<v Speaker 2>We don't touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

777
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 2>But that's an audience that you earn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in your replies page we have a</v>

778
00:38:56.351 --> 00:39:01.000
<v Speaker 2>little bit more room because this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a conversation that starts up</v>

779
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 2>and some people just want to disrupt it.</v>

780
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Speaker 2>And all we're saying is we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at moving the disruption down.</v>

781
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still there.</v>

782
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see a little bit farther down.</v>

783
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the incidence with Ari?</v>

784
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I should text him right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to answer me in real time,</v>

785
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 2>but are you should fear got kicked off</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter because he said something to</v>

786
00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 2>bird like bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking kill you.</v>

787
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer being our good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us are good friends and he's</v>

788
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:28.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking dummy.</v>

789
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or something like that as a record</v>

790
00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 2>albums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he was gonna steal and I'm</v>

791
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.000
<v Speaker 2>breaking and got jokingly got mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

792
00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

793
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 2>That's already though Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert was.</v>

794
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it was all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

795
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Bert really stole his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him.</v>

796
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave them back to them eventually.</v>

797
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

798
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking kill you.</v>

799
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 2>So what happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What probably happened there,</v>

800
00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:49.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not sure of the particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will probably happen there,</v>

801
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 2>is someone might have reported that</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet one of our agents,</v>

802
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 2>a human agents without context of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship or that relationship,</v>

803
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw it as a violent threat and took</v>

804
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:04.594
<v Speaker 2>action on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

805
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And those are the mistakes that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make.</v>

806
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 2>That's why we need an appeals process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Burt needs to keep his fucking</v>

807
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:11.650
<v Speaker 2>greasy hands off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are his records.</v>

808
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not going to happen.</v>

809
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.010
<v Speaker 2>We need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to make sure we need to make</v>

810
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 2>sure that we're reacting to the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

811
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.351
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

812
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.870
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make mistakes where we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to.</v>

813
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.610
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the system right now is</v>

814
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:30.210
<v Speaker 2>most of the most of the work is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the burden is actually on the victims</v>

815
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:36.151
<v Speaker 2>of abuse while they're getting harassed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of our system doesn't</v>

816
00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 2>enforce or act and less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

817
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.310
<v Speaker 2>these tweets are reported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

818
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:47.310
<v Speaker 2>So we don't take suspension actions or</v>
<v Speaker 2>removal of content actions in less that</v>

819
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 2>reported the algorithms rank and order</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation,</v>

820
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 2>but they don't take suspension actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't take,</v>

821
00:40:55.691 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't remove content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might suggest to human to look at</v>

822
00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:02.250
<v Speaker 2>this who might look at our rules and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the content and,</v>

823
00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:06.670
<v Speaker 2>and try to look at the context of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and then take action.</v>

824
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.120
<v Speaker 2>But we would like to move towards a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>more automated enforcement.</v>

825
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:16.210
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>

826
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.630
<v Speaker 2>how do we highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we amplify more of the healthier</v>

827
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:24.100
<v Speaker 2>discussion conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

828
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.850
<v Speaker 2>not removing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

829
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

830
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.360
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to a world,</v>

831
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.670
<v Speaker 2>especially with technology like</v>
<v Speaker 2>blockchain,</v>

832
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that all content that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has ever created will exist</v>

833
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't be able to take it down.</v>

834
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.810
<v Speaker 2>You won't be able to censor it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be centralized at all.</v>

835
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Our role is around what we recommend</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on your interest and based on who</v>

836
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:52.830
<v Speaker 2>you follow and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and helping you to get into that onramp.</v>

837
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the architect</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurology,</v>

838
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a given that anytime something is</v>
<v Speaker 2>created,</v>

839
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 2>it's going to exist forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what blockchain helps enable</v>

840
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 2>down the line and we need to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're paying attention to that and</v>

841
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:10.940
<v Speaker 2>also realizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:16.340
<v Speaker 2>our role is like how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get people the stuff that they</v>

843
00:42:16.341 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 2>really want to see in the find valuable</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'll learn from,</v>

844
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 2>that they'll make them think that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>help them evolve the conversation as</v>

845
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:24.240
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

846
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say amplify the messages</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you deem to be more positive,</v>

847
00:42:28.771 --> 00:42:31.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you decide that people</v>

848
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:32.940
<v Speaker 1>decided?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People decide.</v>

849
00:42:32.941 --> 00:42:36.180
<v Speaker 1>People decide it based on like are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they engaging in replies?</v>

850
00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they read tweeting it?</v>

851
00:42:38.551 --> 00:42:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Are they liking it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they.</v>

852
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's really negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes the people that are</v>

853
00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:44.880
<v Speaker 1>engaging and they're engaging in because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking someone.</v>

854
00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.530
<v Speaker 1>So d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that valuable or is it just</v>

855
00:42:49.531 --> 00:42:50.364
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate?</v>

856
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 2>It's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean every,</v>

857
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 2>every signal is something that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from and we can act on,</v>

858
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to constantly evolve.</v>

859
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

860
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these models that we have to build will</v>

861
00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:07.550
<v Speaker 2>constantly have to learn what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>network is doing and how people are</v>

862
00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 2>using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

863
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

864
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 2>our goal is healthy contribution back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public conversation,</v>

865
00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 2>that that is what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to encourage people into more,</v>

866
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 2>bigger informative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global conversations that they'll learn</v>

867
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:25.664
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

868
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Are you like constantly aware of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much this is changing society and that</v>

869
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you are one of the four or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>different modalities that are radically</v>

870
00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:39.970
<v Speaker 1>changing society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's facebook or instagram or</v>

871
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:44.971
<v Speaker 1>any of these social media companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's radically changing the way people</v>

872
00:43:45.431 --> 00:43:46.900
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>

873
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:51.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant impact on the way human beings</v>

874
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:56.320
<v Speaker 1>talk and see each other and the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>process ideas and the way we distributed</v>

875
00:43:56.321 --> 00:43:57.850
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unprecedented.</v>

876
00:43:57.851 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 1>There's never been anything like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

877
00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.890
<v Speaker 1>And you setting up something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is going to be a group chat.</v>

878
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the early days when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say like at Jack is going to the</v>

879
00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:09.730
<v Speaker 1>movies and you would say like that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd say it.</v>

880
00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I would say at Joe Rogan is on his way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dinner.</v>

881
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 1>That's how people would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking.</v>

882
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It was weird that somewhere along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line that morphed</v>

883
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:21.920
<v Speaker 2>and that's what the world wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

884
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 2>That's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where they wanted to take that.</v>

885
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just think it's so reflective of,</v>

886
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:31.620
<v Speaker 2>of what the world is and in some cases</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the world wants to</v>

887
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.680
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a a pathway for thinking.</v>

888
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Just a pathway for people to get their</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts out,</v>

889
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but a really powerful one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented method of distributing</v>

890
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really nothing ever been like this</v>

891
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:48.490
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

892
00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in it,</v>

893
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.540
<v Speaker 1>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

894
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.380
<v Speaker 1>this mode of communicating will not go</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

895
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It'll just get faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>

896
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it will become a lot more connected and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why our work is so critical to</v>

897
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 1>figure out some of the dynamics at play</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

898
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

899
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.990
<v Speaker 1>that make it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

900
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that caused more negative outcomes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive outcomes.</v>

901
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it because,</v>

902
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:18.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think about it because it's,</v>

903
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it's just a hugely significant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think about it because of</v>

904
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 1>podcasts because podcasts are in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar way,</v>

905
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 1>just no one saw it coming and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in that are like,</v>

906
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:34.750
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing now?</v>

907
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

908
00:45:35.911 --> 00:45:36.810
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

909
00:45:36.811 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

910
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 1>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

911
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.330
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to talk to guys like Ben</v>

912
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Greenfield and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jonathan Haidt and all the,</v>

913
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 1>all these different people and learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stuff.</v>

914
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And I've have clearly learned way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>from doing this podcast than I ever</v>

915
00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 1>would have learned without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it unquestionably.</v>

916
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fucking plan as.</v>

917
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So now all of a sudden there is this a</v>
<v Speaker 1>signal that I'm sending out to millions</v>

918
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 1>and millions of people and then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

919
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a responsibility.</v>

920
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>

921
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to responsibility to what,</v>

922
00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 1>what I distribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to be able to have a freak</v>

923
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:15.380
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talk to people like what?</v>

924
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:15.931
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

925
00:46:15.931 --> 00:46:19.050
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain people that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on whether it's Alex Jones or</v>

926
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 1>anyone that's controversial where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get fucking mad.</v>

927
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Why are you giving this person a</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform?</v>

928
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.763
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

929
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about it that way and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that's what I'm doing.</v>

930
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm talking to people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can listen.</v>

931
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's giving that person a platform</v>

932
00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 1>because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

933
00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 1>they'll tone down there like Milo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos.</v>

934
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.380
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the arguments people</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me,</v>

935
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>like he toned down his platform when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on your show so you could get more</v>

936
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 1>people to pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

937
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:45.890
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also talked about he,</v>

938
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.300
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the reasons why he was</v>

939
00:46:48.301 --> 00:46:53.250
<v Speaker 1>exposed was my show because he talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that it's okay to have sex with</v>

940
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:58.080
<v Speaker 1>underage boys if they're gay because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there like a mentor relationship between</v>

941
00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 1>the older gay man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young and people were like,</v>

942
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:04.120
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a big part of why he's kind</v>

943
00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:06.930
<v Speaker 1>of been removed from the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

944
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.890
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the discussion like,</v>

945
00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 1>well what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is removing someone from the public</v>

946
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:17.650
<v Speaker 1>conversation if someone is very popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have all these people that like</v>

947
00:47:17.651 --> 00:47:20.580
<v Speaker 1>to listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the responsibility of these</v>

948
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 1>platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's youtube or twitter or,</v>

949
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:27.030
<v Speaker 1>or anyone know what is their</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to decide whether or not</v>

950
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 1>someone should or shouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

951
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>And this is a thing that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling with and I've been.</v>

952
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I bounced around inside my own head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that you guys struggle with it and</v>

953
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube does.</v>

954
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:42.063
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

955
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a hugely significant discussion</v>

956
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:52.090
<v Speaker 1>that is left to a very relatively small</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people.</v>

957
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 1>And this is why this discussion of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is social media,</v>

958
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.340
<v Speaker 1>is it something that everybody has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to or is it something that should</v>

959
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:05.341
<v Speaker 1>be restricted to only people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to behave and carry themselves</v>

960
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 1>in a certain way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's something that everyone</v>

961
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 1>has a right to everyone has a right to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still banned people,</v>

962
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 1>like say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Alex Jones,</v>

963
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you guys were the last guys to keep Alex</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones on the platform.</v>

964
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 1>You were the last ones and I believe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hung in there until he started harassing</v>

965
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

966
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.433
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

967
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:26.240
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did come your house.</v>

968
00:48:26.241 --> 00:48:29.000
<v Speaker 2>He begged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>

969
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

970
00:48:29.751 --> 00:48:32.900
<v Speaker 2>he did very different things on our</v>
<v Speaker 2>platform versus the others.</v>

971
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:38.840
<v Speaker 2>So we saw this domino effect over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend of one platform,</v>

972
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.660
<v Speaker 2>a Banningham and then another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

973
00:48:41.661 --> 00:48:43.880
<v Speaker 2>another very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quick succession.</v>

974
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:48.770
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I think would have assumed that</v>

975
00:48:48.771 --> 00:48:52.340
<v Speaker 2>we would just have followed suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't violate our terms of</v>

976
00:48:52.341 --> 00:48:56.960
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And afterwards he did.</v>

977
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.310
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have,</v>

978
00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a,</v>

979
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.460
<v Speaker 2>we have a policy and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

980
00:49:01.461 --> 00:49:02.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a violation,</v>

982
00:49:03.621 --> 00:49:08.621
<v Speaker 2>we take enforcement actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One might be asking the account holder</v>

983
00:49:08.721 --> 00:49:12.710
<v Speaker 2>to delete the tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another might be a temporary suspension,</v>

984
00:49:12.711 --> 00:49:15.020
<v Speaker 2>another might be a permanent suspension.</v>

985
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So were you saying the solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's use it in terms of like him saying</v>

986
00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that Sandy Hook was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not say that on the platform.</v>

987
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:24.850
<v Speaker 1>He did not say that on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always said that on his show.</v>

988
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know all the mediums he set it</v>

989
00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:28.610
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he do?</v>

990
00:49:28.611 --> 00:49:33.611
<v Speaker 2>What we're looking at is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the conduct and what he did on our,</v>

991
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 1>our platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did he do on your platform that</v>

992
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:38.800
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you all were in agreement that this</v>

993
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:39.634
<v Speaker 1>is enough?</v>

994
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

995
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the actual like,</v>

996
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:45.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violations were.</v>

997
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Speaker 2>But we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a set number of actions and if</v>

998
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:51.980
<v Speaker 2>they keep getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

999
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if an account keeps violent in terms of</v>

1000
00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 2>service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately it leads to permanent</v>

1001
00:49:58.571 --> 00:50:00.670
<v Speaker 2>suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when all the other platforms we're</v>

1002
00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:02.920
<v Speaker 2>taking them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't find those.</v>

1003
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 2>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't find those violations and they</v>

1004
00:50:05.321 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 2>weren't reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1005
00:50:06.761 --> 00:50:11.761
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to a lot of our model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people weren't reporting a lot of the</v>

1006
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:17.191
<v Speaker 2>tweets that may have been in violation</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our service and we didn't act on</v>

1007
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1008
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a good instances.</v>

1009
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.790
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with Patrion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of the Sargon of</v>

1010
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:29.330
<v Speaker 1>cod thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a podcast a long time ago,</v>

1011
00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months or so ago where he used the n</v>

1012
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:37.901
<v Speaker 1>word and the way he used it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually against white nationalists and</v>

1013
00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:45.341
<v Speaker 1>he also said a bunch of other stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided Patriot undecided that what</v>

1014
00:50:45.711 --> 00:50:50.711
<v Speaker 1>he said on a podcast was enough for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to remove him from the platform even</v>

1015
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:53.960
<v Speaker 1>though he didn't do anything on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

1016
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 1>That was agregious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also they had previously stated that</v>

1017
00:50:57.681 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 1>they were only judging things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred on their platform.</v>

1018
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 1>There's been a giant blow back because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1019
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:05.110
<v Speaker 1>because people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you're.</v>

1020
00:51:05.111 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially policing and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on his actions.</v>

1021
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Just on concepts and the communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was using,</v>

1022
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.840
<v Speaker 1>the way he was talking a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are eliminating him from being able</v>

1023
00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:22.841
<v Speaker 1>to make a living and that you are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because he does not fit into your</v>

1024
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.060
<v Speaker 1>political paradigm the way you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>view the world.</v>

1025
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 1>He views the world differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an opportunity for you to</v>

1026
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:30.980
<v Speaker 1>eliminate someone who you disagree with.</v>

1027
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know the nuances of their</v>

1028
00:51:34.651 --> 00:51:37.590
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like we have to pay attention to</v>

1029
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 2>folks who are using twitter to shut down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the voices of others.</v>

1030
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weaponized and we</v>

1031
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:50.010
<v Speaker 2>also have to pay attention to where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are using it that put other folks</v>

1032
00:51:50.011 --> 00:51:55.011
<v Speaker 2>in physical danger and that is where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be most severe,</v>

1033
00:51:55.291 --> 00:52:00.291
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise everyone has a right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>these technologies and I think they also</v>

1034
00:52:00.661 --> 00:52:05.661
<v Speaker 2>have a right to make sure that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very simple and open read of the rules</v>

1035
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:10.710
<v Speaker 2>and we're not in a great state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are rules and our enforcement can</v>

1036
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:12.330
<v Speaker 2>be extremely confusing to people.</v>

1037
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.800
<v Speaker 1>What has been the one thing that came up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was perhaps the most controversial,</v>

1038
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:21.801
<v Speaker 1>like I know my friend Sam Harris was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get you guys to ban Donald</v>

1039
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying if the fall,</v>

1040
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.490
<v Speaker 1>your terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did a podcast with him.</v>

1041
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should come out today or tomorrow.</v>

1042
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.610
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1043
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris.</v>

1044
00:52:32.011 --> 00:52:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I love him to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he was trying to do is like</v>

1045
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:35.700
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1046
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.940
<v Speaker 1>he's threatening nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's saying,</v>

1047
00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Hey Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bombs are bigger than your bombs.</v>

1048
00:52:41.641 --> 00:52:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Like what else does the guy have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you to remove them from the</v>

1049
00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:47.610
<v Speaker 1>platform?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you guys saw that,</v>

1050
00:52:47.611 --> 00:52:51.390
<v Speaker 1>what was your reaction to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there an internal discussion about</v>

1051
00:52:51.391 --> 00:52:53.880
<v Speaker 1>actually banning the president of United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States?</v>

1052
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the two things there.</v>

1053
00:52:56.941 --> 00:53:01.941
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the context that presidents of</v>

1054
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:05.970
<v Speaker 2>this country have you similar language</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different mediums.</v>

1055
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.590
<v Speaker 2>They use it on radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use it on television.</v>

1056
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:14.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not just through twitter and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were looking at you were to look</v>

1057
00:53:14.731 --> 00:53:19.590
<v Speaker 2>at the presidency of Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't exactly the same tone in this</v>

1058
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.460
<v Speaker 2>exact same language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were threats around the same</v>

1059
00:53:23.461 --> 00:53:27.420
<v Speaker 2>country and we to take that context into</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>

1060
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:32.450
<v Speaker 2>So the second thing is that we need the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most controversial aspect of our rules</v>

1061
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.140
<v Speaker 2>and our terms of services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the claws around public</v>

1062
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:44.781
<v Speaker 2>interest in newsworthiness where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful figures are public figures,</v>

1063
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 2>might be in violation of our terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>service,</v>

1064
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 2>but the tweet itself is of public</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

1065
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be a conversation around it</v>

1066
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:03.260
<v Speaker 2>and that is probably the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people disagree with the most.</v>

1067
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and where we have a lot of internal</v>

1068
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also have some pretty hard lines.</v>

1069
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 2>If we had a global leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the president of United</v>

1070
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a violent threat against a private</v>

1071
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would take action.</v>

1072
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always have to balance that with</v>

1073
00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:21.564
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a,</v>

1074
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.230
<v Speaker 2>is this something that the public has</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in?</v>

1075
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 2>In I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe generally the answer is yes.</v>

1076
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:30.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be in every case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally the answer is yes.</v>

1077
00:54:30.511 --> 00:54:35.511
<v Speaker 2>Because we should see how our leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>think and how they act in essentially</v>

1078
00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 2>forms voting that informs the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

1079
00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Then forms whether we think they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

1080
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the right job or we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1081
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:45.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be,</v>

1082
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 2>they should be voted out well.</v>

1083
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to see how someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses that platform and when someone uses</v>

1084
00:54:53.601 --> 00:54:57.740
<v Speaker 1>it the way he uses it and then becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and continues to use it that</v>

1085
00:54:57.741 --> 00:54:58.820
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when people are like,</v>

1086
00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:00.780
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been consistent and I think he,</v>

1087
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I think he joined</v>

1088
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.320
<v Speaker 2>then in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012 and you look at all of his tweets</v>

1089
00:55:05.321 --> 00:55:07.420
<v Speaker 2>all the way back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's pretty consistent.</v>

1090
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being he likes to insult people on</v>

1091
00:55:10.301 --> 00:55:11.860
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun for him.</v>

1092
00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:12.920
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

1093
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I never thought he would keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought once he became president maybe</v>

1094
00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:19.330
<v Speaker 1>just lock it down and try to do a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>job for the country and then,</v>

1095
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after four years or eight years,</v>

1096
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.970
<v Speaker 1>just go back to his old self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you fuck the world.</v>

1097
00:55:24.971 --> 00:55:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1098
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:27.730
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1099
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:32.020
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just in one way it's hilarious.</v>

1100
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:35.620
<v Speaker 1>See as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome because it's just,</v>

1101
00:55:35.621 --> 00:55:39.520
<v Speaker 1>it's so hilariously stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so preposterous.</v>

1102
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 1>That even has the time to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos is a fair and the fact that</v>

1103
00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.830
<v Speaker 1>he got caught with the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>enquirer,</v>

1104
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:50.120
<v Speaker 1>getting text messages and calls him Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bozos like,</v>

1105
00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.750
<v Speaker 1>don't you have shit to do man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As.</v>

1106
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.490
<v Speaker 1>But as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1107
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a gigantic fan of folly.</v>

1108
00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Almost a against my better judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching.</v>

1109
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:03.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1110
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I've watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching disasters.</v>

1111
00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I like watching chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see nonsense like that,</v>

1112
00:56:08.521 --> 00:56:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

1113
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm drawn like a motto flame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other part of me is like,</v>

1114
00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:19.381
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sets a very bizarre tone for the</v>

1115
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:24.600
<v Speaker 1>entire country because one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like Obama or hate Obama as he was</v>

1116
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 1>very measured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very articulate,</v>

1117
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:33.390
<v Speaker 1>obviously very well educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that aspect of his</v>

1118
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 1>presidency was very good for all of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he represented something that</v>

1119
00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:43.520
<v Speaker 1>was of a very high standard in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ability to communicate his access to</v>

1120
00:56:43.521 --> 00:56:47.170
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the way measured his words and</v>

1121
00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:50.170
<v Speaker 1>held himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's good for us.</v>

1122
00:56:50.171 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's just parishioner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's.</v>

1123
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:51.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1124
00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 1>look at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's better than me.</v>

1125
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1126
00:56:56.070 --> 00:57:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you lady see trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't talk better than me.</v>

1127
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't use twitter better.</v>

1128
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just this fucking madman.</v>

1129
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:08.780
<v Speaker 1>But isn't an important to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and to see it.</v>

1130
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that informs opinions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions 100 percent.</v>

1131
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my point is that this is this</v>

1132
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:20.191
<v Speaker 1>weird gray area where I think overall I</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely support your decision to not,</v>

1133
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 1>not banned him for violating your terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of service.</v>

1134
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.130
<v Speaker 1>We need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1135
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's</v>

1136
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:33.400
<v Speaker 1>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many accounts are bots,</v>

1137
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 1>how many [inaudible] do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many accounts are from a Russian</v>

1138
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.990
<v Speaker 1>troll farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that?</v>

1139
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.350
<v Speaker 2>So this is a real challenge and</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we're,</v>

1140
00:57:40.351 --> 00:57:43.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to wrap our heads around,</v>

1141
00:57:43.531 --> 00:57:47.910
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things we're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like let's scope the problem down a</v>

1142
00:57:47.911 --> 00:57:50.010
<v Speaker 2>bit and let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's use the technology we have</v>

1143
00:57:50.011 --> 00:57:51.960
<v Speaker 2>available to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like face Id,</v>

1144
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:55.260
<v Speaker 2>touch id,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the biometric stuff to identify the</v>

1145
00:57:55.261 --> 00:57:56.094
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

1146
00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's identify the humans first APP</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it face id is not really</v>

1147
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.290
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it available to you guys?</v>

1148
00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Did you know you just leave leaks?</v>

1149
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1150
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.230
<v Speaker 2>we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't used it yet.</v>

1151
00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:11.231
<v Speaker 2>But you can use it for things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this like a human operating this say</v>

1152
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you can use it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1153
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.440
<v Speaker 2>it's completely locked into the local</v>
<v Speaker 2>device.</v>

1154
00:58:15.441 --> 00:58:17.760
<v Speaker 2>We don't have access to images of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>face or whatnot,</v>

1155
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but the operating system can tell us</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the legit owner of this</v>

1156
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:28.850
<v Speaker 2>phone and therefore it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is human and technology always has to</v>

1157
00:58:28.851 --> 00:58:30.560
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will find ways around that and</v>

1158
00:58:30.561 --> 00:58:34.220
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we go the opposite direction and</v>

1159
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.070
<v Speaker 2>we look for the bots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with looking for the bots</v>

1160
00:58:37.071 --> 00:58:39.140
<v Speaker 2>boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people assume that they just come</v>

1161
00:58:39.141 --> 00:58:44.141
<v Speaker 2>through our api,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the scripting has become extremely</v>

1162
00:58:44.391 --> 00:58:46.740
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can script the APP,</v>

1163
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.860
<v Speaker 2>can script the website and make it look</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1164
00:58:48.861 --> 00:58:53.420
<v Speaker 2>very human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going after this problem first</v>

1165
00:58:53.421 --> 00:58:56.540
<v Speaker 2>trying to identify the humans as much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

1166
00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Utilizing these technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.140
<v Speaker 2>of this is live right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

1168
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:03.530
<v Speaker 2>these are considerations that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making and trying to understand like</v>

1169
00:59:03.531 --> 00:59:04.960
<v Speaker 2>what the impact would be and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1170
00:59:04.961 --> 00:59:06.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we might evolve it,</v>

1171
00:59:06.471 --> 00:59:11.471
<v Speaker 2>but we need to because that information</v>
<v Speaker 2>would provide context for someone like</v>

1172
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:16.790
<v Speaker 2>this is an actual human that I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to and I can invest more time in it</v>

1173
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:19.670
<v Speaker 2>where I can just ignore the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's meaningless.</v>

1174
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Now is apple to share that with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you,</v>

1175
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about biometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints or face,</v>

1176
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:30.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not the data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the operating system verifies</v>

1177
00:59:30.851 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 2>that there's an individual as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and it's unlocking know,</v>

1178
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1179
00:59:35.411 --> 00:59:36.131
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1180
00:59:36.131 --> 00:59:37.840
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you use the,</v>

1181
00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:39.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our cash app uses us,</v>

1182
00:59:39.761 --> 00:59:40.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So squares,</v>

1183
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:44.080
<v Speaker 2>cash APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you want to make a transfer to</v>

1184
00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:47.440
<v Speaker 2>someone when you want to send someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>money or when you want to buy Bitcoin,</v>

1185
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.340
<v Speaker 2>we turn on face id and you verify that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

1186
00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:55.120
<v Speaker 2>you and you are the owner of the phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it goes.</v>

1187
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:58.810
<v Speaker 2>We don't get images of your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't see who you are.</v>

1188
00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you want me to think.</v>

1189
01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how locked down by the operating</v>

1190
01:00:04.691 --> 01:00:06.330
<v Speaker 2>system and that's what it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1191
01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1192
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.940
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has there ever been any consideration to</v>

1193
01:00:09.941 --> 01:00:14.941
<v Speaker 2>not allowing people to post anonymously?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1194
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 2>like what you said earlier about</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists and whistleblowers that is</v>

1195
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.560
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>

1196
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.520
<v Speaker 2>So look at a look at platforms that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real names policy.</v>

1197
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Look at facebook or other problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any different.</v>

1198
01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because I don't go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for I understand there's a lot of</v>

1199
01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.930
<v Speaker 2>still a lot of arguing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same at a political argument if</v>

1200
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.540
<v Speaker 2>the same vectors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same patterns.</v>

1201
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I think older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like older in general it seems.</v>

1202
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I also am not really hanging out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems a little bit older.</v>

1203
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of grammys looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of their kids,</v>

1204
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>grandkids and stuff and that's what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was made for about.</v>

1205
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:52.330
<v Speaker 2>It's connecting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's connecting with the people that you</v>

1206
01:00:52.331 --> 01:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>know and that to me is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference for twitter.</v>

1207
01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:57.490
<v Speaker 2>It's connecting with the people you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what they find interesting</v>

1208
01:00:57.491 --> 01:01:00.070
<v Speaker 2>and like it's around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's around topics and stuff that you</v>

1209
01:01:00.071 --> 01:01:02.120
<v Speaker 2>find that you want to learn more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you saw it.</v>

1210
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg testifying and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in realizing like how this platform is</v>

1211
01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>being used and what are the dangers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1212
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and then you see these senators that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't know what the fuck the</v>

1213
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:19.211
<v Speaker 1>technology is or it's wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really highlights how we're set up to</v>

1214
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1215
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1216
01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>not just a gap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gap in the critical understanding of</v>

1217
01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:30.611
<v Speaker 1>how these things work and what they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how these really important</v>

1218
01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>politicians who are the ones who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>making these decisions as to whether or</v>

1219
01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>not someone has violated laws or whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not something should be curbed or</v>

1220
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really even understand what</v>

1221
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:43.814
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about.</v>

1222
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1223
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a few people do because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1224
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 2>they're not using it directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not using in the way that people</v>

1225
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:55.190
<v Speaker 2>are using it every single day and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the same experience that people</v>

1226
01:01:55.490 --> 01:02:00.490
<v Speaker 2>have every single day and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of regulatory and our</v>

1227
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 2>regulators and our government's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1228
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:04.904
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1229
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the conversation is often about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how regulators will come in and start</v>

1230
01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>writing rules and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and setting expectations for how</v>

1231
01:02:12.651 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 2>companies or services might behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a role for the company to</v>

1232
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:18.830
<v Speaker 2>educate and there's a role for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>company to,</v>

1233
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:24.260
<v Speaker 2>on like what technology makes possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be positive and also some of</v>

1234
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 2>the negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that become possible as well.</v>

1235
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 2>So I think we have a role to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>educate and to,</v>

1236
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>and to help make sure that we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1237
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:37.230
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pushing towards what I think the</v>

1238
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>job of regular regulator is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is number one,</v>

1239
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 2>protect the individual number to level</v>
<v Speaker 2>the playing field and make sure that</v>

1240
01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 2>those two things are not compromised by</v>
<v Speaker 2>special interests trying to protect</v>

1241
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:54.561
<v Speaker 2>their own domain or profits or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a dominance within a particular</v>

1242
01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

1243
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The playing field level,</v>

1244
01:02:57.530 --> 01:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>the playing field so that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an individual has the same opportunity,</v>

1245
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

1246
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.510
<v Speaker 2>someone else might have or a company</v>
<v Speaker 2>might have.</v>

1247
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1248
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>So like anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone,</v>

1249
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>anyone can have a twitter account and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1250
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.290
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1251
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.820
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1252
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an equal opportunity to contribute to it</v>

1253
01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 2>and whatever they do with it will change</v>
<v Speaker 2>the change the outcome.</v>

1254
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Some people might become very popular</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're saying stuff people want</v>

1255
01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:27.420
<v Speaker 2>to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people won't see any following</v>

1256
01:03:27.421 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever because they're not adding</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything original or interesting or,</v>

1257
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.160
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1258
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.050
<v Speaker 2>we're different in terms of perspective.</v>

1259
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Where do you see this going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at these kind of emerging</v>

1260
01:03:38.401 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily emerging anymore,</v>

1261
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>established now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

1262
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1263
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>a new thing in relative terms of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

1264
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.340
<v Speaker 1>where do you see this going and does it</v>
<v Speaker 1>get more intrusive?</v>

1265
01:03:50.341 --> 01:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Does it get deeper into our lives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

1266
01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at new technologies</v>

1267
01:03:54.991 --> 01:03:57.150
<v Speaker 1>like augmented reality and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines,</v>

1268
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:02.510
<v Speaker 1>do you see new possibilities and new</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to make things even more</v>

1269
01:04:02.731 --> 01:04:03.564
<v Speaker 1>complicated?</v>

1270
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:05.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1271
01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just have to assume the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1272
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.950
<v Speaker 2>we naturally use more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>

1273
01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>More and more things become open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More and more things,</v>

1274
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase their velocity.</v>

1275
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>There's more communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not less like this is not going away and</v>

1276
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a question of what we do with</v>

1277
01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:26.400
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where,</v>

1278
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 2>where I want it to go as an where I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter specifically to go is I,</v>

1279
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1280
01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's existential right now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1281
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.130
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have global conversations about some</v>

1282
01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:43.960
<v Speaker 2>things that will become crisis climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>change being one of them.</v>

1283
01:04:43.961 --> 01:04:47.260
<v Speaker 2>There was no one nation state that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to solve that problem alone.</v>

1284
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Economic disparity being another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the rise of Ai and a job</v>

1285
01:04:53.381 --> 01:04:57.190
<v Speaker 2>displacement and just like us offloading</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions to these,</v>

1286
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.660
<v Speaker 2>to these algorithms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the things that,</v>

1287
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>that no one nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one community is going to solve</v>

1288
01:05:03.611 --> 01:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes the entire world to do so,</v>

1289
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:10.651
<v Speaker 2>so I want to make sure that we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>our best to get people seeing these</v>

1290
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>global conversations and ideally</v>
<v Speaker 2>participating in them because it helps.</v>

1291
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:20.250
<v Speaker 2>It helps us solve the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just believe that more open society</v>

1292
01:05:21.341 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>allows us to solve problems much faster.</v>

1293
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So you in many ways see twitter is</v>
<v Speaker 1>having some sort of a social</v>

1294
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:30.200
<v Speaker 1>responsibility in this.</v>

1295
01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1296
01:05:31.491 --> 01:05:32.241
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:05:32.241 --> 01:05:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And I think a big part of is like right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1298
01:05:35.241 --> 01:05:39.110
<v Speaker 2>like how are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are we ensuring that there is more</v>

1299
01:05:39.111 --> 01:05:44.111
<v Speaker 2>healthy contribution to that global</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and you know,</v>

1300
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's so critical that we</v>

1301
01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:50.210
<v Speaker 2>start talking about the things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing all of us,</v>

1302
01:05:50.211 --> 01:05:54.710
<v Speaker 2>not just one nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think you know that that's where</v>

1303
01:05:54.711 --> 01:05:59.711
<v Speaker 2>our current model really puts the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a disadvantage because it</v>

1304
01:05:59.961 --> 01:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>incentivizes more of the elk echo</v>
<v Speaker 2>chambers,</v>

1305
01:06:03.861 --> 01:06:07.820
<v Speaker 2>which lead to things like nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of taking the broader picture</v>

1306
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:11.150
<v Speaker 2>and looking at what's happening around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to all people,</v>

1307
01:06:11.151 --> 01:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>to all of humanity,</v>

1308
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 1>what do you do though to balance the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation or what responsibility do</v>

1309
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you think you have to balance the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in terms of the way</v>

1310
01:06:19.631 --> 01:06:23.080
<v Speaker 1>conservatives view it versus the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals and progressives view it?</v>

1311
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows there,</v>

1312
01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>is there a responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a responsibility or is it</v>

1313
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 1>just leave it up to the people and let</v>
<v Speaker 1>them figure it out the same way they</v>

1314
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 1>figured out hashtags and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1315
01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a responsibility to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it easier to do that easier.</v>

1316
01:06:38.701 --> 01:06:39.850
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now it's just.</v>

1317
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most most people will not venture</v>

1318
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>outside their mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>

1319
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.430
<v Speaker 2>They will not venture out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will not break their bubble,</v>

1320
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 2>but if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's right now on the surface,</v>

1321
01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:53.040
<v Speaker 2>it's just so hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1322
01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I can only follow accounts and I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1323
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I have to look into and just imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1324
01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:02.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get an understanding of your</v>

1325
01:07:02.881 --> 01:07:06.150
<v Speaker 2>own politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can't just look at your bio,</v>

1326
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.860
<v Speaker 2>they have to look through all your</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweets,</v>

1327
01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:10.020
<v Speaker 2>they have to listen to a bunch of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and whatnot.</v>

1328
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's a bunch of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we shifted more towards topics and</v>

1329
01:07:14.851 --> 01:07:19.230
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least we have the potential to see a</v>

1330
01:07:19.231 --> 01:07:20.950
<v Speaker 2>bunch more perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see.</v>

1331
01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The simplest thing as like follow a</v>

1332
01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow a topic,</v>

1333
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.260
<v Speaker 2>like why can't you just follow warriors</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter or uh,</v>

1334
01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:31.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBA,</v>

1335
01:07:31.741 --> 01:07:34.380
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you have to go and find all the</v>

1336
01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:37.590
<v Speaker 2>coaches and the players and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the team.</v>

1337
01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.370
<v Speaker 2>So we can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can help make that a whole lot easier</v>

1338
01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:41.880
<v Speaker 2>for folks.</v>

1339
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So there's something like brexit or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1340
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to Hashtag Brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get the whole</v>

1341
01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:49.230
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get the pros,</v>

1342
01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.520
<v Speaker 1>the cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

1343
01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:51.810
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal,</v>

1344
01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>the centrists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get everybody versus</v>

1345
01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:58.170
<v Speaker 1>following the people that you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow that agree with what you think</v>

1346
01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:00.590
<v Speaker 2>the probability is higher that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get more,</v>

1347
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you'll get more variety of perspectives</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even doesn't even follow Brexit,</v>

1348
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>follow vote leave if you want to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within that topic there might be</v>

1349
01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:13.610
<v Speaker 2>some dissenting opinions and you get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose whether you those inform you,</v>

1350
01:08:13.611 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>whether that emboldens your or not,</v>

1351
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>but and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1352
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that we should force that</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon it,</v>

1353
01:08:19.581 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's not easy to even do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1354
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:26.740
<v Speaker 1>The only tool we give you is finding and</v>
<v Speaker 1>following the accounts and that's what</v>

1355
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.840
<v Speaker 1>people search hashtags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do search,</v>

1356
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

1357
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>They send the timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a small percentage of</v>

1358
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>people that people that really know</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter know how to do that,</v>

1359
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.940
<v Speaker 1>but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they follow an account and they stand</v>

1360
01:08:38.941 --> 01:08:41.780
<v Speaker 1>the timeline and what their world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their timeline.</v>

1361
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Hashtags can be corrupted to totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be gamed.</v>

1362
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It can be gamed and taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took over Hashtag Vegan cat go to and</v>

1363
01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:51.741
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

1364
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's mine.</v>

1365
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:54.104
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1366
01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 1>My last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last Netflix special about a woman</v>

1367
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:01.610
<v Speaker 1>who said a bunch of horrible things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1368
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I put a picture up on instagram</v>

1369
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:07.160
<v Speaker 1>of some deer meat and I wrote this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>some meat from a deer that liked to kick</v>

1370
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>babies and was about to join isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote Hashtag Vegan,</v>

1371
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.230
<v Speaker 1>which was a mistake right to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Vegan,</v>

1372
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:18.440
<v Speaker 1>but the Hashtag Vegan people went</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy and came after me because</v>

1373
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I entered into their timeline with meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>hashtag vegan cat.</v>

1374
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all either pictures of see like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>says Joe Rogan right up.</v>

1375

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't laughed that hard to while</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's people that are feeding their</v>

1377
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:35.930

<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

1378
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 1>And I in the specialist say every cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like it's living in a house with a</v>

1379
01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 1>gas leak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're all like laying down like</v>

1380
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck is the real food?</v>

1381
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 1>But this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is just a conversation to</v>

1382
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.103
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

1383
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:53.110
<v Speaker 1>if someone does something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can like pick a person,</v>

1384
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that person is,</v>

1385
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:56.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1386
01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:59.420
<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have a Hashtag that they utilize</v>

1387
01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:01.280
<v Speaker 1>all the time for their movement or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1388
01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 1>someone could mock them and then use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1389
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a public figure or someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got a prominent voice,</v>

1390
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:11.570
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden that Hashtag</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes people just take it over and</v>

1391
01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 1>start mocking them with that Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it has to be done in mass.</v>

1392
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be coordinated.</v>

1393
01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes people like figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to gain the system and coordinate it in</v>

1394
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amplify that message in an unfair way.</v>

1395
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what,</v>

1396
01:10:22.911 --> 01:10:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what our systems are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize.</v>

1397
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>How sick did that cat look?</v>

1398
01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a real one.</v>

1399
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>That was a real Hashtag Vegan cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1400
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Support Bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1401
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:38.120
<v Speaker 1>so when you look back at emerging social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

1402
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:43.150
<v Speaker 1>like we go all the way back to my space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my space,</v>

1403
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.690
<v Speaker 1>you got Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom was sitting there and you're in your</v>

1404
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>top eight and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would like post music that they</v>

1405
01:10:50.031 --> 01:10:55.031
<v Speaker 1>liked and it was never political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very often very surface.</v>

1406
01:10:55.671 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 1>And for comics it was a great way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote shows and it was,</v>

1407
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting way to see things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

1408
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:08.480
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the seed that became twitter or</v>

1409
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:10.970
<v Speaker 1>facebook or any of these is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

1410
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>at least for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we got more of our roots from</v>

1411
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 2>aol instant messenger and Icq Icq</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was,</v>

1412
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember the status message where</v>

1413
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a meeting or I'm listening to</v>

1414
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.330
<v Speaker 2>music or watching a movie right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the inspiration.</v>

1415
01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 2>And what we took from that was being</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>

1416
01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:31.680
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could do that from anywhere,</v>

1417
01:11:31.681 --> 01:11:33.600
<v Speaker 2>not bound to a desk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could do that from anywhere.</v>

1418
01:11:33.601 --> 01:11:36.030
<v Speaker 2>And you could do it from your phone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just be roaming around and</v>

1419
01:11:36.031 --> 01:11:37.140
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1420
01:11:37.141 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at Joe Rogan's,</v>

1421
01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studio right now,</v>

1422
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>that is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need my computer.</v>

1423
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bound to this chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this desk.</v>

1424
01:11:44.671 --> 01:11:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it from anywhere.</v>

1425
01:11:46.441 --> 01:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>And then the other aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1426
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 2>in some messenger was of course chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that the status</v>

1427
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:56.200
<v Speaker 2>would do is you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say like,</v>

1428
01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to Kendrick Lamar right</v>

1429
01:11:57.601 --> 01:12:00.360
<v Speaker 2>now and I might hit you up on chat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

1430
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of the new album?</v>

1431
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.930
<v Speaker 2>But now it's all public so everyone can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>

1432
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.700
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the biggest difference in the.</v>

1433
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:10.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me is what twitter is.</v>

1434
01:12:10.781 --> 01:12:13.830
<v Speaker 2>It might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my space was,</v>

1435
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:18.860
<v Speaker 2>it was profiles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people organized around these profiles</v>

1436
01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this network that develop between</v>

1437
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:23.730
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is facebook,</v>

1438
01:12:23.731 --> 01:12:27.630
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook optimized the hell out of that.</v>

1439
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:30.730
<v Speaker 2>And they scaled the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1440
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.690
<v Speaker 2>we were something very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1441
01:12:33.691 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1442
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.940
<v Speaker 2>we started with a simple status and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wanted to talk about it and we,</v>

1443
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.950
<v Speaker 2>we decided that it should be on the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>

1444
01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be suburbian to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1445
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 2>to the status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be part of that flow.</v>

1446
01:12:47.011 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes twitter so fluid.</v>

1447
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Now when you look at this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>metamorphosis,</v>

1448
01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>this evolution between those initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>

1449
01:12:57.011 --> 01:13:01.030
<v Speaker 1>whether it's aol instant messenger that</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually became Lux Icq.</v>

1450
01:13:01.031 --> 01:13:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And what was that one that we would use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gamers would use?</v>

1451
01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:10.170
<v Speaker 1>That it was like a all live stream sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of message board</v>

1452
01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 1>for awhile people were using teamspeak</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

1453
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>No it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't,</v>

1454
01:13:16.481 --> 01:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't teamspeak it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like you would go there and share</v>

1455
01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>files and stuff and people would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

1456
01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.860
<v Speaker 1>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I used to play a lot of online</v>

1457
01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:30.880
<v Speaker 1>video games and we play on teams and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have teams go play other teams and he</v>

1458
01:13:30.881 --> 01:13:34.690
<v Speaker 1>would use this sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1459
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.720
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a message board because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>all in real time.</v>

1460
01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.830
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1461
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>

1462
01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1463
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>guys would go there and you could send</v>
<v Speaker 1>people files through it and teams would</v>

1464
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:54.850
<v Speaker 1>go and meet and it would be a chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an online chat that would be in</v>

1465
01:13:54.851 --> 01:13:55.470
<v Speaker 1>real time.</v>

1466
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1467
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have a lot of our roots and</v>

1468
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:01.530
<v Speaker 2>aol instant messenger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also like IRC Internet relay chat</v>

1469
01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:03.590
<v Speaker 2>and use nut which were the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1470
01:14:03.591 --> 01:14:06.570
<v Speaker 2>these old internet seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies is what I was talking</v>

1471
01:14:06.571 --> 01:14:07.250
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IRC.</v>

1472
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1473
01:14:07.771 --> 01:14:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1474
01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Internet relay chat is,</v>

1475
01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>is like this giant room that anyone can</v>
<v Speaker 2>join and so range around topics and</v>

1476
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what's interesting about that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see people typing,</v>

1477
01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.510
<v Speaker 1>see it occurring in real time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it popping up in real time,</v>

1478
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

1479
01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.400
<v Speaker 1>just wonder like what is the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of this?</v>

1480
01:14:28.401 --> 01:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Because because no one saw anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>going from ICQ to twitter,</v>

1481
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>no one saw anything going from that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram and to where we're at right</v>

1482
01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>now where it really does flavor the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation of our entire culture.</v>

1483
01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it was just a thing that was</v>

1484
01:14:42.641 --> 01:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>happening that was happening on people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>

1485
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a thing that's happening on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's computers and now phones and</v>

1486
01:14:48.491 --> 01:14:51.090
<v Speaker 1>now your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1487
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very different influence and I</v>

1488
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 1>wonder because everything does</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate things constantly move</v>

1489
01:14:58.151 --> 01:15:03.151
<v Speaker 1>forward and become more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more integrated into our life</v>

1490
01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder what is the next stage of</v>

1491
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:08.524
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

1492
01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:12.620
<v Speaker 2>if I mean like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secular trends and you know,</v>

1493
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 2>you look at technology and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies like blockchain for</v>

1494
01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

1495
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1496
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.820
<v Speaker 2>we're moving to a world where anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>created exists forever,</v>

1497
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:26.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no centralized control over</v>

1498
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.170
<v Speaker 2>who sees what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1499
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1500
01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:31.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1501
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.450
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these models become completely</v>

1502
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:38.590
<v Speaker 2>decentralized and all these barriers</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

1503
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that exist today aren't as important</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1504
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Something like Gab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gab seems to be a response to the fact</v>

1505
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>that some people are getting banned from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other platforms and they're just</v>

1506
01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:54.760
<v Speaker 1>allowing anybody to come on and say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything they want.</v>

1507
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 1>The downside of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the most horrible people are</v>

1508
01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:01.750
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to say anything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want with no repercussions.</v>

1509
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.660
<v Speaker 1>The good side is anybody can say</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want.</v>

1510
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't studied them too much,</v>

1511
01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that they have taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>action on accounts as well.</v>

1512
01:16:09.641 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 2>They have suspended accounts and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have a terms of service as well,</v>

1513
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 2>what are they suspended accounts for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1514
01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:18.400
<v Speaker 2>It's probably conduct related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably,</v>

1515
01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:21.160
<v Speaker 2>it might be doxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably right,</v>

1516
01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a question of like,</v>

1517
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules and if you agree to the rules</v>

1518
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:30.631
<v Speaker 2>then you sign up for the service and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not there will be other services.</v>

1519
01:16:32.351 --> 01:16:37.351
<v Speaker 2>But like if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the trends and I think um,</v>

1520
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:41.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly things become a lot more</v>

1521
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.650
<v Speaker 2>public and certainly things become a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>more open.</v>

1522
01:16:44.651 --> 01:16:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Certainly the berries and the boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have in place today become less</v>

1523
01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and I think there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>positives in that.</v>

1524
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think there's a lot of danger</v>

1525
01:16:55.841 --> 01:16:58.520
<v Speaker 2>that we need to be mindful of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you as a ceo,</v>

1526
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:01.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a guy who's running this thing,</v>

1527
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1528
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Is the experience been like for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I got to imagine that it wasn't</v>

1529
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.090
<v Speaker 1>anything that you predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1530
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:10.063
<v Speaker 1>Predicted twitter,</v>

1531
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.220
<v Speaker 2>So to all the sudden have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

1533
01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.840
<v Speaker 2>what are changing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>

1534
01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 2>And you're a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

1535
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Forty two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's young to be in control of that</v>

1536
01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:25.781
<v Speaker 2>much and to have it over the time of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has it been 11 years or 10 years</v>

1537
01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:28.540
<v Speaker 2>old?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're 13 and Marcela.</v>

1538
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were really fucking young,</v>

1539
01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.930
<v Speaker 2>like what has that been like for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a,</v>

1540
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:39.800
<v Speaker 2>it's been both beautiful and scary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable and learning.</v>

1541
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just been a ton of learning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolving and it shows me every single</v>

1542
01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:47.960
<v Speaker 2>day where I need to push myself and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1543
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a big part is just the</v>

1544
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 2>realization that we're not gonna be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this alone.</v>

1545
01:17:53.901 --> 01:17:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think we have to either the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

1546
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:58.250
<v Speaker 2>these are what the technologies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to allow us,</v>

1547
01:17:58.251 --> 01:18:01.910
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we have to have all the answers</v>

1548
01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:06.890
<v Speaker 2>around enforcement or policy when we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to serve the world,</v>

1549
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:10.640
<v Speaker 2>we have aspirations to serve every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single person on the planet and we have</v>

1550
01:18:10.641 --> 01:18:12.670
<v Speaker 2>aspirations to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1551
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:17.030
<v Speaker 2>be the first consideration for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>global public conversation.</v>

1552
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1553
01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 2>if we're the bottleneck for all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to reach those</v>

1554
01:18:23.001 --> 01:18:26.600
<v Speaker 2>aspirations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just thinking deeply about how we</v>

1555
01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:31.601
<v Speaker 2>might distribute more of this work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>decentralize more of it and look at look</v>

1556
01:18:32.901 --> 01:18:37.901
<v Speaker 2>at the platform itself and like what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to change to reach that reality.</v>

1557
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:40.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think we got to look really</v>
<v Speaker 2>deepened.</v>

1558
01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Foundational that it goes back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:18:43.201 --> 01:18:43.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1560
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 2>your question on 1:40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we saw was,</v>

1561
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1562
01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.850
<v Speaker 2>we shifted to 280 characters and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1563
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:53.790
<v Speaker 2>there's 140 characters is so sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1564
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became this cultural thing and I was</v>

1565
01:18:57.651 --> 01:18:59.540
<v Speaker 2>in love with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so many people are in love with it,</v>

1566
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things we noticed as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>move to two 80 is that the vast majority</v>

1567
01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 2>of tweets that are broadcasts don't go</v>
<v Speaker 2>above 1:40 even with that limitation</v>

1568
01:19:10.971 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 2>raced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where they do go above a 1:40 is in</v>

1569
01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:19.430
<v Speaker 2>replies when people reply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to go over the hundred 40</v>

1570
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:24.330
<v Speaker 2>character limit and even bump up into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two to 80 limit and what it allowed,</v>

1571
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:28.520
<v Speaker 2>what we've seen it allow us just more</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuance in the conversation and allows</v>

1572
01:19:28.521 --> 01:19:31.490
<v Speaker 2>people to give more context and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1573
01:19:31.491 --> 01:19:34.670
<v Speaker 2>and kind of just get their experience on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table a little bit more,</v>

1574
01:19:34.671 --> 01:19:37.190
<v Speaker 2>whereas 1:40 did not allow that.</v>

1575
01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have seen that increase the health of</v>

1576
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 2>those conversations and the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's stuff like that that we need to</v>

1577
01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:46.850
<v Speaker 2>question and not hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1578
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 2>so sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any consideration to expanding</v>

1579
01:19:49.461 --> 01:19:51.030
<v Speaker 2>it further?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1580
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:53.000
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now we were about a million</v>

1581
01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:54.540
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1582
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have edit tweets right now.</v>

1583
01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:59.240
<v Speaker 2>So we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good or bad.</v>

1584
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't edit a 140 characters,</v>

1585
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.880
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be really pissed off if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you write a million characters in cad.</v>

1586
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I would like,</v>

1587
01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I would like the ability to edit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you make a typo or something</v>

1588
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the ability for people to see</v>

1589
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:14.860
<v Speaker 2>the original like edit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see the original.</v>

1590
01:20:14.861 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's say we're looking at exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1591
01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason we don't have it in the first</v>

1592
01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 2>place is we were born on sms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were born on text messaging.</v>

1593
01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:24.690
<v Speaker 2>When you send a tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't take it back.</v>

1594
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you send a tweet,</v>

1595
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 2>it goes to the world instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it back.</v>

1596
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:32.910
<v Speaker 2>So when we have to exist anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1597
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.800
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you send someone something,</v>

1598
01:20:34.801 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>even if you're on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna know the original.</v>

1599
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they screenshot it and they do their</v>

1600
01:20:39.811 --> 01:20:42.660
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you could build it such that,</v>

1601
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we introduce a five second to 32nd</v>

1602
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:50.220
<v Speaker 2>delay in the sending and within that</v>
<v Speaker 2>window you can edit.</v>

1603
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to need more time than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

1604
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:56.010
<v Speaker 2>If I fucked something up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like someone has to tell me,</v>

1605
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.950
<v Speaker 2>but did you misspelled that word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1606
01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Did I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

1607
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.730
<v Speaker 2>The issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Autocorrect gets you totally,</v>

1608
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 2>but the issue with going longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1609
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 2>it takes that real time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature of the conversation will flow out</v>

1610
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.244
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1611
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Then we're delaying these tweets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're watching UFC,</v>

1612
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 2>are you watching like warriors</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball?</v>

1613
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 2>A lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the great twitter is just like</v>

1614
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:18.180
<v Speaker 2>in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like you know,</v>

1615
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the roar of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1616
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking across a at someone you're in</v>

1617
01:21:22.951 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 2>this virtual stadium with and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>

1618
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shot.</v>

1619
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Can you believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this isn't clarity more important</v>

1620
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:33.370
<v Speaker 2>because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the context that you still</v>

1621
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:37.530
<v Speaker 2>have the ability to communicate quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also have the ability to</v>

1622
01:21:37.531 --> 01:21:38.420
<v Speaker 2>clarify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1623
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:41.970
<v Speaker 2>that's where we need to really pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention because</v>

1624
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the context of an NBA game,</v>

1625
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you want to be fast and you just won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to moment and you just,</v>

1626
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:51.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be raw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're in the context of</v>

1627
01:21:51.751 --> 01:21:55.800
<v Speaker 2>considering what the president just did</v>
<v Speaker 2>or making a particular statement,</v>

1628
01:21:55.801 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 2>then you probably need some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some more time and we can be dynamic</v>

1629
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:00.180
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1630
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.700
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me is how few</v>
<v Speaker 2>people use video.</v>

1631
01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought when you guys have video</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter,</v>

1632
01:22:06.481 --> 01:22:06.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1633
01:22:06.871 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people going to be making</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and putting those up on twitter</v>

1634
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that often.</v>

1635
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.290
<v Speaker 2>It depends on who you follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge for some aspects of twitter.</v>

1636
01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1637
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less so in others,</v>

1638
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but aspects is huge for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>

1639
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:24.060
<v Speaker 2>a lot of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we see a lot of like just the</v>

1640
01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 2>replays and the recaps for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1641
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 2>aspects of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a particular shot that people want to</v>

1642
01:22:30.301 --> 01:22:31.740
<v Speaker 2>comment on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>

1643
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's dangerous for us to focus</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much on the medium,</v>

1644
01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.970
<v Speaker 2>whether it be images or gifts or video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1645
01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.420
<v Speaker 2>it's more about the conversation around</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1646
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:44.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what we want to optimize for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely very popular for sports</v>

1647
01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:46.200
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and folly.</v>

1648
01:22:46.201 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's uh,</v>

1649
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.833
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1650
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:51.570
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of animal attack videos.</v>

1651
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature is metals a good one and hold my</v>

1652
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 2>beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another good one.</v>

1653
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I meant was people making a</v>

1654
01:23:02.641 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 2>video talking about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was trying</v>

1655
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.470
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think is this and that and blah</v>

1656
01:23:08.471 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see a lot of that.</v>

1657
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And I thought maybe that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that people would adopt more.</v>

1658
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Two different speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like the,</v>

1659
01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 2>the consumption of video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see this in the technology</v>

1660
01:23:19.121 --> 01:23:21.760
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are subtitling every single</v>

1661
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 2>video because people might be in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where they can't turn the</v>

1662
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>audio on or like a video like I have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrub through to see what's interesting</v>

1663
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>like it with text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just see it and it allows for a</v>

1664
01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:36.940
<v Speaker 2>lot of serendipity to find something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I probably wouldn't have seen</v>

1665
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 2>unless I watched the whole damn video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the ability to clip something,</v>

1666
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:44.350
<v Speaker 2>the ability to like index in I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really critical.</v>

1667
01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:45.580
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1668
01:23:45.581 --> 01:23:48.430
<v Speaker 2>it's not about the format,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the use case in the context</v>

1669
01:23:48.431 --> 01:23:49.264
<v Speaker 2>that you're in</v>

1670
01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.220
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the responsibility that</v>

1671
01:23:52.221 --> 01:23:57.221
<v Speaker 1>you guys have and you in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when this became what it is now and</v>

1672
01:23:59.391 --> 01:24:04.391
<v Speaker 1>when it became evident that it became</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic way of changing the way</v>

1673
01:24:06.171 --> 01:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>human beings communicate with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1674
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Was there ever any regret or was there a</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment where you're like,</v>

1675
01:24:12.861 --> 01:24:15.110
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck have I gotten myself into?</v>

1676
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.823
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1677
01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 2>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always reflective of where I am and what</v>

1678
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:25.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1679
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest has been around,</v>

1680
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twofold.</v>

1681
01:24:30.971 --> 01:24:35.971
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the dynamics of the service allow it</v>

1682
01:24:36.551 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 2>to be weaponized in order to silence</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else or to drive them off the</v>

1683
01:24:40.421 --> 01:24:44.080
<v Speaker 2>surface entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which goes against the entire concept of</v>

1684
01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:47.120
<v Speaker 2>free speech and free participation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

1685
01:24:47.121 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just can't stand for that.</v>

1686
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.941
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1687
01:24:50.941 --> 01:24:55.480
<v Speaker 2>we need to make sure that everyone feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have an opportunity at a voice</v>

1688
01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:57.940
<v Speaker 2>and when you have these coordinated</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks,</v>

1689
01:24:57.941 --> 01:24:58.481
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1690
01:24:58.481 --> 01:25:01.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second is around,</v>

1691
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1692
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.870
<v Speaker 2>this concept of an echo chamber and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>filter bubble.</v>

1693
01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:05.471
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1694
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel personally good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel.</v>

1695
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we thought that through enough.</v>

1696
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:17.310
<v Speaker 2>In the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should have moved a,</v>

1697
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.520
<v Speaker 2>towards biasing the service towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>topics and interests much,</v>

1698
01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:24.370
<v Speaker 2>much sooner than we are now considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing</v>

1699
01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have these considerations,</v>

1700
01:25:26.131 --> 01:25:29.550
<v Speaker 1>when you take these actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you consult with psychologists or</v>

1701
01:25:29.551 --> 01:25:34.500
<v Speaker 1>sociologists or historians or people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that try to put in perspective for you?</v>

1702
01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:37.500
<v Speaker 1>What the ramifications of each</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual move would be?</v>

1703
01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I try to read as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to talk to as many people as</v>

1704
01:25:41.431 --> 01:25:43.080
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get completely different</v>

1705
01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:45.870
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is there any internal disagreement</v>

1706
01:25:45.871 --> 01:25:47.790
<v Speaker 2>about actions that you take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1707
01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:48.810
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>

1708
01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.790
<v Speaker 2>there's always debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always debate,</v>

1709
01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:54.630
<v Speaker 2>but I think my role is to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask questions and make sure like,</v>

1710
01:25:54.631 --> 01:25:56.520
<v Speaker 2>are like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is our goal here?</v>

1711
01:25:56.521 --> 01:25:58.860
<v Speaker 2>What are we trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1712
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that evolves that,</v>

1713
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 2>that evolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evolves like,</v>

1714
01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 2>and is this over the long term going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a net positive for all humans,</v>

1715
01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all humanity.</v>

1716
01:26:11.241 --> 01:26:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Like how do we balance the</v>
<v Speaker 2>considerations of,</v>

1717
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>of how we serve everyone and like how do</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get down to something,</v>

1718
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:21.200
<v Speaker 2>how do we get down to a fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>answering the central answer?</v>

1719
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And that to me is where the real truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when you can get to something</v>

1720
01:26:25.611 --> 01:26:27.770
<v Speaker 2>foundational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like,</v>

1721
01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like having conversations with as many</v>

1722
01:26:31.341 --> 01:26:35.570
<v Speaker 2>people from as many different fields as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and getting their perspective</v>

1723
01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I asked questions all the time.</v>

1724
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:39.390
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting the way you're phrasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this too,</v>

1725
01:26:39.391 --> 01:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are looking at this as a method to</v>

1726
01:26:44.071 --> 01:26:45.700
<v Speaker 1>save or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1727
01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.760
<v Speaker 1>to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to serve people.</v>

1728
01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.080
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at this as a way that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can benefit society.</v>

1729
01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:54.090
<v Speaker 1>The society can benefit from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>

1730
01:26:54.091 --> 01:26:57.120
<v Speaker 1>can benefit from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ability to communicate,</v>

1731
01:26:57.810 --> 01:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just looking at it as a tech</v>

1732
01:27:00.001 --> 01:27:04.560
<v Speaker 1>company that has to remain profitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the more interesting</v>

1733
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:07.290
<v Speaker 1>things about tech companies to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1734
01:27:07.291 --> 01:27:10.980
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of criticism maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>justified in some ways the tech</v>

1735
01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>companies all lean left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is interesting to me is that</v>

1736
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 1>name another corporation that willingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>have its own choice,</v>

1737
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:28.910
<v Speaker 1>takes that into consideration that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to serve the world and surf culture</v>

1738
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:33.540
<v Speaker 1>in a beneficial way regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

1739
01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1740
01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.600
<v Speaker 1>because you're not really selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1741
01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:38.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have a platform,</v>

1742
01:27:38.641 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's financially viable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

1743
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:43.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not selling things.</v>

1744
01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1745
01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:45.820
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1746
01:27:45.821 --> 01:27:48.370
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do our models based off people's</v>

1747
01:27:48.371 --> 01:27:49.204
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And they're paying us with our attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's extremely valuable and</v>

1749
01:27:55.091 --> 01:27:57.460
<v Speaker 2>something that we need to really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really honor.</v>

1750
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I agree with you.</v>

1751
01:27:59.381 --> 01:28:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

1752
01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.840
<v Speaker 2>look at Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1753
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I just listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1754
01:28:04.661 --> 01:28:05.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1755
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recent earnings call on.</v>

1756
01:28:07.421 --> 01:28:09.970
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1757
01:28:09.971 --> 01:28:11.640
<v Speaker 2>there are two reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1758
01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:15.400
<v Speaker 2>for Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one is to advance,</v>

1759
01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1760
01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different sources of energy and more</v>

1761
01:28:21.041 --> 01:28:26.041
<v Speaker 2>renewable sources of energy because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental and existential crisis</v>

1762
01:28:26.651 --> 01:28:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that's facing all humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And number two is to advance autonomy</v>

1763
01:28:31.121 --> 01:28:33.730
<v Speaker 2>because it'll save lives and give people</v>
<v Speaker 2>time back.</v>

1764
01:28:33.731 --> 01:28:38.731
<v Speaker 2>And then you started talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make that possible and that's where</v>

1765
01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.430
<v Speaker 2>our business comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we,</v>

1766
01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.040
<v Speaker 2>how do we make that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

1767
01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:45.850
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1768
01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:47.380
<v Speaker 2>we have a great business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1769
01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.790
<v Speaker 2>we need to improve all bunch of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

1770
01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:53.980
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it serves what we think our larger</v>

1771
01:28:53.981 --> 01:28:55.750
<v Speaker 2>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is serving the public</v>

1772
01:28:55.751 --> 01:28:58.750
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to see more global public</v>

1773
01:28:58.751 --> 01:28:59.930
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to,</v>

1774
01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>we want technology to be used to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world feel a lot smaller,</v>

1775
01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>to help see what common problems we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>before us.</v>

1776
01:29:07.891 --> 01:29:09.720
<v Speaker 2>And ideally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1777
01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we can get people together to solve</v>

1778
01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:13.560
<v Speaker 2>them faster and solve them better.</v>

1779
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:17.050
<v Speaker 1>You also seem to be embracing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that you're,</v>

1780
01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you're helping to evolve culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is part of the pro providing</v>

1781
01:29:21.871 --> 01:29:24.450
<v Speaker 1>this method of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of communication,</v>

1782
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>rather it's helping to evolve culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>

1783
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:33.860
<v Speaker 1>this is something that is really only</v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable to tech companies in some</v>

1784
01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:39.750
<v Speaker 1>strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird that so many of them have</v>

1785
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.410
<v Speaker 1>share this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was personally a little weirded</v>

1786
01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 1>out when Google took out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be evil.</v>

1787
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a big part of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating model.</v>

1788
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Take that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1789
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:52.410
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1790
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Make sure I don't want to get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they removed that from.</v>

1791
01:29:58.051 --> 01:29:59.100
<v Speaker 1>What would the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you call that?</v>

1792
01:29:59.101 --> 01:30:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their operational directive.</v>

1793
01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the code of conduct code of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct and it's not there anymore.</v>

1794
01:30:07.591 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're moved it.</v>

1795
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So the other article that says they</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed the clause and</v>

1796
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:15.070
<v Speaker 2>a weird thing to tell people not to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>

1797
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.280
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did it take it out once you've</v>

1798
01:30:17.281 --> 01:30:21.090
<v Speaker 1>already said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way weirder to say fuck it,</v>

1799
01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:23.370
<v Speaker 1>we were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was another way of saying that they</v>

1800
01:30:23.371 --> 01:30:25.190
<v Speaker 1>changed it to do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

1802
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:31.260
<v Speaker 1>The fuck does do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean do the right thing so you can make</v>

1803
01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 1>more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1804
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:33.631
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1805
01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:35.040
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do the right thing.</v>

1806
01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It makes more money.</v>

1807
01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1808
01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:37.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1809
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that's why like that's why this openness</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so critical.</v>

1810
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like the public comment to</v>

1811
01:30:42.681 --> 01:30:44.240
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public conversation is so important</v>

1812
01:30:44.241 --> 01:30:48.650
<v Speaker 2>is we can talk about stuff like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be companies forming today</v>

1813
01:30:48.651 --> 01:30:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that look at um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectives and mandates like that and</v>

1814
01:30:52.521 --> 01:30:57.260
<v Speaker 2>base their whole culture around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that the right idea?</v>

1815
01:30:57.950 --> 01:31:00.380
<v Speaker 2>But if we're not talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't be able to answer that</v>

1816
01:31:00.381 --> 01:31:00.940
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

1817
01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:04.810
<v Speaker 1>What's also interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Google is so all encompassing,</v>

1818
01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have gene male,</v>

1819
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 1>you have enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they are the number one</v>

1820
01:31:12.401 --> 01:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>operating system for mobile phones in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world on top of being a search</v>

1821
01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:18.190
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much involved in that</v>

1822
01:31:18.191 --> 01:31:20.500
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1823
01:31:20.501 --> 01:31:25.501
<v Speaker 1>like almost all tech companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they heavily lean left and they be.</v>

1824
01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Because they had that don't be evil as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of their code of conduct.</v>

1825
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:33.250
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like something that was a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea to have,</v>

1826
01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:36.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sort of defined what I was</v>

1827
01:31:36.311 --> 01:31:40.030
<v Speaker 1>talking about that tech companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely progressive.</v>

1828
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:42.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1829
01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what makes it,</v>

1830
01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think um,</v>

1831
01:31:48.190 --> 01:31:49.990
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>

1832
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:56.130
<v Speaker 2>the Internet allows for a very healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>skepticism of nearly everything.</v>

1833
01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from,</v>

1834
01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the show me state.</v>

1835
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1836
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Saint Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>

1837
01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:06.610
<v Speaker 2>We're all skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom was a democrat.</v>

1838
01:32:06.611 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was a republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad listened to rush limbaugh and</v>

1839
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Hannity all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found myself somewhere in the middle,</v>

1840
01:32:14.471 --> 01:32:19.471
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I appreciate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a ton of fights and arguments and</v>

1841
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:23.050
<v Speaker 2>yelling matches around the kitchen</v>
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>

1842
01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but like I appreciate the fact that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have them and I didn't,</v>

1843
01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I felt safe to do so and I didn't feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1844
01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously then my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't judging me because of</v>

1845
01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.570
<v Speaker 2>what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't force you to be a</v>

1846
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:38.620
<v Speaker 2>republican or a democrat.</v>

1847
01:32:38.630 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It forced me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1848
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.030
<v Speaker 2>to think a particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1849
01:32:42.031 --> 01:32:42.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1850
01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were good,</v>

1851
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 2>at least showing different perspectives</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in this,</v>

1852
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 2>in this union that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have.</v>

1853
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.470
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it developed.</v>

1854
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 2>It developed a skepticism in me that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is,</v>

1855
01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 2>is healthy and I have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>skepticism of companies like ours and</v>

1856
01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 2>leaders like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

1857
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people should.</v>

1858
01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was,</v>

1859
01:33:12.710 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was formed through a lot of the ideals</v>

1860
01:33:18.821 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 2>of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fell in love with what it made</v>

1861
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.370
<v Speaker 2>possible and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1862
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:28.710
<v Speaker 2>I never ever want to run a foul of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those ideals and,</v>

1863
01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.310
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1864
01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:34.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the removal of barriers and boundaries</v>

1865
01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the connection that we have because</v>

1866
01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:38.860
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1867
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:40.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1868
01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think often in reflect often about my</v>

1869
01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:48.781
<v Speaker 2>role and the centralization of my role</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our company and I,</v>

1870
01:33:49.731 --> 01:33:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanna figure out and help figure out</v>

1871
01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 2>like how we can continue to add massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>value and,</v>

1872
01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 2>and be an amazing business which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is us and will always be us.</v>

1873
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:07.170
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a participant participatory force in</v>

1874
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.960
<v Speaker 2>this greater good that the Internet has</v>
<v Speaker 2>really started and it's not,</v>

1875
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:18.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not led by any one individual or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone company and that's the beauty of</v>

1876
01:34:18.881 --> 01:34:21.910
<v Speaker 2>it and I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure that we find our</v>

1877
01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:25.030
<v Speaker 2>place in that and we can also contribute</v>
<v Speaker 2>massively to.</v>

1878
01:34:25.031 --> 01:34:27.700
<v Speaker 2>And then I think we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just gonna take a lot of work and a</v>

1879
01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:30.370
<v Speaker 2>lot of introspection and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experimentation,</v>

1880
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of making mistakes and failures</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1881
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1882
01:34:34.530 --> 01:34:38.000
<v Speaker 1>it's very encouraging that you have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude because a,</v>

1883
01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people I think in a similar</v>

1884
01:34:42.141 --> 01:34:44.540
<v Speaker 1>situation would try to control the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

1885
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:49.910
<v Speaker 1>They would try to reinforce their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular perspective on things and try</v>

1886
01:34:49.911 --> 01:34:52.160
<v Speaker 1>to get other people to adopt it or try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push it.</v>

1887
01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:55.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to just have this</v>

1888
01:34:55.611 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 1>open discussion and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's very important</v>

1889
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.970
<v Speaker 2>to review your own thoughts and ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the best ways to do so.</v>

1890
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Put us through the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1891
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>put it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it out there.</v>

1892
01:35:04.161 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And have other people review,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peer review is a,</v>

1893
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:11.270
<v Speaker 2>is a great process and that's the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>this podcast has evolved more than</v>

1894
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>probably anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

1895
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1896
01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.940
<v Speaker 2>you did this because you want to learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people and,</v>

1897
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:19.590
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the platform that you,</v>

1898
01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 2>you've created millions get to learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it as well and that's just so</v>

1899
01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 2>amazing like I learned from your podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and</v>

1900
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what technology makes possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with that power also comes</v>

1901
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 2>ramifications and if we're not talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the ramifications and like at</v>

1902
01:35:38.331 --> 01:35:40.490
<v Speaker 2>least being open about what we know and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we don't know.</v>

1903
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we state and post a lot more of</v>

1904
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:49.220
<v Speaker 2>what we know rather than what we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know when that is so interesting.</v>

1905
01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you guys steal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be evil.</v>

1906
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Put that in your own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1907
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:55.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if that's going to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1908
01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Then what is that telling our employees</v>
<v Speaker 2>that do don't leave.</v>

1909
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:01.790
<v Speaker 2>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a dick.</v>

1910
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like how do,</v>

1911
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:05.120
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get deeper?</v>

1912
01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:10.121
<v Speaker 2>And just like seeing more conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>around what is quote unquote eval,</v>

1913
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:15.140
<v Speaker 2>have you guys considered expanding your</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence in other venues?</v>

1914
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1915
01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Google started off as a search engine</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's fucking everything.</v>

1916
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys considered doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar?</v>

1917
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I think we probably did too much of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>early on.</v>

1918
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's what led to a bunch of issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>

1919
01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.450
<v Speaker 2>from a corporate standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just trying to do too much,</v>

1920
01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:33.290
<v Speaker 2>too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1921
01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were trying to be everything to</v>

1922
01:36:34.971 --> 01:36:36.620
<v Speaker 2>everyone and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1923
01:36:36.621 --> 01:36:37.640
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a,</v>

1924
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:40.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video thing and we had um,</v>

1925
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.520
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gaming stuff and messaging and it lost</v>

1926
01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:48.320
<v Speaker 2>focus of what we are good at.</v>

1927
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.250
<v Speaker 2>What we're good at is conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're good at is as public</v>

1928
01:36:52.251 --> 01:36:54.380
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we now have,</v>

1929
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 2>as a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have just such an amazing focus on</v>

1930
01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.860
<v Speaker 2>what that means and how that evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's just,</v>

1931
01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 2>there's some really cool things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>

1932
01:37:02.991 --> 01:37:04.040
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this,</v>

1933
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 2>we have this app called periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we're</v>

1934
01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:11.660
<v Speaker 2>discovering is like a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>using it to podcast,</v>

1935
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are using it to share</v>
<v Speaker 2>their thoughts and these people come in</v>

1936
01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and chat and have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1937
01:37:20.331 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we did recently is we</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed the audio to play in the</v>

1938
01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:25.760
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super simple,</v>

1939
01:37:25.761 --> 01:37:30.320
<v Speaker 2>but what we found was that people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily want to watch the video of</v>

1940
01:37:30.321 --> 01:37:32.420
<v Speaker 2>people talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to hear what they're</v>

1941
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that just opened the door for more</v>

1942
01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.010
<v Speaker 2>types of use cases.</v>

1943
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:42.010
<v Speaker 2>And there's some really exciting things</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out with periscope that I think</v>

1944
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:47.470
<v Speaker 2>add a new dimension to what conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like and how it is experienced and</v>

1945
01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:50.880
<v Speaker 2>how it evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1946
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 2>those are the things I get really</v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about is like how,</v>

1947
01:37:54.321 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 2>how can we conversation better and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>

1948
01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.453
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1949
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:00.480
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>

1950
01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.520
<v Speaker 2>how do we make it feel more live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we make it feel more,</v>

1951
01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electric and a,</v>

1952
01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:10.860
<v Speaker 2>how do we bring new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1953
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:16.250
<v Speaker 2>new technology into it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just opens the door for an entirely</v>

1954
01:38:16.981 --> 01:38:20.030
<v Speaker 2>new way of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1955
01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:24.510
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing that I think has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been most educational to me about</v>

1956
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:25.670
<v Speaker 2>twitter as we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1957
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.700
<v Speaker 2>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we talked about,</v>

1958
01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:31.701
<v Speaker 2>we started with this idea of sharing</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening around you and then</v>

1959
01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 2>people told us what they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted it to be and it became this</v>

1960
01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:38.280
<v Speaker 2>conversational medium.</v>

1961
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 2>It became this interest networked and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a,</v>

1962
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.860
<v Speaker 2>it became a thing that was entirely new</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1963
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we observed it and uh,</v>

1964
01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.510
<v Speaker 2>we learned more and more of what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be in.</v>

1965
01:38:51.511 --> 01:38:54.900
<v Speaker 2>We as we get deeper and deeper that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be surprised by some of</v>

1966
01:38:54.901 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 2>the technologies that we thought would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be used in this way,</v>

1967
01:38:57.691 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the massive use case and the resonant</v>

1968
01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 2>use case in the fundamental use case is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be created right before our</v>

1969
01:39:06.241 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 2>eyes by the people using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1970
01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:11.790
<v Speaker 2>did you guys acquire periscope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was required postcode and what was</v>

1971
01:39:11.791 --> 01:39:13.320
<v Speaker 2>the thought process when you requiring</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1972
01:39:13.670 --> 01:39:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1973
01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:16.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we liked the live nature of it.</v>

1974
01:39:16.501 --> 01:39:18.360
<v Speaker 2>We liked the broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1975
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:20.880
<v Speaker 2>aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whitey black and why keep it as</v>

1976
01:39:20.881 --> 01:39:23.460
<v Speaker 2>periscope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not have it be like twitter live?</v>

1977
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:26.520
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a specific community on,</v>

1978
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:27.691
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1979
01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 2>on periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's interesting from an</v>

1980
01:39:31.021 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 2>experimentation standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can play with ideas there.</v>

1981
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a small tigress I think uses it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than anybody he gets.</v>

1982
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:39.510
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1983
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:43.170
<v Speaker 2>he's really good at it and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one that I think has figured out,</v>

1984
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1985
01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:47.370
<v Speaker 2>just the NAC behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1986
01:39:47.371 --> 01:39:49.950
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts every one of them with,</v>

1987
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

1988
01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous sip of coffee.</v>

1989
01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:58.800
<v Speaker 2>So he gets his listeners and his viewers</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged right away.</v>

1990
01:39:58.801 --> 01:40:01.370
<v Speaker 2>And then he just goes on and then every</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and then he'll,</v>

1991
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:02.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the comments and,</v>

1992
01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:06.130
<v Speaker 2>and riff off of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people build up to like,</v>

1993
01:40:06.131 --> 01:40:08.310
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll announce that he's going on and</v>

1994
01:40:08.311 --> 01:40:10.440
<v Speaker 2>then wait a little while and say hello</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some people.</v>

1995
01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Then once a bunch of people are in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

1996
01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.620
<v Speaker 2>then he starts talking.</v>

1997
01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1998
01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find A.</v>

1999
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I find that so interesting because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the future of conversation.</v>

2000
01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:22.110
<v Speaker 2>It's looking at the patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's looking at what people are trying</v>

2001
01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:25.770
<v Speaker 2>to do with a thing and then you build</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology around it and that becomes.</v>

2002
01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:28.860
<v Speaker 2>That becomes the next big thing and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have to.</v>

2003
01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:34.190
<v Speaker 2>We have to hone our power of observation</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our power of like connecting the dots</v>

2004
01:40:34.211 --> 01:40:36.030
<v Speaker 2>and looking at all the patterns and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>

2005
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It's what's the question behind the</v>
<v Speaker 2>question?</v>

2006
01:40:38.281 --> 01:40:39.960
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the statement behind the</v>

2007
01:40:39.961 --> 01:40:43.530
<v Speaker 2>statement that they're making and if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get good at understanding some of</v>

2008
01:40:43.531 --> 01:40:46.050
<v Speaker 2>those fundamental central things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we've reached,</v>

2009
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.050
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've at least created the probability</v>

2010
01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 2>that most people in the world will find</v>
<v Speaker 2>it useful and find valuable.</v>

2011
01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz</v>

2012
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.610
<v Speaker 1>is the other person that uses periscope</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than anybody alive,</v>

2013
01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but he just gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just gets baked.</v>

2014
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.380
<v Speaker 1>That just gives you a morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He call it morning bond.</v>

2015
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Morning joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The morning joint.</v>

2016
01:41:04.930 --> 01:41:05.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

2017
01:41:05.441 --> 01:41:10.240
<v Speaker 1>he'll smoke a joint or smoke a bowl in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning and then just sort of let</v>

2018
01:41:10.241 --> 01:41:11.540
<v Speaker 1>everybody know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you in.</v>

2019
01:41:11.541 --> 01:41:12.374
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes mine</v>

2020
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.750
<v Speaker 2>doing something in sync with one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2021
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:16.210
<v Speaker 2>with more people's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2022
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:17.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've um,</v>

2023
01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:23.080
<v Speaker 2>we've had some folks who are interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in doing meditations through periscope.</v>

2024
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great idea.</v>

2025
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:25.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

2026
01:41:25.551 --> 01:41:26.750
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the surface level,</v>

2027
01:41:26.751 --> 01:41:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine anything more boring</v>
<v Speaker 2>than like watching someone meditate,</v>

2028
01:41:29.871 --> 01:41:32.840
<v Speaker 2>but if you're actually meditating with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2029
01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>there's something powerful about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what can we do to improve that</v>

2030
01:41:36.711 --> 01:41:37.510
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>

2031
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:40.480
<v Speaker 1>What about people using it for group</v>
<v Speaker 1>workouts?</v>

2032
01:41:40.481 --> 01:41:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Is anyone doing that?</v>

2033
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's happened and I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it personally,</v>

2034
01:41:44.001 --> 01:41:46.280
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much more people do you have on</v>

2035
01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:47.990
<v Speaker 2>twitter than periscope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

2036
01:41:48.130 --> 01:41:49.520
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

2037
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:53.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things that I</v>

2038
01:41:53.091 --> 01:41:56.960
<v Speaker 2>personally just have a lot of conviction</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and I have a lot of belief in the</v>

2039
01:41:56.961 --> 01:42:00.290
<v Speaker 2>format in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know every now and then we don't have</v>

2040
01:42:00.291 --> 01:42:04.670
<v Speaker 2>instant hits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just requires a lot of patients and</v>

2041
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:07.460
<v Speaker 2>we need to really learn what it wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the.</v>

2042
01:42:07.730 --> 01:42:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that takes time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think oftentimes I've certainly done</v>

2043
01:42:12.651 --> 01:42:13.940
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2044
01:42:13.941 --> 01:42:14.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2045
01:42:14.970 --> 01:42:17.090
<v Speaker 2>we shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shut down things a little bit too</v>

2046
01:42:17.091 --> 01:42:21.770
<v Speaker 2>early and we did this at square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we had this amazing technology and</v>

2047
01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>app I love cold a square wallet and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed you to um,</v>

2048
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:29.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you link your credit card and you have</v>

2049
01:42:29.961 --> 01:42:34.460
<v Speaker 2>all these merchants around you here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>La and you could walk up to a coffee</v>

2050
01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:38.060
<v Speaker 2>merchant and as you walked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your name would pop up on the register.</v>

2051
01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.670
<v Speaker 2>So you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a Cappuccino,</v>

2052
01:42:39.710 --> 01:42:42.860
<v Speaker 2>put it on Jack and it just automatically</v>
<v Speaker 2>charge your card.</v>

2053
01:42:42.861 --> 01:42:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And they would only happen if you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him like two feet.</v>

2054
01:42:45.621 --> 01:42:47.870
<v Speaker 2>We're using Bluetooth and geolocation</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not.</v>

2055
01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.490
<v Speaker 2>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2056
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.540
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had it for about three years and it,</v>

2057
01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:54.800
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't take off and we shut it</v>

2058
01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:57.350
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kinda regret doing that.</v>

2059
01:42:57.351 --> 01:43:01.970
<v Speaker 2>But it also paved the way for another</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that I didn't want to give up on.</v>

2060
01:43:01.971 --> 01:43:04.280
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the cash app,</v>

2061
01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.280
<v Speaker 2>like for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2062
01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:10.640
<v Speaker 2>it was just a slog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people in the company</v>

2063
01:43:10.641 --> 01:43:14.000
<v Speaker 2>wanted to shut down the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They saw it as something that wasn't</v>

2064
01:43:14.001 --> 01:43:15.930
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2065
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:18.920
<v Speaker 2>recently the team reached number one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2066
01:43:18.921 --> 01:43:21.460
<v Speaker 2>in the APP store in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

2067
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:23.240
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were all,</v>

2068
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.240
<v Speaker 2>we were against all these incumbents</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Venmo and paypal and,</v>

2069
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:30.140
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it finally clicked and it's just because</v>

2070
01:43:30.141 --> 01:43:32.720
<v Speaker 2>we had the patients and the conviction</v>
<v Speaker 2>render our belief.</v>

2071
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great app too.</v>

2072
01:43:34.801 --> 01:43:38.100
<v Speaker 1>And the ethics behind it are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic too.</v>

2073
01:43:38.101 --> 01:43:41.910
<v Speaker 1>We're really thankful for the cash app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially my friend Justin wren,</v>

2074
01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and it's fight for the forgotten charity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every time you use the code word</v>

2075
01:43:45.151 --> 01:43:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan all one word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all goes.</v>

2076
01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Where matched $5 goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that they've built two to the pygmies</v>

2077
01:43:51.861 --> 01:43:54.350
<v Speaker 1>in the Congo and they've raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars in building more</v>

2078
01:43:54.351 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 1>wells right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

2079
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:56.474
<v Speaker 1>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2080
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:57.890
<v Speaker 1>we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really happy about that.</v>

2081
01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2082
01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's um,</v>

2083
01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a great way to save money too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you can save 10 percent at</v>

2084
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:05.990
<v Speaker 1>whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's real.</v>

2085
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the other thing is like to the</v>

2086
01:44:08.791 --> 01:44:13.791
<v Speaker 2>population that we serve typically are</v>
<v Speaker 2>underserved by banks or unbanked</v>

2087
01:44:14.251 --> 01:44:16.950
<v Speaker 2>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are their bank account,</v>

2088
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:21.510
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to things like rewards.</v>

2089
01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't get rewards on a typical debit</v>
<v Speaker 2>card or credit card.</v>

2090
01:44:24.761 --> 01:44:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So like just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to your favorite place and getting</v>

2091
01:44:28.621 --> 01:44:30.820
<v Speaker 2>an instant 10 percent off or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2092
01:44:30.821 --> 01:44:35.250
<v Speaker 2>is out of reach for most people because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the financial institutions don't enable</v>

2093
01:44:35.251 --> 01:44:37.320
<v Speaker 2>that and they won't even enable them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in the door,</v>

2094
01:44:37.321 --> 01:44:38.340
<v Speaker 2>in the front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>

2095
01:44:38.370 --> 01:44:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people are listening,</v>

2096
01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:40.870
<v Speaker 1>is this on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck we're</v>

2097
01:44:40.871 --> 01:44:43.300
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cash APP has a thing called a cash</v>

2098
01:44:43.301 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 1>card or a debit card that you get with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and there's a thing called boosts and</v>

2099
01:44:46.421 --> 01:44:49.300
<v Speaker 1>with boosts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you do is pick a boost in the APP</v>

2100
01:44:49.301 --> 01:44:53.560
<v Speaker 1>and then use your cash card as a debit</v>
<v Speaker 1>card and you get these automatic</v>

2101
01:44:53.561 --> 01:44:55.540
<v Speaker 1>discounts and they're real discounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2102
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:59.290
<v Speaker 1>And interest for folks with bad credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no credit check.</v>

2103
01:44:59.370 --> 01:45:03.580
<v Speaker 1>You can direct deposit your paycheck</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the app and the fact that you</v>

2104
01:45:03.581 --> 01:45:08.170
<v Speaker 1>guys do do things like support fight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forgotten and you're supporting UFC</v>

2105
01:45:08.171 --> 01:45:10.990
<v Speaker 1>fighter ray borg son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some serious medical bills.</v>

2106
01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:11.853
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

2107
01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:12.960
<v Speaker 2>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2108
01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:13.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really.</v>

2109
01:45:13.601 --> 01:45:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm really proud of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really proud of the team.</v>

2110
01:45:15.071 --> 01:45:16.240
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very small team,</v>

2111
01:45:16.241 --> 01:45:17.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing some big things</v>

2112
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:19.040
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear a lot of good things about it</v>

2113
01:45:19.041 --> 01:45:19.461
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2114
01:45:19.461 --> 01:45:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've run into people on the street that</v>

2115
01:45:20.931 --> 01:45:22.640
<v Speaker 1>tells me they use it in the very happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2116
01:45:22.641 --> 01:45:24.590
<v Speaker 1>so it's nice to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2117
01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.800
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an emerging technology that's profitable</v>

2118
01:45:27.801 --> 01:45:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but yet also has a really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really good set of ethics.</v>

2119
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:32.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be evil in cash.</v>

2121
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should take it.</v>

2122
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:39.300
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2123
01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.210
<v Speaker 2>one of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our like equivalent operating</v>

2124
01:45:42.211 --> 01:45:47.211
<v Speaker 2>principles within cash and square is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like under like how do we understand</v>

2125
01:45:47.611 --> 01:45:50.160
<v Speaker 2>someone's struggle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do we understand like how do we</v>

2126
01:45:50.161 --> 01:45:53.070
<v Speaker 2>have the empathy for what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggling with and like when it comes</v>

2127
01:45:53.071 --> 01:45:54.570
<v Speaker 2>to finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're struggling with a lot.</v>

2128
01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typically they're struggling with a ton.</v>

2129
01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:58.100
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>

2130
01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.540
<v Speaker 1>the thought process with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2131
01:45:59.541 --> 01:46:02.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's kind of cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the cash app is that you can buy</v>

2132
01:46:02.271 --> 01:46:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and sell bitcoin with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going,</v>

2133
01:46:04.611 --> 01:46:08.120
<v Speaker 1>are you guys going to consider other</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of crypto currency as well?</v>

2134
01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2135
01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:13.050
<v Speaker 2>so back to the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe the Internet will have a</v>

2136
01:46:13.051 --> 01:46:15.900
<v Speaker 2>native currency really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a native currency and I</v>

2137
01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:19.770
<v Speaker 2>don't know if it's bitcoin and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will because just given all the tests</v>

2138
01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:22.680
<v Speaker 2>it's been through and the principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>

2139
01:46:22.681 --> 01:46:25.510
<v Speaker 2>how it was created and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2140
01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something that was born on the</v>

2141
01:46:27.121 --> 01:46:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Internet that was developed on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet that it was tested on it.</v>

2142
01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 2>It is of the Internet and the reason we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2143
01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:39.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we enabled the purchasing of bitcoin</v>

2144
01:46:39.631 --> 01:46:43.020
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the cash APP is one we want to</v>

2145
01:46:43.021 --> 01:46:45.840
<v Speaker 2>learn about the technology and we wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put ourselves out there and take some</v>

2146
01:46:45.841 --> 01:46:48.090
<v Speaker 2>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were the first publicly traded company</v>

2147
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 2>to actually it as a service where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first publicly traded company to talk to</v>

2148
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:55.800
<v Speaker 2>the sec about the coin in what that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means.</v>

2149
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And it made us uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to,</v>

2150
01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 2>we had to like really understand what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on and,</v>

2151
01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 2>and that was critical and important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second thing is that we,</v>

2152
01:47:07.110 --> 01:47:08.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>

2153
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.160
<v Speaker 2>we would love to see something become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>global currency.</v>

2154
01:47:12.161 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 2>It did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it enables more access.</v>

2155
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:16.320
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it allows us to serve more people.</v>

2156
01:47:16.321 --> 01:47:18.450
<v Speaker 2>It allows us to move much faster around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2157
01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2158
01:47:20.791 --> 01:47:21.624
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2159
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:26.490
<v Speaker 2>we thought we were going to start with</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you can use it transactionally,</v>

2160
01:47:26.491 --> 01:47:31.491
<v Speaker 2>but we noticed that people were treating</v>
<v Speaker 2>it more like an asset,</v>

2161
01:47:31.921 --> 01:47:33.600
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a virtual gold,</v>

2162
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.530
<v Speaker 2>and we wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2163
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 2>we want to just to make that easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just the simplest way to buy</v>

2164
01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 2>and sell bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also knew that it had to come</v>

2165
01:47:45.061 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to come with constraint because,</v>

2166
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago people did some really</v>

2167
01:47:52.501 --> 01:47:54.020
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy things about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2168
01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.040
<v Speaker 2>purchasing bitcoin.</v>

2169
01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:57.610
<v Speaker 2>They maxed out their credit cards and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2170
01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.320
<v Speaker 2>put all their life savings into bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2171
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 2>we developed some severity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple restrictions and constraints like</v>

2172
01:48:04.141 --> 01:48:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't buy bitcoin on the cash app</v>

2173
01:48:06.421 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 2>with a credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

2174
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:09.990
<v Speaker 2>it has to be the money you actually have</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>

2175
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.720
<v Speaker 2>And we look for day trading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we,</v>

2176
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:15.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we discourage and shut down like that.</v>

2177
01:48:15.481 --> 01:48:18.930
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we're trying to build.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we're trying to optimize</v>

2178
01:48:18.931 --> 01:48:22.080
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made a children's book explaining</v>

2179
01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:26.950
<v Speaker 2>what Bitcoin is and where it came from</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how people use it and where it might</v>

2180
01:48:26.951 --> 01:48:29.850
<v Speaker 2>be going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we really tried to take on the role</v>

2181
01:48:29.851 --> 01:48:32.220
<v Speaker 2>of education and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2182
01:48:32.221 --> 01:48:37.221
<v Speaker 2>and to have some like very simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy constraints that allowed to be</v>

2183
01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:41.310
<v Speaker 2>allowed people to consider what their</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions are in the space.</v>

2184
01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Now when you have something like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cash app,</v>

2185
01:48:43.181 --> 01:48:46.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much a disruptive technology</v>

2186
01:48:46.601 --> 01:48:51.570
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like decentralization of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of banks and,</v>

2187
01:48:52.090 --> 01:48:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and currency and you know,</v>

2188
01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:58.390
<v Speaker 1>to have it where everything is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at your direct depositing a</v>

2189
01:48:58.391 --> 01:49:00.250
<v Speaker 1>paycheck right in the app if you so</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>

2190
01:49:00.251 --> 01:49:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you could also buy bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another disruptive technology</v>

2191
01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:09.100
<v Speaker 1>mean that this is another step towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of new way of doing things.</v>

2192
01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:15.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is there pushback from,</v>

2193
01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:17.380
<v Speaker 1>from any companies or is there.</v>

2194
01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2195
01:49:18.471 --> 01:49:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you just look at some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>major banks and their consideration</v>

2196
01:49:22.221 --> 01:49:25.490
<v Speaker 2>around bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all love blockchain because of the</v>

2197
01:49:25.491 --> 01:49:29.300
<v Speaker 2>efficiencies that can create for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>business and potentially new business</v>

2198
01:49:29.301 --> 01:49:29.931
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2199
01:49:29.931 --> 01:49:30.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2200
01:49:30.861 --> 01:49:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a explain blockchain to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for people who don't know what</v>

2201
01:49:33.621 --> 01:49:36.410
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blockchain is a distributed ledger and</v>

2202
01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:38.180
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2203
01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:40.790
<v Speaker 2>it's basically a distributed database</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2204
01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2205
01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:46.490
<v Speaker 2>the source of truth can be verified at</v>
<v Speaker 2>any point around the network and you</v>

2206
01:49:46.671 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2207
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:48.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2208
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:53.460
<v Speaker 2>this annotation around how content or</v>
<v Speaker 2>how around money like traveled.</v>

2209
01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have to go to an</v>

2210
01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:57.100
<v Speaker 2>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the records,</v>

2211
01:49:57.101 --> 01:49:58.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no centralized check,</v>

2212
01:49:58.841 --> 01:50:00.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no centralized control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2213
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:02.880
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is a threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2214
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly threatening,</v>

2215
01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to certain services behind banks and</v>

2216
01:50:08.471 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 2>financial institutions.</v>

2217
01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.400
<v Speaker 2>It's threatening to some governments as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2218
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

2219
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I just look at this and like how do we</v>
<v Speaker 2>embrace this technology,</v>

2220
01:50:16.811 --> 01:50:20.680
<v Speaker 2>not react to it in a more from a threat</v>
<v Speaker 2>standpoint,</v>

2221
01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:25.540
<v Speaker 2>but like what does it enable us to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and where does our value shift?</v>

2222
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we should be talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about right now is like how our value</v>

2223
01:50:28.931 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 2>shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's always really strong answers</v>

2224
01:50:32.111 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 2>to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not willing to ask the</v>

2225
01:50:33.851 --> 01:50:36.700
<v Speaker 2>question the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will become irrelevant because</v>

2226
01:50:36.701 --> 01:50:41.350
<v Speaker 2>technology will just continue to march</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and make you irrelevant and it's the</v>

2227
01:50:41.351 --> 01:50:42.880
<v Speaker 2>people that like are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2228
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:44.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up with this technology are born</v>

2229
01:50:44.981 --> 01:50:49.330
<v Speaker 2>with the technology only knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology or are asking the tough</v>

2230
01:50:49.331 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 2>questions of ourselves that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be super disruptive to their business</v>

2231
01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:55.540
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about right now and</v>

2232
01:50:55.541 --> 01:50:57.820
<v Speaker 2>they're and they're taking actions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2233
01:50:57.821 --> 01:50:59.530
<v Speaker 2>we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing that at square and we're</v>

2234
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:03.790
<v Speaker 2>doing that at twitter and like that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me represents longevity.</v>

2235
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:07.520
<v Speaker 2>That represents our ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to thrive and we,</v>

2236
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 2>we got to push ourselves going to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves uncomfortable and we got to</v>

2237
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:15.271
<v Speaker 2>disrupt what we held sacred and what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is success at it because otherwise</v>

2238
01:51:17.051 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be bigger than what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have today.</v>

2239
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

2240
01:51:19.961 --> 01:51:24.961
<v Speaker 2>And I think that cryptocurrency to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>represents one of the more interesting</v>

2241
01:51:25.001 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 2>discussions on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is money and why are we agreeing</v>

2242
01:51:29.441 --> 01:51:32.470
<v Speaker 2>that it's these pieces of paper that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal Reserve prints out.</v>

2243
01:51:32.471 --> 01:51:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2244
01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating time in technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like that,</v>

2245
01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.050
<v Speaker 2>that to me was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the last big,</v>

2246
01:51:41.730 --> 01:51:44.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>centralized natch,</v>

2247
01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:49.600
<v Speaker 2>a nationalized instruments is his</v>
<v Speaker 2>currency is money and when you think</v>

2248
01:51:50.111 --> 01:51:52.990
<v Speaker 2>about the internet as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

2249
01:51:52.991 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 2>as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a market,</v>

2250
01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:59.200
<v Speaker 2>as a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have its own currency and,</v>

2251
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 2>but what's interesting about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet as a nation,</v>

2252
01:52:01.271 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole world.</v>

2253
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:06.400
<v Speaker 2>It is the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the world gets one currency,</v>

2254
01:52:06.401 --> 01:52:09.360
<v Speaker 2>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to communicate in and</v>

2255
01:52:09.361 --> 01:52:10.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's just so freeing and so</v>

2256
01:52:10.961 --> 01:52:12.130
<v Speaker 2>exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2257
01:52:12.170 --> 01:52:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very excited by it and I'm also very</v>

2258
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:17.530
<v Speaker 2>excited that the fact that it's only</v>
<v Speaker 2>been around for such a short period of</v>

2259
01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:18.101
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2260
01:52:18.101 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 2>10 years and it's become a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>global conversation,</v>

2261
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:24.220
<v Speaker 2>good brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that it's going to open up</v>

2262
01:52:24.221 --> 01:52:28.820
<v Speaker 2>the door to potential universal</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages and I think this is,</v>

2263
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:30.100
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That excites me a lot about twitter as</v>

2265
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:36.540
<v Speaker 2>like how do we like it if we want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world into a conversation into a,</v>

2266
01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:40.000
<v Speaker 2>not a single conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least being able to see that</v>

2267
01:52:40.001 --> 01:52:42.930
<v Speaker 2>global conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we gotta work on technologies that</v>

2268
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:44.940
<v Speaker 2>like instantly translate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2269
01:52:44.941 --> 01:52:48.760
<v Speaker 2>we got to work on technologies that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can speak as I'm speaking right now in,</v>

2270
01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 2>in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are hearing it in their context</v>

2271
01:52:52.071 --> 01:52:55.370
<v Speaker 2>and their language and their dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is amazing.</v>

2272
01:52:55.371 --> 01:52:58.730
<v Speaker 2>That is so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like just how that evolves.</v>

2273
01:52:59.310 --> 01:53:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2274
01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.800
<v Speaker 2>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it impacts not just communication</v>

2275
01:53:03.801 --> 01:53:04.820
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but music.</v>

2276
01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just like,</v>

2277
01:53:05.931 --> 01:53:08.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how hip hop and rap and you know,</v>

2278
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:10.370
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

2279
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:11.190
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2280
01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:13.850
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to think about where that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where that can go and where that can</v>

2281
01:53:13.851 --> 01:53:14.990
<v Speaker 2>take us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think</v>

2283
01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you and I are extremely fortunate to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive right now during this time because</v>

2284
01:53:19.531 --> 01:53:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the strangest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most unique times in human history.</v>

2285
01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's ever been a time</v>

2286
01:53:25.441 --> 01:53:27.600
<v Speaker 1>where things have changed so radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>so quickly.</v>

2287
01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:53:28.691 --> 01:53:29.890
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>

2289
01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:30.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2290
01:53:30.491 --> 01:53:32.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2291
01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:33.493
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>

2292
01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.680
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're able through technologies like</v>

2293
01:53:35.681 --> 01:53:40.681
<v Speaker 2>twitter to at least see and acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the issues that we're still</v>

2294
01:53:41.471 --> 01:53:46.330
<v Speaker 2>facing and we're probably in the dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>before and I think that's so critical to</v>

2295
01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.680
<v Speaker 2>making any sort of improvements for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for making any sort of evolution and a</v>

2296
01:53:54.190 --> 01:53:56.080
<v Speaker 2>and for making it better for everyone on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

2297
01:53:56.081 --> 01:53:57.600
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2298
01:53:58.330 --> 01:53:59.950
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as uncomfortable as,</v>

2299
01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:03.490
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes twitter makes people feel,</v>

2300
01:54:03.491 --> 01:54:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it is necessary to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see those things and have</v>

2301
01:54:06.941 --> 01:54:10.720
<v Speaker 2>conversations about them so that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how we might move forward and</v>

2302
01:54:10.721 --> 01:54:15.040
<v Speaker 2>how we might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good at the biggest problems</v>

2303
01:54:15.041 --> 01:54:18.910
<v Speaker 2>facing us all and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some huge ones,</v>

2304
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.360
<v Speaker 2>some huge ones right now that if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have,</v>

2305
01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:27.930
<v Speaker 2>if we don't talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it will drive us to extinction and</v>

2306
01:54:28.691 --> 01:54:33.691
<v Speaker 2>like it will threaten our ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a planet to live on this planet.</v>

2307
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:37.303
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
