32
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her knees were totally wrapped up.</v>

33
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>She was limping from the moment she got </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>This scanning Garcia's towering over </v>
<v Speaker 1>this old lady.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She swallowed it.</v>

36
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just a giant Silva taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>a two by four against Takeshi Secura.</v>

37
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Remember big giant Silva two by four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like hit him with at the end of </v>

38
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The angle.</v>

39
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:04.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the pride fighting championship </v>

40
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:04.451
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he do that?</v>

41
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:04.451
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>the marriage of pro wrestling and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pride in many ways the,</v>

44
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the larger than life storylines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>production could lead to things like </v>

45
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we sought firsthand the freak fights</v>

46
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

47
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't a part of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

48
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:24.851
<v Speaker 1>The fight itself was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you remember allister used to bring </v>

49
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:24.851
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

50
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:29.111
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were pro wrestling esque </v>

51
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:29.111
<v Speaker 1>entrances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>

52
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people loved.</v>

53
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 1>But was this a part of his entrance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was finding somebody?</v>

54
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was after the fight.</v>

55
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>We remember Takeshi cigarette in giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>silver right there,</v>

56
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>and it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

58
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was maybe a part of the presentation </v>

59
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and not something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you say,</v>

60
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:55.991
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to assault someone with a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights for in the early days that you </v>

61
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:55.991
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

62
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

63
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few.</v>

65
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 2>remember it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the funniest thing ever.</v>

66
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.600
<v Speaker 2>A Coleman was fighting to Catia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67

<v Speaker 2>He was going to get finished at six </v>

68
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.121
<v Speaker 2>minutes by way of heel hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now the press comes to me and he </v>

69
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>tells me what do you think's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in his fight,</v>

70
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.380

<v Speaker 2>Who's going to win six minutes?</v>

71
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.381
<v Speaker 2>He'll hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody froze because this was before </v>

72
00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:22.831
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had to change their whole </v>

73
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:22.831
<v Speaker 2>gimmick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they were going to do.</v>

74

<v Speaker 2>but I just thought you future pride </v>

75
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:29.440

<v Speaker 2>They had it all planned out.</v>

76
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>They hold up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

80
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 2>that was 100 percent that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Takata came into our studio training at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Beverly Hills Jujitsu Club.</v>

82
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 2>We had white and blue belts a tapping </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

83
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 2>So it was not like this guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 2>he was just an old time dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

85
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.750
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

86
00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

87
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:52.460
<v Speaker 3>you talk about how pride fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>championships at Genesys,</v>

88
00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:53.690
<v Speaker 3>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

89
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:57.200
<v Speaker 3>bringing the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the so-called toughest best pro wrestler</v>

90
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.330
<v Speaker 3>against Hixon Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

91
00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 3>the mythic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a falling Tuto Jujitsu fighter.</v>

92
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.830
<v Speaker 3>The UFC had a similar but more rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach to it recently with cm punk </v>

93
00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 3>versus making gall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

94
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:16.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll give this cm punk guy a kid with </v>

95
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:16.211
<v Speaker 3>one fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one amateur fight.</v>

96
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I think he had at least one amateur </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and one fight in the UFC show.</v>

97
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.040
<v Speaker 3>It's promise choked guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we said,</v>

98
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get a tough kit.</v>

99
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna get a tough kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but [inaudible] going to have to fight a</v>

100
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:27.380
<v Speaker 3>real fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

101
00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to fight Hixon gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

102
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 3>It was just at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody had Jujitsu like Hickson.</v>

103
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just so above and beyond </v>

104
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

105
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unreal.</v>

106
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 3>So will be $400.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

107
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a nice round number that they </v>

108
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.250
<v Speaker 3>always got to wonder who threw that out </v>
<v Speaker 3>first like they did.</v>

109
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's such a disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three 98.</v>

110
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 3>That sounds way more believable than </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

111
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 3>$400.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy is when you see these tie </v>

<v Speaker 3>but it wouldn't bring.</v>

151
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Criminal State sponsored rehabilitation </v>
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

152
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.651
<v Speaker 3>popular known as prison fight is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>reserved for petty criminals under the </v>

153
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Violent criminals and crew,</v>

154
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>including those convicted of murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second piece of this is the </v>

155
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:52.151
<v Speaker 3>one who was convicted of murder and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual assault had been freed and in </v>

156
00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:56.561
<v Speaker 3>some cases fully absolved of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes through their participation in </v>

157
00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 3>prison fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

158
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona.</v>

159
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 3>My birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's even crazier than that.</v>

160
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:05.441
<v Speaker 3>Anybody would allow this thought you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do if you're a violent criminal </v>

161
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:09.911
<v Speaker 3>is prove that you're more violent than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other violent criminals and you get </v>

162
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:09.911
<v Speaker 3>your freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking insane.</v>

163
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a lesson to be </v>

164
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 3>learned for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Results on one point.</v>

165
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>

166
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 3>violent men redeemed themselves through </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent acts.</v>

167
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

168
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 3>they think probably a pleasant placenta </v>
<v Speaker 3>plus becomes a negative.</v>

169
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they think that way.</v>

170
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Your sister or your daughter or your mom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they get out because they beat </v>

171
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of all the other 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent agree.</v>

172
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 3>If you see the trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a woman says.</v>

173
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:37.710
<v Speaker 3>He stabbed his kid in the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed a kid,</v>

174
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 3>and now his guys going to fight for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life to get out of there.</v>

175
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be.</v>

176
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be losing.</v>

177
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

178
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.290
<v Speaker 3>back to the $400,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no most likely not the dl number in </v>

179
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.011
<v Speaker 3>anybody's case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody just made that up for </v>

180
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:56.770
<v Speaker 3>propaganda purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they would've said over 400 but just </v>

181
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Speaker 3>below 400.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

182
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.800
<v Speaker 3>but making it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love that his son is super active </v>

<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

185
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a tough fucking Chi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough area.</v>

186
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I will always wonder what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossly Gracie.</v>

187
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strike.</v>

188
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seemed to be the first Gracie to me </v>

189
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 3>to take it to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Become more well rounded and well versed</v>

<v Speaker 3>and whip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Done well.</v>

191
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 3>I think Haji showed really great promise</v>
<v Speaker 3>until King Mo knocked him out.</v>

192
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

193
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 3>that was a big knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Mo can crack.</v>

194
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 3>We've got some serious power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a tremendous athlete.</v>

195
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Student striking as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge boxing fan.</v>

196
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget that ground and pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kale that he had with Seth Pinsky.</v>

197
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Scary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that the throw the guard to the side</v>

199
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:51.650

<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>well in Henderson.</v>

201
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.060

00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just a Ninja that was one shot</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I told him to do to everybody.</v>

205
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.320
<v Speaker 4>He is the guy that when he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

206
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 4>when he has a face as a great striker </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I tell them,</v>

207
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 4>just take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him,</v>

208
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.410
<v Speaker 4>he took me down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you is freaking animal.</v>

209
00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:22.411
<v Speaker 4>Like in training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Focus Mitts and my hands would hurt </v>

210
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 4>after I would hold him and he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand on one leg and hit.</v>

211
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't have no clue how he generated </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of force,</v>

212
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 4>but he had so much power and I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just take him down.</v>

213
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Scott Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you even go with them?</v>

214
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 4>The guys is trying to just take them </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

215
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 4>knock them out on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he didn't do it.</v>

216
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Every time at the end of the round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did it.</v>

217
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 4>Hit him one time it was almost dazed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The belt went around again,</v>

218
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 4>but the third run the loader compelling </v>
<v Speaker 4>career for Scott Smith to right.</v>

219
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 4>Hadn't headlining events on CBS major </v>
<v Speaker 4>network exposure.</v>

220
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:52.731
<v Speaker 4>I remember what we called the Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 4>miracle when he came back and knocked </v>

221
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:53.590
<v Speaker 4>down calmly and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

222
00:09:53.591 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 4>the guy who's I think back working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

223
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you know has a steel back in the </v>

224
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 4>factory and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting all the sporting,</v>

225
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 4>such a short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course we've seen the explosion,</v>

226
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 4>but what could have been even in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in with a,</v>

227
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 4>with a [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we saw what happened with kimball,</v>

228
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's just interesting for me now as </v>
<v Speaker 4>we reminisce about stuff,</v>

229
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:17.721
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how so many organizations had </v>

230
00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 4>opportunities and yet fell by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wayside for,</v>

231
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 4>for one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it's self inflicted.</v>

232
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elitist</v>

233
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.980
<v Speaker 5>c was a really hard one to watch because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was bastardizing the sport you were </v>

234
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.450
<v Speaker 5>seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were standing people up like,</v>

235
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:31.010
<v Speaker 5>do you remember what number that 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>second rule was?</v>

236
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 5>But it was also they were standing up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and dominant positions like Roy Nelson </v>

237
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 5>and Arlovski kind of incredulous working</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Kamora and they stood them up but </v>

238
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:42.280
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

239
00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:43.150
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

240
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 4>But then you can understand why those </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kimbo slice,</v>

241
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking what was necessary to bring it </v>

242
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 4>was the first organization to make it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>two major network tv.</v>

243
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 4>And I think there were some decent </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters along the way as well.</v>

244
00:10:56.881 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Where you Akimbo fan at all in terms I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know your,</v>

245
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 4>your martial arts and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 4>respected sit here,</v>

246
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 4>bowing down at the altar of the erudite </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

247
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 4>But did you like what Kimbo slice </v>
<v Speaker 4>represented at the time?</v>

248
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.520
<v Speaker 5>I think to most sites was a tough guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was a fun guy to watch,</v>

249
00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:17.521
<v Speaker 5>but the reality of what he represented </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a mixed martial arts fighter at that </v>

250
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.120
<v Speaker 5>time was he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was fairly novice.</v>

251
00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:24.121
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't really have a ground game and </v>

252
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:24.121
<v Speaker 5>he really couldn't stop a good wrestler </v>
<v Speaker 5>from taking him down,</v>

253
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:27.130
<v Speaker 5>but he was a good puncher who was really</v>
<v Speaker 5>good in those backyard,</v>

254
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 5>brought in those environments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

255
00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:34.621
<v Speaker 5>like he was tough for the 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the guys out there and he would smash </v>

256
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 5>guys and he smashed a few guys in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

257
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 5>And you know what I really respect about</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kimbo said he went on the ultimate </v>

258
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.770
<v Speaker 5>fighter and he gave a go of it can mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>he really does make the.</v>

259
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was already a huge youtube star at </v>

260
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.441
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he went on with all these other </v>

261
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:51.391
<v Speaker 5>unknown unknown guys who are wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and football players and guys like Roy </v>

262
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:52.750
<v Speaker 5>Nelson and he handled it like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

263
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Big Target.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is a big</v>

264
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.600
<v Speaker 3>target on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew him.</v>

265
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to fight him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the numbers were through the roof </v>

266
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.950
<v Speaker 3>when he was on and he was a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

267
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 3>he was always a super friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

268
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 3>real nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always cool with everybody up.</v>

269
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Despite his appearance as he looked like</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>

270
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.690
<v Speaker 3>the gold teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy beer and left.</v>

271
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.040
<v Speaker 3>We had so much fun with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good guy.</v>

272
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

273
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:23.251
<v Speaker 3>And that's why though it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think there's the argument </v>

274
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:23.251
<v Speaker 3>continues even now in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

275
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 3>What with a rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

276
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:29.851
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come Damien Maia is not getting the </v>

277
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:29.851
<v Speaker 3>next shot at you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyron Woodley.</v>

278
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:29.851
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the money.</v>

279
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not fight that Woodley and wonderboy.</v>

280
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Half to read 100 percent draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree 100 percent,</v>

281
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:40.561
<v Speaker 3>but then I also think dominick Cruz in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cody Garbrandt as much as what a </v>

282
00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:45.421
<v Speaker 3>masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at the backgrounds and </v>

283
00:12:45.421 --> 00:12:48.421
<v Speaker 3>what's happened with in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think dominick Cruz also deserves a </v>

284
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:48.421
<v Speaker 3>rematch.</v>

285
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with that because I don't </v>

286
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Speaker 3>think that was that close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think cody clearly won that fight.</v>

287
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing.</v>

288
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Cody represents what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The body of work that he's done in the </v>

289
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:58.740
<v Speaker 3>shore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

290
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tj dillashaw,</v>

291
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 3>he was an amazing fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but tj has been waiting for a long time.</v>

292
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:07.741
<v Speaker 3>Tj barely lost a fight with dominick was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a razor close decision that could've </v>

293
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 3>gone either way and then he goes on to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be half our sun sal and I just feel like</v>

294
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 3>in his position now and then he beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

295
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

296
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lended Linacre shut her down and that's </v>

297
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:26.330
<v Speaker 3>when there's no exact science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess is what I'm saying in it comes </v>

298
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.030
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to matchmaking and putting together </v>

299
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.030
<v Speaker 3>championship fights and what do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>market the freak,</v>

300
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Speaker 3>the star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominant fighter.</v>

301
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love the sport.</v>

302
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While there's certainly arguments either</v>

303
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.440
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's an interesting triangle </v>

304
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.301
<v Speaker 3>between the three of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of good match ups </v>

305
00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 3>that can be made with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also there's Dodson,</v>

306
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug don't ever sleep on Dotson.</v>

307
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Dotson might've lost to Linacre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think Dodson when he's on is one </v>

308
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.130
<v Speaker 3>of the fastest guys in the division just</v>
<v Speaker 3>glued.</v>

309
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the math,</v>

310
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 3>the weight jumps like a freaking spider </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>

311
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't slip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

312
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.790
<v Speaker 3>And if he catches you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

313
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:03.200
<v Speaker 3>that finishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a guy hasn't wait.</v>

314
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Thunderbolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

315
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:05.310
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lighter,</v>

316
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:06.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say the luck of base camp pop.</v>

317
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Well Cody Garbrandt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dotson,</v>

318
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 3>others are showing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even Demetrius Johnson seems to have,</v>

319
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound for pound,</v>

320
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 3>one of the greats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

321
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite fighters ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's becoming more,</v>

322
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.080
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily more aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

323
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.250
<v Speaker 3>there's some finish now to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to his game as well.</v>

324
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 3>He's always been trying to show you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

325
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find a guy like Ali back off.</v>

326
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

327
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough fucking guy talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>finish those guys.</v>

328
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.390
<v Speaker 3>Let me think about who he finished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He finished Moraga,</v>

329
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.830
<v Speaker 3>finished her Gucci with one second to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

330
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking animals Max out.</v>

331
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Benevidez punch the shit out of pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 3>stops one route.</v>

332
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 3>That's where really I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

333
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:45.590
<v Speaker 3>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

334
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.570
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

335
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping like we've seen with boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

336
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.330
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

337
00:14:50.331 --> 00:14:55.331
<v Speaker 3>the UFC fan base mma fan base begins to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rally around these lighter weight </v>

338
00:14:55.331 --> 00:14:57.820
<v Speaker 3>classes because to me that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's mixed martial arts,</v>

339
00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at its best.</v>

340
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I always want the WEC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't my favorite show because </v>

341
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 3>these guys had full gas tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now nowadays everybody has it.</v>

342
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 3>But at the time were only the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightweights,</v>

343
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 3>lightweights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I love that show.</v>

344
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 3>And then when you see butted up like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

345
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 3>more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

346
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

347
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I think cody garbrandt has a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

348
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Becoming a huge mainstream star was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>handsome guy.</v>

349
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 3>He's a devastating puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amen.</v>

350
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Vicious striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's charismatic,</v>

351
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 3>he's confident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very,</v>

352
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 3>he's very moral and ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

353
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:31.451
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A relationship with that young boy that </v>

354
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:31.451
<v Speaker 3>had leukemia and to help them through </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

355
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like intense,</v>

356
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 3>intense shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

357
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 3>he's a special guy and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't leukemia is.</v>

358
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a special guy.</v>

359
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Stop Shop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

360
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

361
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.060
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just mentioned the podcast.</v>

362
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:44.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

363
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 3>it was almost like he was holding back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

364
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pull it out.</v>

365
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:53.861
<v Speaker 3>Once I've fought fight for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when I really got to show what I </v>

366
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 3>can do because he looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different fighter.</v>

367
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 3>He was always good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this was a whole.</v>

368
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:01.571
<v Speaker 3>But the way he dominated dominick Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally especially leading up to the </v>

369
00:16:01.571 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 3>fight where it appeared that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten,</v>

370
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:07.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cruz had gotten under his skin when he </v>

371
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:07.330
<v Speaker 3>stormed out of the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

372
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:07.960
<v Speaker 3>But from the opening bell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>

373
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

374
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the taunting and stuff,</v>

375
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:14.861
<v Speaker 3>and yet able to back it up and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and show whether it's evolution or </v>

376
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:19.541
<v Speaker 3>whether it was already there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A masterful performance man grew up in </v>

377
00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:23.860
<v Speaker 3>tough environments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that what he said after the </v>

378
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:23.860
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I asked him about it,</v>

379
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.701
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the taunting that didn't </v>

380
00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:27.701
<v Speaker 3>bother you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

381
00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:27.701
<v Speaker 3>I love that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm used to that.</v>

382
00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

383
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 3>that was one where he's comfortable in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

384
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:34.751
<v Speaker 3>he was also able to stay real calm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that world championship spotlight that's</v>

385
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:36.470
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very mature.</v>

386
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Plus you flipped it around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

387
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.200
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shows crews that he doesn't want to </v>

388
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.670
<v Speaker 3>go into this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like walking off.</v>

389
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.910
<v Speaker 3>But then once the fight started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started doing it to Cruz and I think </v>

390
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.910
<v Speaker 3>it got to curse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

391
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.320
<v Speaker 3>pointing at the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the little dance moves.</v>

392
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Guts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit,</v>

393
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.150
<v Speaker 3>cruise for the way he handled the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

394
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.280
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a man not as good as anybody.</v>

395
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kennedy's another one handled it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>good as anybody.</v>

396
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys handled it.</v>

397
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor handled as good as anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat me.</v>

398
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know that's a,</v>

399
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 3>that's as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as admirable,</v>

400
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I'm putting out the correct game plan</v>

401
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:13.610
<v Speaker 3>and winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

402
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:18.611
<v Speaker 3>There's something incredibly admirable </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a guy who can take a loss like a </v>

403
00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>man or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

404
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean anyone who can just accept what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened and that's just what it is.</v>

405
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.990
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very unfortunate when you see </v>

406
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.241
<v Speaker 3>someone that's saying some things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't really make sense like after a </v>

407
00:17:31.241 --> 00:17:35.051
<v Speaker 3>fight or blaming on other people or </v>
<v Speaker 3>blaming it on their camp or blaming it </v>

408
00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:38.290
<v Speaker 3>on an injury and it's just an I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>

409
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.360
<v Speaker 3>you did bring this up and I agree with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in terms of when someone has been </v>

410
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 3>knocked out or someone has been in a a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very grueling,</v>

411
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.520
<v Speaker 3>tough fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why we are forced to </v>

412
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:51.520
<v Speaker 3>interview them</v>

413
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 4>myself to at times where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not right.</v>

414
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 4>I remember</v>

415
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 5>interviewed Cro Cop after the Gonzaga </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight when a Gonzaga head kicked him and</v>

416
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was asking him questions.</v>

417
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 5>He had no idea where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could tell there was no one home.</v>

418
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:14.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean he had just gotten completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>flat lined and I'd said to them then I </v>

419
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.270
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

420
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 5>I really don't think we should interview</v>
<v Speaker 5>people after knockout again,</v>

421
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 5>but I dropped it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We never talked about it again.</v>

422
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:21.770
<v Speaker 5>And then after that one and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

423
00:18:21.771 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 5>So he was out cold and I'm</v>

424
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.560
<v Speaker 4>like you said Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously to where he has,</v>

425
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

426
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 4>thought what he did is he had a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

427
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.130
<v Speaker 4>he really didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really close,</v>

428
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.450
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

429
00:18:35.451 --> 00:18:36.410
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

430
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.470
<v Speaker 4>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunate that I don't see what it </v>

431
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.470
<v Speaker 4>accomplished says anyway.</v>

432
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't make me feel bad too and I got</v>

433
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 5>to give them the opportunity and then I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had to give them an opportunity again </v>

434
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 5>because you couldn't see it for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first time.</v>

435
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 5>So we had to watch it from another </v>
<v Speaker 5>angle.</v>

436
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 5>The other angle reveal that it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>

437
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 5>So it was kind of stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

438
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.260
<v Speaker 5>that's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not done,</v>

439
00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.300
<v Speaker 5>but it's also not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone tells you they had a good </v>

440
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:01.300
<v Speaker 5>team,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to</v>

441
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:01.300
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100,</v>

442
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.230
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fuck</v>

443
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.030
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We saw that he had the gifts and we saw </v>

444
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:08.030
<v Speaker 5>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

445
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:08.030
<v Speaker 5>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we went,</v>

446
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.450
<v Speaker 4>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the bat?</v>

447
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.880
<v Speaker 4>My introduction to probably my very </v>
<v Speaker 4>first show,</v>

448
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Bushido one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our first fight,</v>

449
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 4>Chris Brennan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asian Woods,</v>

450
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.950
<v Speaker 4>Woca.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm settling in,</v>

451
00:19:17.951 --> 00:19:20.020
<v Speaker 4>getting ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really excited working with boss.</v>

452
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.260
<v Speaker 4>And immediately there's controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Brendan had to in the arm bar,</v>

453
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.300
<v Speaker 4>we saw him tap and right away the </v>
<v Speaker 4>referee go,</v>

454
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.340
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening?</v>

455
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:35.450
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually restarted the fight and </v>

456
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.470
<v Speaker 4>seconds later Brendan submits them with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Camorra.</v>

457
00:19:35.471 --> 00:19:37.690
<v Speaker 4>So right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a double submission.</v>

458
00:19:37.691 --> 00:19:38.260
<v Speaker 4>The Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

459
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.480
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

460
00:19:40.481 --> 00:19:43.720
<v Speaker 4>I always a lot of great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's he doing right now?</v>

461
00:19:43.721 --> 00:19:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't talked to</v>

462
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.990
<v Speaker 5>tune in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Last I saw him was at a UFC a couple of </v>

463
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:49.990
<v Speaker 5>years back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said Hi.</v>

464
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Speaker 5>And I know he was teaching them</v>

465
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think on social media.</v>

466
00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:56.861
<v Speaker 4>Every so often I see him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's very successful instructor </v>

<v Speaker 4>Even our good friend John said that that</v>

476
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:20.710
<v Speaker 4>was the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

477
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.190
<v Speaker 4>he owned up to it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

478
00:20:22.191 --> 00:20:23.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy doesn't make many mistakes,</v>

479
00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:27.170
<v Speaker 4>but that one I didn't know that he in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the book regretted a greatly obviously.</v>

480
00:20:27.171 --> 00:20:28.340
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How the fuck am I not from team quest?</v>

484
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just talked about that the other day.</v>

485
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.460
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

486
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.680
<v Speaker 4>he got Matt Lindland an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt</v>

487
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 5>millen tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he didn't tap.</v>

488
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 5>They restarted again</v>

489
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 3>and then he got him in to get to you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next round.</v>

490
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On top of the world,</v>

491
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:54.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

492
00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:58.680
<v Speaker 3>it was such a great rivalry to backup </v>
<v Speaker 3>private btt and um,</v>

493
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:03.770
<v Speaker 3>and the shooter box man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was to the point where they get old </v>

494
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 3>even walking by each other like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

495
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

496
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

497
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intense rivalry which made for </v>

498
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

499
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legendary matchups when we're talking </v>

500
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.970
<v Speaker 3>about the way here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was giant.</v>

501
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

502
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

503
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.561
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys represented like this wild </v>

504
00:21:21.561 --> 00:21:21.561
<v Speaker 3>west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

505
00:21:21.561 --> 00:21:21.561
<v Speaker 3>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

506
00:21:21.561 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 3>everything was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

507
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there were also at the time,</v>

508
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 3>these were the best bet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're white whiting was also the </v>

509
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 3>mix of the what we already talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were talking on the way here.</v>

510
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Mauricio Shogun Hua.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember 2:23</v>

511
00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 3>years old goes through Quentin rampage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson,</v>

512
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Antonio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

513
00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:45.731
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Nogueira,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best fights in pride history </v>

514
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:48.010
<v Speaker 3>and then in one night Alistair overeem </v>
<v Speaker 3>and record to win that Grand Prix.</v>

515
00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 3>And you don't say what Jon Jones did at </v>
<v Speaker 3>23.</v>

516
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 3>God bless them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

517
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:56.401
<v Speaker 3>One of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Mauricio Shogun Hua beast at that </v>

518
00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:56.401
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

519
00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a lot of guys and it's </v>

520
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.861
<v Speaker 3>almost like I would have loved to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen what Nogueira in his prime would </v>

521
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:05.581
<v Speaker 3>have been able to do in the UFC and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would've loved to seen what fate or in </v>

522
00:22:05.581 --> 00:22:07.560
<v Speaker 3>his prime because essentially when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nogueira fought fader door,</v>

523
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 3>he was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

524
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was that pre or post Bob Sapp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was after.</v>

525
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 3>After he fought a sap at the national </v>
<v Speaker 3>stadium.</v>

526
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:21.110
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>post Bob Sapp,</v>

527
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
<v Speaker 3>you have to take into consideration how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much damage he took Bob's hats because </v>

528
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.901
<v Speaker 3>he got beat the fuck that was dropped on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his head due to compensating.</v>

529
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

530
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:38.251
<v Speaker 3>we got this first death right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like optum headfirst and nice.</v>

531
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred and 50 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's similar with the monster plex,</v>

532
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:43.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our dearly departed friend,</v>

533
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:48.301
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Randleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When fresh off of upsetting miracle </v>

534
00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:50.820
<v Speaker 3>puppy goes and drops off fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

535
00:22:50.821 --> 00:22:55.821
<v Speaker 3>fader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million Neko let you say would have </v>

536
00:22:55.821 --> 00:22:58.201
<v Speaker 3>been very good to see what we had done </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his prime because even despite being </v>

537
00:22:58.201 --> 00:23:02.011
<v Speaker 3>dropped on his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calmly coolly regrouped and then submit </v>

538
00:23:02.011 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 3>randleman with the memorial about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute and a half later.</v>

539
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>

540
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fatal Aurion is prime.</v>

541
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.370
<v Speaker 3>She's the one thing that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's actually just interesting.</v>

542
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.340
<v Speaker 3>It's cool to see those old videos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wash those old fights.</v>

543
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>But there's something about like epic </v>
<v Speaker 3>matchups between great fighters,</v>

544
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:25.501
<v Speaker 3>like did the opportunity of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 3>Velasquez in his prime versus fade or in</v>

545
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 3>his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have loved to see.</v>

546
00:23:27.551 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 3>That would have been so for all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries.</v>

547
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I would have loved to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

548
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

549
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Who did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

550
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 3>we didn't get to see miracle one fader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which at the time,</v>

551
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:40.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the most anticipated </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight fight in MMA history.</v>

552
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Most amazing about that fight is fatal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beat him standing.</v>

553
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.130
<v Speaker 3>That's why we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

554
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 3>He is the one</v>

555
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 4>that adapted and beat miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What his most potent weapon.</v>

556
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 4>He's this guy that he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His striking,</v>

557
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:55.940
<v Speaker 4>it looks not technical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he strikes it's perfect.</v>

558
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.500
<v Speaker 4>There's no load up whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He holds his fistdale and from here it </v>

559
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.720
<v Speaker 4>goes forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can tell when he shot is accurate.</v>

560
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:08.110
<v Speaker 4>Is a member of the entry cost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with Antonio Gigolo guarantee you </v>

561
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 4>the final.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tournament.</v>

562
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:12.070
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he would enter the garden.</v>

563
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what Fabrizio Verdon did </v>
<v Speaker 4>this homework,</v>

564
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:17.590
<v Speaker 4>because remember they're doom almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>bay.</v>

565
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Well he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He baited him when,</v>

566
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.200
<v Speaker 4>when he submitted them and I think doom </v>
<v Speaker 4>Shaka fight also right when it goes soka</v>

567
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.370
<v Speaker 4>fought fader,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a timer,</v>

568
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 4>the rematch and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

569
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 4>That he was throwing these bombs and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the commentating.</v>

570
00:24:32.901 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

571
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 4>he's really overcommitting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should watch out.</v>

572
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.820
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't fall into a triangle choke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they brought that piece and it </v>

573
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.350
<v Speaker 4>put it next to the piece.</v>

574
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Whitey Ford for doom you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what happened.</v>

575
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:46.750
<v Speaker 4>He was over committing and right away </v>
<v Speaker 4>they slept on that triangle to,</v>

576
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.490
<v Speaker 4>against tk though was ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

577
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:50.140
<v Speaker 4>The elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

578
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 4>it was a rings though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a.</v>

579
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 4>That was an egregious error.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should not have been.</v>

580
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

581
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.920
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why it should've.</v>

582
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 4>It should've been a victory for us </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

583
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 4>No elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the grads.</v>

584
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.740
<v Speaker 4>The man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I think back now,</v>

585
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 4>the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

586
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:14.330
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like there was no real rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no ground and pound.</v>

587
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they also,</v>

588
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:16.530
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

589
00:25:16.531 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

590
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:22.571
<v Speaker 4>came from old wrestling and then into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rings you could hit to the body on </v>

591
00:25:22.571 --> 00:25:23.250
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that how it works?</v>

592
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Clue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

593
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like you couldn't hit to the </v>

594
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.130
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird rule on a promotion that </v>

595
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:32.130
<v Speaker 4>introduced people to two people like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fate or Antonio,</v>

596
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Rodrigo Nogueira,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan Henderson.</v>

597
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all go babaloo.</v>

598
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 4>Sobrato rings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

599
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 4>produced a whole bunch of man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

600
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.140
<v Speaker 4>I wish would have been nice to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

601
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 4>Our friend joined us for some of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

602
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 4>I should have definitely made a trip </v>
<v Speaker 4>over there just to watch,</v>

603
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was thinking of flying to see </v>

604
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 4>fade or fight against material man to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever make it over there.</v>

605
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not this life,</v>

606
00:25:55.210 --> 00:26:00.210
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's one of the things </v>

607
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:00.210
<v Speaker 4>that I probably should have saw it pride</v>
<v Speaker 4>in its prime.</v>

608
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 4>I always tell people out 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>seats.</v>

609
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I remember Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came for the first time,</v>

610
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:07.810
<v Speaker 4>but it was the first row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember when I look back,</v>

611
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 4>when the opening started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked back at east with his mouth </v>

612
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 4>open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks around to go.</v>

613
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.550
<v Speaker 4>This is the craziest things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parents.</v>

614
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:15.100
<v Speaker 4>I remember looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

615
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

616
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was insane.</v>

617
00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:22.991
<v Speaker 4>He brought chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember drover and Quinton rampage.</v>

618
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Jackson five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

619
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 4>the but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there you go though the,</v>

620
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.560
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC used to have the ramp and the </v>

621
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 4>elaborate entrances and I know they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to separate from my other light </v>

622
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 4>of employment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wwe and the wrestling aspect,</v>

623
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:41.471
<v Speaker 4>but don't know Bella toward does a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty decent job when their entrances </v>

624
00:26:41.471 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that is something that</v>

625
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 1>could help UFC now or is it or is it you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the boxing entrance that's pure,</v>

626
00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport aspect of it.</v>

627
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Because I think fans in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

628
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean the production values were </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and I think it was,</v>

629
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 1>it added to the experience while it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely a different thing,</v>

630
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

631
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:03.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like this,</v>

632
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past UFC with Ronda Rousey and Amanda </v>

633

<v Speaker 1>Nunez walking down the tunnel that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like just watching weather all those </v>

<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

635
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give a fuck about fireworks.</v>

636
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

637
00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what someone's face looks </v>

638
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're about to go to war.</v>

639
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went and watched the you,</v>

640
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>

641
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's recorded.</v>

642
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I turned my phone off and that's where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go fast forward.</v>

643
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I go to the fights to pick something up.</v>

644
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>When you then had to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

645
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.580
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

646
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

647
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:36.591
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a little bit of idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it shows you how much I </v>

648
00:27:36.591 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 1>wonder in joy it Yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video footage that they had,</v>

649
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 1>the pride fighting championships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the one would feed or woke up</v>

650
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.210
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a tree was amazing for sure.</v>

651
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Like movie trailers for the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd show you the tea that the movie </v>

652
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.931
<v Speaker 1>trailer and they were not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show it to the American audience for </v>

653
00:27:56.931 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 1>some reason to add this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they weren't allowed to</v>

654
00:27:57.841 --> 00:27:59.410
<v Speaker 1>show the movie trailer part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

655
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Tokyo TV or wherever.</v>

656
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Whoever had that contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

657
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 1>GTV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>GTV and they get like 5 million bucks to</v>

658
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:10.440

<v Speaker 1>you're shows would either be like 4:00</v>

659

<v Speaker 1>so we'd have.</v>

660
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I'd have guys over my house at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

661
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Everybody be drinking red bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to stay awake and then pride </v>

662
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.501
<v Speaker 1>would come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you guys would have the fights and </v>

663
00:28:21.501 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 1>then it would air on tv a while later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like later.</v>

664
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to break it.</v>

665
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I was calling all the windows and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

666
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 1>to see what gambling if we could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something with that.</v>

667
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't.</v>

668
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Cubs win the world series and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody knew the results,</v>

669
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all the websites.</v>

670
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 1>So you just watched to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

671
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I combat sports is the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget football,</v>

672
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:44.260
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey,</v>

673
00:28:44.261 --> 00:28:46.110
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if I know the result,</v>

674
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I will watch a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 1>If I know the result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch a fight too.</v>

676
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the,</v>

677
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep?</v>

678
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as good,</v>

679
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

680
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:58.560
<v Speaker 1>There's something maybe because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more digestible size,</v>

681
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find fighting to be something,</v>

682
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

683
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I will watch other than if I record a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hockey game and I know the score will </v>

684
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.240
<v Speaker 1>and screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not watching it.</v>

685
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

686
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I was reading some of the responses to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Metal Meryl Streep.</v>

687
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>She's crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just blasted for Olympic sports.</v>

688
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:19.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

689
00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.710
<v Speaker 1>What the comedian what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in what context do you think she.</v>

690
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>My knee jerk reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

691
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love me some murals street,</v>

692
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 1>but why do you have to trash at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayor?</v>

693
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if she didn't even ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what mixed martial arts was.</v>

694
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Someone gave her the word with arts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and she made the time.</v>

695
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even arts,</v>

696
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 1>but if football doesn't say football </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>

697
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see.</v>

698
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Went after mixed martial arts because</v>

699
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.400
<v Speaker 3>she said the word arts and then she </v>
<v Speaker 3>ripped it.</v>

700
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Your right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

701
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are like,</v>

702
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what?</v>

703
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 3>What Arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 3>it's not the art of pretending you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

705
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 3>It's the art of execution under extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>

706
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Very difficult circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly trained opponent,</v>

707
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:02.791
<v Speaker 3>trying to smash bones in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly difficult to do advantage </v>

708
00:30:02.791 --> 00:30:02.791
<v Speaker 3>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

709
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.710
<v Speaker 3>It's artistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me.</v>

710
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.770
<v Speaker 3>When Anderson Silva landed that front </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick to veto Belfort's face and you see </v>

711
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 3>his legs given that's art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's art.</v>

712
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.870
<v Speaker 3>What about Joan and on Anderson Silva or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hook right into the heel hook.</v>

713
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.430
<v Speaker 3>That was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like a movie scene,</v>

714
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jujitsu is art.</v>

715
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 3>A brutal piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Quentin,</v>

716
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:29.221
<v Speaker 3>rampage Jackson Queer Carto Rona Slam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

717
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 3>he arches backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

718
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 3>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone actually call that shot a few </v>

719
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.470
<v Speaker 3>seconds before you saw it coming.</v>

720
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Believed in Christ to hold onto that </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

721
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.190
<v Speaker 3>hold on gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let go of that fucking thing.</v>

722
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:46.200
<v Speaker 3>But then the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't.</v>

723
00:30:46.201 --> 00:30:48.960
<v Speaker 3>You did see this smash heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

724
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your wife,</v>

725
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.630
<v Speaker 3>why did he hold on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's probably gone anyway?</v>

726
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 3>And even if the young smash heads up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

727
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:58.771
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact was so brutal there a Ronan </v>

728
00:30:58.771 --> 00:30:58.771
<v Speaker 3>was essentially never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

729
00:30:58.771 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never really fought well again after </v>

730
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 3>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was so much potential.</v>

731
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.920
<v Speaker 3>But you know what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking again.</v>

732
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Paolo filio another gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

733
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.090

<v Speaker 3>Did you see God?</v>

734
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Good Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was Sassy the evolution of him or what </v>

735
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.691
<v Speaker 3>he's now doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's at the door of the top guys in </v>

736
00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:20.820
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

737
00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I need to say about a role now because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was interviewing a rohde and he had a </v>

738
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.371
<v Speaker 3>cup of tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese green tea was standing here as </v>

739
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 3>somebody and it was so cool that he kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>his cool.</v>

740
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:31.650
<v Speaker 3>So good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed the thing,</v>

741
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 3>fell off and he's sitting and he does </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and he comes up here at the cuff.</v>

742
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:40.550
<v Speaker 6>He grabbed this school because I know it</v>
<v Speaker 6>is going to go.</v>

743
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:44.320
<v Speaker 6>Just</v>

744
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 3>not looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he brings it back up and he sets it </v>

745
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.941
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man Jitsu Stud as was Paula Filio yeah.</v>

746
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Paula was one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got you on the ground,</v>

747
00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:57.170
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking pitch.</v>

748
00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.790
<v Speaker 3>You'll do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

749
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.060
<v Speaker 3>will you just call it a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started the radio and Louisa,</v>

750
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

751
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 3>in Bushido want to say it was an to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earliest example for me and probably</v>

752
00:32:09.921 --> 00:32:14.921
<v Speaker 3>one of the best grappling fights I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in an mma arena member,</v>

753
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Ricardo Arona and dean lister and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>rematch from the Abu Dhabi and we were </v>

754
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.720
<v Speaker 3>pumping the crap out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

755
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:25.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't the most fan friendly friend.</v>

756
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you guys about this cobalt on</v>

757
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.350
<v Speaker 3>my mind because I'm tired of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about grappling matches,</v>

758
00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.480
<v Speaker 3>what did you guys think about Aoki?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>

759
00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to wear those tights and uh,</v>

760
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he went to fight in us,</v>

761
00:32:36.111 --> 00:32:38.750
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't let him wear the tights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo and I have talked about this</v>

762
00:32:38.751 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 3>a million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

763
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a problem with him wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tights.</v>

764
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Like why does he get the sweat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has more traction.</v>

765
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.320
<v Speaker 1>But girls can wear like rash guard tops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

766
00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Can they cover their arms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can girls cover their arms?</v>

767
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

768
00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should not be allowed to do that.</v>

769
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

770
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think he should have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to have fun?</v>

771
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.080
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watched Aoki fighting got to rap </v>

772
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 1>dudes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's crazy legs.</v>

773
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 1>The tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tax man.</v>

774
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>George Grid gels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ACL.</v>

775
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

776
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll go roll on your knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Yoakim Hanson.</v>

777
00:33:26.641 --> 00:33:31.130
<v Speaker 1>You wish you Manson when the walk off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another guy that I wonder why it</v>

778
00:33:31.131 --> 00:33:36.131
<v Speaker 1>never came to the UFC when he apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want like,</v>

779
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you know when the UFC bought pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the contracts.</v>

780
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:40.370
<v Speaker 1>He apparently didn't want to come over.</v>

781
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also has been a ton of war man.</v>

782
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

783
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I think he just fought again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I read.</v>

784
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Or retired by boy from Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

785
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember what he was.</v>

786
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:58.331
<v Speaker 1>He was powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember he was one of the few guys </v>

787
00:33:58.331 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 1>that can actually hurt you from a back </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

788
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:04.510
<v Speaker 1>So one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Russian one time who knocked somebody </v>

789
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:04.510
<v Speaker 1>out to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mounted him,</v>

790
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.650
<v Speaker 1>really laid on his back and he a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>swing and he wins the fight.</v>

791
00:34:07.651 --> 00:34:12.651
<v Speaker 1>He knocks the guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy had mounted him event where it </v>

792
00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 1>said that Duane Ludwig broke his orbital</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone when Dwayne was on his back.</v>

793
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne swung up and crack even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeball and broke his little hole from </v>

794
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That which he did the coolest thing.</v>

795
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:26.381
<v Speaker 1>What I always wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you know at the Bartow?</v>

796
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's important stance on one </v>

797
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.841
<v Speaker 1>leg and then go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling my students about this,</v>

798
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that you can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never did it.</v>

799
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an old man.</v>

800
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He was a part he and train a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me as well and actually had that </v>

801
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:45.880
<v Speaker 1>great fight on seeing here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

807
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:06.821

<v Speaker 4>to to it.</v>

1048
00:45:20.721 --> 00:45:25.721
<v Speaker 4>At that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all get up and they run out the </v>

1049
00:45:25.721 --> 00:45:28.141
<v Speaker 4>displays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They locked the door and I look at </v>

1050
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:28.141
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1051
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:28.141
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1052
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 4>because this is a really weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1053
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't.</v>

1054
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 4>He did a great work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1055
00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:35.790
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started looking.</v>

1056
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.360
<v Speaker 4>We made it big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take a video of you.</v>

1057
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:44.361
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I have a skull with a bullet </v>

1058
00:45:44.361 --> 00:45:47.031
<v Speaker 4>hole in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Record an audio will as well because </v>

1059
00:45:47.031 --> 00:45:51.290
<v Speaker 4>there was a cage where Masato used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickbox deadline,</v>

1060
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 4>so he would train in a cage in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>basement.</v>

1061
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five stories below.</v>

1062
00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 4>We kept going down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the craziest thing.</v>

1063
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:01.880
<v Speaker 4>If you think about they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1064
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:06.890
<v Speaker 4>you go like that with the Dobermans in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their regular trading joe.</v>

1065
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.400
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the guy said that it was </v>

1066
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Masato me may have even maybe had an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest in Masato fought cool.</v>

1067
00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:15.510
<v Speaker 4>Vince Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>

1068
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Vince Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American boxing champion,</v>

1069
00:46:19.991 --> 00:46:20.870
<v Speaker 4>the boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1070
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 4>And he went over and fought Masato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Masato lift those legs.</v>

1071
00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Chagas animal at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean even against the Dutch guy.</v>

1072
00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 4>So you can find Masato versus weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Phillips is really interesting to see </v>

1073
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.760
<v Speaker 4>you lift those legs up like a Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree box.</v>

1074
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Top flight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>American boxer fight against a kickboxer</v>

1075
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 4>prime max.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand three.</v>

1076
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:52.410

<v Speaker 4>he was beyond his privacy.</v>

1079
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 4>His body had started to fade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1080
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:59.661
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was kicking kicked across the </v>

1081
00:46:59.661 --> 00:47:01.881
<v Speaker 4>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But who was it that took one kick and </v>

1082
00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:02.440
<v Speaker 4>got out of the ring?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ray Mercer reimbursing,</v>

1083
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 4>knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mercer was a with the Kimbo when the</v>

<v Speaker 4>the American boxer and took one kick and</v>

1086
00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:12.410
<v Speaker 4>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Out of the rain.</v>

1087
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Came on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1088
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:13.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:16.820
<v Speaker 4>It was more not more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

1090
00:47:16.821 --> 00:47:17.750
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1091
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1092
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similar.</v>

1093
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:25.581
<v Speaker 4>It was a blonde guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But look at Masada was awesome sense.</v>

1095
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.120
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't really helpful to the kids and</v>

1096
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 3>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going across to cross the arms and</v>

1097
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:36.190
<v Speaker 3>then across the back leg to rob came and</v>
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>

1098
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.460
<v Speaker 3>He did a lot of that and he just moved a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot and just kick those legs like every </v>

1099
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.181
<v Speaker 3>time we there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see Phillips is already starting to </v>

1100
00:47:45.181 --> 00:47:45.181
<v Speaker 3>wear down and Masato was a good boxer to</v>
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

1101
00:47:45.181 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like you couldn't deny his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1102
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:48.820
<v Speaker 3>he might not have been the same box with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vince.</v>

1103
00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Phillips was in prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all those leg kicks.</v>

1104
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:52.990
<v Speaker 3>It makes such a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember?</v>

1105
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Go Me and Paul over at shockwave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1106
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was some of the best mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing bus we'd seen at that time would </v>

1107
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.480
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes down.</v>

1108
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.330
<v Speaker 3>He just couldn't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you remember that film?</v>

1109
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:13.070
<v Speaker 3>He knocked him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about her hair?</v>

1110
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.310
<v Speaker 3>We're taught off as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sergei.</v>

1111
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.400
<v Speaker 3>We're taught early in pride show.</v>

1112
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Good box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has that debate and argument </v>

1113
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:21.400
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1114
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:21.400
<v Speaker 3>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would they do it?</v>

1115
00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 3>We know it's two different sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to that aspect of MMA,</v>

1116
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 3>the boxing will start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gameplan indicate one surgeon,</v>

1117
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 3>he had quite a few [inaudible] and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently got back into mma,</v>

1118
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:33.220
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't,</v>

1119
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got clipped.</v>

1120
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Complete animal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to train the fader.</v>

1121
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:45.961
<v Speaker 3>I remember all the way back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one big group because that </v>

1122
00:48:45.961 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 3>remembered a split at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching what happened to him.</v>

1123
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:49.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a great guy to illustrate.</v>

1124
00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice Guy.</v>

1125
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 3>One of the scariest stoppages I oversaw </v>
<v Speaker 3>was um,</v>

1126
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was against semi shelt.</v>

1127
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when he mounted semi </v>
<v Speaker 3>shelter and got on top of them and like </v>

1128
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.961
<v Speaker 3>a mounted triangle and start smashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aratana punching them.</v>

1129
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1130
00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1131
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just punching them in one eye over </v>

1132
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:13.990
<v Speaker 3>and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

1133
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 3>That was sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

1134
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a physical.</v>

1135
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:22.980
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't have the ground round </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly with Keratin on right then.</v>

1136
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.190
<v Speaker 3>And Keratan off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just took him onto.</v>

1137
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was back when she sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was beating everybody in key with that </v>

1138
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.541
<v Speaker 3>long Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy at the time.</v>

1139
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.120
<v Speaker 3>The first time I sold for change it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was commentating this fight in the </v>

1140
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Ukraine and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a while ago.</v>

1141
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.940
<v Speaker 3>That was a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the whole trip was a wild trip.</v>

1142
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Oscar Charlie Anzalone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the folks from Vegas,</v>

1143
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1144
00:49:47.361 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 3>he put in an eight men tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the lightest guys,</v>

1145
00:49:50.471 --> 00:49:53.650
<v Speaker 3>like under 90 pound tournament and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed all these guys.</v>

1146
00:49:53.651 --> 00:49:55.960
<v Speaker 3>I think the lightest guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fought to a supple violence.</v>

1147
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 3>That was the lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy at two to 3:30.</v>

1148
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1149
00:50:01.181 --> 00:50:03.340
<v Speaker 3>do I need just knocked everybody out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go like,</v>

1150
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.310
<v Speaker 3>this Chechen guy gets a pretty good.</v>

1151
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:12.570
<v Speaker 3>I remember he fought on this big giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>matt once they did something that was </v>

1152
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 3>almost like they made it up a basketball</v>
<v Speaker 3>court and he fought on it.</v>

1153
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been bringing this up a lot </v>

1154
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think mma we'd be better off of</v>

1155
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.920
<v Speaker 3>the largest surface and no cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a basketball court,</v>

1156
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 3>just like that site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welford sightlines definitely.</v>

1157
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you and teach us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about what came up against the kid?</v>

1158
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.040
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metamorris type fighting surface for </v>

1159
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.040
<v Speaker 3>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't weld.</v>

1160
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.430
<v Speaker 3>The problem metamorphosis is elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1161
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fallen.</v>

1162
00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:40.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1163
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1164
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:46.100
<v Speaker 3>But that kind of like that'll do space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a big open space on the ground,</v>

1165
00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:51.101
<v Speaker 3>just mad at ground level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You almost to let a cage though to had </v>

1166
00:50:51.101 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 3>they had the tip for cameras is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna work.</v>

1167
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.840
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be very hard for the audience</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see as well because it's all one </v>

1168
00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.850
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's in a lot of people.</v>

1169
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Accord is all one level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:08.141
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say though when they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to an event that they are watching the </v>

1172
00:51:08.141 --> 00:51:11.291
<v Speaker 3>screen because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you could do it on a </v>

1173
00:51:11.291 --> 00:51:12.110
<v Speaker 3>basketball court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just think that it.</v>

1174
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:14.900
<v Speaker 3>It dates still see here at a basketball </v>
<v Speaker 3>boards,</v>

1175
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.200
<v Speaker 3>the people on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can at least see the cage,</v>

1176
00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:20.310
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody sits in front of him,</v>

1177
00:51:20.311 --> 00:51:21.820
<v Speaker 3>they can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1178
00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:26.850
<v Speaker 3>if you have tiered seating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have like stadium style seating </v>

1179
00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:30.311
<v Speaker 3>and then there's be a front row and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be some sort of dividing </v>

1180
00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:31.010
<v Speaker 3>line because you don't want to get run </v>
<v Speaker 3>over if you're in the front row.</v>

1181
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Some fucking gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like wrestling a college wrestling.</v>

1182
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 3>If a referral comes piling through and </v>
<v Speaker 3>slams on your girlfriend and breaks both</v>

1184
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 3>her legs or Travis Browne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in the front row.</v>

1185
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a problem,</v>

1186
00:51:44.281 --> 00:51:45.400
<v Speaker 3>but it could be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The front row,</v>

1187
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 3>it could be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as long as they keep people from bug</v>

1188
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 3>piling into the crowd because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have that,</v>

1189
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 3>you would be able to watch something </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened with no cages.</v>

1190
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing that I see over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again,</v>

1191
00:51:56.721 --> 00:52:01.721
<v Speaker 3>like it's a very grueling aspect to mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>when guys are tied up against the cage </v>

1192
00:52:01.721 --> 00:52:05.411
<v Speaker 3>and they're clenching and it throw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice the body and they're throwing </v>

1193
00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:08.440
<v Speaker 3>elbows and titan is a grueling sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also grueling in an artificial </v>

1194
00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:12.731
<v Speaker 3>way like it's artificial that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressed up against something and that </v>

1195
00:52:12.731 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 3>that cage becomes a factor in the fight.</v>

1196
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:19.200
<v Speaker 3>What it doesn't have to be a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the more factors you can remove </v>

1197
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.800
<v Speaker 3>extraneous factors outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent,</v>

1198
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:26.801
<v Speaker 3>the better to fall is an extraneous </v>
<v Speaker 3>factor and you could use it to your </v>

1199
00:52:26.801 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 3>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be pressed people up,</v>

1200
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:33.101
<v Speaker 3>he'd take them down with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things you could do to </v>

1201
00:52:33.101 --> 00:52:34.520
<v Speaker 3>get back up from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really feel like it's an automatic</v>

1202
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:37.490
<v Speaker 3>brake or is that taking too much that </v>
<v Speaker 3>away for the fight.</v>

1203
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:38.900
<v Speaker 3>If you go against the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped.</v>

1204
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm still going to have electricity on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fence that that would be something I</v>

1205
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:53.470
<v Speaker 3>championships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it will hold people who are total </v>

1206
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.651
<v Speaker 3>savages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would hold someone against the </v>

1207
00:52:56.651 --> 00:52:56.651
<v Speaker 3>fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see who could take the pain,</v>

1208
00:52:56.651 --> 00:52:59.951
<v Speaker 3>the most bold jolted to the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>going from a former ring to a cage is </v>

1209
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:13.421
<v Speaker 3>already huge because there's no corner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can only imagine that that means </v>

1210
00:53:13.421 --> 00:53:13.520
<v Speaker 3>she'd know the wool walking no more.</v>

1211
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Everything that Bernard Hopkins knockout</v>
<v Speaker 3>last week,</v>

1212
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.920
<v Speaker 3>not last week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last month or so,</v>

1213
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.760
<v Speaker 3>went through that ring like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fell down on his head.</v>

1214
00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they not protect against this?</v>

1215
00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 3>We have to remember there was a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>pride frank to already there with their </v>

1216
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:43.560
<v Speaker 3>numbers on their back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember this kid that was.</v>

1217
00:53:43.561 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 3>But that was always one of the problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the pride ring,</v>

1218
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:48.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were forced to break lion fight too.</v>

1219
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I was watching one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car Hollenbeck's fights and he,</v>

1220
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.230
<v Speaker 3>he fell out of the ring and smacked his </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees on the edge of the,</v>

1221
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:56.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apron as he was falling out.</v>

1222
00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I remember Marvin Eastman falling out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ring of Vancouver almost seriously </v>

1223
00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 3>hurting himself as well before he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>the goats for Jonah.</v>

1224
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they have like a netting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the ropes to keep prevent people</v>

1225
00:54:08.131 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 3>from falling through?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still serves the same purpose.</v>

1226
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.200
<v Speaker 3>You would think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1227
00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1228
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 3>more vertical rope to swell in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the old valley to doe </v>

1229
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.950
<v Speaker 3>fight between Palae and Chuck Liddell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:25.990
<v Speaker 3>They had a net under the first rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom row was shoving them in there</v>

1231
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 3>and they were bare knuckle fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>chocolates,</v>

1232
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 3>punched him in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bare knuckle,</v>

1233
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:37.610
<v Speaker 3>and he couldn't escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would just tucked in there like a </v>

1234
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 3>fish fuck beat out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1235
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Gary Goodrich with the Pedro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he went to squeeze the pillow does.</v>

1236
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went right into his pants and grabbed</v>

1237
00:54:44.941 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 3>a hold of his junk and crushed his balls</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his hand and he had some grit.</v>

1238
00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you,</v>

1239
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:55.360
<v Speaker 3>I listened to a hotel one time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a massage and while I'm getting </v>

1240
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.540
<v Speaker 3>the massage to the girl that put a towel</v>
<v Speaker 3>over your face,</v>

1241
00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know who's massaging me.</v>

1242
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:04.850
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly the massage gets stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stronger and stronger as she starts </v>

1243
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 3>crushing my shins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1244
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 3>like really hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I throw the towel and go,</v>

1245
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:10.450
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a big data,</v>

1246
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.520
<v Speaker 3>good risk taking over to massage my </v>
<v Speaker 3>legs.</v>

1247
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.430
<v Speaker 3>So I know he has a grip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1248
00:55:19.431 --> 00:55:21.280
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy thing that was a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1249
00:55:21.281 --> 00:55:26.281
<v Speaker 3>you were allowed to grab the balls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so what about the rules will never see </v>

1250
00:55:26.611 --> 00:55:27.510
<v Speaker 3>knees to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1251
00:55:27.511 --> 00:55:32.511
<v Speaker 3>Under the unified rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just implemented some more rules </v>

1252
00:55:32.511 --> 00:55:35.601
<v Speaker 3>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want it to get rid of the midnight </v>

1253
00:55:35.601 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 3>to 12 to six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they changed that,</v>

1254
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:37.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should explain to people what it </v>

1256
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.941
<v Speaker 3>means in mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You not allowed to drop an elbow down </v>

1257
00:55:43.941 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 3>from like vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can drop it from 12 to 6:00</v>

1258
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 3>and the only reason why that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented back in the day when the </v>

1259
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.990
<v Speaker 3>commissions were approving mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big John Mccarthy had to meet with them </v>

1260
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:57.741
<v Speaker 3>and they wouldn't let anybody do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they had seen people break </v>

1261
00:55:57.741 --> 00:55:59.220
<v Speaker 3>bricks on espn by dropping elbows like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1262
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.220
<v Speaker 3>And like if someone could pick a brick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could kill a person can do it like </v>

1263
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:04.220
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1264
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.960
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1265
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:08.540
<v Speaker 3>it's probably like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1266
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it's the week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be my weakest elbow,</v>

1267
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.500
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the weaker elbows.</v>

1268
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:18.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's nearly as strong as </v>

1269
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:19.941
<v Speaker 3>that kind of elbow pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you hit a skull and I can tell it's </v>

1270
00:56:19.941 --> 00:56:19.941
<v Speaker 3>totally still splinted for me when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall.</v>

1271
00:56:19.941 --> 00:56:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Adrenaline and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1272
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:22.790
<v Speaker 3>That was from three to whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1273
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that door,</v>

1274
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 3>horizontal elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still you don't want to hit.</v>

1275
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.670
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.620
<v Speaker 3>You get field as little pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1277
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's from this call from Kevin.</v>

1278
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1279
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1280
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 3>it's just a dumb rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1281
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 3>and that's the one blemish and Jon Jones</v>
<v Speaker 3>record when he fought.</v>

1282
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Dropping those elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1283
00:56:41.871 --> 00:56:42.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1284
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they haven't put that </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in a while.</v>

1286
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's what they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1287
00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they hit an nice socket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>may bend to.</v>

1288
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I could be really damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then again you can do that standing </v>

1289
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:02.930
<v Speaker 3>like someone could tomahawk you standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it could go right into your eye </v>

1290
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 3>socket about soccer kicks and stomps Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogen.</v>

1291
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1292
00:57:04.451 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have if we had a basketball court,</v>

1293
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:13.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have soccer kicks on the </v>

1294
00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:13.110
<v Speaker 3>ground like for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

1295
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think violent.</v>

1296
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 3>I've never punched somebody on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

1297
00:57:16.481 --> 00:57:19.790
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to kick a member of </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was.</v>

1298
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.530
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stomping is great,</v>

1299
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.460
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't believe it tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1300
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Condo condo veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's actually cut the Czech Republic </v>

1301
00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.710
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why he?</v>

1302
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he saw a box team.</v>

1303
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Mauricio Shogun Hua loves soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

1304
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:44.040
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he pedaled kick this big ring Sakharova.</v>

1305
00:57:44.041 --> 00:57:46.170
<v Speaker 3>His face looked like the elephant man to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1306
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.240
<v Speaker 3>There were some violent tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Environment I think is probably once </v>

1307
00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 3>when Sakharova fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melvin manhoef.</v>

1308
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.680
<v Speaker 3>That was horrendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melvin was coming up in his prime and </v>

1309
00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.011
<v Speaker 3>Sakharova was on the way down in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melvin was arguably one of the scariest </v>

1310
00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 3>strikers of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just unbelievably violent.</v>

1311
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Just took violence to a totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>different level,</v>

1312
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.660
<v Speaker 3>knocked out Mark Hunt.</v>

1313
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had a double mark,</v>

1314
00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:19.471
<v Speaker 3>had a double knock out there and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to pull it up to see if I'm </v>

1315
00:58:19.471 --> 00:58:20.070
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe if my shirts,</v>

1316
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 3>we was locked out twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1317
00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 3>he was knocked out and when he fell down</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hits the cup also for maneuver and we</v>

1318
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:28.530
<v Speaker 3>had all of the old steel cups and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>hits a talk.</v>

1319
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.750
<v Speaker 3>He falls down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sees boom under coping.</v>

1320
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe that sealed the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1321
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.160
<v Speaker 3>They're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll find that.</v>

1322
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Find that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark hunted.</v>

1323
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Well now we will probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or what's he doing with the lot.</v>

1324
00:58:40.471 --> 00:58:41.910
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy,</v>

1325
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.880
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got the UFC because the UFC day </v>

1326
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 3>he's saying that they knew here here's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1327
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

1328
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Go right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope my charges paid him full under.</v>

1329
00:58:59.481 --> 00:59:04.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need bumps and forward with the Times </v>

1330
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 3>on the way down to go and mark the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1331
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 3>right into the steel account man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like he was sprawling almost.</v>

1332
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 3>You push his hips forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1333
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1334
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.880
<v Speaker 3>he still is an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy that ever lived</v>

1335
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 4>by the sword wore one of those steel </v>
<v Speaker 4>cups.</v>

1336
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:29.111
<v Speaker 4>Will is a mere renova already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to wear one of those steel cups </v>

1337
00:59:29.111 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 4>and he'd get on top of mount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet with that fucking Steel Cup,</v>

1338
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:36.010
<v Speaker 4>he was quite the goddamn weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Press it into things that he was the </v>

1339
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:40.751
<v Speaker 4>star of your stag stag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still people that are under steady in </v>

1340
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 4>half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1341
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:45.690
<v Speaker 4>if I shouldn't have gotten somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have God right,</v>

1342
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 4>and if I sit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in bite ahead.</v>

1343
00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 4>I can literally bounce his own knee into</v>
<v Speaker 4>his face.</v>

1344
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 4>That's an illegal move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>MMA,</v>

1345
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.610
<v Speaker 4>and it's a real easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that.</v>

1346
00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:00.230
<v Speaker 4>The Nice right over here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just thrust my hips forward.</v>

1347
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.260
<v Speaker 4>His own knee will bash in his face and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask big.</v>

1348
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:04.370
<v Speaker 4>Joe Mccarthy says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1349
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 4>that's illegal move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go,</v>

1350
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.820
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen anybody do that.</v>

1351
01:00:07.821 --> 01:00:09.200
<v Speaker 4>But that little lid knocking himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1352
01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 4>but different way.</v>

1353
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pushing his head into his knee.</v>

1354
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grab his head.</v>

1355
01:00:13.701 --> 01:00:18.701
<v Speaker 4>By the time he can not push me backwards</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I drive my hips forward and his</v>

1356
01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 4>own knee because his leg is here over </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1357
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 4>I can fit into his own face and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to stop my hip power,</v>

1358
01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 4>which is going to be very hard to do for</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

1359
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.590
<v Speaker 4>for him in that same position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

1360
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Have you drilled that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I in my class.</v>

1361
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1362
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys pull that off.</v>

1363
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real easy thing.</v>

1364
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard for you to stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

1365
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.040
<v Speaker 4>We can jump into my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1366
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 4>I can show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that funny?</v>

1367
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 4>When people learn things and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1368
01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:48.590
<v Speaker 4>well there's that now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1369
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time guys would go uh,</v>

1370
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Speaker 4>and they would go and throw under hooks </v>
<v Speaker 4>on like from the half guard and then </v>

1371
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Speaker 4>they would try to like sneak up to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body and then work their way in.</v>

1372
01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:03.610
<v Speaker 4>But then people started Darson people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then that under hook became like a </v>

1373
01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:04.550
<v Speaker 4>real liability for those long arm Doris </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1374
01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 4>And that's just sort of had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had a change,</v>

1375
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had a,</v>

1376
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:13.190
<v Speaker 4>people have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've installed an early days with the </v>

1377
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.800
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing Tyberg book show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ramon Dekkers,</v>

1378
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:14.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the clinch,</v>

1379
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 4>pushing somebody away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

1380
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 4>hiking and it went down and then you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody starts doing it,</v>

1381
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:20.780
<v Speaker 4>then everybody knows you that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work anymore.</v>

1382
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:25.781
<v Speaker 4>And then he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He pushed away with the low kick and I </v>

1383
01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:25.781
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1384
01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 4>when I teach this a lot in my class too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if I push you,</v>

1385
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 4>you're off your balance shifts backwards</v>
<v Speaker 4>show you don't flex your leg.</v>

1386
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.080
<v Speaker 4>That low kick doesn't need to be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trust me,</v>

1387
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:35.260
<v Speaker 4>because the muscle is relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes straight through.</v>

1388
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 4>So a little while you kick as a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing to do.</v>

1389
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 4>You look at the expeditious evolution of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1390
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:43.580
<v Speaker 4>When we go back and remember doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>voiceover for some pancreas,</v>

1391
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 4>have fights for fight network in Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1392
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:50.990
<v Speaker 4>and you know back where you go and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch a sport under what was mma rules </v>

1393
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 4>and well there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that,</v>

1394
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 4>but it just didn't exist to them at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time in there.</v>

1395
01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:56.200
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1396
01:01:56.201 --> 01:01:57.680
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mindset or the,</v>

1397
01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.320
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the drilling as you say,</v>

1398
01:02:00.321 --> 01:02:01.180
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1399
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting when you look at now </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who,</v>

1400
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 4>that's all they've trained in guys like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a courtyard,</v>

1401
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.350
<v Speaker 4>pat for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all these kids,</v>

1402
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Tj dillashaw where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1403
01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love this growth.</v>

1404
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 4>There's only a certain amount of moves </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can do right there.</v>

1405
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Like armbars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's always just chokes.</v>

1406
01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 4>It's Dah weight towards</v>

1407
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:25.790
<v Speaker 5>those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you find a different way going </v>

1408
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:27.891
<v Speaker 5>through that certain Armbar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you surprise somebody and that you </v>

1409
01:02:27.891 --> 01:02:28.000
<v Speaker 5>see that happening a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly it as a triangle choke,</v>

1410
01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 5>the new triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>choke setup.</v>

1411
01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.200
<v Speaker 5>Then everybody starts doing it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone again,</v>

1412
01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 5>but it's just about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The move is there,</v>

1413
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 5>but what the setup is every certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicks,</v>

1414
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:35.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1415
01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:38.460
<v Speaker 5>karate and taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing that you thought,</v>

1416
01:02:38.461 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would never work,</v>

1417
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:40.950
<v Speaker 5>and all of a sudden everyone's know for </v>
<v Speaker 5>a while.</v>

1418
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 5>The front kick to the face and frank </v>
<v Speaker 5>with you seen that with wonderboy.</v>

1419
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:50.810
<v Speaker 5>Wonderboy is perfect example of what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought was going to be the next stage </v>

1420
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Speaker 5>of evolution as the sport karate guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guys,</v>

1421
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:53.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Michael Venom page,</v>

1422
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.400
<v Speaker 5>Raymond Daniels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Daniels,</v>

1423
01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 5>and what these guys are doing is they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing that if you have all those other</v>

1424
01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:06.711
<v Speaker 5>skills will then those traditional </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts techniques become very </v>

1425
01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 5>novel and people don't know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

1426
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Like with wonderboy and he started </v>
<v Speaker 5>stabbing people with that front leg side</v>

1427
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.480
<v Speaker 5>kick and then throws that frontline </v>
<v Speaker 5>round kick.</v>

1428
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.150
<v Speaker 5>People don't know what to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

1429
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 5>And he's also got that crazy style of </v>
<v Speaker 5>leak leaning back and forth like a snake</v>

1430
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:24.260
<v Speaker 5>popping back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be very interesting to </v>

1431
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 5>rematch though because I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think even though it was a draw,</v>

1432
01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.620
<v Speaker 5>I guess according to the score card it </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be a draw.</v>

1433
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.920
<v Speaker 5>When you look at who did more damage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's clearly woodley woodley did way </v>

1434
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 5>more damage in two rounds he had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had wonderboy and some serious shit.</v>

1435
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:42.831
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also for whatever inexplicable </v>

1436
01:03:42.831 --> 01:03:42.831
<v Speaker 5>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he doesn't even know why I asked him</v>

1437
01:03:42.831 --> 01:03:45.330
<v Speaker 5>about it after the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't take them down after the first</v>

1438
01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:46.680
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I cute?</v>

1439
01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:47.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

1440
01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:49.950
<v Speaker 5>if you asked me right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea why I did and he's like,</v>

1441
01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.170
<v Speaker 5>I got 20 years of wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would think I would use it,</v>

1442
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:54.480
<v Speaker 5>and he had so much success in the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>round,</v>

1443
01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:55.230
<v Speaker 5>taking them down.</v>

1444
01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.920
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he almost knocked him out in the fourth </v>

1445
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:00.920
<v Speaker 5>round to remember he stunned them in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fourth round,</v>

1446
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.850
<v Speaker 5>just shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes,</v>

1447
01:04:01.851 --> 01:04:02.580
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1449
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a pretty,</v>

1450
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 5>it was an interesting fight because </v>
<v Speaker 5>would wonder.</v>

1451
01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 5>Boy Did regain some points and regained </v>
<v Speaker 5>some ground,</v>

1452
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 5>but he never really had woodley in any </v>
<v Speaker 5>real trouble.</v>

1453
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:18.501
<v Speaker 5>And I think that is always the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>point of fighting is like who puts the </v>

1454
01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:22.851
<v Speaker 5>other person in grave danger?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And clearly woodley put wonderboy in </v>

1455
01:04:22.851 --> 01:04:24.840
<v Speaker 5>grave danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had him stand.</v>

1456
01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Deanna fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was beating him up.</v>

1457
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:28.690
<v Speaker 5>He caught them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had them in a guillotine,</v>

1458
01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.310
<v Speaker 5>looked like his head was gonna pop off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had him in far more dangerous.</v>

1459
01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:37.100
<v Speaker 5>The cutesy was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scrase escaped.</v>

1460
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wonder how.</v>

1461
01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:41.320
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how he holds his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1462
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.620
<v Speaker 5>because there's some guys that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a diy,</v>

1463
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.680
<v Speaker 5>there's different ways to hold your </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands where you can really like </v>

1464
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.740
<v Speaker 5>accentuate the bone into the neck and </v>
<v Speaker 5>really there's little minute details and</v>

1465
01:04:52.201 --> 01:04:54.830
<v Speaker 5>gay teens that you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1466

<v Speaker 5>ones.</v>

1467
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course Marcello Garcia.</v>

1468
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:04.080
<v Speaker 5>So he's probably got one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>teams I've ever seen in history.</v>

1469
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.790
<v Speaker 5>Grappling competition.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what John Jones used to go to prayer.</v>

<v Speaker 4>becomes a bloodshot instead of just </v>

1489
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:45.980
<v Speaker 4>crushing the windpipe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It seems for whatever stupid reason,</v>

1503
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 4>but in mma there are so many redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even overeem has been up,</v>

1504
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:21.890
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1505
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:23.950
<v Speaker 4>There's still a bad narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing,</v>

1506
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:26.630
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately someone who loses a fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't come back.</v>

1507
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Speaker 4>It was going to help that I think for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

1508
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 4>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1509
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 4>Bernard Hopkins had an old fame career </v>
<v Speaker 4>after losing his first fight.</v>

1510
01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then Gable,</v>

1511
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 4>Dan Gable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>

1512
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.000
<v Speaker 4>we were interviewing him and he saw this</v>
<v Speaker 4>record and like,</v>

1513
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 4>but with randy couture record another </v>
<v Speaker 4>record and he goes,</v>

1514
01:06:44.351 --> 01:06:46.810
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a world champion,</v>

1515
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 4>but we're talking to a guy who lost once</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his life,</v>

1516
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he goes,</v>

1517
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.900
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

1518
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 4>He was totally shocked by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many ways to win,</v>

1519
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:57.310
<v Speaker 4>many ways to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right Wayne,</v>

1520
01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:01.510
<v Speaker 4>different world people are throwing </v>
<v Speaker 4>their punches and kicks and catching you</v>

1521
01:07:01.511 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 4>with knees and take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cro Cop was,</v>

1522
01:07:03.911 --> 01:07:07.360
<v Speaker 4>the guy told us in Japan that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't lose an mma,</v>

1523
01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:09.080
<v Speaker 4>you really haven't fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had been.</v>

1524
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to make the point of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1525
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:11.380
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1526
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 4>it's so tough guys that are gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

1527
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also evolving.</v>

1528
01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 4>It's radical pace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1529
01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing all these new approaches </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly changing.</v>

1530
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:25.350
<v Speaker 4>So many great minds involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:26.320
<v Speaker 4>that's what I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1532
01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:29.150
<v Speaker 4>ferris a hobby and I made want the list </v>
<v Speaker 4>can go on.</v>

1533
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:32.050
<v Speaker 4>But that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I become now a bit more of a</v>

1534
01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 4>nerd because you call so many fights in </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1535
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 4>You try to have a life as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm really now getting back into,</v>

1536
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:42.331
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's catch up and see what these </v>

1537
01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:42.331
<v Speaker 4>different minds of sang well and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself sir,</v>

1538
01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:42.331
<v Speaker 4>even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1539
01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:44.450
<v Speaker 4>listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just always so cool to,</v>

1540
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.330
<v Speaker 4>to hear different perspectives and.</v>

1541
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1542
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 4>that's super important for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why Bj's going to do </v>

1543
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really,</v>

1544
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.840
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe drinking because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed camp.</v>

1545
01:07:55.841 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 4>I think talent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Bj in his training in Hawaii,</v>

1546
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:04.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he kinda dictates whatever he wants to </v>

1547
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:04.740
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so talented.</v>

1548
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.651
<v Speaker 4>He schools people around and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you put people like that on the </v>

1549
01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:10.081
<v Speaker 4>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get tired because they never </v>

1550
01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:10.480
<v Speaker 4>experienced that enduring because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>so way ahead above everybody else.</v>

1551
01:08:10.481 --> 01:08:12.640
<v Speaker 4>So if they want to do extra three rounds</v>
<v Speaker 4>with him,</v>

1552
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:17.641
<v Speaker 4>he prayed and he doesn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to gonna I'm not going to do </v>

1553
01:08:17.641 --> 01:08:17.641
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad example that</v>

1554
01:08:17.641 --> 01:08:18.240
<v Speaker 5>drake at Greg Winkeljohn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1555
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 5>and there he's got all these guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>gunning for him.</v>

1556
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:25.031
<v Speaker 5>It's Alegent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I can only imagine the sparring </v>

1557
01:08:25.031 --> 01:08:25.031
<v Speaker 5>sessions they have going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to do really well for</v>

1558
01:08:25.031 --> 01:08:25.980
<v Speaker 5>him now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His opponent?</v>

1559
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rodriguez is really good know,</v>

1560
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.140
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1561
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.210
<v Speaker 5>But I had a conflict the whole honestly </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

1562
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:36.610
<v Speaker 5>He's a hall of Famer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Done everything we saw against Frankie </v>

1563
01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:36.610
<v Speaker 5>Edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

1564
01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 5>We talked about our podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last one was Matt Hughes.</v>

1565
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:39.610
<v Speaker 5>Twenty 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you.</v>

1566
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:41.720
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think he's still fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1567
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:43.940
<v Speaker 5>he probably feels like he didn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1568
01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 5>He probably feels like the fights he </v>
<v Speaker 5>took with Frankie where you had that </v>

1569
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 5>really bizarre standup stance here was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the weirdest thing I've ever seen.</v>

1570
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:57.130
<v Speaker 5>He decided that he was going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>that way because it was more efficient </v>

1571
01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 5>and it didn't use as much energy as </v>
<v Speaker 5>widening his stance and he,</v>

1572
01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:04.001
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of his career he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned with losing his energy in the </v>

1573
01:09:04.001 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 5>ring.</v>

1574
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.290
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of his crew.</v>

1575
01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:06.560
<v Speaker 5>He's worried about gassing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1576
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 5>So then he went with [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1577
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:11.990
<v Speaker 5>So he does these two camps with Marvin </v>
<v Speaker 5>intervention at least two camps.</v>

1578
01:09:11.991 --> 01:09:12.770
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>

1579
01:09:12.771 --> 01:09:14.030
<v Speaker 5>Sean Sherk and I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1580
01:09:14.031 --> 01:09:15.380
<v Speaker 5>Did Diego Sanchez?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he did.</v>

1581
01:09:15.381 --> 01:09:20.381
<v Speaker 5>Diego Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I know also that Steve Maxwell </v>

1582
01:09:20.381 --> 01:09:21.320
<v Speaker 5>was training Diego Sanchez got Sanchez </v>
<v Speaker 5>in incredible shape,</v>

1583
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:26.540
<v Speaker 5>but that was Bj in his prime and when Bj</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't tired when he was in shape and he</v>

1584
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.260
<v Speaker 5>was joking around about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when I have a six pack here before,</v>

1585
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:35.670
<v Speaker 5>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't just a different animal back </v>

1586
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:38.081
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was only sustainable for like a </v>

1587
01:09:38.081 --> 01:09:38.410
<v Speaker 5>few fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Bj,</v>

1588
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:43.450
<v Speaker 5>it's for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was hard for him to get totally </v>

1589
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:44.720
<v Speaker 5>motivated to get into that kind of shape</v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

1590
01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 5>And when he described it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounded hilarious.</v>

1591
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:48.740
<v Speaker 5>Like he couldn't hold his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally,</v>

1592
01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 5>literally so tired after working out </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he couldn't even hold his kid.</v>

1593
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 5>And they have a very specific training </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophy to the marina bitches.</v>

1594
01:09:56.691 --> 01:09:58.430
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of ways,</v>

1595
01:09:58.431 --> 01:09:59.360
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1596
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:03.560
<v Speaker 5>some of the guys that like Nickerson who</v>
<v Speaker 5>trains under his philosophy and speed of</v>

1597
01:10:03.561 --> 01:10:08.561
<v Speaker 5>sport in California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want strength and conditioning to </v>

1598
01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:09.980
<v Speaker 5>be number one priority number one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You already know how to fight.</v>

1599
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.290
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.970
<v Speaker 5>And the idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you already know how to find it.</v>

1601
01:10:12.971 --> 01:10:14.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So since you already know how to fight,</v>

1602
01:10:14.631 --> 01:10:18.710
<v Speaker 5>you should just work on having the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible aerobic threshold,</v>

1603
01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:23.050
<v Speaker 5>which is back to frank and a plan to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ortiz.</v>

1604
01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:23.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1605
01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:27.960
<v Speaker 5>but even Franco with the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why am I going to Kip Maury Smith with a</v>

1606
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 5>new partner show you in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what frank was all about was the.</v>

1607
01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:36.461
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't be cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cardio was so important on the bus </v>

1608
01:10:36.461 --> 01:10:37.460
<v Speaker 5>back when Tito lost you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>frank.</v>

1609
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.460
<v Speaker 5>I was in the same bus going back to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>airport that Tito was jump next to me </v>

1610
01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:46.091
<v Speaker 5>and he starts asking me a question about</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven because I always said is the most </v>

1611
01:10:46.091 --> 01:10:46.490
<v Speaker 5>important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can never have enough stamina.</v>

1612
01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.600
<v Speaker 5>That's the most important choice that </v>
<v Speaker 5>asking drills and doing all these </v>

1613
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.190
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he became that crazy cycle,</v>

1614
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.650
<v Speaker 5>cardio cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1615
01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.680
<v Speaker 5>and he started beating everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he was transferred that to Kendall </v>

1616
01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Grove and one of the guys on the train </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the ultimate fighter Kendall came </v>

1617
01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:02.140
<v Speaker 5>out of that show and that's what he told</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1618
01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:02.960
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all cardio,</v>

1619
01:11:02.961 --> 01:11:04.860
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything is about cardio when.</v>

1620
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cardio also.</v>

1621
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.890
<v Speaker 5>What about the nerves then and how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>panicking and your emotions drained?</v>

1622
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:13.840
<v Speaker 5>Like what I'm saying plays factor in it,</v>

1623
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but the actual real cold hard cardio </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays a factor too.</v>

1624
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Then it also plays a factor in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerves because if you know that you have</v>

1625
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>a small gas tank and you started your </v>
<v Speaker 1>lit up.</v>

1626
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially when you walk to the </v>

1627
01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:28.720
<v Speaker 1>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I train hard enough?</v>

1628
01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that you can really go,</v>

1629
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after work I done,</v>

1630
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:32.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll do seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six minutes round.</v>

1631
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So that type at full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like 42 minutes and.</v>

1632
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:41.630
<v Speaker 1>But that was after a workout but I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody did that so I was not going </v>

1633
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:45.311
<v Speaker 1>to run out of gas because we had half </v>
<v Speaker 1>our fights in Japan but it's the only </v>

1634
01:11:45.311 --> 01:11:45.660
<v Speaker 1>way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly go hard.</v>

1635
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And I had guys coming who couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the warmup in my class is a 20 minute </v>

1636
01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:54.420
<v Speaker 1>warmup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the boss where to work with the </v>

1637
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.191
<v Speaker 1>sprawls and at a minutes I fill them up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea pushups or with the </v>

1638
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:56.191
<v Speaker 1>kettlebell swings.</v>

1639
01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.280
<v Speaker 1>So it's 20 minutes straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People come in who had a fight like in </v>

1640
01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 1>two weeks in Japan and it couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1641
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:02.190
<v Speaker 1>They had to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1642
01:12:02.191 --> 01:12:02.960
<v Speaker 1>don't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1643
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:03.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1644
01:12:03.541 --> 01:12:08.541
<v Speaker 1>this is the warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even start now and let's say </v>

1645
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:09.710
<v Speaker 1>they lost because of cardio over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how.</v>

1646
01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 1>But how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

1647
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:13.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just baby steps it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get yourself to the point where</v>

1648
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:16.820
<v Speaker 1>you can get through that entire warmup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full clip and then just.</v>

1649
01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep doing it.</v>

1650
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Who can do things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So best conditioned athlete right now in</v>

1651
01:12:22.261 --> 01:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>MMA or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are names that come to mind?</v>

1652
01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Is Alaska's right away I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1653
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Cane and he's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's afraid.</v>

1654
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of really good guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>down 90 miles.</v>

1655
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1656
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.260
<v Speaker 1>He's tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also so efficient.</v>

1657
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You could also say the same thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cody and dominic.</v>

1658
01:12:37.231 --> 01:12:42.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that was more civil </v>

1659
01:12:42.231 --> 01:12:42.231
<v Speaker 1>war for 25 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1660
01:12:42.231 --> 01:12:42.231
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more.</v>

1661
01:12:42.231 --> 01:12:46.940
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming a bigger deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the early days it was only the WC </v>

1662
01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.150
<v Speaker 1>guys because I've got a lighter guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now everybody,</v>

1663
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:54.370
<v Speaker 1>while they hit me the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a guy comes in with no cardio for </v>

1664
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:54.750
<v Speaker 1>three rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1665
01:12:54.751 --> 01:12:59.751
<v Speaker 1>you're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like bringing a half a can of </v>

1666
01:12:59.751 --> 01:12:59.751
<v Speaker 1>paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a painter too,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that connor,</v>

1683
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 1>that he shouldn't have fought nate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nate was too big for him,</v>

1684
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:49.461
<v Speaker 1>but he made his a one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fight that's going to happen </v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you remember going to happen again?</v>

1687
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's on a grid.</v>

1688
01:13:56.610 --> 01:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>You Remember Diaz in daily?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitting there and just calling him like </v>

1689
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.440
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was knocked down twice back and </v>

1690
01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>stopped him with three seconds left </v>
<v Speaker 1>recoveries.</v>

1691
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Always fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seminar in Goma and then the </v>

1692
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:16.890
<v Speaker 1>fricken thc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they test for that?</v>

1693
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>While we don't want to get into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1694
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure is an athletic conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tests tests forever.</v>

1695
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>All my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tell you.</v>

1696
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying now that they're gonna </v>

1697
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking about calming down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then not.</v>

1698
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Not even caring if people test positive.</v>

1699
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

1700
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Which would be a good thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the level show in your skin and the </v>

1701
01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:44.041
<v Speaker 1>way it stays in your fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you got high the night before a </v>

1702
01:14:44.041 --> 01:14:47.851
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to feel it during the </v>

1703
01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:47.851
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just not.</v>

1704
01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>But if it's an of will show up maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1705
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:55.261
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have to really fucked up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and you'll probably get new ideas </v>

1706
01:14:55.261 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 1>on his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not ever seen anybody.</v>

1707
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 1>One of those gummy bears was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>$1,200.</v>

1708
01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.370
<v Speaker 1>The only guy I think he ate ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so insane.</v>

1709
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Like that writer from the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper went to Denver and did a piece</v>

1710
01:15:11.471 --> 01:15:16.471
<v Speaker 1>and she ate a whole shock by guests who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like eight different doses or how </v>

1711
01:15:16.471 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 1>many different doses and talk wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her good oil.</v>

1712
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be paranoid.</v>

1713
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You're a little flesh bag on the planet.</v>

1714
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:26.830
<v Speaker 1>My daughter went to a planet totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>through infinity.</v>

1715
01:15:26.831 --> 01:15:28.970
<v Speaker 1>You should be nervous as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

1716
01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.930
<v Speaker 1>We'd go rock could fly on the sky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill you.</v>

1717
01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a quiche.</v>

1718
01:15:34.711 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Some cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is eight,</v>

1719
01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 1>nine years back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1720
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I crank one because they're heavy </v>

1721
01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>cookies and while I'm eating a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumble fulls of the ground and I,</v>

1722
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I see the dog right away running over </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1723
01:15:46.671 --> 01:15:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to stop it and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1724
01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:51.490
<v Speaker 1>but the little tiny bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1725
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>So I'm eating it and I have to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>something from a friend of mine who was </v>

1726
01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>like 20 minutes away here somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the valley.</v>

1727
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go pick it up,</v>

1728
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm back in the car and as soon as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the car started driving and it hits </v>

1729
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.351
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit and within two minutes </v>

1730
01:16:07.351 --> 01:16:07.351
<v Speaker 1>I got a phone call from my wife.</v>

1731
01:16:07.351 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 1>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember talk outside,</v>

1732
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:14.680
<v Speaker 1>staring outside for like two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1733
01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is looking at site.</v>

1734
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.980
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came home.</v>

1735
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:22.620
<v Speaker 1>He was just like poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor Louis has been high a few times.</v>

1736
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Luna doesn't like men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she made a connection,</v>

1737
01:16:27.431 --> 01:16:30.550
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rather intimate one.</v>

1738
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.880
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't like men for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1739
01:16:32.881 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she will go after you.</v>

1740
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kits and women are cool,</v>

1741
01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:37.420
<v Speaker 1>but a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1742
01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:40.600
<v Speaker 1>the mailman literally does the dog that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will go a full mode attack.</v>

1743
01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It is a little dog is 15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the dog,</v>

1744
01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 1>a poodle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1745
01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

1746
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's your arm?</v>

1747
01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you're getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle back and your arm.</v>

1748
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:55.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>

1749
01:16:55.990 --> 01:17:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see below there still something </v>

1750
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with an a in the valley.</v>

1751
01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:03.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a doctor now and he does these </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy injections also.</v>

1752
01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's elite.</v>

1753
01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.510
<v Speaker 1>It's caught to nervous scorch somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1754
01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And I feel that something is caught </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>

1755
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1756
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>to impinged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 2>So what they say is if you take a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a water hose,</v>

1758
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>if you squeeze it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water comes out.</v>

1759
01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:20.921
<v Speaker 2>That's the same with an nerf action </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out and that apparently they made </v>

1760
01:17:20.921 --> 01:17:22.340
<v Speaker 2>this special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a picture that they only could do in,</v>

1761
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Monica and they saw that it was </v>

1762
01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.011
<v Speaker 2>blocked there and he can apparently he </v>
<v Speaker 2>can inject me there and they will take </v>

1763
01:17:30.011 --> 01:17:33.851
<v Speaker 2>the pressure off and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes that that's very possible </v>

1764
01:17:33.851 --> 01:17:35.290
<v Speaker 2>that we'll come back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1765
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because she stepping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fingers is still very hot and I get </v>

1766
01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I could do that for four years.</v>

1767
01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That even snapping my fingers.</v>

1768
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 2>So slowly but surely it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just work out the arm and the shoulder</v>

1769
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:47.710
<v Speaker 2>shoulder comes back also a little bit.</v>

1770
01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.460
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing that they say about </v>
<v Speaker 5>nerves,</v>

1771
01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:54.461
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That any kind of nerve damage takes a </v>

1772
01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:54.461
<v Speaker 5>tremendous amount of time to heal </v>
<v Speaker 5>because nerves,</v>

1773
01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 5>they grow vag very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very slow,</v>

1774
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:57.930
<v Speaker 5>very slow people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't understand it.</v>

1775
01:17:57.931 --> 01:17:59.850
<v Speaker 5>I always say it's like digging the spark</v>
<v Speaker 5>plug out of a,</v>

1776
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.150
<v Speaker 2>a cylinder that's your nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once the nerve is broke,</v>

1777
01:18:03.151 --> 01:18:04.920
<v Speaker 2>you take that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

1778
01:18:04.921 --> 01:18:06.240
<v Speaker 2>And then to atrophy comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
01:18:06.241 --> 01:18:08.520
<v Speaker 2>because people go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you then be paralyzed?</v>

1780
01:18:08.521 --> 01:18:13.521
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens with people who bring it </v>

1781
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:13.521
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1782
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:13.521
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1783
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:13.920
<v Speaker 5>I said no more nerves going to the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She can't walk anymore.</v>

1784
01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:15.460
<v Speaker 5>And that's the same thing what I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

1785
01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 5>Only the nerve is still there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just pressured.</v>

1786
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 5>I ran into some kid after a show the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other day and we were talking about neck</v>

1787
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:22.600
<v Speaker 5>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1788
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 5>and Jujitsu and he was asking me a </v>
<v Speaker 5>question and he's like,</v>

1789
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:28.580
<v Speaker 5>my arm doesn't work under here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My tricep starting to fade away.</v>

1790
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:29.270
<v Speaker 5>And Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1791
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:34.271
<v Speaker 5>go to a doctor yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to get an Mri as soon as you </v>

1792
01:18:34.271 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 5>start seeing atrophy and as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>start feeling numbness,</v>

1793
01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:37.860
<v Speaker 5>you got to get on it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1794
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.120
<v Speaker 5>Any impingement to necklace because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some ways that they can sort </v>

1795
01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.991
<v Speaker 5>of relieve the pressure and spinal </v>
<v Speaker 5>decompression and a bunch of different </v>

1796
01:18:46.991 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 5>platelet rich plasma type of injections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Regena keen and stuff,</v>

1797
01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.850
<v Speaker 5>but you got to do something and you got </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do something quick and you can't keep</v>

1798
01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:54.170
<v Speaker 5>rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these guys,</v>

1799
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:59.171
<v Speaker 5>they want to keep going to Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even when their back's fucked up like </v>

1800
01:18:59.171 --> 01:18:59.440
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like as you're rolling,</v>

1801
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:03.120
<v Speaker 5>you feel like you feel like that twinge </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shooting,</v>

1802
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:09.180
<v Speaker 5>doing real damage to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to be super careful with any </v>

1803
01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:09.470
<v Speaker 5>kind of nerve injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I waited too long.</v>

1804
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:11.240
<v Speaker 5>That was the thing with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I waited too long.</v>

1805
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.590
<v Speaker 5>I realized I saw my arms slinking and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I go,</v>

1806
01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:14.600
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go to the doctor.</v>

1807
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:15.200
<v Speaker 5>But it was already.</v>

1808
01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I should've gone faster as soon as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>

1809
01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you go sooner?</v>

1810
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to fix itself.</v>

1811
01:19:22.911 --> 01:19:27.911
<v Speaker 2>I've been this indestructible guy from </v>
<v Speaker 2>my windows from rooms that are not your </v>

1812
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:29.660
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1813
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel I'm from a roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell on my face on the other step and </v>

1814
01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I put all my t stayed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the craziest thing.</v>

1815
01:19:37.611 --> 01:19:39.800
<v Speaker 2>You can tell by my front teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have something,</v>

1816
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did my feet did not come out.</v>

1817
01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was quite a fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fell on your face from a roof.</v>

1818
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>You know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know those,</v>

1819
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:50.760
<v Speaker 2>how you call those letters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

1820
01:19:50.761 --> 01:19:52.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feet pointed one.</v>

1821
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's stands like this and I'm </v>

1822
01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.061
<v Speaker 2>standing it up and I'm pushing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course when I push the ladder </v>

1823
01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:05.641
<v Speaker 2>stairs like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pushed myself away and I'm following </v>

1824
01:20:05.641 --> 01:20:08.711
<v Speaker 2>all the way down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see a slow motion coming because one of </v>

1825
01:20:08.711 --> 01:20:08.711
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1826
01:20:08.711 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 1>one of those stats things I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1827
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fall on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realize I'm going to go slow motion.</v>

1828
01:20:13.741 --> 01:20:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So I stuck my arms out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm good,</v>

1829
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:17.860
<v Speaker 1>but it was longer than my arm for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Geez.</v>

1830
01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I train on that thing and it wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>dazed.</v>

1831
01:20:21.811 --> 01:20:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1832
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 1>a very gentle.</v>

1833
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please be in it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and all my tooth fairy is insane.</v>

1835
01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have killed 80 percent of the</v>

1836
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:35.680
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk away with no loose teeth.</v>

1844
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.960

01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:23.181
<v Speaker 1>He was afraid I had to actually cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I crumpled they up because when I </v>

1854
01:21:23.181 --> 01:21:27.201
<v Speaker 1>brought brand new bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously they could tell it </v>

1855
01:21:27.201 --> 01:21:27.201
<v Speaker 1>wasn't counterfeit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'd always look and go,</v>

1863
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm like,</v>

1864
01:21:47.761 --> 01:21:48.330
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>AM tomorrow morning you can come and </v>

1866
01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:53.331
<v Speaker 1>pick up your fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was only one room and every single</v>

1867
01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:56.220
<v Speaker 1>fighter would ain't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even guys like miracle Crocapo I know me</v>

1868
01:21:56.221 --> 01:22:01.221
<v Speaker 1>like 2 million bucks or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they made a lot of money at the </v>

1869
01:22:01.221 --> 01:22:01.221
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1870
01:22:01.221 --> 01:22:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And they gave everybody cash.</v>

1871
01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:07.800
<v Speaker 1>and I always thought men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

1872
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 1>if the equity has evolved and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do that,</v>

1873
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:10.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1874
01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you definitely have to bring 10 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't remember they were telling family</v>

1878
01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she can't bring more defense </v>

1879
01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She took one bill off,</v>

1880
01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 1>so it was less than 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had the roles in Rappongi.</v>

1881
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.320

<v Speaker 1>but it looked nice.</v>

1883
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It looked cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you came back,</v>

1884
01:22:32.821 --> 01:22:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you felt you felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a criminal,</v>

1885
01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 1>criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big rural Mexico actually got </v>

<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cash from the heavyweight Grand Prix </v>

1887
01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and then put that in a suitcase and went</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to Croatia.</v>

1888
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most gangster fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I've ever heard in my life.</v>

1889
01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like that's a scene in a movie.</v>

1890
01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Be beat the fuck out of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little title case you.</v>

1891
01:22:56.701 --> 01:23:00.540
<v Speaker 1>When that sperm tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember those sperm posters?</v>

1892
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Fucking person was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the posters.</v>

1893
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad I got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had that post shirts or pluck.</v>

1894
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Remember that upright or plug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1895
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew and what lights that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is no such thing as doing so.</v>

1896
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:22.720
<v Speaker 2>There's no sort of doing things as </v>
<v Speaker 2>usual.</v>

1897
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as doing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>such as usual.</v>

1898
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.180
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get the t shirt.</v>

1899
01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:35.660
<v Speaker 2>That is the dumbest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to get a member of the </v>

1900
01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Grand Prix poster with a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>breastfeeding the baby.</v>

1901
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the heck is going on?</v>

1902
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:45.470
<v Speaker 2>You have a Waleed Ishmael t shirt from </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1998.</v>

1903
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 2>And it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be coward,</v>

1904
01:23:48.851 --> 01:23:53.851
<v Speaker 2>don't run off the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it says on it at the time,</v>

1905
01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:59.071
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a guy said he had made and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed me and it was a direct </v>

1906
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 2>translation for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fulfill for fight,</v>

1907
01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:07.600
<v Speaker 2>for fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for good luck with that buddy fight,</v>

1908
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:13.760
<v Speaker 2>but brutal miscalculations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>translations because I lead with it.</v>

1909
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:15.970
<v Speaker 2>He was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember he uh,</v>

1910
01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:21.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling a story and then I </v>

1911
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:21.020
<v Speaker 2>realized what a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did.</v>

1912
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Because you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of,</v>

1913
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was funny after my rental </v>

1914
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 2>man flight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my base face was bashed in,</v>

1915
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I blew my nose,</v>

1916
01:24:25.301 --> 01:24:30.301
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I wasn't addressing one because </v>

1917
01:24:30.301 --> 01:24:30.301
<v Speaker 2>then I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it before.</v>

1918
01:24:30.301 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes blew up and I never close.</v>

1919
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I could almost see anything anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we all wanted to go out and um,</v>

1920
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:39.430
<v Speaker 2>and it guy there and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1921
01:24:39.431 --> 01:24:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1922
01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 2>give me one second ahead of the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1923
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the,</v>

1924
01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:44.290
<v Speaker 2>the syringe with the widest couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:49.291
<v Speaker 2>so I stabbed in my eye and I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking the blood out yet.</v>

1926
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 2>But that's when I heard he told that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story and he goes,</v>

1927
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and this guy still see me in the Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dah slugging it out.</v>

1928
01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.300
<v Speaker 2>He puts some shade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the freaking terminator.</v>

1929
01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1930
01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:07.351
<v Speaker 2>let's go do my accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard that I go to now.</v>

1931
01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Now you see when you go back in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

1932
01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:15.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was maybe a weird thing to.</v>

1933
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you stuck them in your eyelids.</v>

1934
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Like where did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.540
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to find you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull just nothing coming out.</v>

1936
01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:25.120
<v Speaker 2>You'd have a little further and suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get blocked.</v>

1937
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 2>When you do a blood test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still just start pulling,</v>

1938
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:33.870
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I did and I could see again </v>

1939
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:36.481
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Terminator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so ridiculous.</v>

1940
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:40.510
<v Speaker 2>That is how many people have done that.</v>

1941
01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a super rare move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick a fucking needle under the bag </v>

1942
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.660
<v Speaker 2>under your arm and suck blood out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say you're in a very rare company to</v>

1943
01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.980
<v Speaker 2>try to try to stitch yourself up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1944
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 2>with normal needles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that as well.</v>

1945
01:25:57.731 --> 01:26:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I put a video in a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife at the beginning said,</v>

1946
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:04.150
<v Speaker 2>don't tell her that you were with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughters yourself up.</v>

1947
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:09.190
<v Speaker 2>My daughter's filming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one is playing music of the </v>

1948
01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dog is walking over my lack </v>

1949
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.030
<v Speaker 2>stinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

1950
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:14.080
<v Speaker 2>super antiseptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1951
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:15.210
<v Speaker 2>you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this third.</v>

1952
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fired a fast.</v>

1953
01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 2>What was that cut from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People won't believe it.</v>

1954
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I at the time I drank nonalcoholic beer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I walk outside and I grab a six pack</v>

1955
01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 2>of blackstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcoholic Beer.</v>

1956
01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I walk back in the six pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks the bottles,</v>

1957
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 2>hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it shoots against my leg.</v>

1958
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:34.400
<v Speaker 2>And I walk inside and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1959
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>this hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1960
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:40.661
<v Speaker 2>There's this weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I walk a few steps and this is </v>

1961
01:26:40.661 --> 01:26:40.661
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I pulled my pants down and I saw that</v>

1962
01:26:40.661 --> 01:26:42.710
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The piece of glass was still in it,</v>

1963
01:26:43.290 --> 01:26:47.620
<v Speaker 2>so I had to pull it out and not go to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual doctor.</v>

1964
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because my wife was in Holland at the </v>

1965
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:52.640
<v Speaker 2>last time I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was A.</v>

1966
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I overtrained in the sun for a promotion</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the body action system and I have to</v>

1967
01:26:57.561 --> 01:27:01.280
<v Speaker 2>go to the hospital because I was 93 </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees my body.</v>

1968
01:27:01.281 --> 01:27:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't hold anything anymore.</v>

1969
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Everything started cramping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the weirdest thing.</v>

1970
01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:06.560
<v Speaker 2>So they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like when you were filming that</v>

1971
01:27:06.561 --> 01:27:08.010
<v Speaker 2>commercial?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1972
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I did a workout video workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the whole workout into at noon in </v>

1973
01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:16.600
<v Speaker 2>the son Jesus on the top and how much I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to look good on the camera.</v>

1974
01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.410
<v Speaker 2>So I was hitting the thing as hard as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

1975
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.410
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course I took all potassium.</v>

1976
01:27:21.411 --> 01:27:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I tried every because I knew what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to happen,</v>

1977
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but still I started cramping crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to the hospital,</v>

1978
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.560
<v Speaker 2>they put like two backs in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they put another two bags and the </v>

1979
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.590
<v Speaker 2>bags are empty and it's and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd been there for a long time and have</v>

1980
01:27:33.591 --> 01:27:38.591
<v Speaker 2>my kids with me because my wife is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland so they're there with me and </v>

1981
01:27:38.591 --> 01:27:42.581
<v Speaker 2>it's 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning now and they still don't </v>

1982
01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:42.581
<v Speaker 2>come back and it's already like an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

1983
01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And I've been asking them and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1984
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I say,</v>

1985
01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go guilt.</v>

1986
01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.160
<v Speaker 2>What you'd never should do is pull it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out yourself.</v>

1987
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to put pressure on there.</v>

1988
01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:54.090
<v Speaker 2>And now I know why that is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sprayed the whole room full of blood.</v>

1989
01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.830
<v Speaker 2>So then my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughters had hold your finger on,</v>

1990
01:28:00.831 --> 01:28:03.230
<v Speaker 2>the other one is I pulled it out to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we got to run.</v>

1991
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 2>So we run out of the hospital and escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospital,</v>

1992
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.800
<v Speaker 2>escaped the hospital because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated.</v>

1993
01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So then my wife has gone again and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing happens and she already didn't </v>

1994
01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That something crazy at the first time.</v>

1995
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 2>So I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1996
01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be there again.</v>

1997
01:28:19.311 --> 01:28:21.770
<v Speaker 2>It's become this big story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stitch it myself.</v>

1998
01:28:21.771 --> 01:28:26.750
<v Speaker 2>So I asked the girls to find a needle </v>
<v Speaker 2>for first like they do,</v>

1999
01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:31.751
<v Speaker 2>but it broke and I go no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we followed one more left and </v>

2000
01:28:31.751 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 2>they're really not sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta really push to get it in there</v>

2001
01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it worked.</v>

2002
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.190
<v Speaker 2>It worked out perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cleaned everything.</v>

2003
01:28:37.191 --> 01:28:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I cleaned the rope with alcohol swipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

2004
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:44.820
<v Speaker 2>And I start stitching it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well not much I can do my,</v>

2005
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 2>my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go like,</v>

2006
01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2007
01:28:47.551 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just like Rambo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2008
01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:50.060
<v Speaker 2>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is,</v>

2009
01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>who is Rambo Daddy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he do it too?</v>

2010
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2011
01:28:52.651 --> 01:28:53.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

2012
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:54.250
<v Speaker 2>But who is she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2013
01:28:54.251 --> 01:28:54.860
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an actor.</v>

2014
01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.610
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2015
01:28:55.611 --> 01:28:57.230
<v Speaker 2>it was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2016
01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.870
<v Speaker 2>it was in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he did not do it for real.</v>

2017
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should do it.</v>

2018
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Stitch themselves up either if you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a first aid kit with needles and </v>

2019
01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:12.360
<v Speaker 2>needle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2020
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.040
<v Speaker 2>because if you have one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>needles,</v>

2021
01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 2>you know the little round ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hooks,</v>

2022
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it's an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go really fast but you slip off </v>

2023
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2024
01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>everyday the hardest things to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you need to do it when you have </v>

2025
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>the cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for instance,</v>

2026
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.740
<v Speaker 2>if the one side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one here's the cut and here right.</v>

2027
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to put your finger underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>so make your finger underneath and then </v>

2028
01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.611
<v Speaker 2>you have to stab the needle there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise every time what </v>

2029
01:29:37.611 --> 01:29:37.611
<v Speaker 2>happens is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it slips off.</v>

2030
01:29:37.611 --> 01:29:39.480
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had to put my finger on an IV,</v>

2031
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:44.690
<v Speaker 2>going out what's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you're from the inside going </v>

2032
01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:44.690
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was easier to do.</v>

2033
01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:48.920
<v Speaker 2>But the going in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was hard because it kept slipping </v>

2034
01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:48.920
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not a really sharp new.</v>

2035
01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems like a lot of work.</v>

2036
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's better go to the hospital for </v>

2037
01:29:56.210 --> 01:29:56.600
<v Speaker 2>four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A crazy glued.</v>

2038
01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gluco all my students.</v>

2039
01:29:58.771 --> 01:29:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I got to go into the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come here.</v>

2041
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Who really works the best as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>your finger doesn't get stuck on the </v>

2042
01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 2>wound as you're applying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2043
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:15.860
<v Speaker 2>who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody did that for fun with a friends</v>

2044
01:30:15.861 --> 01:30:16.980
<v Speaker 2>with his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2045
01:30:16.981 --> 01:30:20.870
<v Speaker 2>that's good for lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ripped apart.</v>

2046
01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Scar tissue over your lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to hit the dumbest thing </v>

2047
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a guy in Holland.</v>

2048
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:31.450
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They challenged him to put a pool ball </v>

2049
01:30:31.450 --> 01:30:31.450
<v Speaker 2>into his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

2050
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:33.780
<v Speaker 2>So once it was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did get it out.</v>

2051
01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.750
<v Speaker 2>They had to break stitch out to get them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2052
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Yet he almost couldn't breathe with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gets the freaking ball was in his mouth.</v>

2053
01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Fix it to the next level is Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Christ had a break his teeth at </v>

2054

<v Speaker 2>independent MMA shows on TV.</v>

<v Speaker 2>more heads up what you know.</v>

2073
01:31:47.801 --> 01:31:48.190

2091
01:32:31.491 --> 01:32:33.340
<v Speaker 4>although we talk a other combat sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

<v Speaker 4>positivity to try to find some good news</v>

2096
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:49.390
<v Speaker 4>stories to share in this deeply divided </v>
<v Speaker 4>world of ours.</v>

2097
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:50.390
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just uh,</v>

2098
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.660
<v Speaker 4>we enjoy working with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been a,</v>

2099
01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a blessing to be a reunited with them in</v>

2100
01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:56.860
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a busy dude,</v>

2101
01:32:56.861 --> 01:32:59.160
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you still doing boxing commentary as</v>

2102
01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:00.890
<v Speaker 4>well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debbie?</v>

2103
01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:06.130
<v Speaker 4>Tupac pen and Glorious and well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not so much shitty longer,</v>

2104
01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:09.340
<v Speaker 4>although glory will always remain a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>near and dear to me.</v>

2105
01:33:09.341 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so timing and did they were upset that I</v>

2106
01:33:12.461 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 4>didn't go to Germany because I had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing event that night.</v>

2107
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Showtime is a first priority so we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>

2108
01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:18.650
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2109
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:19.120
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2110
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:23.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing a championship double header </v>
<v Speaker 4>on Saturday at Barclays on showtime.</v>

2111
01:33:23.111 --> 01:33:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Where a unification fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think this year in boxing,</v>

2112
01:33:26.141 --> 01:33:29.900
<v Speaker 4>because not a great year last year for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sweet science and uh,</v>

2113
01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 4>we're going to try to hopefully see more</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the best fighting the best finally.</v>

2114
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:34.500
<v Speaker 4>And I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2115
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:37.930
<v Speaker 4>people can say what they want about him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may match making everything else.</v>

2116
01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:39.800
<v Speaker 4>But the one thing I've always liked </v>
<v Speaker 4>about mma,</v>

2117
01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.220
<v Speaker 4>eventually you will see those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best fight,</v>

2118
01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:45.430
<v Speaker 4>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in boxing the politics and the money</v>

2119
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:51.330
<v Speaker 4>kept that from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that was the thing that kept fade </v>

2120
01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:51.330
<v Speaker 4>or out of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2121
01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:52.750
<v Speaker 4>they wanted his own promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:33:52.751 --> 01:33:55.860
<v Speaker 4>They want to code promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We see how it helped us strike.</v>

2123
01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:58.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everyone knows this by now.</v>

2124
01:33:58.211 --> 01:34:03.211
<v Speaker 4>That was the deal that broke the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proverbial camel's back with </v>

2125
01:34:03.211 --> 01:34:03.211
<v Speaker 4>strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And showtime,</v>

2126
01:34:03.211 --> 01:34:05.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the fader after he lost the,</v>

2127
01:34:05.411 --> 01:34:06.680
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2128
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:11.080
<v Speaker 4>wanted to resign fader at that amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

2129
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.820
<v Speaker 4>A showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The boss at the time said,</v>

2130
01:34:13.821 --> 01:34:18.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need a fader or we're not going to </v>

2131
01:34:18.821 --> 01:34:19.540
<v Speaker 4>renew the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Doug strike forces owners,</v>

2132
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:21.520
<v Speaker 4>the sharks at the time with coker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2133
01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.240
<v Speaker 4>they wanted out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that kind of set the ball in motion I</v>

2134
01:34:25.241 --> 01:34:30.241
<v Speaker 4>think to because I thought and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have still been very healthy </v>

2135
01:34:30.241 --> 01:34:30.241
<v Speaker 4>for the sport.</v>

2136
01:34:30.241 --> 01:34:34.860
<v Speaker 4>I thought strikeforce and the UFC man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was some good shows in strikeforce </v>

2137
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:34.860
<v Speaker 4>as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look what the,</v>

2138
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.270
<v Speaker 4>the alum have done in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing Organization,</v>

2139
01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2140
01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:42.991
<v Speaker 4>Between strikeforce and in WEC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's been a quite a few </v>

2141
01:34:42.991 --> 01:34:45.700
<v Speaker 4>champions that have come from both those</v>
<v Speaker 4>elements and smart move by the UFC to,</v>

2142
01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.470
<v Speaker 4>to do what they did to make sure they </v>
<v Speaker 4>got exactly what I was.</v>

2143
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.480
<v Speaker 4>A very smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there is something to be said for </v>

2144
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:53.480
<v Speaker 4>competition for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

2145
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:53.880
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2146
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2147
01:34:55.241 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad there's other combat sports are</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting more and more popular.</v>

2148
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Like Bella tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take boxing liked glory to glory is a </v>

2149
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:05.190
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very prevalent.</v>

2150
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

2151
01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:08.360
<v Speaker 3>you've helped push that needle as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My man.</v>

2152
01:35:08.361 --> 01:35:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad because I think for me,</v>

2153
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:15.611
<v Speaker 3>bud calling all these combat sports that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've called in this society in the 21st</v>

2154
01:35:15.711 --> 01:35:17.900
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing at the highest level,</v>

2155
01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pick it over everything.</v>

2156
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:22.550
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most exciting sports in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world for sure.</v>

2157
01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things about glory is </v>

2158
01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:27.580
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2159
01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:31.720
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's an organization that </v>

2160
01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:31.720
<v Speaker 3>may be a lot of people have not totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>become aware of.</v>

2161
01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's world class world,</v>

2162
01:35:33.651 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 3>championship level talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The talent is not like at a low level at</v>

2163
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:42.641
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you got guys like Niki hold skin </v>

2164
01:35:42.641 --> 01:35:42.670
<v Speaker 3>and you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much good.</v>

2165
01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.470
<v Speaker 3>But it's again comes.</v>

2166
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me go.</v>

2167
01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think it?</v>

2168
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Everyone says we need American stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like with you and you know </v>

2169
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.910
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

2170
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think Laurie is not making a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger imprint right now in America?</v>

2171
01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had the answer to because </v>

2172
01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.530
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of combat pilots already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the doc would have how many shows</v>

2173
01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.970
<v Speaker 3>they go to UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at all the other ones,</v>

2174
01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that or not.</v>

2175
01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that's also very valuable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing drives me more insane than </v>

2176
01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:17.080
<v Speaker 3>hearing mma fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boo and incredible ground game or two </v>

2177
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 3>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just saying,</v>

2178
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's that segment,</v>

2179
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.180
<v Speaker 3>there is this thing called glory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxing is on UFC fight pass to now.</v>

2180
01:36:23.181 --> 01:36:28.181
<v Speaker 3>It's just I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a little surprised in a </v>

2181
01:36:28.181 --> 01:36:30.890
<v Speaker 3>disappointed that it hasn't gotten a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more traction because these guys </v>

2182
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:31.280
<v Speaker 3>deserve it.</v>

2183
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2184
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think boss nailed it though.</v>

2185
01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:37.160
<v Speaker 3>I think there's too much to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

2186
01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're watching everything.</v>

2190
01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:45.431
<v Speaker 3>I can't keep up anymore when I'm on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>road doing wwe and UFC and a single bed.</v>

2191

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to tape everything just so fast </v>

2193
01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:51.370
<v Speaker 3>forward and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like you say to save time,</v>

2194
01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Joan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2195
01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:52.640
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2196
01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:57.641
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't dedicate six hours because I only </v>

2197
01:36:57.641 --> 01:36:59.960
<v Speaker 3>got two or three and I still want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow in cover and yeah.</v>

2198
01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:02.930
<v Speaker 3>And then if you want to file Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck with all of luck with all that</v>

2199
01:37:02.931 --> 01:37:03.680
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2200
01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just too many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much.</v>

2201
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.600
<v Speaker 3>You're writing what size?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hardest thing to watch in terms of </v>

2202
01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.210
<v Speaker 3>like get it live on television paper for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2203
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean if some worldclass fights that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going on right now and there's no.</v>

2204
01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:17.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of times there's no way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more type premier league remembering</v>

2205
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 3>again was there all these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nikki goes great,</v>

2206
01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 3>but boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still owe me money.</v>

2207
01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.530
<v Speaker 3>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they did.</v>

2208
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:30.690
<v Speaker 3>Somebody organizations only money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>

2209
01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.800
<v Speaker 3>That was a good organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put together a good event rather </v>

2210
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 3>than together a great event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

2211
01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>But I think in the boycott was there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were a couple corporate.</v>

2212
01:37:38.161 --> 01:37:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2213
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I think the world class more time </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldclass a kickboxing or greatly.</v>

2214
01:37:44.421 --> 01:37:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Greatly underappreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think fight pass.</v>

2215
01:37:47.331 --> 01:37:52.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean the ESPN deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this helped a little bit and of </v>

2216
01:37:52.331 --> 01:37:52.331
<v Speaker 3>course being on fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it was also.</v>

2217
01:37:52.331 --> 01:37:56.691
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing the shows and keeping </v>

2218
01:37:56.691 --> 01:37:56.691
<v Speaker 3>track of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2219
01:37:56.691 --> 01:37:57.000
<v Speaker 3>there is growth.</v>

2220
01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:02.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think stagnated by any stretch </v>

2221
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.030
<v Speaker 3>of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

2222
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.520
<v Speaker 3>it's in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2223
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.440
<v Speaker 3>it is popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good ratings,</v>

2224
01:38:04.441 --> 01:38:04.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2225
01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.460
<v Speaker 3>the Netherlands and by not an ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter of show,</v>

2226
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:09.810
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boxing.</v>

2227
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:11.470
<v Speaker 3>I asked anybody gives a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2228
01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:14.320
<v Speaker 3>those as well where we have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2229
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2230
01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.790
<v Speaker 3>I think people have seen too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality TV.</v>

2231
01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:22.791
<v Speaker 3>I think the novelty of it all wore off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when forrest griffin and Stephan</v>

2232
01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Bonner went to war and season one and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole,</v>

2233
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 3>that whole cast with Kenny Florian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diego Sanchez and it just,</v>

2234
01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.010
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2235
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:36.070
<v Speaker 3>it was something special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then that was also before like the </v>

2236
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:37.370
<v Speaker 3>real housewives and a million different </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos.</v>

2237
01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 3>That TV in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a member who wants to be a </v>

2238
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 3>millionaire when the was on one night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>

2239
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 3>30 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll kick two nights,</v>

2240
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:44.670
<v Speaker 3>three nights.</v>

2241
01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything else we do in life </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's good or when it's successful.</v>

2242
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep going until they run it into </v>

2243
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:53.360
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2244
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:53.360
<v Speaker 3>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's style,</v>

2245
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.950
<v Speaker 3>there's trends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just get excited about certain </v>

2246
01:38:57.950 --> 01:39:01.101
<v Speaker 3>trends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they get bored of certain trends </v>

2247
01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:02.841
<v Speaker 3>and I think reality shows in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's hard for people to get </v>

2248
01:39:02.881 --> 01:39:07.881
<v Speaker 3>excited about a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you had a new one is just about a </v>

2249
01:39:07.881 --> 01:39:10.311
<v Speaker 3>bunch of kickbox almost got to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something more than what it would be </v>

2250
01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:12.340
<v Speaker 3>something for either a fight or Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2251
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:17.360
<v Speaker 3>why you can watch it in one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Netflix is the way to go </v>

2252
01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.240
<v Speaker 3>nowadays because you decide when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to write,</v>

2253
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:24.490
<v Speaker 3>not just netflix and Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a special on Netflix as well </v>

2254
01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.790
<v Speaker 3>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2255
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2256
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.960
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're then that's why to me kickboxing,</v>

2257
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:30.690
<v Speaker 3>grieving him at me.</v>

2258
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:32.440
<v Speaker 3>You can go like on your phone right </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2259
01:39:32.441 --> 01:39:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2260
01:39:33.011 --> 01:39:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I got three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2261
01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 3>What a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great stuff.</v>

2262
01:39:34.921 --> 01:39:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

2263
01:39:35.521 --> 01:39:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Like it's digestible in those tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>morsel.</v>

2264
01:39:38.771 --> 01:39:41.170
<v Speaker 3>But how do you monetize it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you build a,</v>

2265
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an audience that's consistent?</v>

2266
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be a slow build.</v>

2267
01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be like the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which kind of exploded,</v>

2268
01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:52.860
<v Speaker 3>blow from the ultimate fighter and most </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports don't explode like that.</v>

2269
01:39:52.861 --> 01:39:56.760
<v Speaker 3>They take a long time and several </v>
<v Speaker 3>generations to build a mma.</v>

2270
01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:01.780
<v Speaker 3>It was so unusual in that it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>excitement level from watching a high </v>

2271
01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:06.021
<v Speaker 3>level of fight was irrefutable to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where when people would watch </v>

2272
01:40:06.021 --> 01:40:10.281
<v Speaker 3>fights on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be so crazy and so exciting that </v>

2273
01:40:10.281 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 3>it was almost like undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2274
01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:12.840
<v Speaker 3>you had to watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just too many people watching.</v>

2275
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Can take your eyes off of it.</v>

2276
01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:17.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think kickboxing,</v>

2277
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.950
<v Speaker 3>it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gloves are bigger.</v>

2278
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:26.060
<v Speaker 3>They definitely ponds but doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cage boy time.</v>

2279
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2280
01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:29.790
<v Speaker 3>That's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good idea,</v>

2281
01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.350
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it in a cage like,</v>

2282
01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:32.340
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't he take them down?</v>

2283
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:38.150
<v Speaker 3>I can always do a flying arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.180
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do a lot of things.</v>

2285
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think the sport is still </v>

2286
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:48.060
<v Speaker 3>growing phases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as far as the talent level,</v>

2287
01:40:48.061 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 3>you definitely seeing what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>women's mma.</v>

2288
01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Women's MMA is changing pretty radically</v>
<v Speaker 3>and quickly.</v>

2289
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:55.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:55.800
<v Speaker 5>We saw that.</v>

2291
01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at a water sitting in Paige vanzant</v>

2292
01:41:00.481 --> 01:41:01.770
<v Speaker 4>for variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2293
01:41:01.771 --> 01:41:05.310
<v Speaker 4>that's an eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how our society,</v>

2294
01:41:05.311 --> 01:41:07.050
<v Speaker 4>we're fixated the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2295
01:41:07.051 --> 01:41:10.470
<v Speaker 4>the good looking people who can fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>are getting these huge numbers.</v>

2296
01:41:10.471 --> 01:41:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Where shouldn't it just be in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>sport?</v>

2297
01:41:12.631 --> 01:41:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a fighter,</v>

2298
01:41:13.531 --> 01:41:15.330
<v Speaker 4>you're talented fighter and I know for </v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

2299
01:41:15.331 --> 01:41:19.770
<v Speaker 4>but it just seems like America </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially is about the cosmetics,</v>

2300
01:41:19.771 --> 01:41:20.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2301
01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:22.930
<v Speaker 5>Sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if that's totally fair.</v>

2302
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:27.490
<v Speaker 5>I think what we have is we have this </v>
<v Speaker 5>giant pool of hardcore fans,</v>

2303
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:28.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2304
01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:31.480
<v Speaker 5>Who want to watch a tyron woodley versus</v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderboy too.</v>

2305
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:32.000
<v Speaker 5>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2306
01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.870
<v Speaker 5>people want to watch this really good </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights.</v>

2307
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that and,</v>

2308
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:38.080
<v Speaker 5>but in order to make the really big </v>
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>

2309
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.360
<v Speaker 5>you got to go outside of those folks and</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2310
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:46.380
<v Speaker 5>get that casual fan and also generate </v>
<v Speaker 5>interest in 100 percent of the hardcore </v>

2311
01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.970
<v Speaker 5>fans because there's some hardcore fans </v>
<v Speaker 5>that quite honestly,</v>

2312
01:41:48.971 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 5>we'll look at a fire and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2313
01:41:50.051 --> 01:41:55.051
<v Speaker 5>I don't really give a fuck about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight for whatever reason that fights </v>

2314
01:41:55.051 --> 01:41:55.051
<v Speaker 5>not my fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to watch it.</v>

2315
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:57.940
<v Speaker 5>And so that's a big pay per view night </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the UFC.</v>

2316
01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain percentage of even the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hardcore fans at it say,</v>

2317
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:05.971
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel better saving my 60 bucks and </v>

2318
01:42:05.971 --> 01:42:06.130
<v Speaker 5>then I'll find out an hour later who </v>
<v Speaker 5>want anyway.</v>

2319
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:07.370
<v Speaker 5>And unfortunately</v>

2320
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:11.310
<v Speaker 4>time before Mcgregor came,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always the lighter weight classes.</v>

2321
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the.</v>

2323
01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Is the roster too big you think for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC in that respect?</v>

2324
01:42:16.921 --> 01:42:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Like are you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because even as we say,</v>

2325
01:42:18.451 --> 01:42:19.980
<v Speaker 4>we covered this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we hardcore like it's,</v>

2326
01:42:20.130 --> 01:42:25.130
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of fighters on the coil </v>

2327
01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:25.130
<v Speaker 4>wire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2328
01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:25.130
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>

2329
01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:25.130
<v Speaker 4>the guy got to fill out the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just wondering,</v>

2330
01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:27.330
<v Speaker 4>for guy you covers a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it works for the company,</v>

2331
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 4>do you think there's the roster is it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>too big or you're happy with the way it </v>

2332
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

2333
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:34.260
<v Speaker 5>now in terms of Mike's fights?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2334
01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:37.960
<v Speaker 5>so if I said that I would really have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do research before I save the rosters to</v>

2335
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:42.980
<v Speaker 5>big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if they don't fight for if in this </v>

2336
01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:47.451
<v Speaker 5>roster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the question then becomes where do they </v>

2337
01:42:47.451 --> 01:42:50.751
<v Speaker 5>fight because they have to get fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere and would it be better for </v>

2338
01:42:50.751 --> 01:42:51.540
<v Speaker 5>some of these lighter?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Lighter,</v>

2339
01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:54.750
<v Speaker 5>but a lighter inexperienced guys like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mickey Golf for instance,</v>

2340
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:58.920
<v Speaker 5>who just right away now he's fighting in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the UFC and beat sage northcutts on Holy</v>

2341
01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.820
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the kid's a star,</v>

2342
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He beats up on my phone because the </v>

2343
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.760
<v Speaker 5>smart so now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's also only a couple of fights </v>

2344
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.851
<v Speaker 5>into his career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were his manager and you cared </v>

2345
01:43:13.851 --> 01:43:14.130
<v Speaker 5>about them a lot and you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look kid,</v>

2346
01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:16.320
<v Speaker 5>you're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got real potential,</v>

2347
01:43:16.321 --> 01:43:21.321
<v Speaker 5>but you need to get some seasoning and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to get some seasoning and </v>

2348
01:43:21.321 --> 01:43:22.020
<v Speaker 5>against commensurate talent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you want.</v>

2349
01:43:22.021 --> 01:43:27.021
<v Speaker 5>You want to fight guys that offer a </v>
<v Speaker 5>threat but that you can beat and you </v>

2350
01:43:27.021 --> 01:43:28.200
<v Speaker 5>want to build your way up to a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Damien Maia.</v>

2351
01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you fight Damien Maia today,</v>

2352
01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:35.630
<v Speaker 5>you're probably going to get fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>smushed good and you might get smushed </v>

2353
01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:38.340
<v Speaker 5>in a way that might destroy your </v>
<v Speaker 5>confidence for fucking years,</v>

2354
01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:41.600
<v Speaker 4>but then there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess there's a feeder leagues,</v>

2355
01:43:41.601 --> 01:43:42.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Access TV.</v>

2356
01:43:42.711 --> 01:43:44.240
<v Speaker 4>What has done a good job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>RFA,</v>

2357
01:43:44.241 --> 01:43:49.241
<v Speaker 4>all these other groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering the UFC if they want to </v>

2358
01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:49.850
<v Speaker 4>even invest to invest in something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2359
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Limited TV show of it now looking for</v>

2360
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.990
<v Speaker 3>a fight so they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they will do that,</v>

2361
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:58.991
<v Speaker 3>but I always thought that they should do</v>
<v Speaker 3>an amateur division or something to use </v>

2362
01:43:58.991 --> 01:44:02.450
<v Speaker 3>an image of the vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of cool because you're wind </v>

2363
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.540
<v Speaker 3>micky gall I think has potential to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>superstar,</v>

2364
01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:05.090
<v Speaker 3>but if you're already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He already beat north.</v>

2365
01:44:05.091 --> 01:44:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Y'all already been six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Northcott,</v>

2366
01:44:07.290 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Northcott.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to fight next?</v>

2367
01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe barring Barberino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he fights in,</v>

2368
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:15.750
<v Speaker 3>keeps winning like he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not too far out of a top 20 ranked.</v>

2369
01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves,</v>

2370
01:44:17.811 --> 01:44:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2371
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:19.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2372
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones did it.</v>

2373
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2374
01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:25.750
<v Speaker 3>How many fucking people are John Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2375
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:26.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2376
01:44:26.630 --> 01:44:31.630
<v Speaker 3>When you get that kind of talent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how Jon Jones is a real special </v>

2377
01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:31.630
<v Speaker 3>talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really.</v>

2378
01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:36.440
<v Speaker 3>It's undeniable takedowns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit on Dan Henderson pure grappling </v>

2379
01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:40.540
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2380
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:41.930
<v Speaker 3>He can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like.</v>

2381
01:44:41.931 --> 01:44:43.490
<v Speaker 3>He could submit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can knock you out.</v>

2382
01:44:43.491 --> 01:44:48.491
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really thinks about his fight in the </v>

2383
01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 3>coordinated for a guy that size under </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

2384
01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:54.101
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking gym under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just rides the horse drawn.</v>

2385
01:44:54.610 --> 01:44:59.610
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that what was his arm is hyper </v>

2386
01:44:59.610 --> 01:45:01.960
<v Speaker 3>extended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vituro caught them in a beautiful arm </v>

2387
01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:01.960
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect arm bar from the guard.</v>

2388
01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Had a fully locked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like it looked like it was.</v>

2389
01:45:03.251 --> 01:45:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was over,</v>

2390
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:05.480
<v Speaker 3>but didn't panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John just wouldn't,</v>

2391
01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:10.570
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let his elbow get fucked up and then </v>

2392
01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:10.850
<v Speaker 3>went on to submit Vittorio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2393
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2394
01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:17.171
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're a fighter and you slap on </v>

2395
01:45:17.171 --> 01:45:19.001
<v Speaker 3>something and you think you got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put all your effort in and then you </v>

2396
01:45:19.001 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 3>lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does a little bit to some fighters to</v>

2397
01:45:20.871 --> 01:45:22.030
<v Speaker 3>their mental states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2398
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:25.580
<v Speaker 3>they get depressed and then when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it up,</v>

2399
01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:30.960
<v Speaker 3>you know it has the moment you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start turning it up because then you </v>

2400
01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.770
<v Speaker 3>destroyed a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can get actually to go for a </v>

2401
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.770
<v Speaker 3>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's what happened there.</v>

2402
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:35.570
<v Speaker 3>That was a unique fight too and that Jon</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones dropped Vittori with the front leg</v>

2403
01:45:35.571 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 3>side kick to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2404
01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:41.030
<v Speaker 3>that is a great technique for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's so long.</v>

2405
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:46.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're seeing the way wonderboy </v>

2406
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:47.980
<v Speaker 3>uses it and some other folks use it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sage Northcutt as a really good one </v>

2407
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:47.980
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

2408
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.340
<v Speaker 3>But you think those will bleak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use.</v>

2409
01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I have a feeling somebody is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get hurt and they're going to take them </v>

2410
01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.990
<v Speaker 3>out because it looks so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially the guy like Jones,</v>

2411
01:45:56.991 --> 01:46:01.991
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she got so much power on top of </v>

2412
01:46:01.991 --> 01:46:03.911
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if by any chance the guy just walks </v>

2413
01:46:03.911 --> 01:46:03.911
<v Speaker 3>backwards in his leg is stretched and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets hit at that moment.</v>

2414
01:46:03.911 --> 01:46:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Silva women with silk because there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight.</v>

2415
01:46:07.161 --> 01:46:12.161
<v Speaker 3>I thought it would involve silverware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the same thing like this is </v>

2416
01:46:12.161 --> 01:46:15.791
<v Speaker 3>gonna end in a serious knee injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do from lake side kicks to the </v>

2417
01:46:15.791 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 3>knees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would just hit you.</v>

2418
01:46:16.311 --> 01:46:19.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not the right above the knee?</v>

2419
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Just hyperextends you're neil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing because it's very </v>

2420
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:24.770
<v Speaker 3>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how come,</v>

2421
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.050
<v Speaker 3>how come you're allowed to round kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outside of the knee?</v>

2422
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Which everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2423
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 3>why you allowed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not allowed to hyperextend.</v>

2424
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not there when it happens,</v>

2425
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you don't get hit or you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2426
01:46:35.031 --> 01:46:35.990
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2427
01:46:35.991 --> 01:46:39.350
<v Speaker 3>it is a very effective technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm uses it quite a bit,</v>

2428
01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.350
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2429
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:42.260
<v Speaker 3>she used it on Rhonda quite a bit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fight.</v>

2430
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:44.450
<v Speaker 3>The lower low kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it,</v>

2431
01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little logo there under CAF.</v>

2432
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:47.660
<v Speaker 3>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was it?</v>

2433
01:46:47.661 --> 01:46:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Who broke his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2434
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 3>people are again,</v>

2435
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:53.340
<v Speaker 5>if I was a pretty recent like three </v>
<v Speaker 5>months ago or something,</v>

2436
01:46:53.341 --> 01:46:58.341
<v Speaker 5>somebody broke his feeble because he got</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked in the calf and they stopped the </v>

2437
01:46:58.341 --> 01:47:00.730
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm thinking I'm the go to walk into</v>

2438
01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:03.750
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't uc other organization,</v>

2439
01:47:03.751 --> 01:47:04.320
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2440
01:47:04.321 --> 01:47:09.321
<v Speaker 5>I mean it definitely happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about knees to the head of a </v>

2441
01:47:09.321 --> 01:47:09.321
<v Speaker 5>grounded opponent?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe?</v>

2442
01:47:09.321 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 5>Are you a fan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2443
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.970
<v Speaker 5>or blue thing could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should be allowed.</v>

2444
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 5>This is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2445
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 5>I think that if someone is shooting for </v>
<v Speaker 5>a takedown,</v>

2446
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:17.520
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a question.</v>

2447
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:22.760
<v Speaker 5>So like say if a guy is in the process </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a double leg and someone's knee </v>

2448
01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.440
<v Speaker 5>touches the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy shooting for that double leg,</v>

2449
01:47:25.441 --> 01:47:27.560
<v Speaker 5>the knee touches the ground and as his </v>
<v Speaker 5>knee touches the ground,</v>

2450
01:47:27.561 --> 01:47:29.400
<v Speaker 5>you're opponent is already launching </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a knee,</v>

2451
01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:34.401
<v Speaker 5>a counter nate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the perfect technique for that </v>

2452
01:47:34.401 --> 01:47:34.401
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2453
01:47:34.401 --> 01:47:36.270
<v Speaker 5>What happens there should be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that illegal?</v>

2454
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:41.480
<v Speaker 5>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone shoots a total power double </v>

2455
01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:42.950
<v Speaker 5>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as they're sliding in their knees,</v>

2456
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.600
<v Speaker 5>hitting the ground and you catch them </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a knee and put them out.</v>

2457
01:47:45.601 --> 01:47:47.430
<v Speaker 5>Is that a need or grounded opponent?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2458
01:47:47.431 --> 01:47:48.110
<v Speaker 5>how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2459
01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.120
<v Speaker 5>he slipped in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that's the same as I hit </v>

2460
01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:53.120
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you turn your head at the moment.</v>

2461
01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:53.610
<v Speaker 5>I hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hit the back of your head.</v>

2462
01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Who are gaming the system?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember when the guys would.</v>

2463
01:47:58.101 --> 01:48:00.660
<v Speaker 5>They would just put that they have they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2464
01:48:00.661 --> 01:48:01.980
<v Speaker 5>that was just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2465
01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:06.210
<v Speaker 5>but it's also like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial fight really recently with</v>

2466
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:07.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2467
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.440
<v Speaker 5>Oliveira's and a 10 means tim and Tim </v>
<v Speaker 5>means and Mark Ratner,</v>

2468
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.790
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I asked him when it was,</v>

2469
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:17.910
<v Speaker 5>he's only on one point at one point </v>
<v Speaker 5>being one knee.</v>

2470
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:20.080
<v Speaker 5>I guess foot wasn't even on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2471
01:48:20.081 --> 01:48:22.170
<v Speaker 5>and his other foot was up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something like,</v>

2472
01:48:22.171 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 5>is that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was real confusing,</v>

2473
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:27.060
<v Speaker 5>confusing run.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Ratner said it should be legal.</v>

2474
01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:27.630
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2475
01:48:27.631 --> 01:48:30.030
<v Speaker 5>well it's one point is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then John Macarthur said,</v>

2476
01:48:30.031 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said it's not a point.</v>

2477
01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:37.551
<v Speaker 5>He said like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that expression that everybody uses </v>

2478
01:48:37.551 --> 01:48:40.130
<v Speaker 5>three points more than three points,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like two hands and two feet rather than </v>

2479
01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:44.271
<v Speaker 5>a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's illegal to hit person when they're </v>

2480
01:48:44.271 --> 01:48:46.401
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he says it's the bottom of your </v>

2481
01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:46.401
<v Speaker 5>feet.</v>

2482
01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:46.950
<v Speaker 5>Anytime it's not the bottom of your feet</v>
<v Speaker 5>are grounded opponent.</v>

2483
01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.360
<v Speaker 5>So even if you have one knee on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground and no feet like you're,</v>

2484
01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:53.670
<v Speaker 5>you're just bouncing and moving towards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're still a grounded opponent.</v>

2485
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:55.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2486
01:48:55.381 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 5>Which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>

2487
01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2488
01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:05.031
<v Speaker 5>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and niche to the opponent on the </v>

2489
01:49:05.031 --> 01:49:05.310
<v Speaker 5>grunt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always scraped her knee.</v>

2490
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:10.370
<v Speaker 5>I think it's better then elbows and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nowadays we see some knockouts with </v>

2491
01:49:10.831 --> 01:49:12.850
<v Speaker 5>elbows and there's a lot of cuts and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you know,</v>

2492
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:14.350
<v Speaker 5>and you don't have to with the knee and </v>
<v Speaker 5>evil.</v>

2493
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:15.060
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2494
01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I said it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an easy defense once you know what </v>

2495
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 5>going to be coming there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bigger thing.</v>

2496
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:21.960
<v Speaker 5>You can just hold the thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2497
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:24.160
<v Speaker 5>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer it over lotion.</v>

2498
01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:29.700
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when Coleman used it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>pride from Randall Road South position?</v>

2499
01:49:30.210 --> 01:49:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ya know,</v>

2500
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:36.380
<v Speaker 5>those are just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean from sky high or just right to </v>

2501
01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.220
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a restaurant.</v>

2502
01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:40.440
<v Speaker 5>One of the rest of the process moves </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the wrestler,</v>

2503
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:41.190
<v Speaker 5>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2504
01:49:41.191 --> 01:49:45.120
<v Speaker 5>if you're trying to shoot on them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they sprawl and they're on top that they</v>

2505
01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:47.280
<v Speaker 5>have those needs right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom,</v>

2506
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

2507
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.640
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous technique for wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Coleman?</v>

2508
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:56.500
<v Speaker 1>That was the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The arms did it to Maurice.</v>

2509
01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Maurice Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Coleman.</v>

2510
01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:04.201
<v Speaker 1>Fight with when headbutts were allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People forget that was nuts.</v>

2511
01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>But is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it so nuts?</v>

2512
01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Why can't your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just like how come you can use </v>

2513
01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.581
<v Speaker 1>your elbow but you can't head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why can't you art nine lymph node,</v>

2514
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:20.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you can cut someone with </v>

2515
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.550
<v Speaker 1>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2516
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.550
<v Speaker 1>You're slashing across their face with </v>
<v Speaker 1>elbows.</v>

2517
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of the concussion thing,</v>

2518
01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's up to you.</v>

2519
01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like we were talking </v>

2520
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:29.460
<v Speaker 1>about the art of actual fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2521
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.810
<v Speaker 1>We know that a headbutt is a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts technique.</v>

2522
01:50:31.811 --> 01:50:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2523
01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was one of the reasons I would </v>

2524
01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:37.680
<v Speaker 1>have bought somebody if there was a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of audience,</v>

2525
01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting at a club,</v>

2526
01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:44.320
<v Speaker 1>if I had to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost never fought for what you do </v>

2527
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:44.320
<v Speaker 1>because I just talked my way out though.</v>

2528
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I would tell the people that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing going on.</v>

2529
01:50:45.251 --> 01:50:50.251
<v Speaker 1>But if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used it on purpose headbutts because </v>

2530
01:50:50.251 --> 01:50:53.911
<v Speaker 1>they look really insane and I will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that older people were watching </v>

2531
01:50:53.911 --> 01:50:54.730
<v Speaker 1>that they would understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2532
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:57.690
<v Speaker 1>we can't accept that kind of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have bought,</v>

2533
01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 1>that will freak people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2534
01:50:59.921 --> 01:51:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And I truly believe that's it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2535
01:51:02.261 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 1>for the sport to make the sport more </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

2536
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Take the hell wants a normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watches the fight,</v>

2537
01:51:08.021 --> 01:51:11.020
<v Speaker 1>like a comas thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headbutting somebody into oblivion,</v>

2538
01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go,</v>

2539
01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:15.210
<v Speaker 1>is this a sport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks,</v>

2540
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:17.170
<v Speaker 1>it looks really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks terrible.</v>

2541
01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.440
<v Speaker 1>So to soccer kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was going to say ground and pound </v>

2542
01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:26.530
<v Speaker 1>for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of boxes and people had a hard </v>

2543
01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:26.980
<v Speaker 1>time with people being on the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hammered.</v>

2544
01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Interested in the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're aware,</v>

2545

<v Speaker 1>tell you remember if they won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2547
01:51:33.251 --> 01:51:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why the referee didn't stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why he let him kick.</v>

2548
01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was obvious he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an a la La land use in Lala land </v>

2549

<v Speaker 1>kick in.</v>

2550
01:51:42.941 --> 01:51:46.270

<v Speaker 1>He was just dead out cold.</v>

2551
01:51:46.290 --> 01:51:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Could have killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>One hundred 80 pound fighter.</v>

2604
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:16.500

2605
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:16.500
<v Speaker 5>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you do,</v>

2606
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:16.760
<v Speaker 5>this is what you fight at.</v>

2607
01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:19.310
<v Speaker 5>Or if you want to weigh less,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to have to lose some weight,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm okay.</v>

2613

2616
01:54:35.690 --> 01:54:37.160
<v Speaker 5>You fight one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

2617
01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:40.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean how many guys?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My weight class of course,</v>

2618
01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:47.540
<v Speaker 5>and that's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the goiter was established for </v>

2619
01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:52.241
<v Speaker 5>the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that you said it already at the </v>

2620
01:54:52.241 --> 01:54:52.241
<v Speaker 5>beginning of the old ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They blame other people.</v>

2621
01:54:52.241 --> 01:54:53.270
<v Speaker 5>Fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2622
01:54:53.271 --> 01:54:58.271
<v Speaker 5>and if there's nobody to blame,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they blame the fact that their opponent </v>

2623
01:54:58.271 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 5>was cutting more weight so he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>stronger in the fight.</v>

2624
01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 5>That's why I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2625
01:55:00.861 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 5>you lost because you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't lose because she weighed five</v>

2626
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 5>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sex.</v>

2627
01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:06.260
<v Speaker 5>I look at the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2628
01:55:06.261 --> 01:55:08.370
<v Speaker 5>let's forget what Frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2629
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.250
<v Speaker 5>everybody will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just won 55.</v>

2630
01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:12.900
<v Speaker 5>18.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't cut a goddamn out one and he's</v>

2631
01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.320
<v Speaker 5>beating everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>

2632
01:55:14.321 --> 01:55:15.200
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem.</v>

2633
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:18.320
<v Speaker 5>And they got and they shocked for </v>
<v Speaker 5>focusing on it and at least because they</v>

2634
01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:23.321
<v Speaker 5>can give it a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then let's hope that the main </v>

2635
01:55:23.321 --> 01:55:25.540
<v Speaker 5>events,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've lost shows and we will lose sight.</v>

2636
01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Chris Justino,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2637
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:33.710

<v Speaker 5>What is the most healthiest?</v>

2638
01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.750
<v Speaker 5>She's think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2639
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:38.150
<v Speaker 5>So Bonnie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's bigger than that.</v>

2640
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:40.850
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think if she,</v>

2641
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:45.851
<v Speaker 5>if it's that much of a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's almost done outside of to make </v>

2642
01:55:45.851 --> 01:55:45.900
<v Speaker 5>1:40</v>
<v Speaker 5>1:45</v>

2643
01:55:45.901 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 5>is a bruised street with 1:50</v>
<v Speaker 5>5:55</v>

2644
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:50.790
<v Speaker 5>is a real weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

2645
01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:52.380
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well maybe it's not for her,</v>

2646
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.450
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm hearing that she's even heavier than</v>

2647
01:55:54.451 --> 01:55:58.250
<v Speaker 5>one 75.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's way over one 80 shift.</v>

2648
01:55:59.400 --> 01:55:59.730
<v Speaker 5>Gabby.</v>

2649
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 5>Gabby slows down their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2650
01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.400
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2651
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:09.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish there were more weight classes </v>

2652
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:09.500
<v Speaker 5>for men and for women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2653
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:10.620
<v Speaker 5>I wish there was a ton of weight classes</v>
<v Speaker 5>in boxing.</v>

2654
01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:12.510
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:56:12.511 --> 01:56:17.511
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that boxing has the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't like is that they have so many </v>

2656
01:56:17.511 --> 01:56:17.580
<v Speaker 5>champions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have too many weight classes,</v>

2657
01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:19.730
<v Speaker 5>but that's how you make things fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right,</v>

2658
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:22.680
<v Speaker 5>you've got like you can't have a one 85 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then a two.</v>

2659
01:56:22.681 --> 01:56:24.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That jump is huge.</v>

2660
01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:27.360
<v Speaker 5>Twenty five to 65,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 stakes,</v>

2661
01:56:27.361 --> 01:56:31.070
<v Speaker 5>20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take Twenty one ounce or 16 ounce t bone</v>

2662
01:56:31.071 --> 01:56:34.260
<v Speaker 5>steak and stack them up and imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone has that advantage over you.</v>

2663
01:56:35.110 --> 01:56:39.950
<v Speaker 5>If it's in his belly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's okay to 35 week class,</v>

2664
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.220
<v Speaker 5>we need that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>

2665
01:56:41.221 --> 01:56:44.970
<v Speaker 5>Or 2:25,</v>
<v Speaker 5>25 maybe at 2:45</v>

2666
01:56:44.971 --> 01:56:46.500
<v Speaker 5>and then unlimited.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2667
01:56:46.501 --> 01:56:51.501
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that having heavyweight </v>

2668
01:56:51.501 --> 01:56:51.930
<v Speaker 5>where there's a weightless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't weigh more than two 65.</v>

2669
01:56:51.930 --> 01:56:54.140
<v Speaker 5>That seems crazy because they had a been</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2670
01:56:54.170 --> 01:56:59.170
<v Speaker 5>80 a day of the fight will look and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're struggling.</v>

2671
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go to two.</v>

2672
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:07.701
<v Speaker 5>Oh five to 20 and you have a really hard</v>
<v Speaker 5>gut and then you face a guy who's do 85.</v>

2673
01:57:08.431 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 5>Although the early morning thing I guess</v>
<v Speaker 5>has been successful right?</v>

2674
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:13.830
<v Speaker 5>The day of the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's successful.</v>

2675
01:57:13.831 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 5>Radically unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's been 17 different people missing</v>

2676
01:57:18.590 --> 01:57:23.590
<v Speaker 5>weight like one or two in the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then what's this?</v>

2677
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:26.910
<v Speaker 5>Why is that then just because they want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get the edge,</v>

2678
01:57:26.911 --> 01:57:27.960
<v Speaker 5>the safety,</v>
<v Speaker 5>safety,</v>

2679
01:57:27.961 --> 01:57:30.030
<v Speaker 5>it gives people more time to rehydrate </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>

2680
01:57:30.031 --> 01:57:32.600
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is it gives them less </v>
<v Speaker 5>time to lose the weight.</v>

2681
01:57:32.601 --> 01:57:37.601
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're starting off early in the </v>

2682
01:57:37.601 --> 01:57:37.601
<v Speaker 5>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you're,</v>

2683
01:57:37.601 --> 01:57:37.920
<v Speaker 5>if your weigh ins or at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know you're not going to eat all</v>

2684
01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:42.920
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lose weight all </v>

2685
01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:42.920
<v Speaker 5>throughout the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're way answered at 8:00</v>

2686
01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:43.960
<v Speaker 5>in the morning when you're getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lose all that weight.</v>

2687
01:57:44.370 --> 01:57:45.240
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might not,</v>

2688
01:57:45.330 --> 01:57:48.780
<v Speaker 5>you might not lose enough weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people were miscalculating including.</v>

2689
01:57:49.150 --> 01:57:54.150
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely an issue with people </v>

2690
01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:57.111
<v Speaker 5>cutting too much weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely an issue with people </v>

2691
01:57:57.111 --> 01:57:58.350
<v Speaker 5>doing it unhealthy Sunday be punished or</v>
<v Speaker 5>penalized even more though,</v>

2692
01:57:58.351 --> 01:58:02.690
<v Speaker 5>like I just recently heard Gospel 30 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of his wealth and that's what,</v>

2693
01:58:02.691 --> 01:58:03.470
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2694
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.460
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But even Calvin Gospel when they admit,</v>

2695
01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:10.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't really been looking after my </v>

2696
01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:10.640
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2697
01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:10.640
<v Speaker 5>You're a professional athlete signed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

2698
01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.350
<v Speaker 5>The biggest organization in the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>

2699
01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:18.360
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't that be part of the contract </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in if you're fighting for us that </v>

2700
01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.490
<v Speaker 5>you have to maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you almost have those.</v>

2701
01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:24.120
<v Speaker 5>I instead of even a random drug tests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>random random way to obviously they made</v>

2702
01:58:24.121 --> 01:58:25.710
<v Speaker 5>calvin go up to one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2703
01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:30.720
<v Speaker 5>Next fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's crazy is he looked fucking </v>

2704
01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.470
<v Speaker 5>insane and Tim Kennedy blew his entire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was trying to take him down and beat him</v>

2705
01:58:34.471 --> 01:58:35.340
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the earlier,</v>

2706
01:58:35.341 --> 01:58:36.340
<v Speaker 5>the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2707
01:58:36.341 --> 01:58:37.050
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2708
01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:39.720
<v Speaker 5>he showed his size advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his strength advantage.</v>

2709
01:58:39.721 --> 01:58:41.500
<v Speaker 5>He's a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2710
01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:42.000
<v Speaker 5>like he's</v>

2711
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.070
<v Speaker 3>a massive powerhouse when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>his ground and pound his Jujitsu.</v>

2712
01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 3>But Calvin just stayed the course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the defense.</v>

2713
01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually when he got on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet,</v>

2714
01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:52.800
<v Speaker 3>man way to swift and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times does he know?</v>

2715
01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Three just missed a bunch of times he </v>
<v Speaker 3>missed against Tyron Woodley and tyron </v>

2716
01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 3>and beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tyrone as a gentleman,</v>

2717
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:00.080
<v Speaker 3>decided yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even take his money.</v>

2718
01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Remember the which is a very fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical and moral move by the champ.</v>

2719
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Now the current champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he lost that.</v>

2720
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:10.510
<v Speaker 3>And I mean there was more than one fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past for that.</v>

2721
01:59:10.511 --> 01:59:12.430
<v Speaker 3>But you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say.</v>

2722
01:59:12.431 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2723
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 3>not because he's a great fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying.</v>

2724
01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 85.</v>

2725
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:18.490
<v Speaker 3>So let's hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2726
01:59:18.491 --> 01:59:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Stays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if Mrs Wade,</v>

2727
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:22.660
<v Speaker 3>you should take a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

2728
01:59:23.850 --> 01:59:28.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put the fear in them and then they </v>

2729
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:28.850
<v Speaker 3>really going to do.</v>

2730
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I think Calvin should fight at 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he could when he could.</v>

2731
01:59:30.791 --> 01:59:35.791
<v Speaker 3>When it 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he can make 70 but he doesn't </v>

2732
01:59:35.791 --> 01:59:35.791
<v Speaker 3>always make sense or you're right one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2733
01:59:35.791 --> 01:59:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean unless he wants to lose a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 3>body fat and then try fighting at one </v>

2734
01:59:40.730 --> 01:59:40.730
<v Speaker 3>70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2735
01:59:40.730 --> 01:59:43.530
<v Speaker 3>really clean his diet up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really go down the bricks.</v>

2736
01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Donnie Henderson does not seem like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same person.</v>

2737
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh what it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of Thompson wrecking them the </v>

2738
01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.391
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I agree because I heard you say as </v>

2739
01:59:54.391 --> 01:59:54.391
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though like physically did not look</v>

2740
01:59:54.391 --> 01:59:54.960
<v Speaker 3>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2741
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:58.750
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't look like he works as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like he is as motivated.</v>

2742
01:59:58.751 --> 02:00:02.410
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't look as hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His vaunted knockout power is gone.</v>

2743
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

2744
02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird,</v>

2745
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.070
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2746
02:00:06.130 --> 02:00:11.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted him and I said a long time ago </v>

2747
02:00:11.130 --> 02:00:13.291
<v Speaker 3>if I was just coaching with his tie his </v>
<v Speaker 3>left hand through his body and it put </v>

2748
02:00:13.291 --> 02:00:13.291
<v Speaker 3>them after every workout.</v>

2749
02:00:13.291 --> 02:00:15.490
<v Speaker 3>You go three or four rounds on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2750
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:20.520
<v Speaker 3>just using your right hand Kale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if he developed a right hand on </v>

2751
02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:23.881
<v Speaker 3>top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because it was 90 percent was </v>

2752
02:00:23.881 --> 02:00:23.881
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2753
02:00:23.881 --> 02:00:25.480
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you open a whole new door,</v>

2754
02:00:25.481 --> 02:00:26.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2755
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:31.310
<v Speaker 3>and it's an unfair to question someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they tested positive for </v>

2756
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:32.380
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they took anything,</v>

2757
02:00:32.381 --> 02:00:37.381
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he never tested positive for </v>

2758
02:00:37.381 --> 02:00:40.141
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't look at it that I don't </v>

2759
02:00:40.141 --> 02:00:41.461
<v Speaker 3>think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he know maybe a diuretic or </v>

2760
02:00:41.461 --> 02:00:41.461
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2761
02:00:41.461 --> 02:00:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Maybe find out if Johnny Hendricks ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested positive for something.</v>

2762
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:45.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2763
02:00:45.131 --> 02:00:50.131
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people throwing </v>
<v Speaker 3>accusations about him and George St </v>

2764
02:00:50.131 --> 02:00:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Pierre was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what it costs will be one </v>

2765
02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:52.890
<v Speaker 3>of the things he said about his last </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

2766
02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:56.110
<v Speaker 3>he said he worked out four times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>week one time,</v>

2767
02:00:56.111 --> 02:00:56.860
<v Speaker 3>four times a week.</v>

2768
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:59.110
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just was not focused on that fight.</v>

2769
02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:01.060
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to get.</v>

2770
02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:06.190
<v Speaker 3>That's why he looks like that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with Usada or anything </v>

2771
02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:06.190
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't have the hunger.</v>

2772
02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:06.920
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you,</v>

2773
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:11.000
<v Speaker 3>you put yourself at great risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also mentally going into the fight.</v>

2774
02:01:11.001 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 3>If you know that another guy trained 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times a week and you're trained for what</v>

2775
02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:19.771
<v Speaker 3>are you going to do it for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird that his power went </v>

2776
02:01:19.771 --> 02:01:20.400
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he used to make ice crumble.</v>

2777
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:23.200
<v Speaker 3>He used to let me know when he hit John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fitch and went flying,</v>

2778
02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Martin Kampmann flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went flying.</v>

2779
02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:28.550
<v Speaker 3>It was like he had magic in his hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden it stopped.</v>

2780
02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 3>So what the fuck really just ruined him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2781
02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:38.250
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2782
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:43.470
<v Speaker 3>And you fucked him up and he fucked him </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with like using that front leg side </v>

2783
02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:43.470
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>

2784
02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:47.680
<v Speaker 3>And then the front leg round kiss would </v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit a bad one to the body and then </v>

2785
02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:48.370
<v Speaker 3>johnny leg nods his head like you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2786
02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:50.480
<v Speaker 3>And then slap the same one right up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the face.</v>

2787
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing with water boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he makes it.</v>

2788
02:01:53.410 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfectly.</v>

2789
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:57.290
<v Speaker 3>And then it suddenly a hook a get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>question mark and it's every time it's a</v>

2790
02:01:57.291 --> 02:01:59.270
<v Speaker 3>different cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what's going to come.</v>

2791
02:01:59.271 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Mr Berger Talk Shit about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the spinning kicks.</v>

2792
02:02:02.661 --> 02:02:03.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a waste of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2793
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for real.</v>

2794
02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.290
<v Speaker 3>This shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a coincidence city.</v>

2795
02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:09.290
<v Speaker 3>We'll kicked ellenberger in the head </v>
<v Speaker 3>twice.</v>

2796
02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Here's your waste of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2797
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2798
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:15.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's some fucking super good at this.</v>

2799
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 3>But Greg King,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of combat sports.</v>

2817
02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Stevens starts talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2821
02:03:17.901 --> 02:03:19.510
<v Speaker 3>You say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he looked back.</v>

2822
02:03:22.290 --> 02:03:27.290
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious when he went in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dilated Eddie Alvarez like that.</v>

2823
02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:31.160
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

2824
02:03:31.590 --> 02:03:35.750
<v Speaker 3>He's any of that style of sliding out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sliding in.</v>

2825
02:03:35.751 --> 02:03:40.751
<v Speaker 3>It's a very unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost a karate based style with like </v>

2826
02:03:40.751 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 3>sitting down on vicious punches on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of it,</v>

2827
02:03:42.861 --> 02:03:47.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't hit stamps and because </v>

2828
02:03:47.861 --> 02:03:47.861
<v Speaker 3>she's a soccer ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2829
02:03:47.861 --> 02:03:47.861
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2830
02:03:47.861 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 3>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although if I was all those coach a year</v>

2831
02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:55.060
<v Speaker 3>ago already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have said when we go to trey </v>

2832
02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:58.200
<v Speaker 3>South Pole and you because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>way he can block those low kicks if </v>

2833
02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:58.670
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way he can block them because</v>

2834
02:03:58.671 --> 02:04:02.250
<v Speaker 3>his stance is too white and his knees </v>
<v Speaker 3>are pointing to the again,</v>

2835
02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:07.350
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole game changes the whole game </v>

2836
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:08.310
<v Speaker 3>and his left low kick by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

2837
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Although could kick the fuck out of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>with either low or right.</v>

2838
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Wow Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2839
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2840
02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:18.310
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made me think of for Ramon dekkers,</v>

2841
02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that explosive.</v>

2843
02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.780
<v Speaker 3>They call the Duchy left to the body and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then right leg kicked behind it.</v>

2844
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Chad Mendez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Though he throws it man.</v>

2846
02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I think although and Max Holloway's have</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting fight that fight.</v>

2847
02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:37.620

<v Speaker 3>It has happen.</v>

2852
02:04:49.330 --> 02:04:54.330
<v Speaker 3>everyone already even talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcwane instead of staying in their way </v>

2853
02:04:55.531 --> 02:05:00.030
<v Speaker 3>instead of defending the title they own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's obviously not as big a fight</v>

2854
02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:01.980
<v Speaker 3>is him fighting Nijmegen madoff in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

2855
02:05:02.090 --> 02:05:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially if they fight for a 55 </v>

2856
02:05:07.090 --> 02:05:10.251
<v Speaker 3>pound title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've never gone out fights in Russia </v>

2857
02:05:10.251 --> 02:05:10.251
<v Speaker 3>and they might have to fucking build a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new soccer stadium.</v>

2858
02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime I post something on Instagram,</v>

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Like if you fight conor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting about the </v>

2867
02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:41.320
<v Speaker 3>conor fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2868
02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:41.340
<v Speaker 3>lack Habib time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Habib time.</v>

2869
02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:41.880
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2870
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:43.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not fucking around.</v>

2871
02:05:43.111 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It's all true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

2872
02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:46.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he fights connor,</v>

2873
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Johnson cracked him and rocked </v>

2874
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

2875
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:54.650
<v Speaker 3>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did get angry and he beat the fuck </v>

2876
02:05:54.650 --> 02:05:56.350
<v Speaker 3>out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is he got hurt,</v>

2877
02:05:56.351 --> 02:05:58.650
<v Speaker 3>he got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if connor catches you like that,</v>

2878
02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:00.450
<v Speaker 3>you might be fucking Donesville.</v>

2879
02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:04.110
<v Speaker 3>He might drop some hammers on you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be the same thing.</v>

2880
02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The we've seen caught her as well at </v>

2881
02:06:09.170 --> 02:06:11.520
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the bet habibs defense.</v>

2882
02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:15.210
<v Speaker 3>We saw conor get rocked against nate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wind up losing that fight.</v>

2883
02:06:15.211 --> 02:06:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Shortly thereafter Habib got rocked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Michael Johnson came back stronger.</v>

2884
02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominated him.</v>

2885
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.830
<v Speaker 3>So it was the only time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2886
02:06:22.831 --> 02:06:24.970
<v Speaker 3>it's when you see a guy with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant is a Habib,</v>

2887
02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.700
<v Speaker 3>you start looking for weaknesses in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm.</v>

2888
02:06:26.701 --> 02:06:28.440
<v Speaker 3>It's the only time we've seen any </v>
<v Speaker 3>weakness at all.</v>

2889
02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:29.300
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg,</v>

2890
02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:31.600
<v Speaker 3>in his defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was getting tired already there.</v>

2891
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

2892
02:06:34.690 --> 02:06:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2893
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Would that be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't get tired.</v>

2894
02:06:36.241 --> 02:06:41.241
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that funny video to habit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>narrating guy who's constantly dropping </v>

2895
02:06:41.241 --> 02:06:45.141
<v Speaker 3>f bombs leftover?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell a story about how bp they always </v>

2896
02:06:45.141 --> 02:06:46.200
<v Speaker 3>training and where you coach from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one was six years old.</v>

2897
02:06:46.201 --> 02:06:50.100
<v Speaker 3>He was already wrestling with fricking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears and it's really funny.</v>

2898
02:06:50.101 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on here right now somewhere.</v>

2899
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what the name of the show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hobby.</v>

2900
02:06:56.010 --> 02:07:01.010
<v Speaker 3>A Hobby Promo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put that on trusting man of the </v>

2901
02:07:01.561 --> 02:07:06.561
<v Speaker 3>world title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lately made so it will pop up and </v>

2902
02:07:06.561 --> 02:07:06.900
<v Speaker 3>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's really funny.</v>

2903
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see them wrestling a bear.</v>

2904
02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:14.300
<v Speaker 3>A bear when he was six years old and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he starts talking about his father </v>

2905
02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 3>who was already a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the other thing.</v>

2906
02:07:15.031 --> 02:07:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Judo Guy MMA and sample reports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The memes.</v>

2907
02:07:17.941 --> 02:07:21.490
<v Speaker 3>The use of social media get so cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the.</v>

2908
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Unless you Ronda Rousey's Nunez fight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>should come in so many fucking people.</v>

2909
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.520
<v Speaker 3>You know what those mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

2910
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 3>what do you think she's coming back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2911
02:07:34.411 --> 02:07:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2912
02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think if she does,</v>

2913
02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:42.910
<v Speaker 5>she should come back in a calculated </v>
<v Speaker 5>manner.</v>

2914
02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 5>Like don't just rush in and fight for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the title like she did.</v>

2915
02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 5>I think that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Taking a year off,</v>

2916
02:07:48.131 --> 02:07:49.570
<v Speaker 5>getting head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knocked out,</v>

2917
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:51.130
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's your head out?</v>

2918
02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:56.620
<v Speaker 5>And was she 100 percent committed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this as far as like training for the </v>

2919
02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:59.170
<v Speaker 5>entire time off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or did she just get in really good shape</v>

2920
02:07:59.171 --> 02:08:01.900
<v Speaker 5>over the last few months and had she </v>
<v Speaker 5>been training at all before then?</v>

2921
02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:06.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to ask her and answer all </v>

2922
02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:06.920
<v Speaker 5>those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if she doesn't want to be fighting,</v>

2923
02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:08.200
<v Speaker 5>she shouldn't be fighting,</v>

2924
02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:13.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know from the beginning of </v>

2925
02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:16.510
<v Speaker 4>movement head movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I assumed they worked on the hand </v>

2926
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:18.390
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think the pressure and the way </v>

2927
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.570
<v Speaker 4>she comes to the angry phase and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that shuts her down and,</v>

2928
02:08:18.571 --> 02:08:20.120
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still much pressure.</v>

2929
02:08:20.121 --> 02:08:23.510
<v Speaker 4>A whole Hollywood career writes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's not gonna happen now,</v>

2930
02:08:23.511 --> 02:08:24.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2931
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:27.880
<v Speaker 4>because buddy was a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked about no footwork,</v>

2932
02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:31.910
<v Speaker 4>no defense thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what nurses can do to you.</v>

2933
02:08:31.911 --> 02:08:35.090
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see a Rhonda with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>smile on her face,</v>

2934
02:08:35.091 --> 02:08:37.430
<v Speaker 4>go tutoring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being relaxed and calm,</v>

2935
02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.730
<v Speaker 4>send her away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to a Duane Ludwig for a year and have</v>

2936
02:08:40.731 --> 02:08:43.640
<v Speaker 4>some smokers because she can still </v>
<v Speaker 4>legally do that.</v>

2937
02:08:43.970 --> 02:08:45.650
<v Speaker 4>And other clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just striking,</v>

2938
02:08:45.651 --> 02:08:46.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2939
02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:48.740
<v Speaker 4>to just get in that moment that to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you went.</v>

2940
02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I think in training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the problem that everybody has,</v>

2941
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:52.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in training,</v>

2942
02:08:52.611 --> 02:08:53.480
<v Speaker 4>you always do good.</v>

2943
02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys do good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know as well as I do that as </v>

2944
02:08:58.570 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 4>these gym guys are really good in </v>
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>

2945
02:08:58.570 --> 02:09:00.490
<v Speaker 4>they can do it on a pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if she's been boxing and working on a</v>

2946
02:09:00.491 --> 02:09:02.180
<v Speaker 4>striking and she's been hitting people </v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

2947
02:09:02.181 --> 02:09:03.830
<v Speaker 4>they're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got some good people coming in.</v>

2948
02:09:03.831 --> 02:09:08.770
<v Speaker 4>I heard that she works out even with </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing champions are champions and doing</v>

2949
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:10.970
<v Speaker 4>well against this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>

2950
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.720
<v Speaker 4>you know that that's a nice safe </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2951
02:09:14.721 --> 02:09:18.470
<v Speaker 4>Bringing it under pressure with all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>crap she had on her shoulders.</v>

2952
02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I thought it's also takes it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New is a very,</v>

2953
02:09:22.610 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sod In strikeforce kicks right away,</v>

2954
02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:31.640
<v Speaker 4>her kicks or punches and kicks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>punches so fucking hard and she has long</v>

2955
02:09:31.641 --> 02:09:35.570
<v Speaker 4>arms man and she puts you on the end of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these long punches and cheat.</v>

2956
02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Dinged Rhonda very early in the fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could tell she was rock.</v>

2957
02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:40.610
<v Speaker 4>She goes right back into the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2958
02:09:40.611 --> 02:09:41.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2959
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.290
<v Speaker 4>and Nunez also leans all the way over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's hard to take her down,</v>

2960
02:09:45.291 --> 02:09:46.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and run.</v>

2961
02:09:46.251 --> 02:09:47.390
<v Speaker 4>That should also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2962
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:49.700
<v Speaker 4>and maybe she's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying what I don't see,</v>

2963
02:09:49.701 --> 02:09:51.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe stock wrestling over a small intel</v>

2964
02:09:51.831 --> 02:09:53.810
<v Speaker 4>because a girl like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so much talent,</v>

2965
02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:59.020
<v Speaker 4>she'll pick that up so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if she suddenly suits for a singer </v>

2966
02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.150
<v Speaker 4>or don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she'd already been rock.</v>

2967
02:10:00.151 --> 02:10:03.200
<v Speaker 4>So I think that because remember she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>shocked her off clenches.</v>

2968
02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2969
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:06.210
<v Speaker 5>his upper body couch and she always </v>
<v Speaker 5>reaches him with the left arm.</v>

2970
02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.990
<v Speaker 5>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know Greg Jackson,</v>

2971
02:10:07.991 --> 02:10:12.991
<v Speaker 5>I talked about it after the Holly Holm </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight that they had seen every single </v>

2972
02:10:12.991 --> 02:10:12.991
<v Speaker 5>one of her fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She comes at you,</v>

2973
02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:14.740
<v Speaker 5>she got that left arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extended,</v>

2974
02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:16.600
<v Speaker 5>tries to get ahold of girls with left </v>
<v Speaker 5>arm hip,</v>

2975
02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:17.920
<v Speaker 5>tosses them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets them on the ground,</v>

2976
02:10:17.921 --> 02:10:19.390
<v Speaker 5>armbars on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they just were.</v>

2977
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:19.640
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2978
02:10:20.410 --> 02:10:23.870
<v Speaker 4>that was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting that home shifting from mma,</v>

2979
02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:26.990
<v Speaker 4>from boxing Dema just trained for Ronda </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rousey fight.</v>

2980
02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Cody car brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember Shit as a kickboxing,</v>

2981
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:30.290
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and boxing champ,</v>

2982
02:10:30.291 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying in terms of our MMA prep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the goal was Ronda Rousey right</v>

2983
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.800
<v Speaker 3>and now with cody garbrandt he talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in high school,</v>

2984
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Dominick Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think you wonder,</v>

2985
02:10:38.691 --> 02:10:39.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2986
02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.430
<v Speaker 3>the laser focus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2987
02:10:40.431 --> 02:10:45.431
<v Speaker 3>The television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously you have to work on </v>

2988
02:10:45.431 --> 02:10:47.051
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if that's your target and you see </v>

2989
02:10:47.051 --> 02:10:48.650
<v Speaker 3>what he did to cruise it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's a lot of fighters like that</v>

2990
02:10:48.651 --> 02:10:53.651
<v Speaker 3>that attract greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think Anderson Silva attracted </v>

2991
02:10:53.651 --> 02:10:56.441
<v Speaker 3>greatness and I think one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 3>why Weidman became as great as he was </v>

2992
02:10:56.441 --> 02:10:57.320
<v Speaker 3>because he knew that Anderson Silva was </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the top of the mountain.</v>

2993
02:10:57.450 --> 02:10:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Can you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2994
02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.190
<v Speaker 3>that assassin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2995
02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:03.270
<v Speaker 3>and Weidman caught him like right at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right time and you know,</v>

2996
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:06.630
<v Speaker 3>knocked them out and then the broken leg</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the second fight and it.</v>

2997
02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I think when you have a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion like Anderson was for so many </v>

2998
02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those young kids coming up,</v>

2999
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:15.560
<v Speaker 3>that's who they aspire to and raises the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bar like I want.</v>

3000
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm really curious to see what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flyweights look like in a few years.</v>

3001
02:11:18.451 --> 02:11:23.451
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of how good mighty mouse is </v>

3002
02:11:23.451 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 3>because his bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's raised it so it's way above </v>

3003
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3004
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3005
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:30.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and associate for getting to coastal </v>

3006
02:11:30.311 --> 02:11:30.311
<v Speaker 3>planning for two feet next to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

3007
02:11:30.311 --> 02:11:34.660
<v Speaker 3>having no for backwards site and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>let her will move with whatsoever you </v>

3008
02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:37.781
<v Speaker 3>can only lean as much backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right for that left hook he received </v>

3009
02:11:37.781 --> 02:11:37.781
<v Speaker 3>from Weipa and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3010
02:11:37.781 --> 02:11:42.531
<v Speaker 3>when he fought Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had a very clever move that a lot of </v>

3011
02:11:42.531 --> 02:11:46.091
<v Speaker 3>people missed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what he did was he threw a right </v>

3012
02:11:46.091 --> 02:11:46.091
<v Speaker 3>hand and then behind the right hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>threw,</v>

3013
02:11:46.091 --> 02:11:49.640
<v Speaker 3>he threw a back fist so there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a punch coming from the left and then he</v>

3014
02:11:49.641 --> 02:11:54.641
<v Speaker 3>moved towards it and another punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming towards left because it was a </v>

3015
02:11:54.641 --> 02:11:55.820
<v Speaker 3>left hook because the Anderson is doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is bobbing and weaving stuff.</v>

3016
02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:57.080
<v Speaker 3>But when a punch comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3017
02:11:57.081 --> 02:11:59.710
<v Speaker 3>and then a backfill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to go that way up.</v>

3018
02:11:59.750 --> 02:12:02.180
<v Speaker 3>So then he's got to go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he went back,</v>

3019
02:12:02.181 --> 02:12:07.181
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when Chris Weidman cracked him </v>

3020
02:12:07.181 --> 02:12:09.071
<v Speaker 3>with that long left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the same punch that he used to </v>

3021
02:12:09.071 --> 02:12:11.981
<v Speaker 3>knock out your rial hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws this long straight armed hook </v>

3022
02:12:11.981 --> 02:12:13.970
<v Speaker 3>and it's very deceiving how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance you can cover with it,</v>

3023
02:12:14.230 --> 02:12:15.330
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3024
02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:17.610
<v Speaker 3>A lot of distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus it sent straight spot.</v>

3025
02:12:17.690 --> 02:12:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Straight punches are better as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>

3026
02:12:19.561 --> 02:12:24.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I always liked to use </v>

3027
02:12:24.561 --> 02:12:24.561
<v Speaker 3>clotheslines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3028
02:12:24.561 --> 02:12:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have more reach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you connect with a left hook,</v>

3029
02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:27.300
<v Speaker 3>you'll wait to see if the person doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>move your weight,</v>

3030
02:12:27.301 --> 02:12:30.590
<v Speaker 3>your close for a straight punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you make it a palm strike,</v>

3031
02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:32.690
<v Speaker 3>now we have some space that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover.</v>

3032
02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.900
<v Speaker 3>What did you think a Yoel Romero </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocking out Weidman was not insane.</v>

3033
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Why did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did white men even wanted to go for </v>

3034
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.350
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3035
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.750
<v Speaker 3>he had the whole training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3036
02:12:41.751 --> 02:12:43.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no clue.</v>

3037
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I did it because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we knew we should not do that.</v>

3038
02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as she lowered himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

3039
02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just glided.</v>

3040
02:12:50.121 --> 02:12:53.080
<v Speaker 3>There's just a perfect knee because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing freaking awesome.</v>

3041
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:54.970
<v Speaker 3>We did exactly what I said in the game </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan,</v>

3042
02:12:54.971 --> 02:12:56.060
<v Speaker 3>and you'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

3043
02:12:56.061 --> 02:12:57.380
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if he keep him down,</v>

3044
02:12:57.381 --> 02:12:59.180
<v Speaker 3>take him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll get all those muscles working.</v>

3045
02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get them tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3046
02:13:01.081 --> 02:13:05.090
<v Speaker 3>and it was working for him until you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>well decided to wrestle with them.</v>

3047
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.820
<v Speaker 3>And then he was thrown Weidman around </v>
<v Speaker 3>that second round.</v>

3048
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:11.180
<v Speaker 3>That's when you realize how strong a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler he is,</v>

3049
02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 3>how good his wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another saying,</v>

3050
02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:19.320
<v Speaker 3>the wrestling of the high level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympic caliber and get our to dangerous</v>

3051
02:13:20.151 --> 02:13:25.151
<v Speaker 3>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's the freak of all free </v>

3052
02:13:25.151 --> 02:13:28.930
<v Speaker 3>stands next to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looks like what in the fuck did </v>

3053
02:13:28.930 --> 02:13:30.320
<v Speaker 3>they feed you in Cuba?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the same thing with him.</v>

3054
02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine if he starts focusing</v>

3055
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 2>on the right side a little bit more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a super freaked his guy is going to</v>

3056
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:38.910
<v Speaker 2>be because all those attacks are coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>to left leg,</v>

3057
02:13:38.911 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 2>left knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left straight,</v>

3058
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.320
<v Speaker 2>pretty much the only way time when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses the right look,</v>

3059
02:13:42.321 --> 02:13:45.330
<v Speaker 2>he gets to set up a straight punch or </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick or whatever.</v>

3060
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 2>And he doesn't throw with power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should counter that,</v>

3061
02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.720
<v Speaker 2>that right kick that distros outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack or inside leg,</v>

3062
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:55.730
<v Speaker 2>whatever statute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you should counter that instantly </v>

3063
02:13:55.730 --> 02:13:55.730
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise the big hand is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come.</v>

3064
02:13:55.730 --> 02:13:57.990
<v Speaker 2>But if he starts developing a right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a right kick,</v>

3065
02:13:58.210 --> 02:14:02.190
<v Speaker 2>just do things so right near right who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he is,</v>

3066
02:14:02.230 --> 02:14:04.520
<v Speaker 2>he too muscular and I know it's late for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3067
02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like</v>

3068
02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.160
<v Speaker 5>you look at a guy like that because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>save physical specimen man,</v>

3069
02:14:10.161 --> 02:14:12.110
<v Speaker 5>just so incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3070
02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:13.520
<v Speaker 5>above and beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet,</v>

3071
02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:19.120
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's working for him while he's humble </v>

3072
02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:19.120
<v Speaker 5>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3073
02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:20.810
<v Speaker 5>So it's definitely not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just has to manage it.</v>

3074
02:14:20.811 --> 02:14:25.811
<v Speaker 5>Like in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same way tyron woodley uses his </v>

3075
02:14:25.811 --> 02:14:26.780
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's obviously much more muscular,</v>

3076
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:28.970
<v Speaker 5>much stronger than most guys in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>division.</v>

3077
02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:32.360
<v Speaker 5>And he showed the wonderboy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Woodley knows how to manage it.</v>

3078
02:14:32.361 --> 02:14:34.790
<v Speaker 5>And I came out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went full five rounds.</v>

3079
02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:38.060
<v Speaker 5>And what's really important is that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>stunned wonderboy and the fourth.</v>

3080
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:43.270
<v Speaker 5>So they're in the championship round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>still rocked him and hurt him bad and </v>

3081
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.370
<v Speaker 5>had them in deep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep trouble.</v>

3082
02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:48.640
<v Speaker 5>So I feel like there's so many benefits </v>
<v Speaker 5>to being as powerful as Yellow Romero </v>

3083
02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:49.970
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely a downside.</v>

3084
02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:55.180
<v Speaker 5>The downside is if a guy like Weidman </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't shoot for that and was constantly</v>

3085
02:14:56.031 --> 02:15:01.031
<v Speaker 5>wearing on him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly grinding on him and had him </v>

3086
02:15:01.031 --> 02:15:03.551
<v Speaker 5>in a bit of trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Tim Kennedy had been his second </v>

3087
02:15:03.551 --> 02:15:03.551
<v Speaker 5>round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you know,</v>

3088
02:15:03.551 --> 02:15:03.551
<v Speaker 5>we'll see what happens.</v>

3089
02:15:03.551 --> 02:15:06.650
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean even in the Kennedy fight,</v>

3090
02:15:06.651 --> 02:15:08.420
<v Speaker 5>he definitely cheated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3091
02:15:08.421 --> 02:15:13.100
<v Speaker 5>You definitely saw that and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was tired,</v>

3092
02:15:13.101 --> 02:15:16.150
<v Speaker 5>but they still at knockout power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's still recovering.</v>

3093
02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:18.620
<v Speaker 5>I still came back to fuck Kennedy and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

3094
02:15:18.621 --> 02:15:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's such a monster.</v>

3095
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:26.770
<v Speaker 5>He's so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's so much better of an athlete than </v>

3096
02:15:26.770 --> 02:15:28.310
<v Speaker 5>almost anybody else in the division.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he throws guys around,</v>

3097
02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:30.500
<v Speaker 5>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could just go sailing.</v>

3098
02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:36.170
<v Speaker 5>Or guys who.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always been impressed with a guy </v>

3099
02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:40.450
<v Speaker 5>who mean the guy with the striking to me</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he well fucked him up to hit him </v>

3100
02:15:45.531 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 5>with that spinning back fist and hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>them all.</v>

3101
02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:52.420
<v Speaker 5>All hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Came back from that fight in one good </v>

3102
02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:55.740
<v Speaker 5>thoroughbreds mare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of great fights and what know know</v>

3103
02:15:55.760 --> 02:16:00.760
<v Speaker 5>Yoel Romero one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wanted the decision but the cision </v>

3104
02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:01.600
<v Speaker 5>was overturned because of the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3105
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000
<v Speaker 5>he had some sort of peptides that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>found in the supplement that he was </v>

3106
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.681
<v Speaker 5>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they only gave him like a nine month </v>

3107
02:16:11.681 --> 02:16:11.681
<v Speaker 5>suspension was Saint Joe's took</v>

3108
02:16:11.681 --> 02:16:13.250
<v Speaker 2>for understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't watch to me was like,</v>

3109
02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:15.590
<v Speaker 2>that was kind of weird because he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed by.</v>

3110
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:17.720
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely not.</v>

3111
02:16:17.721 --> 02:16:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought that.</v>

3112
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:18.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3113
02:16:18.921 --> 02:16:23.921
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had some growth hormone thing inside </v>

3114
02:16:23.921 --> 02:16:24.260
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas Jones had clomifene.</v>

3115
02:16:24.710 --> 02:16:26.440
<v Speaker 5>Clomifene is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3116
02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:31.720
<v Speaker 5>an estrogen suppressor that people use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kickstart their testosterone production </v>

3117
02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 5>after a steroid cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an extra burden.</v>

3118
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Estrogen rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3119
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:39.490
<v Speaker 5>suppressing the first one who brought </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually the product that he says,</v>

3120
02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:42.890
<v Speaker 5>this is what I looked into it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I never.</v>

3121
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:45.370
<v Speaker 5>I always said that the older fighters </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

3122
02:16:45.371 --> 02:16:46.440
<v Speaker 5>but nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I would be,</v>

3123
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 5>the guy would say this is what it took </v>
<v Speaker 5>police test is,</v>

3124
02:16:48.431 --> 02:16:50.970
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you a proponent like cut?</v>

3125
02:16:50.971 --> 02:16:55.971
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people say why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do supplements actually do for the </v>

3126
02:16:55.971 --> 02:16:58.971
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the athlete if this is what's been </v>

3127
02:16:58.971 --> 02:16:59.290
<v Speaker 5>happening with attendance where you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>your supplements from there.</v>

3128
02:16:59.291 --> 02:17:03.460
<v Speaker 5>The real issue with supplements is some </v>
<v Speaker 5>of them definitely work,</v>

3129
02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:04.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3130
02:17:04.571 --> 02:17:09.571
<v Speaker 5>how much should you be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>enhance your body with nutritional </v>

3131
02:17:09.571 --> 02:17:09.571
<v Speaker 5>supplements?</v>

3132
02:17:09.571 --> 02:17:13.640
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there's a lot of supplements at </v>

3133
02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:15.031
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Creatine works is a lot of stuff that </v>

3134
02:17:15.031 --> 02:17:15.031
<v Speaker 5>works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have to figure out like,</v>

3135
02:17:15.031 --> 02:17:15.640
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well how much can it work?</v>

3136
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:20.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it obviously can't work like Andrew on </v>

3137
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:21.820
<v Speaker 5>or all those hormone precursors that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've all band.</v>

3138
02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:23.050
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it can't work that good.</v>

3139
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Can it work as good as this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like there's all these </v>

3140
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:28.330
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3141
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:28.330
<v Speaker 5>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

3142
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:32.190
<v Speaker 5>there's certain protocols that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>follow when ti comes of it turns to have</v>

3143
02:17:32.191 --> 02:17:37.191
<v Speaker 5>a vitamin replacements and they do ivy </v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamin drips and extreme concentration </v>

3144
02:17:38.261 --> 02:17:40.270
<v Speaker 5>on their nutrition and they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>results.</v>

3145
02:17:40.850 --> 02:17:42.220
<v Speaker 5>Those results,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3146
02:17:42.310 --> 02:17:47.310
<v Speaker 5>they tend to show that there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefits in supplementation and there's </v>

3147
02:17:47.310 --> 02:17:52.081
<v Speaker 5>definitely benefits and clean diet and </v>
<v Speaker 5>making sure that your nutritional </v>

3148
02:17:52.081 --> 02:17:55.621
<v Speaker 5>balances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like at what level should it be </v>

3149
02:17:55.621 --> 02:17:55.621
<v Speaker 5>illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3150
02:17:55.621 --> 02:17:55.900
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How you found the fuck.</v>

3151
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:57.850
<v Speaker 5>Are you getting so much?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Twelve out of nature.</v>

3152
02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.860
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to take it in a pill.</v>

3153
02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:02.050
<v Speaker 5>Then it gives you energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well what the fuck is that?</v>

3154
02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:05.180
<v Speaker 5>And you could take some caffeine like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chael Sonnen,</v>

3155
02:18:05.181 --> 02:18:10.181
<v Speaker 5>he used to take caffeine pills to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure that he got the exact amount of </v>

3156
02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:13.771
<v Speaker 5>caffeine because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know because you get a </v>

3157
02:18:13.771 --> 02:18:13.771
<v Speaker 5>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might get a Venti starbucks and they</v>

3158
02:18:13.771 --> 02:18:17.590
<v Speaker 5>might've fucking packed it in tight and </v>
<v Speaker 5>chews the shit out of it and you can get</v>

3159
02:18:17.591 --> 02:18:22.591
<v Speaker 5>a cup of coffee like coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it might actually test over.</v>

3160
02:18:22.841 --> 02:18:26.410
<v Speaker 5>So in order to make sure that jail was </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the the lines,</v>

3161
02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:28.640
<v Speaker 5>he would take pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Caffeine is illegal.</v>

3162
02:18:28.641 --> 02:18:31.050
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of lifts legal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Illegal.</v>

3163
02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:33.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you get to a certain number,</v>

3164
02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:34.680
<v Speaker 5>it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3165
02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:37.690
<v Speaker 5>If you get past a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>milligrams in your system,</v>

3166
02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how they mentioned that.</v>

3167
02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:40.790
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>testosterone,</v>

3168
02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.800
<v Speaker 5>deputy testosterone or talk to medical </v>
<v Speaker 5>professionals and everyone saying men </v>

3169
02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:47.680
<v Speaker 5>you produce supposed to be around one </v>
<v Speaker 5>took one.</v>

3170
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:48.580
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3171
02:18:48.581 --> 02:18:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're some weird freak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might be like one to two.</v>

3172
02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:54.400
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So four to one or six to one.</v>

3173
02:18:55.330 --> 02:18:56.080
<v Speaker 5>How does that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3174
02:18:56.081 --> 02:19:01.081
<v Speaker 5>that's always been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about is wanting to learn and for </v>

3175
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:05.150
<v Speaker 5>injury recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe and I know a lot of people.</v>

3176
02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:06.270
<v Speaker 5>Fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they said.</v>

3177
02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:08.080
<v Speaker 5>Well Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a mortgage.</v>

3178
02:19:08.081 --> 02:19:09.580
<v Speaker 5>I have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to support the family.</v>

3179
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:14.440
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way to monitor that where </v>
<v Speaker 5>even though the band steroid thing where</v>

3180
02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:19.560
<v Speaker 5>you can allow a person to at least make </v>
<v Speaker 5>a living without making it an </v>

3181
02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:20.310
<v Speaker 5>enhancement?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3182
02:19:20.311 --> 02:19:22.740
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be an enhancement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem right away.</v>

3183
02:19:22.741 --> 02:19:27.741
<v Speaker 5>When is he going to be an enhancement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you take steroids while you're </v>

3184
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:31.350
<v Speaker 5>like say if you have a knee surgery and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he takes steroids and then you're </v>

3185
02:19:31.350 --> 02:19:33.851
<v Speaker 5>lifting weights the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're going to keep some of those </v>

3186
02:19:33.851 --> 02:19:36.461
<v Speaker 5>games,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to keep a certain </v>

3187
02:19:36.461 --> 02:19:36.461
<v Speaker 5>percentage of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on the flip side,</v>

3188
02:19:36.461 --> 02:19:40.631
<v Speaker 5>your endocrine system is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and it's going to take you a </v>

3189
02:19:40.631 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 5>while to get back to normal testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 5>production.</v>

3190
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:44.840
<v Speaker 5>If you do end up testing and you do go </v>
<v Speaker 5>back on Usada after the injury.</v>

3191
02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:47.450
<v Speaker 5>So there's an argument so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking a risk,</v>

3192
02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:52.630
<v Speaker 5>you do recover quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it might not be better for your </v>

3193
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.630
<v Speaker 5>overall hormone system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3194
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:54.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was talking about it,</v>

3195
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:56.190
<v Speaker 2>we did it on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3196
02:19:56.191 --> 02:20:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't memorize have it memorized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a test but testosterone,</v>

3197
02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.130
<v Speaker 2>what they did in the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bri,</v>

3198
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Bri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3199
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:07.460
<v Speaker 2>steroids and after steroids and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start really testing biological passport</v>

3200
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:12.490
<v Speaker 2>and they say that it actually did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>help that more people who didn't use had</v>

3201
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:16.040
<v Speaker 2>better results than the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>

3202
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And it was same thing as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that face,</v>

3203
02:20:18.861 --> 02:20:20.030
<v Speaker 2>what you have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two analysts,</v>

3204
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.990
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3205
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:22.850

02:21:26.031 --> 02:21:27.350
<v Speaker 5>but they've been going back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3226
02:21:27.351 --> 02:21:32.351
<v Speaker 5>they use the old samples from 2008 and </v>
<v Speaker 5>12 and they've already kicked out to a </v>

3227
02:21:32.351 --> 02:21:34.250
<v Speaker 5>Russian Olympic gold medalists in </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling.</v>

3228
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:39.730
<v Speaker 5>They were on the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're on the shit that just on this </v>

3229
02:21:39.730 --> 02:21:40.190
<v Speaker 5>undetectable shit or some shit that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't detect yet.</v>

3230
02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:42.020
<v Speaker 5>Which of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you see him.</v>

3231

3232
02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:50.910

<v Speaker 5>Is it ever going to be clean?</v>

3233

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's way cleaner now in the UFC that </v>

3234
02:21:55.911 --> 02:21:55.911
<v Speaker 5>it's ever been before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's also.</v>

3235
02:21:55.911 --> 02:21:58.610
<v Speaker 5>I liked the fact that one fcs available </v>
<v Speaker 5>for guys who don't want to be clean.</v>

3236
02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Risings available for guys who don't </v>

3237
02:22:03.850 --> 02:22:03.850
<v Speaker 5>want to be clean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3238
02:22:03.850 --> 02:22:04.520
<v Speaker 5>there's an argument either way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an argument for the pride way,</v>

3239
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:07.040
<v Speaker 5>which was everybody knew that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>was on it.</v>

3240
02:22:07.690 --> 02:22:09.750
<v Speaker 5>Tested pride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Just civic here.</v>

3243
02:22:16.791 --> 02:22:17.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buddy,</v>

3244
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I did this thing believable decoder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the boss to her.</v>

3245
02:22:20.351 --> 02:22:23.360
<v Speaker 5>I was going backstage with the camera </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing everybody,</v>

3246
02:22:23.361 --> 02:22:24.220
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up here?</v>

3247
02:22:24.221 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 5>You don't look there spending training</v>

3248
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:27.570
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I say okay,</v>

3249
02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:31.650
<v Speaker 2>we walk into the room from the doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I opened the door and I looked at the</v>

3250
02:22:31.651 --> 02:22:34.980
<v Speaker 2>side and I see all the protests there </v>
<v Speaker 2>with little sticks on them.</v>

3251
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I closed the door right away to look</v>

3252
02:22:36.971 --> 02:22:37.550
<v Speaker 2>into camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3253
02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:40.170
<v Speaker 2>give me one moment to the very busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me walk in and ask for permission.</v>

3254
02:22:40.171 --> 02:22:45.171
<v Speaker 2>So I walk in and I grabbed one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>cups and I see green tea or fill it up </v>

3255
02:22:45.171 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 2>and it put the same cup next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when you weren't even allowed to</v>

3256
02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:51.300
<v Speaker 2>be that close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3258
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:53.670

<v Speaker 2>I could have contaminated everything.</v>

3259
02:22:53.970 --> 02:22:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So I'm walking in and I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3260
02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.770
<v Speaker 2>these had a doctors here and they looked</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tests.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And these people,</v>

3265

<v Speaker 5>tea</v>

3266
02:23:10.780 --> 02:23:12.650
<v Speaker 2>and I take the thing off.</v>

3273
02:23:25.691 --> 02:23:26.980
<v Speaker 5>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Serious.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's been real open about it and talked </v>

3276

<v Speaker 5>about like they literally said in large </v>
<v Speaker 5>prints,</v>

3278
02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:41.390
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3279
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew a guy from there and he would say</v>

3280
02:23:44.291 --> 02:23:47.530
<v Speaker 2>to me that in the morning he would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge runs of</v>

3281
02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:52.760
<v Speaker 5>testosterone because it made him really </v>
<v Speaker 5>angry in the morning.</v>

3282
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:56.300
<v Speaker 5>That jacked up once far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Andy,</v>

3283
02:23:56.380 --> 02:23:59.310
<v Speaker 5>what about these guys who were like </v>
<v Speaker 5>bench pressing the day before,</v>

3284
02:23:59.311 --> 02:24:00.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these muscles</v>

3285
02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:01.280
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they got in,</v>

3286
02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:06.290
<v Speaker 2>you know that you have the white dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have these guys because of the </v>

3287
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:08.670
<v Speaker 2>cosmetic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pride would love to the freaks,</v>

3288
02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:10.070
<v Speaker 2>my man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

3289
02:24:10.071 --> 02:24:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of matchmaking</v>

3290
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:13.820
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember Jason Chambers from,</v>

3291
02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:18.080
<v Speaker 5>he went over to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget which organization was that?</v>

3292
02:24:18.081 --> 02:24:23.081
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want him to fight one 85 and he's </v>

3293
02:24:23.081 --> 02:24:23.081
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait one 70.</v>

3294
02:24:23.081 --> 02:24:23.220
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't worry,</v>

3295
02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:28.340
<v Speaker 5>we'll get you on this title.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wanted him to juice up and go to one </v>

3296
02:24:28.611 --> 02:24:29.420
<v Speaker 5>85.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

3297
02:24:29.421 --> 02:24:30.230
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck?</v>

3298
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:33.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

3299
02:24:33.951 --> 02:24:36.160
<v Speaker 2>But people say he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say they should just allow it.</v>

3300
02:24:36.161 --> 02:24:41.161
<v Speaker 2>I say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you force the guys who want to </v>

3301
02:24:41.161 --> 02:24:41.161
<v Speaker 2>stay clean to use it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you shouldn't.</v>

3302
02:24:41.161 --> 02:24:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Joel mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the health,</v>

3303
02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:47.080
<v Speaker 2>there are health risks risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think not even health risks,</v>

3304
02:24:47.391 --> 02:24:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it doesn't damage your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your</v>

3305
02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:54.480
<v Speaker 5>system when you do steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it depends on how much you're </v>

3306
02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:54.480
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're,</v>

3307
02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:56.040
<v Speaker 5>if you're going like super hyper human </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels,</v>

3308
02:24:56.050 --> 02:24:58.960
<v Speaker 5>like I'm sure a lot of those guys were a</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes for you.</v>

3309
02:24:59.170 --> 02:25:01.720
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of the real clear </v>
<v Speaker 5>indicators that a lot of guys were on it</v>

3310
02:25:01.721 --> 02:25:04.680
<v Speaker 5>were how they got off of it and came to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the UFC and looked like models.</v>

3311
02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:09.340
<v Speaker 5>They look like cumin pitbulls right away</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a lot of them.</v>

3312
02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:10.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a lot of them.</v>

3313
02:25:10.571 --> 02:25:11.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

3314
02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.680
<v Speaker 5>it is what it is and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately the early roots of mma </v>

3315
02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:21.241
<v Speaker 5>were marred like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost all people that took </v>

3316
02:25:21.241 --> 02:25:21.241
<v Speaker 5>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3317
02:25:21.241 --> 02:25:22.390
<v Speaker 5>there's so many camps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you talked to the insiders,</v>

3318
02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:23.750
<v Speaker 5>they will tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God dammit,</v>

3319
02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:26.170
<v Speaker 5>back then everybody was on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody was on,</v>

3320
02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:31.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you don't have to name names and </v>

3321
02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:31.380
<v Speaker 5>everybody who knows knows and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>matter,</v>

3322
02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:34.300
<v Speaker 5>but what does matter is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the early days of the sport,</v>

3323
02:25:34.330 --> 02:25:37.600
<v Speaker 5>it was insane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially contaminated and now they've</v>

3324
02:25:37.601 --> 02:25:42.601
<v Speaker 5>wiped out a giant percentage of it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>occasionally guys still get caught with </v>

3325
02:25:42.601 --> 02:25:44.520
<v Speaker 5>some things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg got caught with a,</v>

3328
02:25:50.111 --> 02:25:52.690
<v Speaker 5>inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dihydrotestosterone,</v>

3329
02:25:52.691 --> 02:25:57.691
<v Speaker 5>which is a derivative of testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 5>which makes your hair fall out and I </v>

3330
02:25:57.691 --> 02:25:59.440
<v Speaker 5>used to use that spironolactone stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>that she got caught with.</v>

<v Speaker 5>keep my hair from falling out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3336
02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.000
<v Speaker 5>it's also used by people who want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>shield themselves from tests.</v>

3337
02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.360
<v Speaker 5>It's also used by females that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken male hormones and they want to </v>

3338
02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:20.570

<v Speaker 1>him are both super high level.</v>

3435
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Kickbox is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only really saw that mostly in mma.</v>

3436
02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't see it that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high level kickboxing and that's why </v>

3437
02:31:09.730 --> 02:31:11.180
<v Speaker 1>we talked there is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Matt embry,</v>

3438
02:31:11.181 --> 02:31:16.181
<v Speaker 1>this kid from Canada who's now a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be fighting in Los Angeles </v>

3439
02:31:16.181 --> 02:31:19.421
<v Speaker 1>next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Canada to where the sport is </v>

3440
02:31:19.421 --> 02:31:19.421
<v Speaker 1>banned in so many of the provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Joseph,</v>

3441
02:31:19.421 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>valvoline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had</v>

3442
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:22.710
<v Speaker 3>to retire because of the concussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

3443
02:31:22.711 --> 02:31:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>place on next week.</v>

3444
02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a smart kid,</v>

3445
02:31:26.881 --> 02:31:27.840
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

3446
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:33.950
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's 100 percent decided </v>

3447
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.950
<v Speaker 3>on his retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's leaning towards that.</v>

3448
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:37.580
<v Speaker 3>That's either concussions a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not something you want to.</v>

3449
02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:39.750
<v Speaker 3>You want to mess with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember Tj grant?</v>

3450
02:31:39.810 --> 02:31:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was exactly.</v>

3451
02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Benson had the title and a lightweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>division never kept saying never came </v>

3452
02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:48.170
<v Speaker 3>back and from concussions I just pumped </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3453
02:31:48.171 --> 02:31:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Pit Bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was people who broke his shin.</v>

3454
02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:52.220
<v Speaker 3>It was in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3455
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:53.310
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3456
02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:56.830
<v Speaker 3>That bone in the next two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should.</v>

3457
02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:59.010
<v Speaker 3>People are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love whatever it is.</v>

3458
02:31:59.070 --> 02:32:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting also that like we know </v>

3459
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:05.400
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really gaining ground in America.</v>

3460
02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Ballot tourism really gain ground either</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

3461
02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:08.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3462
02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:10.710
<v Speaker 3>it reaches a certain point in some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ratings were really good.</v>

3463
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Like when Kim Shamrock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those freak show,</v>

3464
02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Meryl Streep or Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a promoter.</v>

3465
02:32:23.071 --> 02:32:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Always has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always will be in.</v>

3466
02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:29.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that mix where I think Bella </v>

3467
02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:30.690
<v Speaker 3>tour has to focus on because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see for the large part,</v>

3468
02:32:30.750 --> 02:32:34.200
<v Speaker 3>98 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99 percent of the best talent,</v>

3469
02:32:34.201 --> 02:32:35.880
<v Speaker 3>but Bella toward trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're right,</v>

3470
02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:38.000
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also because Joel,</v>

3471
02:32:38.010 --> 02:32:42.480
<v Speaker 3>we talked about too much of everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] it's every week something.</v>

3472
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:48.190
<v Speaker 3>The UFC did it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At first they got to have to fight us </v>

3473
02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:48.490
<v Speaker 3>underneath the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By having so many show,</v>

3474
02:32:48.491 --> 02:32:51.830
<v Speaker 3>she shut every hug a organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you look at guys,</v>

3475
02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:55.970
<v Speaker 3>a few guys in Beltour like Lima who just</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked out course golf,</v>

3476
02:32:56.010 --> 02:32:59.670
<v Speaker 3>which is fuck this world class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrific fighter.</v>

3477
02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marla,</v>

3478
02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:02.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean world series of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even man,</v>

3479
02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:05.940
<v Speaker 3>there's Marlon Moraes guide sheet we </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about,</v>

3480
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.760
<v Speaker 3>was it for me?</v>

3481
02:33:06.890 --> 02:33:11.370
<v Speaker 3>For me too many times he got lit up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win that fight.</v>

3482
02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:13.700
<v Speaker 3>He won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got hit too many times.</v>

3483
02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:15.840
<v Speaker 3>He really needs to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Change his game.</v>

3484
02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:20.930
<v Speaker 3>He knows she can take a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he thinks too much advantage of it </v>

3485
02:33:20.930 --> 02:33:21.360
<v Speaker 3>and I just don't think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the goals?</v>

3486
02:33:21.361 --> 02:33:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like realistic,</v>

3487
02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:25.170
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even belt Torres and got traction.</v>

3488
02:33:25.171 --> 02:33:28.000
<v Speaker 3>So how do there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did they continue to exist?</v>

3489
02:33:28.610 --> 02:33:33.610
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is hard because they've been around </v>

3490
02:33:33.610 --> 02:33:33.610
<v Speaker 3>for a long time now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>World series of fighting for a long time</v>

3491
02:33:33.610 --> 02:33:36.090
<v Speaker 3>now and the hardcore hardcore fans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you break it down,</v>

3492
02:33:36.091 --> 02:33:41.091
<v Speaker 3>not even regular heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardcore hardcore are watching those </v>

3493
02:33:41.091 --> 02:33:41.091
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like we're spoiled.</v>

3494
02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:46.110
<v Speaker 3>We have too many and it's weird to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>because how many years did we fight?</v>

3495
02:33:46.111 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at us now.</v>

3496
02:33:48.271 --> 02:33:49.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3497
02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:50.310
<v Speaker 3>a tsunami of action.</v>

3498
02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Well the UFC has been super wise but </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's promotion.</v>

3499
02:33:53.430 --> 02:33:55.680
<v Speaker 3>We know how to stay on top and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3500
02:33:55.681 --> 02:34:00.681
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see a challenger emerge </v>

3501
02:34:00.681 --> 02:34:01.310
<v Speaker 3>and like right now it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3502
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.870
<v Speaker 3>there's Beltour has guys like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chandler,</v>

3503
02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:08.871
<v Speaker 3>they've got some guys that are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting and really fun to watch and I </v>

3504
02:34:08.871 --> 02:34:09.420
<v Speaker 3>think it'd be genuine stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course Michael,</v>

3505
02:34:09.421 --> 02:34:13.430
<v Speaker 3>a venom for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sent Cyborg.</v>

3506
02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Nahko was called crushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never seen him,</v>

3507
02:34:18.611 --> 02:34:23.050
<v Speaker 3>never seen him before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is dented in his skull.</v>

3508
02:34:23.450 --> 02:34:28.450
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy timing too because you </v>

3509
02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:31.171
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cyborg charge down and it was kind of </v>

3510
02:34:31.171 --> 02:34:31.171
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone shooting for a double,</v>

3511
02:34:31.171 --> 02:34:31.840
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think his knees were on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground with that.</v>

3512
02:34:31.890 --> 02:34:34.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as he shot in Michael Venom page,</v>

3513
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:39.160
<v Speaker 3>timed it perfectly and going down in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>member technori Goldman Health Gracie,</v>

3514
02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:43.290
<v Speaker 3>but need burst onto the fight.</v>

3515
02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:45.360
<v Speaker 3>That was the hops last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3516
02:34:45.361 --> 02:34:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3517
02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3518
02:34:46.961 --> 02:34:49.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean nice to a guy was trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>you down.</v>

3519
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:51.050
<v Speaker 3>It's so devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3520
02:34:51.051 --> 02:34:56.051
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to commit to that knee or </v>

3521
02:34:56.051 --> 02:34:56.051
<v Speaker 3>commit to that takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get caught coming in like that.</v>

3522
02:34:56.570 --> 02:34:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you could shoot with what he went </v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of your face.</v>

3523
02:34:59.471 --> 02:35:04.471
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was probably the most horrific </v>

3524
02:35:04.471 --> 02:35:04.471
<v Speaker 3>injury I've ever seen in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

3525
02:35:04.471 --> 02:35:04.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like afterwards,</v>

3526
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:05.760
<v Speaker 3>the pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3527
02:35:05.770 --> 02:35:08.800
<v Speaker 3>with all these little lights on them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying he wants to fight again.</v>

3528
02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:12.300
<v Speaker 3>He's nobody's retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just announced.</v>

3529
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he snapped back after the fact </v>

3530
02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:17.790
<v Speaker 3>and we just really realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3531
02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:19.720
<v Speaker 3>the fucking egg that contains my brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>is cracked.</v>

3532
02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that he recovered the way </v>

3533
02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:25.560
<v Speaker 3>he did as far as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After seeing the,</v>

3534
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:30.590
<v Speaker 3>the x rays and pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it tuition was fucking insane.</v>

3535
02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:34.780
<v Speaker 3>I thought he'd be dead and now you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the skull was crushed like that.</v>

3536
02:35:34.781 --> 02:35:36.130
<v Speaker 3>They're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to fingers.</v>

3537
02:35:38.110 --> 02:35:39.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the touch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something of the,</v>

3538
02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:41.620
<v Speaker 3>of the brain that does something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3539
02:35:41.621 --> 02:35:42.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a scary thing if you think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3540
02:35:42.970 --> 02:35:45.980
<v Speaker 3>And how much damage did his brain taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3541
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a significant mgd,</v>

3542
02:35:47.931 --> 02:35:52.290
<v Speaker 3>but in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only,</v>

3543
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:54.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan men against him.</v>

3544
02:35:54.431 --> 02:35:59.431
<v Speaker 3>One amazing thing that just hit that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was going on?</v>

3545
02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

3546
02:36:04.031 --> 02:36:05.280
<v Speaker 3>How many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>

3547
02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:07.900
<v Speaker 3>if what to seed Nogueira at his prime </v>
<v Speaker 3>and UFC.</v>

3548
02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:11.690
<v Speaker 3>How many wars did old go annual jury go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>

3549
02:36:11.691 --> 02:36:15.410
<v Speaker 3>But how many shots did they take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like full fighter in the garden and Lego</v>

3550
02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:20.460
<v Speaker 3>men don't do too many fighters in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably borrowed the.</v>

3551
02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we talked about,</v>

3552
02:36:21.581 --> 02:36:26.581
<v Speaker 3>the stomps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other Gary Goodrich right now is </v>

3553
02:36:26.581 --> 02:36:26.581
<v Speaker 3>coming out.</v>

3554
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad to see you because the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

3555
02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:32.970
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the was some,</v>

3556
02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:34.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was just one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports.</v>

3557
02:36:34.921 --> 02:36:39.921
<v Speaker 3>A news magazine shows the with the NFL </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff that they had 99 samples of </v>

3558
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.010
<v Speaker 3>former football player's brains were </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicated.</v>

3559
02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Out of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost 100 percent showed signs of cte.</v>

3560
02:36:48.910 --> 02:36:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine you get away without it.</v>

3561
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3562
02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:53.500
<v Speaker 3>you're colliding into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

3563
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:55.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way around it.</v>

3564
02:36:55.331 --> 02:36:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3565
02:36:56.021 --> 02:36:56.780
<v Speaker 3>and if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3566
02:36:56.890 --> 02:37:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Gary Goodrich said that is really his k </v>
<v Speaker 3>one career that did a man may fights the</v>

3567
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:03.640
<v Speaker 3>gatekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all show you much,</v>

3568
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.000
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked out tito all the way in the </v>

3569
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.560
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about it at the pride </v>

3570
02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:11.560
<v Speaker 3>fighting championships when he came over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3571
02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:12.340
<v Speaker 3>He was a powerful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3572
02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:15.610
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember what dodd frank and hope,</v>

3573
02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:17.460

<v Speaker 3>The Dawn.</v>

3574
02:37:18.450 --> 02:37:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Actually I just texted him yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3575
02:37:20.561 --> 02:37:25.561
<v Speaker 3>I remember when he came back to a pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New Year's eve shown goodridge </v>

3576
02:37:25.561 --> 02:37:27.540
<v Speaker 3>knocked out right away to the rivalry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3577
02:37:27.541 --> 02:37:29.870
<v Speaker 3>goodrich was a beast back in the day as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

3578
02:37:29.871 --> 02:37:30.860
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3579
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:33.800
<v Speaker 3>he beat Gary Young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

3580
02:37:35.350 --> 02:37:36.940
<v Speaker 3>UFC of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the pride,</v>

3581
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:38.000
<v Speaker 3>the rematch was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3582
02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:40.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years later in pride on New Year's Eve.</v>

3583
02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:42.950
<v Speaker 3>And it was like one kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gary.</v>

3584
02:37:42.951 --> 02:37:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Now was it kickboxer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3585
02:37:44.930 --> 02:37:46.600
<v Speaker 3>he started training again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3586
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:48.980
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3587
02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:50.710
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot them.</v>

3588
02:37:50.711 --> 02:37:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I member Friday yama courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plastic so much.</v>

3589
02:37:54.741 --> 02:37:57.470
<v Speaker 3>And I felt it immediately forgot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday.</v>

3590
02:37:58.370 --> 02:38:01.990
<v Speaker 3>And then I've added it to goodwill </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

3591
02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:05.930
<v Speaker 3>What about Swanson?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And look how many.</v>

3592
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an amazing tool to account many </v>

3593
02:38:10.990 --> 02:38:11.750
<v Speaker 3>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a crazy fight.</v>

3594
02:38:11.751 --> 02:38:14.750
<v Speaker 3>That was the one of the most chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights I've ever watched.</v>

3595
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:19.750
<v Speaker 3>And one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the data wasn't going in my head </v>

3596
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.750
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3597
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:24.080
<v Speaker 3>how is he getting hit with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>haymakers that cubs Swanson's winging in</v>

3598
02:38:24.081 --> 02:38:28.580
<v Speaker 3>from downtown Cleveland and cracking him</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his head when he came from across the</v>

3599
02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:31.630
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punches crazy,</v>

3600
02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:38.440
<v Speaker 3>just stagger back and then come crack </v>
<v Speaker 3>him again.</v>

3601
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:43.450
<v Speaker 3>He would stagger back room a room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's standing there watching it.</v>

3602
02:38:43.881 --> 02:38:47.570
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Picked it as the.</v>

3603
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:49.500
<v Speaker 3>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a thick.</v>

3604
02:38:49.570 --> 02:38:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Remember it started with lawler and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct for fights.</v>

3605
02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:58.120
<v Speaker 3>That was a crazy holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3606
02:38:58.130 --> 02:39:01.950
<v Speaker 3>when you draw the line and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>started slugging it out.</v>

3607
02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:07.310
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite guys to man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went up on this,</v>

3608
02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:12.940
<v Speaker 3>that's going to mcgregor too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's 100 percent convinced he's </v>

3609
02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:12.940
<v Speaker 3>going to get a title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3610
02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:14.320
<v Speaker 3>he's one of these guys that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's going to know.</v>

3611
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:19.510
<v Speaker 3>But we went the distance with connor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean connor did kind of being </v>

3612
02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:24.780
<v Speaker 3>blown out of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right towards later he said that </v>

3613
02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:25.990
<v Speaker 3>he was also injured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3614
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Max was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>

3615
02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:29.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>max is a real.</v>

3616
02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an interim champion right now,</v>

3617
02:39:31.041 --> 02:39:32.800
<v Speaker 3>but he's world championship caliber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3618
02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Want to see how he does against all </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3619
02:39:35.001 --> 02:39:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I want to see how he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3620
02:39:36.121 --> 02:39:38.360
<v Speaker 3>some of the best guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but know he's finished cups wants.</v>

3621
02:39:38.361 --> 02:39:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And should we get rid of interim titles </v>
<v Speaker 3>through and through boxing,</v>

3622
02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:42.830
<v Speaker 3>mma all to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3623
02:39:42.831 --> 02:39:47.831
<v Speaker 3>I think the only way that interim titles</v>
<v Speaker 3>make any sense if someone is recovering </v>

3624
02:39:47.831 --> 02:39:49.580
<v Speaker 3>from a catastrophic catastrophic injury.</v>

3625
02:39:49.610 --> 02:39:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone blows her acl out and you </v>

3626
02:39:54.610 --> 02:39:54.610
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3627
02:39:54.610 --> 02:39:54.770
<v Speaker 3>well the title is now going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspended for a whole year.</v>

3628
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's gonna take six months </v>

3629
02:39:59.830 --> 02:40:01.721
<v Speaker 3>before you can even start training again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like nine months we can start </v>

3630
02:40:01.721 --> 02:40:05.591
<v Speaker 3>training hard and then three months to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go through a camp you need and then </v>

3631
02:40:05.591 --> 02:40:09.770
<v Speaker 3>you've got crews took even longer or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you simply say,</v>

3632
02:40:11.151 --> 02:40:13.500
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title is going to be taken away from</v>

3633
02:40:13.501 --> 02:40:14.880
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3634
02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:19.960
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not the champion anymore but you </v>

3635
02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:19.960
<v Speaker 3>are the first one in line as soon as she</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>

3636
02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:21.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's usually the case a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3637
02:40:21.061 --> 02:40:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they do recover they do get the.</v>

3638
02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:28.160
<v Speaker 3>But I just think the think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's an easy because then </v>

3639
02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:28.650
<v Speaker 3>they lose that history books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3640
02:40:28.651 --> 02:40:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

3641
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got a bad injury and you know,</v>

3642
02:40:32.761 --> 02:40:36.360
<v Speaker 3>like Anderson Silva made sense with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>owner to take it away.</v>

3643
02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:37.230
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3644
02:40:37.231 --> 02:40:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I know if he wasn't going to defend it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we know,</v>

3645
02:40:39.031 --> 02:40:40.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they needed to.</v>

3646
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:45.830
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the UFC is the one just </v>

3647
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:48.770
<v Speaker 3>down the hallway when they took it away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from title.</v>

3648
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3649
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:51.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's not defending the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys take it away from him.</v>

3650
02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:57.550
<v Speaker 3>If all those already the champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the winter of Holloway and walk,</v>

3651
02:40:57.950 --> 02:41:02.950
<v Speaker 3>they become the number one contender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the problem is you tie up the </v>

3652
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:05.670
<v Speaker 3>titles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a guy who's the champion champ,</v>

3653
02:41:05.671 --> 02:41:08.460
<v Speaker 3>champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like connor champ at 45 and 55.</v>

3654
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:13.790
<v Speaker 3>You got to say you got to vacate one </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like to hold two of them </v>

3655
02:41:13.790 --> 02:41:14.910
<v Speaker 3>subsequently or then they should've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>it right then and there.</v>

3656
02:41:14.911 --> 02:41:16.350
<v Speaker 3>He made history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

3657
02:41:16.390 --> 02:41:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Was the one title Let.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to defend all.</v>

3658
02:41:18.431 --> 02:41:19.320
<v Speaker 3>He's got to decide.</v>

3659
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:24.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he decided he's going to stay at 55 </v>

3660
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.590
<v Speaker 3>where they decided not to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck's going on,</v>

3661
02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:26.600
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he can get for what if</v>
<v Speaker 3>45.</v>

3662
02:41:26.601 --> 02:41:27.460
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be hard for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

3663
02:41:27.490 --> 02:41:28.530
<v Speaker 3>There's another way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut that.</v>

3664
02:41:28.531 --> 02:41:31.680
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should be at 1:45.</v>

3665
02:41:31.681 --> 02:41:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't look like a man when you see me </v>
<v Speaker 3>at 1:45</v>

3666
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:37.920
<v Speaker 3>or two to cut in in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

3667
02:41:38.250 --> 02:41:41.550
<v Speaker 3>You can only do that so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much healthier at 1:55</v>

3668
02:41:41.850 --> 02:41:44.780
<v Speaker 3>and there's a bunch of fights for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when they were talking about.</v>

3669
02:41:44.781 --> 02:41:45.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3670
02:41:45.210 --> 02:41:47.720
<v Speaker 3>no med off fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turning Tony Ferguson guys.</v>

3671
02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3672
02:41:49.081 --> 02:41:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Look at that fucking picture on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

3673
02:41:50.730 --> 02:41:55.730
<v Speaker 3>He looks he looks like a taxi cab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3674
02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much healthier.</v>

3675
02:41:58.261 --> 02:41:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>

3676
02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:02.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were talking about having,</v>

3677
02:42:02.191 --> 02:42:05.340
<v Speaker 3>although and normally when madoff fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>for an interim,</v>

3678
02:42:05.341 --> 02:42:09.000
<v Speaker 3>1:55</v>
<v Speaker 3>title or Ferguson was 45,</v>

3679
02:42:09.001 --> 02:42:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>

3680
02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Well 45 is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although all those a champ,</v>

3681
02:42:13.351 --> 02:42:14.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max Hall was the interim champ.</v>

3682
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Those guys have 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

3683
02:42:18.510 --> 02:42:20.790
<v Speaker 3>But now all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know if it's true,</v>

3684
02:42:20.791 --> 02:42:22.890
<v Speaker 3>but in a normal going out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was bullshit.</v>

3685
02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:28.180
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about Aldo fighting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>super fight with Russia and of course </v>

3686
02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3687
02:42:29.221 --> 02:42:34.221
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson wanted more money than </v>
<v Speaker 3>this contract stated and unfortunately </v>

3688
02:42:34.221 --> 02:42:37.941
<v Speaker 3>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in a weird position right now </v>

3689
02:42:37.941 --> 02:42:39.711
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many fights to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>made at 55 and the big one of course is </v>

3690
02:42:39.711 --> 02:42:39.711
<v Speaker 3>connor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3691
02:42:39.711 --> 02:42:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who conor fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it decides to fight conor and they </v>

3692
02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:46.090
<v Speaker 3>decided that's the big fight and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>put her on in Russia anywhere,</v>

3693
02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:51.320
<v Speaker 3>but for sure fucking low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Irish guys in the Russian guys,</v>

3694
02:42:53.010 --> 02:42:55.890
<v Speaker 3>they do realize just how big he is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

3695
02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:57.000
<v Speaker 3>number combined off giant.</v>

3696
02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:00.330
<v Speaker 3>He's a huge star when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he goes on stage too,</v>

3697
02:43:00.331 --> 02:43:02.810
<v Speaker 3>like when he steps onto the platform and</v>
<v Speaker 3>enters into the cage,</v>

3698
02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:05.080
<v Speaker 3>fucking crowd goes nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know who he is.</v>

3699
02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those things where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians are way ahead of the game in </v>

3700
02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 3>terms of knowing who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a giant star over there,</v>

3701
02:43:12.221 --> 02:43:14.590
<v Speaker 3>but he could be a giant star over here </v>
<v Speaker 3>to kids,</v>

3702
02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:18.030
<v Speaker 3>kids of color on the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People and if funny guy to you know,</v>

3703
02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:21.250
<v Speaker 3>outside of five has got personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>

3704
02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:22.630
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3705
02:43:23.050 --> 02:43:28.050
<v Speaker 3>he's a real wild card in that division </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's undefeated mean we saw one </v>

3706
02:43:28.301 --> 02:43:30.340
<v Speaker 3>moment of weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3707
02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:33.250
<v Speaker 3>One moment was in trouble and he came </v>
<v Speaker 3>back from that brilliantly.</v>

3708
02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Cain Velasquez again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3709
02:43:35.561 --> 02:43:36.770
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3710
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:38.770
<v Speaker 3>he's got some serious fucking medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

3711
02:43:39.250 --> 02:43:41.590
<v Speaker 3>He's got a stenosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spinal stenosis,</v>

3712
02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:41.950
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>

3713
02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:45.560
<v Speaker 3>They have to clean out his area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas spine.</v>

3714
02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:48.580
<v Speaker 3>So what would you fight again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's got.</v>

3715
02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:52.260
<v Speaker 3>He's got a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say medically like that.</v>

3716
02:43:52.270 --> 02:43:53.160
<v Speaker 3>If it's better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

3717
02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Well apparently the doctors are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced that they can open up that </v>

3718
02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:02.821
<v Speaker 3>pathway a little bit and whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressing down on the bone spurs or </v>

3719
02:44:02.821 --> 02:44:03.370
<v Speaker 3>anything that are pressing down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nerve,</v>

3720
02:44:03.371 --> 02:44:05.500
<v Speaker 3>they can remove those and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>alleviate as issues.</v>

3721
02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I'm not a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3722
02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Poor guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3723
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:14.220
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up that he had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had surgery exactly before the fight.</v>

3724
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:17.440
<v Speaker 3>That was a big mistake was because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put,</v>

3725
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:22.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob Bennett and the Nevada state </v>

3726
02:44:22.510 --> 02:44:24.380
<v Speaker 3>commission in a terrible position </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're saying that you're </v>

3727
02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:26.570
<v Speaker 3>compromised and so then they ran some </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests on him and I guess his doctor </v>

3728
02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:27.910
<v Speaker 3>cleared him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Nevada state athletic commission</v>

3729
02:44:27.911 --> 02:44:28.420
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3730
02:44:28.430 --> 02:44:29.970
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to have a cortisone</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>

3731
02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.190
<v Speaker 3>numb everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even though you might have some,</v>

3732
02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have really a problem as far </v>

3733
02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:38.920
<v Speaker 3>as the structure of your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be compromised.</v>

3734
02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do it.</v>

3735
02:44:41.050 --> 02:44:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Go get the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about that French?</v>

3736
02:44:42.971 --> 02:44:46.210
<v Speaker 3>A heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And God knew who he was.</v>

3737
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He figured it out when you were talking.</v>

3738
02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:52.690
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3739
02:44:52.691 --> 02:44:53.840
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is a.</v>

3740
02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:55.600
<v Speaker 3>he's terrifying monster men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3741
02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:00.760
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can punch so fucking hard and he </v>

3742
02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:03.781
<v Speaker 3>kicks so hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he gets into the octagon to certain </v>

3743
02:45:03.781 --> 02:45:03.781
<v Speaker 3>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They walk into the octagon.</v>

3744
02:45:03.781 --> 02:45:07.870
<v Speaker 3>They sound different like fee.</v>

3745
02:45:10.930 --> 02:45:15.930
<v Speaker 3>They're just bigger man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gonzaga was Zaga would step on the </v>

3746
02:45:15.930 --> 02:45:16.810
<v Speaker 3>platform to weigh in and you just feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jesus,</v>

3747
02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:20.530
<v Speaker 3>he's made of stone and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavier.</v>

3748
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I love those elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember that he threw so over the </v>

3749
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:28.501
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Through the defense on the ground when </v>

3750
02:45:28.501 --> 02:45:28.501
<v Speaker 3>he was in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3751
02:45:28.501 --> 02:45:28.501
<v Speaker 3>Well it was blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweet revenge.</v>

3752
02:45:28.501 --> 02:45:31.650
<v Speaker 3>When Marco came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smashed him with elbows from the top and</v>

3753
02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.410
<v Speaker 3>they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fight.</v>

3754
02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Mirko was saying that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like about the UFC vs pride </v>

3755
02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:42.280
<v Speaker 3>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's too much grappling and that</v>

3756
02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:44.440
<v Speaker 3>there's too many elbows on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What won them?</v>

3757
02:45:44.441 --> 02:45:46.720
<v Speaker 3>The fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grappling and elbows on the ground.</v>

3758
02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy.</v>

3759
02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:53.640
<v Speaker 3>He was worried that Zach was just trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take him down and that he wasn't </v>

3760
02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:56.130
<v Speaker 3>gonna stand with them so he couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>his revenge from the head kick knockout,</v>

3761
02:45:56.140 --> 02:46:01.140
<v Speaker 3>but he got while he takes Gonzaga down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on top and he smashes him with </v>

3762
02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable,</v>

3763
02:46:02.291 --> 02:46:07.291
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learn learning game while he realized </v>

3764
02:46:07.291 --> 02:46:11.080
<v Speaker 3>that it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've got a guy who that level </v>

3765
02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:11.080
<v Speaker 3>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Arco is</v>

3766
02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:15.040
<v Speaker 4>throwing elbows from the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see how much force you can generate </v>

3767
02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:16.200
<v Speaker 4>where he's retired again after winning </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rise and things.</v>

3768
02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:20.390
<v Speaker 4>What a great way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great way to go out on an epic Korea.</v>

3769
02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:23.420
<v Speaker 4>One of the all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

3770
02:46:23.421 --> 02:46:26.490
<v Speaker 4>the whole of the prank you pull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean the fight will fade or just.</v>

3771
02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:27.980
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>

3772
02:46:27.981 --> 02:46:30.830
<v Speaker 4>the guy right away when you were around </v>
<v Speaker 4>him was like,</v>

3773
02:46:30.831 --> 02:46:35.831
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget his stare down with </v>

3774
02:46:35.831 --> 02:46:36.410
<v Speaker 4>vandelay for that first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My first fight.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He wants to be interviewed on the day of</v>

3825
02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:36.940
<v Speaker 4>the event in his dressing room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we go to the dressing room with him </v>

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:40.871
<v Speaker 4>and he starts and a miracle is now all </v>
<v Speaker 4>in on it and at this moment.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know what a funeral this.</v>

3833
02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:59.730

<v Speaker 1>Looks at me like a little help,</v>

3843
02:49:12.241 --> 02:49:13.550

02:49:15.991 --> 02:49:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't expect no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really wasn't doing it.</v>

3847
02:49:18.031 --> 02:49:19.800
<v Speaker 1>But give it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to the question.</v>

3848
02:49:19.801 --> 02:49:21.750
<v Speaker 1>So we stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now miracle start getting annoyed,</v>

3850
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.110
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to scare.</v>

3853
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:29.280
<v Speaker 1>So he gets out that we send him back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

3856
02:49:31.531 --> 02:49:36.531
<v Speaker 1>So we know he's going back and he sits </v>
<v Speaker 1>down again and he starts going and </v>

<v Speaker 1>kind of ruined.</v>

3891
02:51:20.551 --> 02:51:25.551
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay hunt cracked him a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times and I'm stunned in that fight and </v>

3892
02:51:25.551 --> 02:51:27.750
<v Speaker 1>that was one of one of vandelays last </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights in his prime,</v>

3893
02:51:27.751 --> 02:51:29.570
<v Speaker 1>but he's another one man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3894
02:51:29.610 --> 02:51:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Come money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just him and Quinton Rampage Jackson.</v>

3895
02:51:32.730 --> 02:51:37.730
<v Speaker 1>How about that for a dramatic Kao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Halloween I probably 28 when Jackson </v>

3896
02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:40.920
<v Speaker 1>did very well in the rematch and then go</v>
<v Speaker 1>vandelay catches them again.</v>

3897
02:51:40.930 --> 02:51:43.720
<v Speaker 1>The nice in between the ropes and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

3898
02:51:44.730 --> 02:51:46.510
<v Speaker 1>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a bad knockout.</v>

3899
02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:52.200
<v Speaker 1>He smashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what's going on with Randall </v>

3900
02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Randall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to fight and rise.</v>

3901
02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And I heard what he was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

3902
02:51:54.331 --> 02:51:57.300
<v Speaker 1>bug Miraco in the rising thing and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

3903
02:51:57.390 --> 02:51:59.430
<v Speaker 1>He pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had an injury or something.</v>

3904
02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were hanging out with Bellatore and </v>

3905
02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:04.740
<v Speaker 1>another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3906
02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I can't fight anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3907
02:52:05.390 --> 02:52:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the one that say by any means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's the point?</v>

3908
02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Definitely can fight camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

3909
02:52:10.241 --> 02:52:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not his.</v>

3910
02:52:11.441 --> 02:52:15.020
<v Speaker 1>He's his health is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it in a long time now too.</v>

3911
02:52:15.430 --> 02:52:18.160
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think like this is a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time off.</v>

3912
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember once he told us in pride,</v>

3913
02:52:20.201 --> 02:52:21.130
<v Speaker 1>he dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3914
02:52:21.131 --> 02:52:21.880
<v Speaker 1>how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3915
02:52:22.390 --> 02:52:24.010
<v Speaker 1>typical question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much longer you want to do?</v>

3916
02:52:24.250 --> 02:52:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy couture did it until he was 48,</v>

3917
02:52:26.111 --> 02:52:28.150
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to do it until I'm 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3918
02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:30.820
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys think about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with vandelay?</v>

3919
02:52:31.090 --> 02:52:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Because with vandelay they came to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw came to him,</v>

3920
02:52:34.301 --> 02:52:36.780
<v Speaker 1>they tried to test him and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Outta here.</v>

3921
02:52:36.781 --> 02:52:40.500
<v Speaker 1>You fucking brain did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

3922
02:52:40.810 --> 02:52:42.630
<v Speaker 1>He flew back to Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3923
02:52:42.850 --> 02:52:45.540
<v Speaker 1>When was this member?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a war against me.</v>

3924
02:52:45.541 --> 02:52:50.541
<v Speaker 1>Or was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what the fight was supposed to be </v>

3925
02:52:50.541 --> 02:52:52.081
<v Speaker 1>where he was the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of got out of dodge when testing </v>

3926
02:52:52.081 --> 02:52:52.081
<v Speaker 1>was looking for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But vandelay same.</v>

3927
02:52:52.081 --> 02:52:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about the house.</v>

3928
02:52:53.610 --> 02:52:55.260
<v Speaker 1>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3929
02:52:55.670 --> 02:53:00.670
<v Speaker 1>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the first alice stroke first </v>

3930
02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:01.030
<v Speaker 1>they went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>

3931
02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:03.520
<v Speaker 1>but he tried to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3932
02:53:03.521 --> 02:53:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that you guys were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprints away from drugs.</v>

3933
02:53:08.610 --> 02:53:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is 2012.</v>

3934
02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:14.770
<v Speaker 1>That was back when it was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real.</v>

3935
02:53:14.980 --> 02:53:17.200
<v Speaker 1>This is really rare that you will get </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>

3936
02:53:17.370 --> 02:53:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ya see,</v>

3937
02:53:18.270 --> 02:53:20.080
<v Speaker 1>break the mirror right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3938
02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's done right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not gun.</v>

3939
02:53:24.250 --> 02:53:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guilty.</v>

3940
02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3941
02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:30.310
<v Speaker 1>But it just seems like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they railroaded him.</v>

3942
02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just take the guy's career </v>

3943
02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:35.340
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3944
02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:36.380
<v Speaker 1>if you tested him and he was positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's whatever punishment he,</v>

3945
02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:39.040
<v Speaker 1>if he runs away from the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just stays positive.</v>

3946
02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And then he would have already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting again.</v>

3947
02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

3948
02:53:41.650 --> 02:53:44.650
<v Speaker 1>But instead they tried to sustain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

3949
02:53:44.651 --> 02:53:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forever for life.</v>

3950
02:53:46.510 --> 02:53:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So he got that overturned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he's still battling out in court</v>

3951
02:53:49.421 --> 02:53:53.050
<v Speaker 1>who knows how much it cost him in court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't do himself any favors.</v>

3952
02:53:53.051 --> 02:53:54.470
<v Speaker 1>But with this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3953
02:53:54.570 --> 02:53:57.660
<v Speaker 1>bashing UFC batch and everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than that.</v>

3954
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I started making youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3955
02:53:59.370 --> 02:54:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Took a mania staring in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

3956
02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3957
02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:08.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3958
02:54:08.881 --> 02:54:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It just got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3959
02:54:10.481 --> 02:54:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was probably some really dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments for him.</v>

3960
02:54:12.761 --> 02:54:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

3961
02:54:13.630 --> 02:54:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's he make money now?</v>

3962
02:54:14.831 --> 02:54:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Just as Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

3963
02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Backed.</v>

3964
02:54:17.350 --> 02:54:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what was taught as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter for me.</v>

3965
02:54:20.681 --> 02:54:25.681
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to not do it anymore to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and especially not train anyway so </v>

3966
02:54:25.681 --> 02:54:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that she can at least when you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>

3967
02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did the feeling.</v>

3968
02:54:28.751 --> 02:54:31.160
<v Speaker 1>There's no feeling like it to walk out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hey,</v>

3969
02:54:31.161 --> 02:54:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you training at all anymore?</v>

3970
02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:35.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One just water exercise on the water and</v>

3971
02:54:35.161 --> 02:54:40.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes had to do with weights </v>

3972
02:54:40.161 --> 02:54:40.161
<v Speaker 1>trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My just my right arm.</v>

3973
02:54:40.161 --> 02:54:43.321
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fight federally and </v>

3974
02:54:43.321 --> 02:54:45.250
<v Speaker 1>pride with dynamite show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was official.</v>

3975
02:54:45.330 --> 02:54:48.280
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was facing to fight him to ask me,</v>

3976
02:54:48.281 --> 02:54:53.281
<v Speaker 1>you want to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but identified for a long time and I </v>

3977
02:54:53.281 --> 02:54:53.281
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3978
02:54:53.281 --> 02:54:53.281
<v Speaker 1>I'd only been striking.</v>

3979
02:54:53.281 --> 02:54:55.930
<v Speaker 1>So since this is a mix between k one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pride,</v>

3980
02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:59.560
<v Speaker 1>why don't we do a kickboxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gloves,</v>

3981
02:54:59.590 --> 02:55:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I would love to do that and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't go for it.</v>

3982
02:55:02.501 --> 02:55:04.490
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he chose another opponent at the time.</v>

3983
02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:05.600
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that.</v>

3984
02:55:05.601 --> 02:55:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that would have been such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>change for you.</v>

3985
02:55:07.850 --> 02:55:08.590
<v Speaker 1>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

3986
02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:11.330
<v Speaker 1>That's good money at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been a crazy fight.</v>

3987
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:17.410
<v Speaker 1>What's holding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's holding you back from becoming </v>

3988
02:55:17.410 --> 02:55:17.410
<v Speaker 1>like pride again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superstar.</v>

3989
02:55:17.410 --> 02:55:22.040
<v Speaker 1>A superstar superstar and just they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>need some big Japanese dude to come </v>

3990
