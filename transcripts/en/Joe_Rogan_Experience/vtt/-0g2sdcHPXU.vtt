5
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.120

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

10
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>he's scared of him.</v>

11
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

12
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to take that guy to a sister so bad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was pretty crazy.</v>

76
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>For hostile.</v>

77
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>What about the clientele?</v>

79
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

80
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.333
<v Speaker 1>well they,</v>

81
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

82
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>they were mostly there for us.</v>

83
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:41.081
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

84
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>George just pretty much,</v>

85
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>we had the whole club at ourselves.</v>

86
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I've always all people coming to see the show.</v>

87
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>So it was strippers too though.</v>

88
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>And strippers to was the idea that you would get people in there for the show</v>

89
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and then the girls would dance for them afterwards.</v>

90
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And while we're doing the show,</v>

92
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>they were coming and sitting on table,</v>

93
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>hey you went to go get some,</v>

94
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>but sex upstairs,</v>

95
00:01:58.681 --> 00:01:59.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.163
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

97
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So I got a question for you.</v>

98
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk about the run rabbit run race you had that you won or yeah,</v>

99
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about that.</v>

100
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>How that end.</v>

101
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

102
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll let her describe it because it sounds pretty crazy what happened.</v>

103
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

104
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 2>so the hundred mile race that I was doing a month before Moab add about,</v>

105
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean 12 miles roughly to the finish line.</v>

106
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 2>My vision started blurring like in the periphery.</v>

107
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

108
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 2>and over the course of the next couple of miles closed in until it was pure</v>

109
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

110
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't see anything.</v>

111
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.071
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:41.071
<v Speaker 2>so I just like stumbled my way along roughly 10 miles of trails to get to the</v>

113
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.204
<v Speaker 2>finish line.</v>

114
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.411
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

115
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I would say like 98% blind.</v>

116
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 2>What I could see my feet like right in front of my feet,</v>

117
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 2>but it was just white out.</v>

118
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 2>So I was running and um,</v>

119
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 2>falling everywhere.</v>

120
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 2>It was probably a hilarious if people were,</v>

121
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.210
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

122
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I hit my head also on a rock.</v>

123
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>One of them to your blind.</v>

124
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 2>One of the times I fell so I had blood dripping down my face,</v>

126
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>like stumbling along.</v>

127
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Totally couldn't see the trail and he still one.</v>

128
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Managed to finish and,</v>

130
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and hold the lead.</v>

131
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.173
<v Speaker 2>You're a savage.</v>

132
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Should give seminars on how to be a savage.</v>

133
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

134
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.033
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

135
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.431
<v Speaker 2>what did,</v>

136
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>what happened to your vision?</v>

137
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.471
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

138
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>so since then there's been tons of people kind of talking about it.</v>

139
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it happens in,</v>

140
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 2>in ultra is quite often they are thinking it's a corneal edema.</v>

141
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>So basically like I wear contact lenses to see,</v>

142
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.721
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

143
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:42.721
<v Speaker 2>and the like contact mixed with the air and the dryness and all sorts of things</v>

144
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>cause like a kind of fluid or I'm not really sure how it works.</v>

145
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>If you ever thought about getting lasix or something,</v>

146
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>people who have done lasik also get this corneal edema.</v>

147
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>So for now I'm just,</v>

148
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

149
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.113
<v Speaker 2>stay in,</v>

150
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 2>stay in with the contacts because I've,</v>

151
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I've been learning how to deal with those a little bit better.</v>

152
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.821
<v Speaker 3>What do they look?</v>

153
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Do they look different?</v>

154
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I look a fair bit different.</v>

155
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 3>So that first bullet Jamie showed was like a Brahmin bull.</v>

156
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Then one of those Grable's,</v>

157
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.230
<v Speaker 3>which is just bits of frigging every sort of bull over a lot of generations will</v>

158
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>come in and Nyland buried with it and then sort of wrecks the herd.</v>

159
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

160
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.900
<v Speaker 3>when did they get released or when did they escape?</v>

161
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.291
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

162
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:23.720
<v Speaker 3>it would have been with the first Cadillac come into Australia.</v>

163
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.700
<v Speaker 3>So 18 hundreds and hundreds.</v>

164
00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

166
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 3>So they've just sort of morphed and become wild animals and the wild bulls.</v>

168
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.903
<v Speaker 3>Very dangerous.</v>

169
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.631
<v Speaker 3>Very dangerous.</v>

170
00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.700
<v Speaker 3>So what happened was,</v>

172
00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:35.001
<v Speaker 3>Pedro,</v>

173
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I shot these bowling and it dropped like,</v>

174
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

175
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 3>down conscious.</v>

176
00:04:38.331 --> 00:04:38.721
<v Speaker 3>He fought,</v>

177
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:39.171
<v Speaker 3>it was dead,</v>

178
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 3>walked up to it.</v>

179
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 3>It jumped up.</v>

180
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Like he literally got up to it and it jumped up.</v>

181
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:44.930
<v Speaker 3>And anyway,</v>

182
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 3>it ended up getting him against the tray.</v>

183
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Like he ran to get up a tree,</v>

184
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.840
<v Speaker 3>he felt it hit him and it sort of lifted him up the tree.</v>

185
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.440
<v Speaker 3>He climbed up the tree is the gross bit.</v>

186
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Then he felt something warm and his legs and looked down and his guts and</v>

187
00:04:57.681 --> 00:04:58.491
<v Speaker 3>everything hanging down.</v>

188
00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And I read his legs but he's a tough boss.</v>

189
00:05:00.681 --> 00:05:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Did he?</v>

190
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Gavin his stomach back up and sort of hold it in place.</v>

191
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Then the ball actually died.</v>

192
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.790
<v Speaker 3>He climbed down out of the train,</v>

193
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.800
<v Speaker 3>ended up dawn two times I think once in the air because the royal flying doctors</v>

194
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:13.430
<v Speaker 3>come in,</v>

195
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 3>grabbed him cause he's a long way out in the middle of nowhere.</v>

196
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

197
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.610
<v Speaker 3>then once on the table is operating table as well.</v>

198
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.713
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

199
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 3>He survived all that and end up dying of a bloody mess,</v>

200
00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:23.691
<v Speaker 3>heart attack.</v>

201
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 3>So no way.</v>

202
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

203
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 3>When uh,</v>

204
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.390
<v Speaker 3>it was only thing,</v>

205
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it was only 36 or 37.</v>

206
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it had anything to do with the accident that I reckon it was</v>

207
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.074
<v Speaker 3>related at all.</v>

208
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

209
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

210
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 3>You would think that a guy could get past getting gored by air,</v>

211
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.380
<v Speaker 3>pushes guts back into them.</v>

212
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.921
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

213
00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 3>that guy's not going to get a heart attack.</v>

214
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

215
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 3>that's life's not fair.</v>

216
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

217
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

218
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

219
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.961
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

220
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:45.321
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

221
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 3>has anybody been skeptical as anybody?</v>

222
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

223
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's skeptical.</v>

224
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 3>And w w what's your response to that?</v>

226
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.613
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what I know,</v>

227
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.461
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

228
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:52.601
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

229
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:53.630
<v Speaker 3>what do you know though?</v>

230
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.533
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

231
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you some of the shit that I know and I can't tell you,</v>

232
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.881
<v Speaker 4>but what could it be?</v>

233
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy if you,</v>

234
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

235
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean what you've said,</v>

236
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 4>we'll think about what you've said.</v>

237
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.170
<v Speaker 4>You said that there's some ridiculous sorta propulsion system that allows you to</v>

238
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 4>move through time,</v>

239
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>

240
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 4>they visit this planet all the time and extract resources,</v>

241
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

242
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 4>That there's people in the government that are trying to disseminate this</v>

243
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.641
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

244
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 4>but they don't know how to do it.</v>

245
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the right vehicle do it.</v>

246
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it in these sort of controlled chunks.</v>

247
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Think of all these things that you've said.</v>

248
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 4>What could possibly be crazier than that?</v>

249
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Well you're asking me how do I know and no,</v>

250
00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:32.031
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

251
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:32.151
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

252
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:32.271
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

253
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking you what do you know that could possibly be crazier than that?</v>

254
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

255
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.131
<v Speaker 4>that's the shit.</v>

256
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:37.964
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you.</v>

257
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not everything's Hunky Dory.</v>

258
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 4>Is it something where you worried about the fate of the human race?</v>

259
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that's part of it.</v>

260
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.253
<v Speaker 4>Where should I move?</v>

261
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.233
<v Speaker 4>If I was going to move?</v>

262
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not existential.</v>

263
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 4>If your dick out of I should go to Australia.</v>

264
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.823
<v Speaker 4>How about,</v>

265
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 4>how about I guess pick out in Australia?</v>

266
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean where's the spot?</v>

267
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there is one spot.</v>

268
00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

269
00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.940
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

270
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 4>this is what I will say.</v>

271
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.120
<v Speaker 4>It's not existential in the sense of a,</v>

272
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

273
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to come here like independence day in nuke the place.</v>

274
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

275
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

276
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

277
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

278
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 4>there are things to worry about but sometimes you read these books with the</v>

279
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 4>writers go a little too far with that bullshit,</v>

280
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.043
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

281
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>

282
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 4>It's just too much.</v>

283
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like you were saying,</v>

284
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 4>you ever go to people's houses and they talk and then he'd say shift for 20</v>

285
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:22.544
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>

286
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 4>They let a lot of,</v>

287
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 4>it's like by studios to the,</v>

288
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.364
<v Speaker 4>where I live,</v>

289
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 4>go to that coffee shop from time to time,</v>

290
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 4>you know what they was saying in the world,</v>

291
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.011
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

292
00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 4>after the Vegas shooter,</v>

293
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 4>the Vegas shooter was Sunday night.</v>

294
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what these idiots were saying in there Monday?</v>

295
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 4>But that this had to do with women's rights and abortions and they just talk</v>

296
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 4>these new,</v>

297
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 4>this new breed of gentiles.</v>

298
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 4>They just talk.</v>

299
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 4>That's all they do is talk with big words to impress you.</v>

300
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 4>But then don't say shit.</v>

301
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Don't say shit.</v>

302
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Three or four big words to let you know they're smart.</v>

303
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 4>And then they didn't say nothing.</v>

304
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of repeating narratives.</v>

305
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

306
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Every time the show,</v>

307
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 4>the new show I'm gonna do,</v>

308
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm buying one of those little tape recorders,</v>

309
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 4>putting up Mondays,</v>

310
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 4>six fucking morons every day.</v>

311
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Then at night I'm going to do a show about what they discussed because this is</v>

312
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 4>60% of America with these fucking people are talking about this is the idiots.</v>

313
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 4>The shit that comes out of that mouth is amazing.</v>

314
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 4>And you sit there and go,</v>

315
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 4>no one to fucking isis wants to shoot us.</v>

316
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 4>Listen to these fucking dummies.</v>

317
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Listen to what's coming out of their mouth.</v>

318
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Women's rights.</v>

319
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 4>That's what they talking about that.</v>

320
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.353
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

321
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.760
<v Speaker 4>what was their argument there?</v>

322
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 4>They were saying that the guy,</v>

323
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 4>they all get that argument.</v>

324
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Is everybody trying to be smarter than everybody?</v>

325
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just six people trying out with each other.</v>

326
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:42.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you go to those fucking dinner party parties you talk about,</v>

327
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.680
<v Speaker 4>and by the time they served the salad,</v>

328
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 4>you want to put a gun in your fucking mouth.</v>

329
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 4>Why am I even fucking here with these people?</v>

330
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I could have stopped at Burger King and had a better fucking time.</v>

331
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't go to those dinner parties because there's eight people and</v>

332
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 4>politics comes up.</v>

333
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 4>You loosely Joe Rogan.</v>

334
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hear about it no more.</v>

335
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 4>You lose me.</v>

336
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 4>You lose me.</v>

337
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 4>These new political people talking nonsense.</v>

338
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 4>You lucidly move forward.</v>

339
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 4>Either impeach him,</v>

340
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 4>get a new one or shut the fuck up.</v>

341
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:10.861
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

342
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 4>you'll put the news on anymore,</v>

343
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.450
<v Speaker 4>but it's definitely 20 minutes on.</v>

344
00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 4>He didn't send the check.</v>

346
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.853
<v Speaker 4>He called her,</v>

347
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck man?</v>

348
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 4>Just tell who gives a fuck.</v>

349
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.813
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a fuck?</v>

350
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 4>There's gotta be something more.</v>

351
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be a seal stuck on a beat somewhere.</v>

352
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 4>This fucking country,</v>

353
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 4>something more important than this shit every fucking day.</v>

354
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 4>So the politics is over my world.</v>

355
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.843
<v Speaker 4>Religion,</v>

356
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

357
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.391
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it there.</v>

358
00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to talk about politics or religion at those fucking things,</v>

359
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 4>but this new breed of gentile,</v>

360
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.590
<v Speaker 4>they just talk for the sense of talking to see who's the smartest person in the</v>

361
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:46.021
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

362
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of the day,</v>

363
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 4>they're all a bunch of dump fucks anyway.</v>

364
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
