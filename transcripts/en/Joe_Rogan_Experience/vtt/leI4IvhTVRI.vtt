<v Speaker 2>We had to get it rocking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ladies,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's as gangster as it gets.</v>

11
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 2>You and Terence Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know he was.</v>

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna was this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic guy who lived on the big </v>

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.921
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this giant property and the big </v>

14
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:45.921
<v Speaker 2>island where he grew all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic plants.</v>

15
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Most of them were actually legal to grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

16
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>the government didn't know about quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few of them.</v>

18
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 2>You never heard of Terence Mckenna know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So keep going.</v>

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 2>give you a lot of stuff before you leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tunes into this guy.</v>

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>this sort of psychedelic bard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way to describe it.</v>

23
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Just a really good speaker who had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep understanding of psychedelics and </v>

24
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.711
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of botany and the biology of these </v>

25
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.951
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he also had some crazy theories </v>

26
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.411
<v Speaker 2>about human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And evolution and his biggest one was </v>

27
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.291
<v Speaker 2>called the stoned ape theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that theory,</v>

28
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.261
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know it was from that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Mckenna and he lived out the last </v>

29
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:32.631
<v Speaker 2>part of his life on the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this cool compound and used to </v>

30
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 2>bring people up there and do Iowasca </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

31
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Just those books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the third time I've heard </v>

32
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.571
<v Speaker 2>about that IOWASCA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's only the third time you've heard </v>

33
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.511
<v Speaker 2>it on the big island in the last little </v>
<v Speaker 2>while talking about this spreading </v>

34
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:50.571
<v Speaker 2>everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think Mckenna is a big reason why </v>

35
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 2>it spread all around Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

36
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 2>he came to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what year,</v>

37
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 2>got some property and built a house out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there on Mauna Loa.</v>

38
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.720
<v Speaker 2>In Kona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kona.</v>

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had like a complete self sufficient </v>

40
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.891
<v Speaker 2>system up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like collecting rain water and they're </v>

41
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 2>all crazy up there and they're the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius genius inventors.</v>

42
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.770

<v Speaker 2>The stuff they've done is like </v>

<v Speaker 2>so futuristic in their design.</v>

45
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 2>It blows my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their designs are like space,</v>

46
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.290

<v Speaker 3>there's some interesting thinkers.</v>

75
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.120
<v Speaker 2>What's one of the last free place is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

76
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 2>if you stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

77
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's America,</v>

78
00:03:55.401 --> 00:04:00.401
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's five hours away by plane and it's </v>

79
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.220
<v Speaker 2>incredible paradise as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

80
00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:02.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the islands,</v>

81
00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big island,</v>

82
00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:09.641
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just incredibly fascinating and </v>

83
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:09.641
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous and beautiful and,</v>

84
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 3>but all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody says all that,</v>

85
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one way of putting it I guess.</v>

86
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.880
<v Speaker 3>But to me it's like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It grabbed me in the naval,</v>

87
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 3>grabbed you in the naval lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my navel and we're not let.</v>

88
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 3>We're not cease to grab my navel.</v>

89
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 2>That's one of your shockers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

90
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naval is one of them.</v>

91
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 3>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something around there that it's</v>

92
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 3>like a magnet thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's to,</v>

93
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 3>to a certain place on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

94
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 3>And it's like an energy lay lance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

98
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 2>in Hawaii on vacation where I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually write.</v>

99
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's why I like it there because I can</v>

101
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 3>really right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your head is clear and,</v>

104
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 3>out and finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't never finish it,</v>

105
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can finish things there</v>

106
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.620
<v Speaker 2>while you are more at peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things because because </v>

107
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.071
<v Speaker 2>everyone sort of knows it's isolating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also know that you really are on a </v>

108
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This beautiful natural volcano.</v>

109
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went there because they got a goddess </v>

110
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.770
<v Speaker 3>named Pele and that's why the last place</v>
<v Speaker 3>on earth where there's like a,</v>

111
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:26.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a goddess so that it is active in </v>

112
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:29.921
<v Speaker 3>people's minds and act also active </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside a volcano might erupt at any </v>

113
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

114
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that which occurred that which,</v>

118
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.550

119
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I really feel that they are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like me trying to my nuts out </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.020
<v Speaker 2>You're growing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

128
00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:05.490
<v Speaker 2>You have like a plantation or something</v>

129
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.770
<v Speaker 3>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trees are grown up.</v>

130
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I just pick them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I try to fertilize my trees and get </v>

131
00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:18.351
<v Speaker 3>it so that you can perfect the net and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this year was quite a good harvest and </v>

132
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these debts are like,</v>

133
00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:24.750
<v Speaker 3>they're not like nobody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like any other nuts.</v>

134
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>

135
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you were actually a part of it.</v>

136
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I bet you affect it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in that way</v>

137
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 3>do ship for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was like owned by the Dole </v>

138
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know about it.</v>

139
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 2>They own the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an island of Lanai,</v>

140
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 2>didn't they?</v>

141
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

142
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one point in time at least.</v>

143
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Them and the University of Hawaii,</v>

144
00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:51.180
<v Speaker 3>they're all hooked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

145
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.040
<v Speaker 3>and they do do your genetic modification</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies and such,</v>

146
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 3>which is very interesting to me of how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they do all that and then create a </v>

147
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.380
<v Speaker 3>pineapple that has lower acidity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

148
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that's interesting.</v>

149
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's spooky and it's interesting at the </v>

150
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.181
<v Speaker 2>same time because it the implications of</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically modifying plants or are </v>

151
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very profound and they shouldn't</v>

152
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 2>just affect the people that are creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and putting them out there.</v>

153
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.910
<v Speaker 2>They're really worldwide questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

154
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 2>when you have people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting away with doing genetic </v>

155
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.081
<v Speaker 2>modifications on plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really sure of the longterm </v>

156
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 2>ramifications to the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bs too.</v>

157
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 2>There's a host of different things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are affected by these things.</v>

158
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 2>These things.</v>

159
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that I got.</v>

160
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I thought I did a pretty good checkmate </v>
<v Speaker 3>on on Monsanto,</v>

161
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.680
<v Speaker 3>which I called him once eight and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I got them in a choke hold like </v>

162
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.110
<v Speaker 3>that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about that fighting Ronda</v>

163
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing compared to me.</v>

164
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare I tell you?</v>

165
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 3>I put them in quite a nice headlock over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

166
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 3>What were they trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

167
00:07:55.581 --> 00:08:00.581
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to pass a law or to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>rid of a law which took a lot of work </v>

168
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.910
<v Speaker 3>getting there to make law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was to,</v>

169
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the people,</v>

170
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:09.341
<v Speaker 3>they're not want the GMO studies to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue on the island and uh,</v>

171
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like you got to vote yes,</v>

172
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>but it really means now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean it was like layer after layer</v>

173
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.910
<v Speaker 3>of ridiculousness to protect public </v>
<v Speaker 3>health and home.</v>

174
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 3>So I just started studying it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that there they,</v>

175
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 3>they kept on doing that fake science </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that they do,</v>

176
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

177
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 3>science last more than 90 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genetic studies,</v>

178
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.820
<v Speaker 3>proper scientific genetic studies they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have follow through and they also have a</v>

179
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:47.801
<v Speaker 3>control group and he don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come to a conclusion,</v>

180
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.920
<v Speaker 3>you don't stop studying after 90 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like actually like pay </v>

181
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>lobbyists to pass a law saying you only </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do</v>

182
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 4>90 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean gas,</v>

183
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 4>that's Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's friggin crazy ass.</v>

184
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Satan.</v>

185
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.890
<v Speaker 2>It's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pure money.</v>

186
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 2>People wanting money over humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People wanting money over the </v>

187
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 2>possibility of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

188
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 2>we got to be really careful with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just there's been a million </v>

189
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.880
<v Speaker 2>diseases that have occurred throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of people and they come from</v>

190
00:09:15.881 --> 00:09:20.881
<v Speaker 2>a variety of reasons that come from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of sources that come from all </v>

191
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:22.630
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different contagions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we can create shit.</v>

192
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.200
<v Speaker 2>We could accidentally fuck up and create</v>
<v Speaker 2>something horrible and we could also,</v>

193
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 2>if we haven't already,</v>

194
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.840
<v Speaker 4>fucking atomic weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the biggest fucking mistake </v>

195
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.501
<v Speaker 4>anybody's ever heard of and make it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they make it and then give every </v>

196
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 4>everybody 50 or 60 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

197
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

198
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 4>the truth is that horrifying truth of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>

199
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Why I don't go to parties because I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>bump people out of certain fucking </v>

200
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

201
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:52.820
<v Speaker 4>I do because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

202
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a popular thing to say.</v>

203
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 4>It's all fucking over.</v>

204
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 2>It's totally over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too late to a human beings have </v>

205
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 2>ruined the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

206
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not convinced.</v>

207
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I think we've definitely fucked a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things up and there's definitely a lot </v>

208
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>of hubris going on and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary shit going on.</v>

209
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Like Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima is bad and it started at the,</v>

210
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.610
<v Speaker 2>they just had a new um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies showing that a lot of radiation </v>

211
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Speaker 2>started to reach San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 2>they've found a three percent increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some of the tune of the radiation and</v>

213
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 2>tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scary shit,</v>

214
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.640
<v Speaker 2>but there's also people eat fish out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and yeah,</v>

215
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think</v>

216
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.980
<v Speaker 4>we're all poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Banged out over.</v>

<v Speaker 2>got to keep on rolling over yet it's not</v>

225
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:58.720
<v Speaker 2>going to get better by you mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalist society,</v>

226
00:10:58.721 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 2>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people destroying the earth,</v>

227
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.240
<v Speaker 2>polluting all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nuclear waste.</v>

228
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By Roll it back?</v>

00:11:11.991 --> 00:11:15.230
<v Speaker 4>tend to become of used to the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

232
00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:20.231
<v Speaker 4>That's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got to come up with some kind </v>

233
00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to do genetic studies.</v>

234
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get rid of that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Get rid of that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

236
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.300
<v Speaker 4>come up with some kind of an implant for</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's teeth are brain that blocks </v>

237
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:36.671
<v Speaker 4>that horrendous lemming fucking impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do fucking humanity of favor and </v>

238
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:42.851
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how we're supposed to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>rid of that shit that we keep going </v>

239
00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:45.821
<v Speaker 4>along with what's killing us because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're too fucking confused to know what </v>

240
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.060
<v Speaker 4>the fuck is really good.</v>

241
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

242
00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Just that there's just too much to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to their own lives.</v>

243
00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 2>They have their own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own bills on family,</v>

244
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

245
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 5>then each try paying attention to global</v>
<v Speaker 5>issues like genetically modified foods </v>

246
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.301
<v Speaker 5>and farmers suing all across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The farmers in Brazil recently,</v>

247
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 5>one billions of dollars from Monsanto </v>
<v Speaker 5>farm is in India.</v>

248
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 5>Commit suicide on an almost daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they have.</v>

249
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.780
<v Speaker 5>They have farmers in India that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>committing suicide left and right </v>

250
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 5>because of the debt that they get into </v>
<v Speaker 5>these crazy deals.</v>

251
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.490
<v Speaker 5>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all been pyramid.</v>

252
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 5>They can't get out of it and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>afford it,</v>

253
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 5>and that the whole thing is just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>disaster.</v>

254
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:28.501
<v Speaker 5>It's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a disaster that clearly has its </v>

255
00:12:28.501 --> 00:12:28.501
<v Speaker 5>roots in money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

256
00:12:28.501 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just about heres the roads.</v>

257
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 4>They're getting a payoff for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different various ways that people can </v>

258
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.211
<v Speaker 4>get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting fucking insurance pay </v>

259
00:12:39.211 --> 00:12:40.430
<v Speaker 4>off for killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

260
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and taking bets on how long it'll take </v>

261
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 4>for them to die.</v>

262
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 5>But on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the other hand,</v>

263
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:50.121
<v Speaker 5>I think like the idea of genetically </v>
<v Speaker 5>modifying food in order to help people </v>

264
00:12:50.121 --> 00:12:54.590
<v Speaker 5>nutritious food like golden rice and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's been a bunch of innovation as </v>

265
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.590
<v Speaker 5>far as.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

266
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.780
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's a lot of beauty in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the science behind it,</v>

267
00:12:57.781 --> 00:12:59.100
<v Speaker 5>but I think we're going to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

268
00:12:59.101 --> 00:13:04.101
<v Speaker 5>really fucking careful when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>playing around with nature to the money </v>

269
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:04.770
<v Speaker 5>part is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pollution of the environment.</v>

270
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:06.900
<v Speaker 5>Disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you started about talking about</v>

271
00:13:06.901 --> 00:13:10.440
<v Speaker 5>declining bee populations due to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pesticides they using in their plants,</v>

272
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.710
<v Speaker 5>it's scary shit because if the bees go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a chain reaction to this whole </v>

273
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might not like the end result of it.</v>

274
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.520
<v Speaker 5>You got it.</v>

275
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Read up on that be shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

276
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 4>That's a really interesting micro world </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

277
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.100
<v Speaker 4>but it's like all the stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The African Queens,</v>

278
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 4>the invading African queens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever gone on there?</v>

279
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Read them</v>

280
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.070
<v Speaker 5>kind of language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like really?</v>

281
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

282
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.920
<v Speaker 5>they were definitely afraid of African </v>
<v Speaker 5>killer bees.</v>

283
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 5>They're afraid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not why they're killing these </v>

284
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.231
<v Speaker 5>fucking piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're killing these bees because the </v>

285
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:42.231
<v Speaker 5>pesticides are given them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just killed everything.</v>

286
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:42.560
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

287
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.900
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of patients are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>business together.</v>

288
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 5>Work on both side of the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think they're actively trying to </v>

289
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 5>kill babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's just a side effect.</v>

290
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.310
<v Speaker 5>Your solutions</v>

291
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.480
<v Speaker 4>kill a whole populations for a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick back.</v>

292
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

293
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.720
<v Speaker 5>You think they're actively trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill whole populations of bees,</v>

294
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.450
<v Speaker 5>of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of humans,</v>

295
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.480
<v Speaker 5>of life mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that.</v>

296
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 5>I think they're just trying to profit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very positive.</v>

297
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.190
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told you guys bomber,</v>

298
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.990
<v Speaker 5>you just very strong and very </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinionated and it's all bullshit</v>

299
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 4>and people better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

300
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.820
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to make everything work </v>
<v Speaker 4>for people.</v>

301
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.210
<v Speaker 4>And everything could really work for all</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

302
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 4>All the mechanism is in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like the,</v>

303
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crazy Trans Trans and bots that seat</v>

304
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.040
<v Speaker 4>that are seated in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in those positions of power.</v>

305
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 4>They're not for like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

306
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.630
<v Speaker 4>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

307
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

308
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.950
<v Speaker 5>I hundred percent agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does.</v>

309
00:14:39.951 --> 00:14:44.951
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real problem is the idea of a </v>

310
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:44.951
<v Speaker 5>corporation itself where you value the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom line,</v>

311
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:48.861
<v Speaker 5>the numbers over the humans that work </v>
<v Speaker 5>there over the humans you affect with </v>

312
00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:52.701
<v Speaker 5>your work and because you can do it like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that because you can send to place and </v>

313
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:52.701
<v Speaker 5>shoot</v>

314
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:57.070
<v Speaker 2>mrs out of the sky because you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of does choose to fuck over some </v>

315
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.420
<v Speaker 2>country that you never have to visit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

316
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 2>take away a lot of their natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and make them,</v>

317
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:06.190
<v Speaker 2>force them into using your product </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have deals with politicians </v>

318
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.110
<v Speaker 2>and kings and monarchs there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

319
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:12.250
<v Speaker 2>just because you could do that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean that's the way you're supposed to </v>

320
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.281
<v Speaker 2>be living your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have one life here and you could </v>

321
00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 2>choose to be an evil fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you can choose to be a good person.</v>

322
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I always try to appeal to them to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 3>you could rejoin the human race at any </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

324
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 3>They all could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could.</v>

325
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 3>They could like actually like make </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

326
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 3>all that technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

327
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Everything that it took to create the </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

328
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.170
<v Speaker 3>the actual science of like a increasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>food for people and all and like a </v>

329
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Speaker 3>desalinization of water and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are so possible.</v>

330
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wasn't for just a few greedy Fox </v>

331
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:47.290
<v Speaker 3>and they're and they're trons.</v>

332
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said that if you could just </v>

333
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.551
<v Speaker 2>take the amount of money that the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States gave to Halliburton to rebuild </v>

334
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Iraq after we destroyed it and put that </v>
<v Speaker 2>money in the inner cities in America and</v>

335
00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:01.290
<v Speaker 2>not have the ward not destroy anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first place,</v>

336
00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:06.291
<v Speaker 2>the amount of positive work that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been done and the same amount of </v>

337
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 2>contracts could have been dealt out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could.</v>

338
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 2>We could have all easily convinced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money that's been spent.</v>

339
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.870
<v Speaker 2>It could effect on work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still can.</v>

340
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a better chance today </v>
<v Speaker 2>than ever before.</v>

341
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.420
<v Speaker 2>I think because today you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

342
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 2>you have information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being distributed in a way that no </v>

343
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 2>one can stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop so far,</v>

344
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.830
<v Speaker 2>but they stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if the people that are</v>

345
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:29.620
<v Speaker 2>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

346
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>They are not big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough of them that would </v>

347
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>agree with that because they would turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>against each other.</v>

348
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's a cabal of three </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes that have ultimate power.</v>

349
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.960
<v Speaker 2>There's thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are making decisions.</v>

350
00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:44.961
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not this gets censored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets censored and they're in </v>

351
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.370
<v Speaker 2>cahoots against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem by the FBI and the CIA.</v>

352
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.870
<v Speaker 2>The reason why portray us got kicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed from office is the CIA was being</v>

353
00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 2>spied on by the fucking FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't even.</v>

354
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what all NSA spying on each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

355
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.720
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out if he knows the shit.</v>

356
00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:05.721
<v Speaker 2>I Bet Poland exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're caught up kind of runs on black </v>

357
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:05.721
<v Speaker 2>male like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

358
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:10.710
<v Speaker 3>what is like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking think they're like James </v>

359
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Bond or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all like they all have to be </v>

360
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:13.840
<v Speaker 3>dirty in order to blackmail the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

361
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>They're all fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crux,</v>

362
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.040
<v Speaker 2>every goddamn blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking one of them will.</v>

363
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly quite a few of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are crooks and inside the system,</v>

364
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know them,</v>

365
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.940
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if they're crooks are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not crooks,</v>

366
00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you were growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that system,</v>

367
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 2>people imitate their atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get caught up in that wacky system </v>

368
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 2>and that becomes your reality and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're doing it,</v>

369
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also the side effects.</v>

370
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that.</v>

371
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.340
<v Speaker 6>I did what that insane.</v>

372
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't it?</v>

373
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.370
<v Speaker 3>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

374
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

375
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:45.730
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

376
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.020
<v Speaker 3>That was like fucking an unreal.</v>

377
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 2>But that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they,</v>

378
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 2>they've just gone crazy ended jackal </v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

379
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 2>They left a human race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's people trying to do something,</v>

380
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to,</v>

381
00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:01.860
<v Speaker 2>when they try to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to get past this marker.</v>

382
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.400
<v Speaker 2>They have a marker of 10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to get to 100.</v>

383
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 2>You want to get to a billion like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep snorting coke to keep it up.</v>

384
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:13.191
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ain't got to go farther and farther </v>

385
00:18:13.191 --> 00:18:13.191
<v Speaker 2>when the stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

386
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.130
<v Speaker 2>don't be telling them about adderall </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got on adderall and it's the </v>

387
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.031
<v Speaker 2>best fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not saying there's anything wrong with </v>

388
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:23.031
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

389
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:23.031
<v Speaker 2>My good friend is on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He a,</v>

390
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 2>a patch that he keeps on his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PROZAC.</v>

391
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a PROZAC patch.</v>

392
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

393
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

394
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Taking the adderall but they won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>enter.</v>

395
00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 2>You can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked what I'd love from us taking the</v>

396
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:36.970
<v Speaker 2>adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

397
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 2>the dropoff at the end of the day was </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much for them.</v>

398
00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:44.001
<v Speaker 2>It was really starting to drive him </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy because he would feel great </v>

399
00:18:44.001 --> 00:18:44.001
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day and be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>

400
00:18:44.001 --> 00:18:47.840
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd have this big dropoff </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's when you start your </v>

401
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 2>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cocktail hour.</v>

402
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with adderall,</v>

403
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:55.071
<v Speaker 2>but I am saying a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a lot of shit done or taken </v>

404
00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:55.071
<v Speaker 2>adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

405
00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 2>she had cleaned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

406
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.970
<v Speaker 2>I am sad.</v>

407
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.490
<v Speaker 4>I just cleaned out my closet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I have never done in my whole </v>

408
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.500
<v Speaker 4>fucking life because I can't focus to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

409
00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:08.090
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

410
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.020
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

411
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.080
<v Speaker 4>I might add plenty of fucking closet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm have shared in there from 25 fucking</v>

412
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.830
<v Speaker 4>years that I was afraid to throw out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I counted.</v>

413
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.840
<v Speaker 4>I had something like 1700 black plain </v>
<v Speaker 4>black tee shirts.</v>

414
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you count those all?</v>

415
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I woulda gave up after the first couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hundred</v>

416
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 4>because I was donating them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

417
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.100
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

418
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna do that again.</v>

419
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 4>That's when I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was pre adderall behavior.</v>

420
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 4>That was pre adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adderall made me see.</v>

421
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had enough fucking black tee shirt.</v>

422
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.200
<v Speaker 2>So adderall gave you clarity on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my kids are trying to get me off</v>

423
00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:01.710
<v Speaker 2>and why are you like math?</v>

424
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.650
<v Speaker 4>My fucking kids like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put through Rehab.</v>

425
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.270
<v Speaker 4>He shared about my fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell me.</v>

426
00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:09.250
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

427
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I've never done math </v>
<v Speaker 4>except for,</v>

428
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two times I was married to Tom Arnold.</v>

429
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 4>But aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

430
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:18.720
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never get into math.</v>

431
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.800
<v Speaker 4>I think it's nothing like adderall.</v>

432
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.400
<v Speaker 2>I think they've got it down to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very effective for a lot of people.</v>

433
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's real effective because I got the </v>

434
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.621
<v Speaker 4>back and forth of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two way mirror thing going on all the </v>

435
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:37.000
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made me.</v>

436
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.180
<v Speaker 4>I used to bite my nails so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

437
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.240
<v Speaker 4>like a down to nothing because my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did it too.</v>

438
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.160
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

439
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I quit for a long time.</v>

440
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Then I went on adderall and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started biting my nails and then I had</v>

441
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:56.581
<v Speaker 4>to keep it down to only two nails that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>could allow myself to buy it only tune,</v>

442
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.850
<v Speaker 4>but it perfected my fucking nail biting</v>

443
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.350
<v Speaker 2>because there's like no nail left at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

444
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.330
<v Speaker 2>They're really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good at it now.</v>

445
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.940
<v Speaker 2>But you give yourself two nails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have specific nails?</v>

446
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two are my biters.</v>

447
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.420
<v Speaker 2>So adderall let you save your other </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight fingers essentially.</v>

448
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.980
<v Speaker 4>But it kind of forced me to do these two</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

449
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.270
<v Speaker 4>So it's got its good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have clean closets</v>

450
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

451
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.070
<v Speaker 4>to write scripts I was able to fly a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking focus software.</v>

452
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that adderall stuff.</v>

453
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Did you know Robert Schimmel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did know Robert Shaw,</v>

454
00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm a great guy</v>

455
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.080
<v Speaker 2>who's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

456
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.400
<v Speaker 2>really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

457
00:21:47.401 --> 00:21:49.140
<v Speaker 2>very funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good guy.</v>

458
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.590
<v Speaker 2>He was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a heart condition and when he had</v>

459
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.990
<v Speaker 2>his heart condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was recovering from it,</v>

460
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.650
<v Speaker 2>he accidentally took adderall and called</v>
<v Speaker 2>his doctor up.</v>

461
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was somebody else's and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistook the bottle,</v>

462
00:22:01.141 --> 00:22:03.150
<v Speaker 2>wasn't paying attention and took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong medication.</v>

463
00:22:03.151 --> 00:22:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It took someone else's medication and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>he calls his doctor up in a panic.</v>

464
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

465
00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was taking my heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>

466
00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I took adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I gonna be okay,</v>

467
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like don't worry about it was the </v>

468
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>dosage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tells me the dosage,</v>

469
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

470
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.260
<v Speaker 2>just prepare to get a lot of shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert said,</v>

471
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.440
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I organize my notes in a way I've never </v>

472
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>done before when over stacks of paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrote them all down into categories.</v>

473
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Totally fucked</v>

474
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

475
00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:32.841
<v Speaker 4>it's so good like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can write a script instead of like </v>

476
00:22:32.841 --> 00:22:36.830
<v Speaker 4>getting 50 ideas on page 10 and 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>scripts and then just fucking throwing </v>

477
00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:39.880
<v Speaker 4>them all in the garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

478
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 4>just the obsessive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can focus it so that it,</v>

479
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:44.940
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

480
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.310
<v Speaker 4>constructive.</v>

481
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make you very creative that it makes you</v>

482
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:55.681
<v Speaker 2>get work done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's more like busy work done or </v>

483
00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:55.681
<v Speaker 2>things not creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like that.</v>

484
00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Writing on it was not good.</v>

485
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.060
<v Speaker 4>This is just obviously a secondhand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that could be,</v>

486
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>

487
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can never say because things affect </v>

488
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.221
<v Speaker 4>people differently anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know people that smoke pot and </v>

489
00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 4>they want to go work out and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know people that smoke pot and they </v>

490
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 4>don't want to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

491
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.271
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get smoked the same pod and they </v>

492
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:22.001
<v Speaker 4>have the one person has a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>adventure and wants to put boots on and </v>

493
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:24.521
<v Speaker 4>go to the top of a mountain and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other person doesn't want to do a thing </v>

494
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:24.521
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to play video games.</v>

495
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 4>It's who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

496
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.060
<v Speaker 4>neural pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all different.</v>

497
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.050
<v Speaker 4>We're so different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People seek some relief.</v>

498
00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:34.080
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

499
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we agree.</v>

500
00:23:35.961 --> 00:23:36.380
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

501
00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:37.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should have the right to,</v>

502
00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 4>to the relief that they seek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

503
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

504
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should just legalize pot and like </v>

505
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 4>then I think all the troubles</v>

506
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 3>would end pot and ham.</v>

507
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 5>I really agree with you 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that especially people started </v>

508
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 5>eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they started eating,</v>

509
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.280
<v Speaker 5>getting that self objective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>self analytical experience,</v>

510
00:23:56.281 --> 00:24:01.281
<v Speaker 5>really intense experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People will be a lot less prone to </v>

511
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:02.310
<v Speaker 5>continue a lot of their shitty behavior </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I does.</v>

512
00:24:02.311 --> 00:24:05.560
<v Speaker 5>Mckenna's theory of evolution in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first theory.</v>

513
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all about psilocybin mushrooms </v>

514
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.550
<v Speaker 5>and the rain forests of Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the rain forest has had receded into</v>

515
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:15.120
<v Speaker 5>grasslands and all this is proved by </v>
<v Speaker 5>climatological studies,</v>

516
00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:18.870
<v Speaker 5>core samples and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The time has been debated,</v>

517
00:24:18.871 --> 00:24:23.871
<v Speaker 5>but essentially what happened was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rainforest receded monkeys came down </v>

518
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:27.381
<v Speaker 5>from the trees and started experimenting</v>
<v Speaker 5>with different food sources and one of </v>

519
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:27.381
<v Speaker 5>them was the mushrooms growing on </v>
<v Speaker 5>calpads.</v>

520
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that you started eating </v>

521
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 5>psilocybin mushrooms and started having </v>
<v Speaker 5>these intense ideas.</v>

522
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it only makes sense if we get intense </v>

523
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.220
<v Speaker 5>ideas from them and we're having </v>
<v Speaker 5>advanced brain and a monkey gets intense</v>

524
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.450
<v Speaker 5>and experiences from.</v>

525
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.170
<v Speaker 5>They obviously have intelligent brains </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean.</v>

526
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.010
<v Speaker 5>We've seen chimps do a lot of really </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy creative things.</v>

527
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.640
<v Speaker 5>We know that the act impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We only hunt in packs were talking about</v>

528
00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:51.720
<v Speaker 5>like lower hominids getting a dose of </v>
<v Speaker 5>psilocybin mushrooms on a daily basis.</v>

529
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.450
<v Speaker 5>Of course it's going to have a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect on their evolution.</v>

530
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Of course it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

531
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Speaker 5>that's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big factor in,</v>

532
00:24:58.381 --> 00:24:59.970
<v Speaker 5>in terms of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

533
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.480
<v Speaker 5>I and I completely agree with you that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Hampton,</v>

534
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.530
<v Speaker 5>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they were made available,</v>

535
00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:09.531
<v Speaker 5>I think we are lacking in self analysis </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're lacking as a society and our </v>

536
00:25:10.771 --> 00:25:15.771
<v Speaker 5>feeling of being responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>actions of the group and those are two </v>

537
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:15.771
<v Speaker 5>things that you feel.</v>

538
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so arrogant too because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we just like ignore what everything </v>

539
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 3>means to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

540
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to know what anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>means to other people.</v>

541
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.990
<v Speaker 5>We don't care as long as we can make </v>
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>

542
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.180
<v Speaker 5>like if you're going to go to the rain </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest and chopped down these people,</v>

543
00:25:34.181 --> 00:25:38.800
<v Speaker 5>sacred trees and villages and force them</v>
<v Speaker 5>to work in factories instead,</v>

544
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.600
<v Speaker 5>if they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're willing to do it,</v>

545
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.610
<v Speaker 5>then we're going to get them to do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we want those trees.</v>

546
00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:47.611
<v Speaker 5>When we want that oil and whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck else is there that we can make </v>

547
00:25:47.611 --> 00:25:51.060
<v Speaker 5>medicine out of mean what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>is just stealing resources and we're </v>

548
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.060
<v Speaker 5>letting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're letting them say,</v>

549
00:25:52.061 --> 00:25:52.870
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff,</v>

550
00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:53.860
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't live here.</v>

551
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:58.861
<v Speaker 5>This is so what they've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people have been there for </v>

552
00:25:58.861 --> 00:25:58.861
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years and say anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 5>has eminent domain,</v>

553
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 5>tribal rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're really after.</v>

554
00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:06.391
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to get rid of that </v>

555
00:26:06.391 --> 00:26:06.391
<v Speaker 5>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All people from like from nature.</v>

556
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.400
<v Speaker 5>You can't stop people from having the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to live a natural life just </v>

557
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.631
<v Speaker 5>because you have guns just because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have tanks that stealing and if we're </v>

558
00:26:15.631 --> 00:26:15.760
<v Speaker 5>going to just let people steal shit.</v>

559
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 5>If these people were there in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the Amazon,</v>

560
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.960
<v Speaker 5>that's their fucking home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's their home.</v>

561
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.030
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to take into </v>
<v Speaker 5>context.</v>

562
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:24.610
<v Speaker 5>Their culture is culture of hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>gathering.</v>

563
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.620
<v Speaker 5>They're living in these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these cultures,</v>

564
00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 5>the same way they've been living in some</v>
<v Speaker 5>places like in the Congo and the in the,</v>

565
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.560
<v Speaker 5>in the Amazon thousands of years it had </v>
<v Speaker 5>been untouched.</v>

566
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.290
<v Speaker 5>You can't do anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to leave that alone.</v>

567
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.620
<v Speaker 5>You know you have to because just as far</v>
<v Speaker 5>as like for the sake of our </v>

568
00:26:40.961 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 5>understanding of ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having like that with these ancient,</v>

569
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:47.700
<v Speaker 5>ancient untouched cultures is so </v>
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>

570
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.970
<v Speaker 5>It's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can learn so much about the origins </v>

571
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.421
<v Speaker 5>of certain behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about group thinking when you were in </v>

572
00:26:56.421 --> 00:26:59.421
<v Speaker 5>small tribes that counter each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>about how they dealt with injuries and </v>

573
00:26:59.421 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 5>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these are fascinating,</v>

574
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 5>fascinating discoveries to be had and </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead people just want money.</v>

575
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 5>They just want to be able to chop the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trees down.</v>

576
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:09.981
<v Speaker 5>Fuck these weird people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take their shit and throw them in a </v>

577
00:27:09.981 --> 00:27:09.981
<v Speaker 5>cage.</v>

578
00:27:09.981 --> 00:27:10.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism is like that.</v>

579
00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 4>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you know,</v>

580
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.290
<v Speaker 4>unless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless human beings would brains,</v>

581
00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it under control as a tool of people</v>

582
00:27:21.101 --> 00:27:24.670
<v Speaker 4>and not its master,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll continue to go that way because it</v>

583
00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:29.671
<v Speaker 4>requires that it requires gluttonous </v>
<v Speaker 4>quarterly growth and there's nothing </v>

584
00:27:31.631 --> 00:27:33.850
<v Speaker 4>left but invest in people dying fast.</v>

585
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to maintain,</v>

586
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.020
<v Speaker 5>they want growth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is ridiculous.</v>

587
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 5>Like at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have everybody kept growing.</v>

588
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.010
<v Speaker 5>The world would be full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

589
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.040
<v Speaker 5>there's no room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no room for everybody to keep </v>

590
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.100
<v Speaker 5>growing a business in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that being your primary goal.</v>

591
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 5>Not to be profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to make money.</v>

592
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think these guys are stupid.</v>

593
00:27:50.831 --> 00:27:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it makes no sense to me because,</v>

594
00:27:55.630 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I accept that they're greedy fucking </v>

595
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.301
<v Speaker 4>pigs and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think why can't they make that </v>

596
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:08.011
<v Speaker 4>work for them and everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why can't they be a greedy fucking pig?</v>

597
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Because they're going to get like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times the fucking pay off.</v>

598
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 4>They will get even richer if they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>just listen to me make all the bats </v>

599
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.470
<v Speaker 4>because like Wall Street and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

600
00:28:20.471 --> 00:28:25.471
<v Speaker 4>That's just going to the casino,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make all the bets about how fast you can</v>

601
00:28:25.541 --> 00:28:30.130
<v Speaker 4>turn a place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a green and sustainable,</v>

602
00:28:30.131 --> 00:28:32.860
<v Speaker 4>and how fast could that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A village,</v>

603
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 4>how fast could that happen and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they they could like use the same </v>

604
00:28:38.741 --> 00:28:43.741
<v Speaker 4>fucking ridiculous infrastructure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>already exists to like make things </v>

605
00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:49.201
<v Speaker 4>better for everybody and could get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food to the hungry people because </v>

606
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.050
<v Speaker 4>there's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is,</v>

607
00:28:50.051 --> 00:28:54.190
<v Speaker 4>is the roads that get the food to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry people.</v>

608
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 4>That's 90 percent of everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying is dying because of waste and </v>

609
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.120
<v Speaker 4>stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

610
00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:06.121
<v Speaker 4>if they fixed that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get 10 times fucking </v>

611
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:09.421
<v Speaker 4>richer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not greedy fucking pigs </v>

612
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:09.421
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>

613
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.790
<v Speaker 5>All avenues as being a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

614
00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:15.130
<v Speaker 5>Even avenues that hurt people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as they profit,</v>

615
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.410
<v Speaker 5>that's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're mad,</v>

616
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 5>they're lacking in humanity and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>why when you talk about pot being what </v>

617
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.840
<v Speaker 5>could fix everything or psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 5>being what could fix things,</v>

618
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.380
<v Speaker 5>that's the only thing that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bring humanity to a giant group.</v>

619
00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:31.381
<v Speaker 5>Think that thinks that it's okay to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely diffused of responsibilities </v>

620
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:35.431
<v Speaker 5>because you're a part of some gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 5>machine that apparently no one can </v>

621
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:38.491
<v Speaker 5>control now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you're a giant machine like </v>

622
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:40.741
<v Speaker 5>Monsanto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this has been fucking over farmers for </v>

623
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:43.021
<v Speaker 5>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years or however long they've been </v>

624
00:29:43.021 --> 00:29:43.021
<v Speaker 5>around for to that</v>

625
00:29:43.021 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 3>to stop that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to get the whole </v>

626
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 3>team high on mushrooms now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it worked.</v>

627
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you hear this that Monsanto said </v>

628
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 3>they were going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going into pot.</v>

629
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Did you not hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking good.</v>

630
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 3>They're changing their thing and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have another name for it.</v>

631
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Center just or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have another name for pot?</v>

632
00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Our new company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

633
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 3>They're going to own the patent on </v>
<v Speaker 3>pockets where it gets really creepy.</v>

634
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:12.721
<v Speaker 3>They tried to own patent on pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to own pigs because pigs.</v>

635
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I was totally involved in that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering because I was like,</v>

636
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.110
<v Speaker 3>can you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we create a kosher pig that.</v>

637
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:26.210
<v Speaker 3>That's an actual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an actual studies about that </v>

638
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 3>idea of patenting and then owning a life</v>
<v Speaker 3>form is fucking ridiculous.</v>

639
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Kosher pig though.</v>

640
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be really cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be.</v>

641
00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was Nicer,</v>

642
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.960
<v Speaker 3>nicer stuff would look better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be clothing.</v>

643
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.950
<v Speaker 3>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The genetically altered?</v>

644
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 3>What would be the other options?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to keep it like they'd make a </v>

645
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.201
<v Speaker 3>pig into a chow or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess like they made a fish out of a </v>

646
00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 3>tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>

647
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a tomato out of a fish.</v>

648
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>They put fish genes in the tomato to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it shiny in the grocery store.</v>

649
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

650
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 3>they're doing a lot of weird shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

651
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.360
<v Speaker 3>They've always been doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was saying about my farm,</v>

652
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 3>that Dole pineapple that my farm is </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they did a lot of shit like that </v>

653
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.630
<v Speaker 3>and here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know how many generations </v>

654
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my fucking nuts are like,</v>

655
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.160
<v Speaker 3>they're like walnuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>

656
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 3>You think it's because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified dirt or something,</v>

657
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:31.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever these fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three of them is a meal really?</v>

658
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Is the perfect protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you get involved in macadamia </v>

659
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 3>nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How this whole thing gets started?</v>

660
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:42.820
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

661
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I tried to look for a school to put for </v>
<v Speaker 3>my kid because my kid,</v>

662
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 3>he's 18 now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was little and he needed to go to</v>

663
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 3>a school that had focused because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have any focus so I wasn't able to</v>

664
00:31:57.371 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 3>teach him how to focus or else he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>born that way or some shit.</v>

665
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell so I put them in that </v>

666
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I went out,</v>

667
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I went over and I found this school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I went over there and I bought this </v>

668
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 3>farm site unseen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really moved into it.</v>

669
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 3>What island?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A big island.</v>

670
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 3>So there was a really good school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was elvis favorite island.</v>

671
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I went there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that that's where Elvis </v>

672
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:27.330
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where Elvis?</v>

673
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the spot though.</v>

674
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.000
<v Speaker 3>If you've never been to the observatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there.</v>

675
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.630
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

676
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.650
<v Speaker 3>They said don't go up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

677
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.630
<v Speaker 3>because it could erupt at any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

678
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

679
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.440
<v Speaker 3>That an active,</v>
<v Speaker 3>active Montello is active,</v>

680
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:45.440

681
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I think they give you a little </v>

682
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.031
<v Speaker 3>bit of warning before it blows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a return and a I just returned in </v>

683
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 3>the corner in my car just as it happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it hit,</v>

684
00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:01.450
<v Speaker 3>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted a picture today of a bridge </v>

685
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 3>falling apart of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a road actually falling apart.</v>

686
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Just some cracks in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A landslide.</v>

687
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:10.901
<v Speaker 3>This gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing you do have to think </v>

688
00:33:10.901 --> 00:33:10.901
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in Hawaii,</v>

689
00:33:10.901 --> 00:33:11.900
<v Speaker 3>do you have to think about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living on a volcano?</v>

690
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making this up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>

693
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting at my desk here where I </v>

<v Speaker 3>was that perfect zero.</v>

699
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.610
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

700
00:33:41.611 --> 00:33:44.200
<v Speaker 3>When you get to the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>140 characters,</v>

701
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.470
<v Speaker 3>it's 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking seven shit.</v>

702
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to alter the top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it for obsessive people,</v>

703
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.800
<v Speaker 3>but I just hit sand and right then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt an earthquake right on my fucking </v>

704
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.570
<v Speaker 3>desk and I went on line and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had hit Marina del Rey right where I </v>

705
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:09.431
<v Speaker 3>was sitting where I sit and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking go crazy because I was </v>

706
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:09.431
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

707
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:13.420
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking free cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Run into the street screaming,</v>

708
00:34:13.421 --> 00:34:16.330
<v Speaker 3>knocking on their neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking do that.</v>

709
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Stay in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get some emotional control.</v>

710
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:23.350
<v Speaker 3>You've just lived through a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

711
00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earth moving.</v>

712
00:34:25.361 --> 00:34:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earthquake.</v>

713
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.300
<v Speaker 3>So I calm myself down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go back to Hawaii the first night </v>

714
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.120
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another one.</v>

715
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I almost lost my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just beginning finding.</v>

716
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so terrifying.</v>

717
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.630
<v Speaker 3>You think of all these people like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

718
00:34:45.631 --> 00:34:50.631
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just there and here comes a </v>

719
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:50.631
<v Speaker 3>tidal wave and here comes a tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how,</v>

720
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:55.551
<v Speaker 3>how vulnerable we are to all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements and why and stuff and people </v>

721
00:34:56.281 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 3>don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>

722
00:34:58.831 --> 00:35:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have a fucking nervous breakdown</v>

723
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.100
<v Speaker 3>over that when you definitely can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

724
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:07.410
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>that human beings die.</v>

725
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 3>They were very finite and whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get hit with an earthquake or a </v>

726
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.600
<v Speaker 3>tsunami or hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to die anyway.</v>

727
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really the terrifying part.</v>

728
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one.</v>

729
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're sitting there all the </v>

730
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 3>time wondering how you're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

731
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.840
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you upset?</v>

732
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Are you scared of that at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think of that?</v>

733
00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that much.</v>

734
00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:26.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only,</v>

735
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:30.330
<v Speaker 3>what I think about the big worry for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be leaving behind my kids.</v>

736
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be the big worry,</v>

737
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:32.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them sad.</v>

738
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.830
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to die.</v>

739
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

740
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm enjoying life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's inevitable</v>

741
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.400
<v Speaker 5>unless something crazy comes along </v>
<v Speaker 5>technologically over the next hundred </v>

742
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.900
<v Speaker 5>years when that'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say that it's there.</v>

743
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it would be cool because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's next.</v>

744
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced that this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a one stop shop.</v>

745
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.850
<v Speaker 5>Like we land in life and this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>

746
00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:55.680
<v Speaker 5>this is where our soul is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where energy is.</v>

747
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 5>This is the ultimate stop of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>

748
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 5>Convinced why do you think you'd go </v>
<v Speaker 5>after this?</v>

749
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just the fact that this exists.</v>

750
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Just the fact that this life that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>live in where we can communicate with </v>

751
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.281
<v Speaker 5>our mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we can see with our eyes where we </v>

752
00:36:13.281 --> 00:36:13.281
<v Speaker 5>walk around and drive around flying </v>
<v Speaker 5>planes.</v>

753
00:36:13.281 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 5>This life is so fucking insane and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy and bizarre and fantastic.</v>

754
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.910
<v Speaker 5>Just this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that this existence exists </v>

755
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.611
<v Speaker 5>where we shut off every night for eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours and completely vanished from the </v>

756
00:36:25.611 --> 00:36:29.900
<v Speaker 5>reality that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then we do it willingly and then </v>

757
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:29.900
<v Speaker 5>we'd come back in the morning and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>start all over again.</v>

758
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 5>That alone is fucking fantastic and </v>
<v Speaker 5>bizarre and strange.</v>

759
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced that when we die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this ends.</v>

760
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced that anybody dies.</v>

761
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:44.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced that this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>is in just one series of wake ups and </v>

762
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:47.931
<v Speaker 5>goes and sleeps and wakes up and go and </v>
<v Speaker 5>while your conscious and while you're </v>

763
00:36:47.931 --> 00:36:51.111
<v Speaker 5>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced that you're in the </v>

764
00:36:51.111 --> 00:36:51.770
<v Speaker 5>same timeline that you were on before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're Sam's.</v>

765
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.440
<v Speaker 5>We could be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what a lot of people far </v>

766
00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.781
<v Speaker 5>smarter than me are arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could almost prove that we are part </v>

767
00:36:59.781 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 5>of some sort of a crazy gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer simulation,</v>

768
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 5>but that might be what the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the first place.</v>

769
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.100
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that might be with nature as we </v>

770
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 5>try to look at nature as being something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

771
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:16.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is rock and this is dirt and these </v>

772
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.130
<v Speaker 5>are one.</v>

773
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shorter until you break it down to </v>

774
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.650
<v Speaker 5>molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tear breakup time summit,</v>

775
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.370
<v Speaker 5>atomic particles that exist everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Patterns.</v>

776
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:25.371
<v Speaker 5>When you break it down to like a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 5>fibonacci sequence and things along </v>

777
00:37:25.371 --> 00:37:29.991
<v Speaker 5>those lines like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need any bigger mystery than </v>

778
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 5>this now as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know today,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right in the very</v>

799
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 4>end of it.</v>

00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I can joke.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

804
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:44.930
<v Speaker 4>look at this again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

805
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 4>what's happening with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

806
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 4>the native,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the native,</v>

807
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 4>the first nations people that otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 4>people can't hear you.</v>

808
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:55.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry for drag it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could drag it back to take a look at</v>

809
00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 4>like first nations stuff in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States and how that's just.</v>

810
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 4>It's very fascinating to be come more </v>
<v Speaker 4>informed on that subject.</v>

811
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially genocide.</v>

812
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's essentially what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the native Americans.</v>

813
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Their culture was wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were stuck into these small camps </v>

814
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>and fenced in and given these areas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas eventually became casinos in</v>

815
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:18.010
<v Speaker 2>some spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

816
00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:20.490
<v Speaker 2>it's the weirdest absorption of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concert.</v>

817
00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

818
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.680
<v Speaker 4>They don't get any of that money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only a couple tribes that got </v>

819
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 4>any of that money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>

820
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Remember why that Jack Abramoff walked </v>
<v Speaker 4>off with about $30 million from it at </v>

821
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 4>the bureau of Indian affairs.</v>

822
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about this.</v>

823
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Who is that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those banks,</v>

824
00:39:35.961 --> 00:39:40.961
<v Speaker 2>jurors that got caught and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got four years yet still all that.</v>

825
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>The bureau of Indian affairs money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$30 million of those casinos are </v>

826
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.791
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole situation is crazy because </v>

827
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:51.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's all native Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>that own and operate those places.</v>

828
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Other people are involved too that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>profiting off of these casinos that are </v>

829
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>in places where it's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

830
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 2>But in native American ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

831
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 4>they had me meet some of their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

832
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.870
<v Speaker 4>native council or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

833
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.130
<v Speaker 4>You got in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

834
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.420
<v Speaker 4>because I go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're,</v>

835
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 4>you're Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're Jewish.</v>

836
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.550
<v Speaker 4>I know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're Jewish.</v>

837
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could tell that they were Italians and</v>

838
00:40:16.311 --> 00:40:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't frigging native Americans.</v>

839
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Native American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he have to be,</v>

840
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.700
<v Speaker 4>do you have to be 100 percent 50 50 by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Roseanne Barr scale scale to scale </v>

841
00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:33.251
<v Speaker 4>of each tribe makes their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mostly 50.</v>

842
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.160
<v Speaker 4>Mostly 50 or it could be your </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandparents to 25,</v>

843
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.910
<v Speaker 4>but it has to be pretty 50 slash 50 like</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii.</v>

844
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 4>One thing I think so cool is that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do have a lot of affordable housing for </v>

845
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.900
<v Speaker 4>the first nations people there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

846
00:40:47.901 --> 00:40:52.901
<v Speaker 4>the Hawaiian people and they get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like guarantee of school and </v>

847
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:52.901
<v Speaker 4>like they got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

848
00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big island,</v>

849
00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:59.120
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii has a fantastic socialist state </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

850
00:40:59.121 --> 00:41:01.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's just going to make the</v>

851
00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:06.041
<v Speaker 4>big turnaround real quick because </v>
<v Speaker 4>China's just said no gmos,</v>

852
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 4>so we kicked their ass out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I think we're going to like have </v>

853
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.991
<v Speaker 4>a boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we do need some of that technology </v>

854
00:41:15.991 --> 00:41:18.000
<v Speaker 4>because I think we want to grow organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeds with help.</v>

855
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.340
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to reinvent the organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>seed.</v>

856
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.250
<v Speaker 4>We want to grow organics with </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

857
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.730
<v Speaker 4>So it's an incredible new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>odd time of,</v>

858
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mixing the best everything.</v>

859
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 5>So what you're talking about is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>genetically modifying the foods but </v>

860
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.791
<v Speaker 5>using technology to more efficiently </v>
<v Speaker 5>till the soil more officially irrigate </v>

861
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:46.740
<v Speaker 5>the crops more efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put nutrients into the ground,</v>

862
00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.870
<v Speaker 5>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

863
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's stuff that works well.</v>

864
00:41:50.431 --> 00:41:55.431
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that we know the cause and </v>

865
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:55.431
<v Speaker 5>effect of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know it's healthy.</v>

866
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:59.091
<v Speaker 5>We know it's a part of the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know that there's just a rich </v>

867
00:41:59.091 --> 00:42:00.570
<v Speaker 5>biodiversity when it comes to any place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where something's growing.</v>

868
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 5>There's bugs involved in rodents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolved and BS.</v>

869
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.870
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just the plant itself.</v>

870
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:12.110
<v Speaker 5>When you alter the plant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real issue seems to be that you </v>

871
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:12.400
<v Speaker 5>alter a lot of other shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then of course,</v>

872
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how much of this is true or</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

873
00:42:14.581 --> 00:42:19.581
<v Speaker 5>but the idea of cross pollenization and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people being sued because they have </v>

874
00:42:19.581 --> 00:42:20.490
<v Speaker 5>genetically modified foods growing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

875
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.240
<v Speaker 5>in their farms because of inadvertent </v>
<v Speaker 5>cross pollinization.</v>

876
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's very few people who have only </v>

877
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 4>organic's really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

878
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Most farmers there have a mix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think now it's been tilted to </v>

879
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.460
<v Speaker 4>where it's going to become more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

880
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

881
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.560
<v Speaker 4>moving towards a 100 percent organic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no pesticides and this and that and the </v>

882
00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:47.790
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in order to do that,</v>

883
00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:52.791
<v Speaker 4>you've got to reverse a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't let them be spraying </v>

884
00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 4>overhead anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't be spraying aluminum and </v>

885
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 4>Barium all day if you're going to grow.</v>

886
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.260
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you seeing you saying chem trails,</v>

887
00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.060
<v Speaker 5>the aluminum barium shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

888
00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:02.970
<v Speaker 5>I did a whole Saifai special on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Scifi channel,</v>

889
00:43:02.971 --> 00:43:07.440
<v Speaker 5>a whole episode dedicated to chem trails</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the more attention to it,</v>

890
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.800
<v Speaker 5>the more I think that people are very </v>
<v Speaker 5>confused as to what's going on.</v>

891
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 5>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee without a doubt has sprayed </v>

892
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.620
<v Speaker 5>things on people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've proven it.</v>

893
00:43:16.621 --> 00:43:17.730
<v Speaker 5>They've proven it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did it.</v>

894
00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:22.820
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a recent thing they talked </v>

895
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.101
<v Speaker 5>about doing it in the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did tests to see what would happen </v>

896
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:28.821
<v Speaker 5>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Communists said came over here and </v>

897
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:30.810
<v Speaker 5>did some sort of a nuclear attack on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>population or poisonous gas attack.</v>

898
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.500
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they.</v>

899
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:34.170
<v Speaker 5>They sprayed particles so they could </v>
<v Speaker 5>track them.</v>

900
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:36.210
<v Speaker 5>They don't know what the fuck that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to do to people.</v>

901
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.370
<v Speaker 5>They've done things where they've done </v>
<v Speaker 5>done experiments on the.</v>

902
00:43:38.371 --> 00:43:40.770
<v Speaker 5>Whether they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They figured out how to cloud seeding by</v>

903
00:43:40.771 --> 00:43:41.730
<v Speaker 5>just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

904
00:43:41.731 --> 00:43:45.060
<v Speaker 5>they knew the science behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like they had a vote on the</v>

905
00:43:45.061 --> 00:43:46.500
<v Speaker 5>entire world and ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

906
00:43:46.501 --> 00:43:49.170
<v Speaker 5>can we see clouds or what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you guys think?</v>

907
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:49.800
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

908
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:50.790
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just did it.</v>

909
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.360
<v Speaker 5>The government has done things along </v>
<v Speaker 5>those lines for a long time.</v>

910
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.740
<v Speaker 4>People think that they bring on </v>
<v Speaker 4>earthquakes too and</v>

911
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:03.020
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we talked about that as well and aside </v>

912
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.020
<v Speaker 5>fi show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the problem.</v>

913
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.350
<v Speaker 5>There is science behind those trails.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a.</v>

914
00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:09.351
<v Speaker 5>You can track when it's gonna happen and</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's not going to happen and it's </v>

915
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:09.420
<v Speaker 5>all based on the humidity in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>atmosphere.</v>

916
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's all based on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you have a jet engine and it burns </v>

917
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.540
<v Speaker 5>jet fuel and it's going through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>atmosphere,</v>

918
00:44:15.541 --> 00:44:19.920
<v Speaker 5>it's creating moisture and in conditions</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's almost cloud like,</v>

919
00:44:19.921 --> 00:44:24.921
<v Speaker 5>like very hazy when a jet engine pass </v>
<v Speaker 5>through this change of atmosphere and </v>

920
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:29.601
<v Speaker 5>adding moisture creates a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you see those patterns and </v>

921
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:30.060
<v Speaker 5>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

922
00:44:30.061 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 5>they're spraying us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

923
00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:36.411
<v Speaker 5>they're actually creating a cloud with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the natural effect of a jet engine </v>

924
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 5>passing through a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>humidity.</v>

925
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 5>That's why you see them in some days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but other days you don't see.</v>

926
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a natural side effect of jet </v>

927
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 5>travel.</v>

928
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've known about it since the 19 </v>

929
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:50.600
<v Speaker 5>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the 19 forties,</v>

930
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 5>there was a paper written by the army </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they were asking what?</v>

931
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 5>What about these things that you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind planes?</v>

932
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.920
<v Speaker 5>They called them consistent condensation</v>
<v Speaker 5>trails,</v>

933
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.390
<v Speaker 5>persistent rather persistent </v>
<v Speaker 5>condensation trails.</v>

934
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 5>They didn't call him contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was back then,</v>

935
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:08.450
<v Speaker 5>so they were trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things are and they realized that </v>

936
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.140
<v Speaker 5>this is just what happens if you get an </v>
<v Speaker 5>engine the past through the environment,</v>

937
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 5>burn fuel and create moisture that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain conditions it creates clouds.</v>

938
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:20.510
<v Speaker 5>See when people start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>aluminum and Barium and all that </v>

939
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.510
<v Speaker 5>different Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

940
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 5>there's aluminum in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

941
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:28.250
<v Speaker 5>the ground is filled with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>aluminum and a lot of these guys that </v>

942
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.440
<v Speaker 5>are doing these tests locally found </v>
<v Speaker 5>aluminum in the water.</v>

943
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 5>When you look at their test,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it actually says sludge,</v>

944
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.590
<v Speaker 5>like what in the world are they </v>
<v Speaker 5>spraying?</v>

945
00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 5>This is a conversation I had with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy on the air.</v>

946
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.320
<v Speaker 5>It says sludge sludges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dirt,</v>

947
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 5>dirt and water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's saying,</v>

948
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's all this aluminum in this water,</v>

949
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not water.</v>

950
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:47.061
<v Speaker 5>That's water with dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you're telling me is you did a </v>

951
00:45:47.061 --> 00:45:49.551
<v Speaker 5>scientific test that showed that dirt </v>
<v Speaker 5>tested positive for being dirt because </v>

952
00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:50.760
<v Speaker 5>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dirt has seven,</v>

953
00:45:50.761 --> 00:45:52.740
<v Speaker 5>10 percent aluminum in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes less,</v>

954
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:57.741
<v Speaker 5>sometimes more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aluminum is one of the most common </v>

955
00:45:57.741 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 5>things you can find in dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when someone does a test and says,</v>

956
00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this aluminum is proof,</v>

957
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 5>they're spraying this guy's no fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>aluminum is a part of nature.</v>

958
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 5>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in the ground or not.</v>

959
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 5>If they were spraying it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would they be spraying?</v>

960
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would it look like?</v>

961
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's what it wouldn't look like.</v>

962
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 5>Clouds aluminum's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you spray it,</v>

963
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 5>it's much heavier than moisture.</v>

964
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.850
<v Speaker 5>Will you seen in those things in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>clouds?</v>

965
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's real chem trails.</v>

966
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the real chemistry.</v>

967
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Let's hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're burning fucking millions of </v>

968
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 5>gallons of fuel in the atmosphere that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

969
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.480
<v Speaker 5>Forget about this craziness of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>spraying shit.</v>

970
00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 5>Honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to alter our personalities.</v>

971
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.330
<v Speaker 5>They're burning fuel in the sky and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>all take part of this.</v>

972
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Speaker 5>You did to get here from Hawaii I did to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get here from Vegas this past weekend.</v>

973
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.880
<v Speaker 5>We're all a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what it is for sure is not good.</v>

974
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.090
<v Speaker 5>You're burning fucking fuel in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the real camp trail where you're </v>

975
00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:58.511
<v Speaker 5>seeing those cloud things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not spraying chemicals at a </v>

976
00:46:58.511 --> 00:47:01.401
<v Speaker 5>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not some gigantic conspiracy that </v>

977
00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:03.591
<v Speaker 5>the whole world is in the dark about and</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these politicians are in on and </v>

978
00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how many fucking people </v>

979
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 5>would have to be quiet everyday on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>daily basis?</v>

980
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:12.351
<v Speaker 5>If they really were spraying aluminum on</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and if they were spraying </v>

981
00:47:12.351 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 5>aluminum on people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't look like clouds.</v>

982
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Those are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look like clouds because they are </v>

983
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.360
<v Speaker 5>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've asked scientists,</v>

984
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 5>they said if you had aluminum dust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he sprayed.</v>

985
00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.640
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't look anything like those </v>
<v Speaker 5>clouds.</v>

986
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Even Monsanto says that they are are </v>
<v Speaker 5>they need to have a radio engineering</v>

987
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 2>they need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need a reflection because of what's</v>

988
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>in the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A reflection.</v>

989
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need like to create a mirror.</v>

990
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

991
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mirror.</v>

992
00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

993
00:47:42.541 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about spraying the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Monsanto said that?</v>

994
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

995
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

996
00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mirror effect.</v>

997
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 2>People say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

998
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

999
00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Those people are fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can project the movie that they </v>

1000
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.740
<v Speaker 2>planned on fucking putting us all </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the war.</v>

1001
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.260
<v Speaker 2>You're on an island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too long going crazy.</v>

1002
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 2>He goes nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

1003
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Nuts and got your fucking mind warped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people say that,</v>

1004
00:48:13.781 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 2>but people also say that all the leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the free world or actually reptiles,</v>

1005
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:19.920
<v Speaker 2>they also say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go that far.</v>

1006
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you have a fucking.</v>

1007
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Aliens are common to those with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and a felon and all that.</v>

1008
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go there neither.</v>

1009
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 2>It's Nibiru is the planet and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Annunaki.</v>

1010
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1011
00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:37.170
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1012
00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:38.950
<v Speaker 2>They do know</v>

1013
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:43.990
<v Speaker 5>that there's something out way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way out far past Jupiter and past Pluto </v>

1014
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.510
<v Speaker 5>and they think that a bigger actually in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jupiter,</v>

1015
00:48:47.511 --> 00:48:49.700
<v Speaker 5>they think it might be actually four </v>
<v Speaker 5>times the size of Jupiter at least,</v>

1016
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
<v Speaker 5>so they think it might be a brown star,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a star that's died out and they think </v>

1017
00:48:56.331 --> 00:49:00.170
<v Speaker 5>that this source system where might </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually be a binary source system.</v>

1018
00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 5>So it's a brown dwarf star and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently there's as many binary star </v>

1019
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.380
<v Speaker 5>systems as there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1020
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.610
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a single star.</v>

1021
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.680
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like super common.</v>

1022
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 5>And if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense for a lot of things </v>

1023
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.220
<v Speaker 5>including pluto because Pluto's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really a planet,</v>

1024
00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:18.110
<v Speaker 5>like that's why they stopped having it </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a plant anymore.</v>

1025
00:49:18.111 --> 00:49:21.530
<v Speaker 5>They realize it's a part of the Kuyper </v>
<v Speaker 5>belt was this huge belt of,</v>

1026
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.810
<v Speaker 5>of objects way out at the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>solar system.</v>

1027
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.090
<v Speaker 5>But that there's a thing called the </v>
<v Speaker 5>galactic shelf.</v>

1028
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:31.180
<v Speaker 5>This is big dropoff afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which would indicate there's something </v>

1029
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.500
<v Speaker 5>absolutely massive just outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is all butchered science,</v>

1030
00:49:33.501 --> 00:49:38.501
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not a scientist obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so they think if there is a planet </v>

1031
00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:42.641
<v Speaker 5>out there as something out there that </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people you know or trying to </v>

1032
00:49:42.641 --> 00:49:44.390
<v Speaker 5>describe that more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a brown dwarf star,</v>

1033
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 5>but it's no people on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a giant mass of something.</v>

1034
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:52.850
<v Speaker 5>I think there might be people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1035
00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:54.980
<v Speaker 5>there couldn't be somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there is us,</v>

1036
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.870
<v Speaker 5>if there's us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there could be somewhere.</v>

1037
00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 5>The real problem with the alien thing is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that everyone you talked to that says </v>

1038
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:02.720
<v Speaker 5>they've met aliens or they know aliens </v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

1039
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:04.670
<v Speaker 5>They're almost all fucked up.</v>

1040
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost 100 percent.</v>

1041
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

1042
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:14.551
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe I don't not believe in </v>

1043
00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:16.811
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely believe that aliens could </v>

1044
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:16.811
<v Speaker 2>be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I believe in spiders,</v>

1045
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:18.740
<v Speaker 2>spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiders are fucking crazy.</v>

1046
00:50:18.741 --> 00:50:20.270
<v Speaker 2>You ever met an alien though?</v>

1047
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.560
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe so.</v>

1048
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:26.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean I might've.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if you're smart enough to come </v>

1049
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.030
<v Speaker 5>here and be an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're smart enough to also take a </v>

1050
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.751
<v Speaker 5>human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have fucking camouflage that </v>

1051
00:50:31.751 --> 00:50:31.751
<v Speaker 5>we put on jets where you can't see them </v>
<v Speaker 5>on radar.</v>

1052
00:50:31.751 --> 00:50:36.450
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have hunters that were clothes that </v>

1053
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:36.450
<v Speaker 5>looked like trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They stand in the.</v>

1054
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 5>No one even sees them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1055
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:41.890
<v Speaker 5>it's real obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could pretend to be a person if </v>

1056
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:41.890
<v Speaker 5>you're so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could get here from the planet.</v>

1057
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yourself a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trillion light years away.</v>

1058
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:49.450
<v Speaker 5>Why can't tend to be made on what if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're less than less than than me.</v>

1059
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.850
<v Speaker 5>They're called</v>

1060
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:57.310
<v Speaker 4>now they are bought and they are created</v>
<v Speaker 4>and programmed and set upon innocent </v>

1061
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:03.520
<v Speaker 4>people from our government and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>government from the the government of </v>

1062
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 4>the beast,</v>

1063
00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.370
<v Speaker 5>the government of the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the money behind the whole wholesale.</v>

1064
00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.890
<v Speaker 5>The other problem with that is they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not smart enough to make that,</v>

1065
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 5>so you'd have to get people smart enough</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make that.</v>

1066
00:51:10.511 --> 00:51:13.060
<v Speaker 5>And the consensus science right now is </v>
<v Speaker 5>not capable.</v>

1067
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.790
<v Speaker 5>A Bot like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the consensus science right now,</v>

1068
00:51:15.791 --> 00:51:19.000
<v Speaker 5>it's not a fake person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's bullshit.</v>

1069
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.760
<v Speaker 5>No sex dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're close,</v>

1070
00:51:21.761 --> 00:51:22.980
<v Speaker 5>but it's not going to trick me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1071
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:26.590
<v Speaker 5>that's just what they're showing you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're 50 years ahead of that shit.</v>

1072
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:31.650
<v Speaker 5>They.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with that kind of thinking </v>

1073
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.721
<v Speaker 5>is the people that are in control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they have the whole Republican think </v>

1074
00:51:33.721 --> 00:51:38.431
<v Speaker 5>sewed up forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are in control or not </v>

1075
00:51:38.431 --> 00:51:41.581
<v Speaker 5>smart enough to create all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This stuff has to be created by </v>

1076
00:51:41.581 --> 00:51:41.581
<v Speaker 5>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scientists.</v>

1077
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.980
<v Speaker 5>It's all documented stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that's being done.</v>

1078
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:50.160
<v Speaker 5>All the stuff that's being done today is</v>
<v Speaker 5>all based on the technology that's been </v>

1079
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.620
<v Speaker 5>created by geniuses over the past </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred years from Tesla,</v>

1080
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.800
<v Speaker 5>Edison on down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different people have added </v>

1081
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.180
<v Speaker 5>their campaign contributions and is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very clear line between how these things</v>

1082
00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:06.181
<v Speaker 5>get created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when you have all this fantastic </v>

1083
00:52:06.181 --> 00:52:06.940
<v Speaker 5>stuff like giant televisions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>satellite Internet and all this,</v>

1084
00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.090
<v Speaker 5>there's a direct line that shows how all</v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff came about,</v>

1085
00:52:10.091 --> 00:52:14.110
<v Speaker 5>but yet they can't sell gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clean water or food to the hungry.</v>

1086
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Not that they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just that they haven't figured out </v>

1087
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.470
<v Speaker 5>a way to make it so profitable that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>more profitable than than destroying the</v>

1088
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:25.471
<v Speaker 5>environment and stealing people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>resources and leaving behind horrible </v>

1089
00:52:25.471 --> 00:52:28.390
<v Speaker 5>pollution because that's profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the way they're doing it.</v>

1090
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:33.510
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>corporations are allowed to act like </v>

1091
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.211
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that individuals become a part of the </v>

1092
00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:36.400
<v Speaker 5>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what is it?</v>

1093
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:41.400
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really want to say this is how you're </v>

1094
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:41.400
<v Speaker 4>going to be at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1095
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:41.400
<v Speaker 4>jump in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1096
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1097
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.890
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I lost the thought.</v>

1098
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:48.490
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

1099
00:52:48.491 --> 00:52:53.491
<v Speaker 5>I lost the fuck fucking what you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying was that what I was saying that </v>

1100
00:52:53.491 --> 00:52:57.331
<v Speaker 5>you reacted to was that they need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to still remain human and</v>

1101
00:52:57.521 --> 00:52:59.350
<v Speaker 5>that the problem is when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>corporation,</v>

1102
00:52:59.351 --> 00:53:04.351
<v Speaker 5>you have this big giant group of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's allowed to act in and make money </v>

1103
00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 5>without any consideration mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't say</v>

1104
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.220
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's government.</v>

1105
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.670
<v Speaker 4>The government that they hate and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>all talk about,</v>

1106
00:53:10.671 --> 00:53:15.671
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we out have a big government and </v>

1107
00:53:15.671 --> 00:53:15.750
<v Speaker 4>they're all on government money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While they're saying that the replay.</v>

1108
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them.</v>

1109
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:22.060
<v Speaker 4>Everybody who hates the big government </v>
<v Speaker 4>is sucking on the t to big government </v>

1110
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 4>and that's their job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting paid to go out there and</v>

1111
00:53:24.831 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we hate big government.</v>

1112
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.640
<v Speaker 3>We need to keep government in check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But government is the thing that keeps </v>

1113
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 3>that shit in Czech government is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only power that people have.</v>

1114
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Government is the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no,</v>

1115
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.360
<v Speaker 3>there's no loss and it has to be a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of corrupt fuck fucking people that are </v>

1116
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.720
<v Speaker 3>for sale and whores and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that.</v>

1117
00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:48.721
<v Speaker 3>Eat the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could actually be people who </v>

1118
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:52.251
<v Speaker 3>understood what being a true </v>
<v Speaker 3>representative of the American people </v>

1119
00:53:52.251 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should start a,</v>

1120
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:55.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1121
00:53:55.621 --> 00:54:00.621
<v Speaker 3>Here's my solution because I like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of solutions rather than just yap </v>

1122
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 3>about problems like the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right because they're fucking idiots who</v>

1123
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 3>can invent anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1124
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1125
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we could fix everything,</v>

1126
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:11.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a real big fat fucking hurry.</v>

1127
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.430
<v Speaker 3>We could fix the economic system if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to.</v>

1128
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just put fucking regulations on it.</v>

1129
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.550
<v Speaker 3>All the things that existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 3>before Reagan took them away and sold </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the fucking river,</v>

1131
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 3>just put them back.</v>

1132
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.370
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever watch that documentary </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside job?</v>

1133
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fantastic.</v>

1134
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Because wasn't it great?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrifying and fantastic.</v>

1136
00:54:29.751 --> 00:54:34.751
<v Speaker 5>And the guy who got on coke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're the fucking guys in the wolf of </v>

1137
00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1138
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the guy who created actually give </v>

1139
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.120
<v Speaker 5>him some credit right now I'm Charles h </v>
<v Speaker 5>dot Ferguson.</v>

1140
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:42.710
<v Speaker 5>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's awesome.</v>

1141
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:44.840
<v Speaker 5>It was a really fantastic job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>

1142
00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:50.140
<v Speaker 5>It was just a brilliant and insightful </v>
<v Speaker 5>view on how these problems occur.</v>

1143
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:55.540
<v Speaker 5>Who Profits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how these people that start out as </v>

1144
00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.820
<v Speaker 5>people who are the educators who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>recommending the economic,</v>

1145
00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:00.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>professors that are recommending certain</v>

1146
00:55:00.921 --> 00:55:05.921
<v Speaker 5>standards and those standards get passed</v>
<v Speaker 5>and these guys wind up getting giant </v>

1147
00:55:05.921 --> 00:55:08.390
<v Speaker 5>jobs with the banks that profited from </v>
<v Speaker 5>them changing the regulations.</v>

1148
00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:10.510
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking madness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just shelving.</v>

1149
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.950
<v Speaker 5>It's on everybody's face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:15.760
<v Speaker 3>Well they get off on that now for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1151
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:16.640
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1152
00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 3>they used to like hide net with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret organizations.</v>

1153
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 3>But then they made a big change once </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started on that cocaine,</v>

1154
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:28.850
<v Speaker 3>then they like to put it in people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>face and they kept coming with it and </v>

1155
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:32.271
<v Speaker 3>it's like not just put in their face but</v>
<v Speaker 3>bend over and spread their ass cheeks </v>

1156
00:55:32.271 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and rub it right on your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A vacation house.</v>

1157
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are just like,</v>

1158
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:41.391
<v Speaker 3>sure they can get away with anything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have been allowed to get away with </v>

1159
00:55:41.391 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Wireless fucking ever been arrested.</v>

1160
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.250
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what's going to change </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's going to change because</v>

1161
00:55:46.251 --> 00:55:51.251
<v Speaker 5>of the Internet because this information</v>
<v Speaker 5>was all hidden before we use this same </v>

1162
00:55:51.251 --> 00:55:52.460
<v Speaker 5>type of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not new.</v>

1163
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:55.610
<v Speaker 5>It's not that it just erupted in 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1164
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.410
<v Speaker 5>It's been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1165
00:55:57.411 --> 00:56:02.411
<v Speaker 5>We have the direct line that we learned </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the kind of regulations that </v>

1166
00:56:02.411 --> 00:56:06.041
<v Speaker 5>Reagan had stopped and what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened from then to the Bush </v>

1167
00:56:06.171 --> 00:56:07.610
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know all that stuff now,</v>

1168
00:56:07.611 --> 00:56:10.200
<v Speaker 5>but they just moved while it was all </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on a private</v>

1169
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 3>pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the short of it.</v>

1170
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:15.960
<v Speaker 3>They made laws that made it possible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to do that,</v>

1171
00:56:15.961 --> 00:56:19.380
<v Speaker 3>but this is so incredible about it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it seems that,</v>

1172
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:24.750
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I ran for president </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was like when are they going </v>

1173
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.750
<v Speaker 3>to put a a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1174
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:29.750
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an American person,</v>

1175
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:36.780
<v Speaker 3>like a working American person in a seat</v>
<v Speaker 3>at those tables where money is </v>

1176
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.830
<v Speaker 3>apportioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1177
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 3>that ever happened,</v>

1178
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:43.550
<v Speaker 5>you mean a person that represents the </v>
<v Speaker 5>average person,</v>

1179
00:56:43.551 --> 00:56:43.970
<v Speaker 5>the average,</v>

1180
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:49.830
<v Speaker 3>the of the public of John and Joan q </v>
<v Speaker 3>public.</v>

1181
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.950
<v Speaker 3>So I think we should start a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that should be the name of our </v>

1182
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:59.611
<v Speaker 3>corporation of Americans ink and that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>should apply for a privatized contracts </v>

1183
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 3>like everybody else is doing.</v>

1184
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.870
<v Speaker 5>So America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ANC being,</v>

1185
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a friend of mine that's starting</v>

1186
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 5>a business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a more of an avenue rather for,</v>

1187
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:17.700
<v Speaker 5>for people to fund politicians the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>corporations have been funny politicians</v>

1188
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.880
<v Speaker 5>and to encourage politicians that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsible and ethical and that you </v>

1189
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.511
<v Speaker 5>could profit from that just as much as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could profit from having worked for </v>

1190
00:57:26.511 --> 00:57:31.221
<v Speaker 5>some evil corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that if you got like sort of almost </v>

1191
00:57:31.221 --> 00:57:31.260
<v Speaker 5>like a kickstarter type thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1192
00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.500
<v Speaker 5>to represent like strong ethical </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

1193
00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.210
<v Speaker 3>But anytime you put money into it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be wrong and suck ass.</v>

1194
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 5>But if it's all transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea being,</v>

1195
00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:45.721
<v Speaker 5>if they're not representing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>corporation that's going to profit </v>

1196
00:57:45.721 --> 00:57:48.750
<v Speaker 5>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're representing people that want </v>

1197
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.750
<v Speaker 5>more activity and ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See the money,</v>

1198
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:50.240
<v Speaker 5>there's profit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see what I'm saying?</v>

1199
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.980
<v Speaker 5>But you see what I'm saying though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people would be willing to </v>

1200
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 5>contribute and then someone else will </v>
<v Speaker 5>control your system though.</v>

1201
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.910
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think it would be their </v>
<v Speaker 5>system anymore.</v>

1202
00:57:57.911 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 5>It'll be our system if it was done </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly.</v>

1203
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:04.800
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is that our system would</v>
<v Speaker 5>be different than the system right now </v>

1204
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:04.960
<v Speaker 5>because there wouldn't be a need for </v>
<v Speaker 5>profit.</v>

1205
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.850
<v Speaker 5>So the need for profit exists now where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1206
00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 5>you get the politicians take the money </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the corporations,</v>

1207
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 5>the corporations give them money because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want profit.</v>

1208
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:18.810
<v Speaker 5>This would be people giving them money </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they want ethics and morality </v>

1209
00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 5>and a healthy society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think the,</v>

1210
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 5>so much money comes from taxpayers as it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to have that be an option instead to </v>

1211
00:58:25.741 --> 00:58:26.710
<v Speaker 5>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People donate,</v>

1212
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:28.840
<v Speaker 5>people that really care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>donate a certain amount.</v>

1213
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:32.170
<v Speaker 5>If everybody donates a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be a staggering amount of money</v>

1214
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:33.330
<v Speaker 5>out of 300 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1215
00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1216
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.230
<v Speaker 3>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone to therapy,</v>

1217
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:43.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:44.790
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1219
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 3>there is the public common wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1220
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:52.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people who do pay taxes and they </v>

1221
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.660
<v Speaker 3>should get something back for the taxes </v>
<v Speaker 3>they pay,</v>

1222
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.950
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1223
00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.760
<v Speaker 3>And it should be in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospitals,</v>

1224
00:58:59.761 --> 00:59:01.080
<v Speaker 3>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1225
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.200
<v Speaker 3>clinics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free legal advice.</v>

1226
00:59:04.201 --> 00:59:09.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you pay your fucking taxes </v>

1227
00:59:09.201 --> 00:59:11.121
<v Speaker 3>for healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I get paid for roads and </v>

1228
00:59:11.121 --> 00:59:13.881
<v Speaker 3>other things too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You certainly don't pay your taxes to </v>

1229
00:59:13.881 --> 00:59:14.340
<v Speaker 3>subsidize somebody whose statement from </v>
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

1230
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:15.620
<v Speaker 5>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

1231
00:59:15.621 --> 00:59:20.621
<v Speaker 5>I not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would take it a step further and say </v>

1232
00:59:20.621 --> 00:59:23.410
<v Speaker 5>community centers should be mandatory in</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost community where kids can go with </v>

1233
00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 5>they're protected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they can learn things,</v>

1234
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 5>where they can learn sports and skills </v>
<v Speaker 5>and games and places where they can,</v>

1235
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can educate in inside of communities.</v>

1236
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:37.250
<v Speaker 5>I think that will be just like a gas </v>
<v Speaker 5>station should be a normal part of every</v>

1237
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1238
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 5>any sort of city or town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it should be funded,</v>

1239
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 5>should be funded by the government </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's there to improve kids.</v>

1240
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:50.171
<v Speaker 5>And did there to improve people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but education free as fuck across the </v>

1241
00:59:50.171 --> 00:59:55.061
<v Speaker 5>board,</v>
<v Speaker 5>straight through the university all the </v>

1242
00:59:55.061 --> 00:59:55.061
<v Speaker 5>way to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should pay for that.</v>

1243
00:59:55.061 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 5>We should make it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should make it tough to get into.</v>

1244
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:59.070
<v Speaker 5>You have to work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's fucking free.</v>

1245
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>College education was free in California</v>

1246
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.190
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a first thing.</v>

1247
01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Reagan got rid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1248
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was governor.</v>

1249
01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm not shocked and that should be free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1250
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:13.060
<v Speaker 5>college mean we can't encourage </v>
<v Speaker 5>laziness,</v>

1251
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:18.360
<v Speaker 5>but we can certainly support people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to learn and make it so that it's </v>

1252
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:18.370
<v Speaker 5>less of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1253
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.520
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why good doctors get </v>
<v Speaker 5>so God damn greedy is because they got a</v>

1254
01:00:21.521 --> 01:00:25.390
<v Speaker 5>fucking huge bill behind them from La,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from medical school.</v>

1255
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:28.030
<v Speaker 5>So many people go into by the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're into office,</v>

1256
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.360
<v Speaker 5>they have these giant fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these kids that are</v>

1257
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 3>getting out now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in a big old financial hole.</v>

1258
01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in a whole.</v>

1259
01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 3>And what it means is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is just part of the scam and</v>

1260
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:39.690
<v Speaker 3>all that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as their parents signed,</v>

1261
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where their house is,</v>

1262
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.460
<v Speaker 3>houses away for the education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they come and take the house.</v>

1263
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a big frigging Ponzi scam.</v>

1264
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:49.820
<v Speaker 3>It's the shell game times a million.</v>

1265
01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:54.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's even more of the shell game when </v>

1266
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.271
<v Speaker 5>it's obvious that when you find out that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the banks actually banked on people </v>

1267
01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 5>faulting on their loans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1268
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:01.230
<v Speaker 5>Defaulting people falling apart and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being held their homes repossessed.</v>

1269
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.720
<v Speaker 5>They actually banked on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>profited off of it.</v>

1270
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:07.260
<v Speaker 3>That really pissed me off because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1271
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:08.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1272
01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.350
<v Speaker 3>then what that means is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1273
01:01:10.351 --> 01:01:14.160
<v Speaker 3>what that means in terms of cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real cost,</v>

1274
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.160
<v Speaker 3>not bullshit paper cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but real customer community.</v>

1275
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:20.940
<v Speaker 3>That means a lot more little kids are </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting going to get beaten to death.</v>

1276
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:24.240
<v Speaker 3>And it means a lot more little kids are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get trafficked.</v>

1277
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.410
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1278
01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I do think the poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just putting that on people.</v>

1279
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.230
<v Speaker 3>So you can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1280
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.880
<v Speaker 3>gambier fourth mistress and another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1281
01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1282
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Endangered Species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kate.</v>

1283
01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said she saved the best content in the </v>

1284
01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:45.730
<v Speaker 5>history of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give you a fourth mistress it endangered</v>

1285
01:01:45.731 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 5>species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>K,</v>

1286
01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.840
<v Speaker 5>what kind of Cape would you make?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1287
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:54.950
<v Speaker 5>like a human skulls to stitched all </v>
<v Speaker 5>together as a class when you walk in </v>

1288
01:01:55.891 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 5>virgin blood vials dangling around your </v>
<v Speaker 5>neck with clocks.</v>

1289
01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.220
<v Speaker 5>Tramp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a real baller though.</v>

1290
01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:04.960
<v Speaker 5>If he's got four mistresses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys responded.</v>

1291
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.580
<v Speaker 5>But until you see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1292
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:09.390
<v Speaker 5>like my boyfriend always says whenever </v>
<v Speaker 5>we see a,</v>

1293
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're here in California originally</v>

1294
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.680
<v Speaker 3>a rich old fucker and is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1295
01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:19.200
<v Speaker 3>strip or wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Johnny always says,</v>

1296
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 3>that is</v>

1297
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 4>proof that our currency is sound.</v>

1298
01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:28.520
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proof that our currency is sound.</v>

1299
01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>That was actually very funny,</v>

1300
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.140
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1301
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 4>when you make everything for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1302
01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.880
<v Speaker 4>pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1303
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.480
<v Speaker 4>Money doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think they're such fucking </v>

1304
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 4>geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's how fucking stupid they are.</v>

1305
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 4>But they think they're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Financial Wizards,</v>

1306
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.820
<v Speaker 2>the smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smart guy,</v>

1307
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.940
<v Speaker 2>the money guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money guys.</v>

1308
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so fucking stupid.</v>

1309
01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make everything at a certain point </v>

1310
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.060
<v Speaker 4>it's going to hit a wall and end and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they put that right in there too.</v>

1311
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 4>It can't go on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not sustainable.</v>

1312
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 4>It's going to crash and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking get caught.</v>

1313
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.390
<v Speaker 4>But I think that's what they like </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're so sociopath's.</v>

1314
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 4>They liked the fucking people over parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much.</v>

1315
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just keep denying that there's </v>

1316
01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:24.320
<v Speaker 4>going to be a reckoning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course there is,</v>

1317
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.480
<v Speaker 4>and that's already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking reckoning right now on Wall </v>

1318
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Street and everybody knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody talks about it.</v>

1319
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just what people do.</v>

1320
01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Norton or ordinarily without logic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>

1321
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>without enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do as far as what we do </v>

1322
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.180
<v Speaker 2>as far as the pollution of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment as far as global warming.</v>

1323
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.140
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1324
01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 2>People would not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

1325
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:49.940
<v Speaker 2>because they will factor in the true </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

1326
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the one in the books that you have </v>

1327
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.150
<v Speaker 2>to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1328
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent agreement with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the consequences of </v>

1329
01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 2>their actions or just something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1330
01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll deal with that eventually.</v>

1331
01:03:58.821 --> 01:04:03.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think they're like </v>

1332
01:04:03.821 --> 01:04:03.821
<v Speaker 2>engineering this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of infinite growth.</v>

1333
01:04:03.821 --> 01:04:03.821
<v Speaker 2>Hit the wall.</v>

1334
01:04:03.821 --> 01:04:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1335
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:07.450
<v Speaker 4>and they fuck over like all the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and everything.</v>

1336
01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.920
<v Speaker 4>They fuck over every and then right </v>
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>

1337
01:04:09.921 --> 01:04:14.921
<v Speaker 4>what's the first thing they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start working on the other side of </v>

1338
01:04:14.921 --> 01:04:15.380
<v Speaker 4>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go to Rehab,</v>

1339
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.060
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

1340
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.230
<v Speaker 4>then they come out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1341
01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:20.990
<v Speaker 4>I've been sober for 14 days and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

1342
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I have</v>

1343
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.040
<v Speaker 2>to like say Goddamn fucking is such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocritical.</v>

1344
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And then they go and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work to try to stop corruption.</v>

1345
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.680
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Expose corruption and write books on </v>

1346
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.970
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all like so crazy.</v>

1347
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I think though that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what I'm saying is that I think </v>

1348
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:46.211
<v Speaker 2>people do shit when they think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like why do people smoke </v>

1349
01:04:46.211 --> 01:04:46.940
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the consequences or cancer.</v>

1350
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:50.000
<v Speaker 2>They know they're going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then eventually,</v>

1351
01:04:50.001 --> 01:04:54.230
<v Speaker 2>but the smoke right now is better for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>than not having a smoke.</v>

1352
01:04:54.231 --> 01:04:55.760
<v Speaker 2>So I want to write down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

1353
01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll deal with them later.</v>

1354
01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.940
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a lot of times when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are saying when they're,</v>

1355
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:03.050
<v Speaker 2>when they're creating these sort of laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>that allow them to.</v>

1356
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>The concept of infinite growth doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make any sense.</v>

1357
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:11.061
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only a certain amount of </v>

1358
01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:11.061
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of space on earth.</v>

1359
01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just keep counting numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run out of space.</v>

1360
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is shit is over now.</v>

1361
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.170
<v Speaker 2>As much</v>

1362
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 5>as I can grab that advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what people are doing is just </v>

1363
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.390
<v Speaker 5>doing what people have always done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Acting without that much concern for the</v>

1364
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:28.330
<v Speaker 5>consequences because they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal with the consequences right now.</v>

1365
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:33.660
<v Speaker 5>It's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you get up in the morning and you </v>

1366
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:33.660
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you look at,</v>

1367
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.511
<v Speaker 5>this is a cake from last night that </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks so delicious and it's right next </v>

1368
01:05:36.511 --> 01:05:40.621
<v Speaker 5>to like all your fresh vegetables that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you were thinking about making a hemp </v>

1369
01:05:40.621 --> 01:05:41.080
<v Speaker 5>protein shake with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1370
01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 5>I get a lot of times to go for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cake.</v>

1371
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because fuck it.</v>

1372
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 5>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1373
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 5>I know it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's sugar.</v>

1374
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:49.090
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm going to feel like shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>later,</v>

1375
01:05:49.091 --> 01:05:53.350
<v Speaker 5>but right now I'm going to feel good to </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel good when I eat that red velvet,</v>

1376
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 5>own yummy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yummy,</v>

1377
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 5>yummy.</v>

1378
01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:59.930
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's what these folks are </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that we're not gonna do that.</v>

1379
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:02.430
<v Speaker 5>If your intent is to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1380
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.400
<v Speaker 5>lose two pounds by three days from now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to fuck.</v>

1381
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need adderall.</v>

1382
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.500
<v Speaker 5>But I don't really go for the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty healthy.</v>

1383
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:15.150
<v Speaker 5>But what I'm saying is it's an instinct </v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

1384
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:20.540
<v Speaker 5>well it's a lower instincts based on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peter Principle and all that shit and </v>

1385
01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 5>the peanut peanut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that one penis principles.</v>

1386
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 5>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't think of.</v>

1387
01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.310
<v Speaker 5>Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>

1388
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Is that one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>

1389
01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.530
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it called?</v>

1390
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1391
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.250
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's broken my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I normally have that right there.</v>

1392
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.780
<v Speaker 5>It could with a slight alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Murphy's law,</v>

1393
01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 5>Murphy's law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monsanto could fix murphy's law I was </v>

1394
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.390
<v Speaker 5>using.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be confusing it with Moore's law.</v>

1395
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>

1396
01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:59.970
<v Speaker 5>Monsanto could come up with a chip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a chip or wherever,</v>

1397
01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 5>but you know what they would do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that chip?</v>

1398
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.980
<v Speaker 5>They would just fucking deload your </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain and turn you into a robot.</v>

1399
01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:11.700
<v Speaker 5>That's what they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've already need to be turned into </v>

1400
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:11.700
<v Speaker 5>robot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The NSA came out today.</v>

1401
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.740
<v Speaker 5>There was an article that said the NSA </v>
<v Speaker 5>has 100 percent access to iphones.</v>

1402
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.830
<v Speaker 5>They can look at your camera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>read your texts,</v>

1403
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.410
<v Speaker 5>listened to your microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1404
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.520
<v Speaker 5>keep your microphone on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if your phone is off.</v>

1405
01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 5>Is that a surprise to people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1406
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.090
<v Speaker 5>that 100 percent access?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty fascinating.</v>

1407
01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:33.220
<v Speaker 5>The thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is one of the reasons why our </v>

1408
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.770
<v Speaker 5>podcast sponsors sponsored by Ting </v>
<v Speaker 5>tings,</v>

1409
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 5>a company that uses android phones and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I like to get an android.</v>

1410
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.050
<v Speaker 5>What I like about android phones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1411
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:46.051
<v Speaker 5>you've got an android.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can take the battery out so you can </v>

1412
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.051
<v Speaker 5>shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not saying that the government is really</v>

1413
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:50.431
<v Speaker 5>listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that that's possible that </v>

1414
01:07:50.431 --> 01:07:52.921
<v Speaker 5>anybody can just turn your microphone on</v>
<v Speaker 5>it anytime or turn your camera on at </v>

1415
01:07:52.921 --> 01:07:52.921
<v Speaker 5>anytime.</v>

1416
01:07:52.921 --> 01:07:57.030
<v Speaker 5>To me sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we know that the NSA has that </v>

1417
01:07:57.030 --> 01:08:00.141
<v Speaker 5>capability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have an android phone and you </v>

1418
01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:00.141
<v Speaker 5>just take the battery out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't do that with an iphone.</v>

1419
01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:01.810
<v Speaker 5>I found some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of weird shit about the iphone.</v>

1420
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 5>The memory is all in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't get it out.</v>

1421
01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.220
<v Speaker 5>The fucking the batteries in there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't get it out.</v>

1422
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:10.190
<v Speaker 5>No accidents are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know people are dying.</v>

1423
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:13.600
<v Speaker 5>Making those killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what's hilarious about that?</v>

1424
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 5>I had this conversation with guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying.</v>

1425
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:21.150
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend than not a good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this guy that I know that always </v>

1426
01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:24.641
<v Speaker 5>tries to give me the republican point of</v>
<v Speaker 5>view on things like he's a sensible </v>

1427
01:08:24.641 --> 01:08:27.761
<v Speaker 5>logical guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know we were talking about this factory </v>

1428
01:08:27.761 --> 01:08:28.010
<v Speaker 5>in China where people are jumping off </v>
<v Speaker 5>the roof and he goes,</v>

1429
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:33.011
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know how many people are working </v>

1430
01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:33.011
<v Speaker 5>at that factory?</v>

1431
01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:33.011
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1432
01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:36.401
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just like about half a million people </v>

1433
01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:36.401
<v Speaker 5>or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

1434
01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 5>and if you look at the average </v>
<v Speaker 5>population of a half a million people,</v>

1435
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 5>the amount of suicides is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard.</v>

1436
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1437
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:46.210
<v Speaker 5>but they're killing themselves at work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many fucking people killed </v>

1438
01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:50.071
<v Speaker 5>themselves at work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's not standard is nothing </v>

1439
01:08:50.071 --> 01:08:52.931
<v Speaker 5>standard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous that that concept is </v>

1440
01:08:52.931 --> 01:08:56.260
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Idiot talk or say it's like a fucking a </v>

1441
01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.230
<v Speaker 5>tower of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that don't want </v>

1442
01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:01.230
<v Speaker 5>to be silly though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1443
01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:03.470
<v Speaker 5>They want to be sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

1444
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:07.660
<v Speaker 4>We have enough fact and data now that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can make informed decisions.</v>

1445
01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:11.500
<v Speaker 4>W W we have enough stuff to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>informed intelligence,</v>

1446
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.220
<v Speaker 4>intelligent decisions that work for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1447
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.280
<v Speaker 4>the p for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just the few at the expense of the </v>

1448
01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.330
<v Speaker 4>many but for everyone and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1449
01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.060
<v Speaker 4>that I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1450
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:25.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1451
01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:28.900
<v Speaker 4>we're on our way out and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and dying and over,</v>

1452
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:33.790
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's our Karma to fucking do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it right this time because,</v>

1453
01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:34.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1454
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:36.670
<v Speaker 4>helping each other and such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1455
01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:37.970
<v Speaker 4>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1456
01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:43.350
<v Speaker 4>take a step back from needing so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>and being more into sharing and new </v>

1457
01:09:45.131 --> 01:09:46.740
<v Speaker 4>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new solutions,</v>

1458
01:09:46.741 --> 01:09:51.741
<v Speaker 4>solution based thinking and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a great time for that </v>

1459
01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:55.771
<v Speaker 4>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really evolving into that and </v>

1460
01:09:55.771 --> 01:09:56.740
<v Speaker 4>people can't back away from it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not over.</v>

1461
01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1462
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.020
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1463
01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I do think it's over first humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that when people get that in</v>

1464
01:10:05.531 --> 01:10:10.531
<v Speaker 4>their head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to make them really mutate </v>

1465
01:10:10.531 --> 01:10:10.531
<v Speaker 4>quickly and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1466
01:10:10.531 --> 01:10:15.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I better get right with my maker and </v>

1467
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.900
<v Speaker 4>actually start fucking doing some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit that I know is,</v>

1468
01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right thing to do just because I'm a</v>

1469
01:10:20.231 --> 01:10:22.210
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1470
01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I think that's happening.</v>

1471
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that's happening as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I have hope.</v>

1472
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.580
<v Speaker 5>I think that's evident in what I read </v>
<v Speaker 5>online.</v>

1473
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:33.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean even points that I don't agree </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the extreme left points,</v>

1474
01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:38.451
<v Speaker 5>the extreme progressive positions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which a lot of times I don't take those </v>

1475
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:41.781
<v Speaker 5>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I liked the fact that those </v>

1476
01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:41.781
<v Speaker 5>positions are really public now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1477
01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:43.630
<v Speaker 4>what I like is how the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1478
01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.150
<v Speaker 4>I like how I like to watch it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>

1479
01:10:46.151 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like how the left light goes,</v>

1480
01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:51.580
<v Speaker 4>right for character assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then,</v>

1481
01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:56.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what people do when they've lost </v>

1482
01:10:56.581 --> 01:10:56.581
<v Speaker 4>the argument.</v>

1483
01:10:56.581 --> 01:10:56.581
<v Speaker 5>Add homonyms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1484
01:10:56.581 --> 01:10:56.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1485
01:10:56.931 --> 01:10:58.430
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're good points though.</v>

1486
01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:03.490
<v Speaker 5>It's a good to consider how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone else before you listen to their </v>

1487
01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:06.461
<v Speaker 5>point of view on something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you know that they're kicking babies </v>

1488
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:06.461
<v Speaker 5>in their spare time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably something to pay attention</v>

1489
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what you mean though.</v>

1490
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1491
01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1492
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to say like,</v>

1493
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 4>just because somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1494
01:11:13.651 --> 01:11:18.651
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real thing is that they want the </v>

1495
01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 4>monopoly of definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're after.</v>

1496
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:24.951
<v Speaker 4>That's the real war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want things to mean what they want </v>

1497
01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:28.131
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good try to censor people </v>

1498
01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:28.131
<v Speaker 4>who are saying something else.</v>

1499
01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:29.630
<v Speaker 5>That's a very powerful statement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you said,</v>

1500
01:11:29.631 --> 01:11:31.250
<v Speaker 5>the monopoly of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of definition.</v>

1501
01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:32.360
<v Speaker 5>That's so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so true.</v>

1502
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.490
<v Speaker 5>And I've never</v>

1503
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.600
<v Speaker 4>tried to censor that debate in a free </v>
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>

1504
01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:39.180
<v Speaker 4>We have debate which has more than one </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>

1505
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mindset.</v>

1506
01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm like Monsanto Science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same mental thing and uh,</v>

1507
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:47.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1508
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a rigid ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:51.570
<v Speaker 4>And it makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

1510
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.600
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't apply data and fact as it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't directly apply data and </v>

1511
01:11:56.821 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 4>facts.</v>

1512
01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:02.470
<v Speaker 5>What's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of these people </v>

1513
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:04.511
<v Speaker 5>that are involved in both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's the conservative movement </v>

1514
01:12:04.511 --> 01:12:08.051
<v Speaker 5>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the really progressive movement that </v>

1515
01:12:08.051 --> 01:12:08.120
<v Speaker 5>are really just assholes that want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get heard.</v>

1516
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.980
<v Speaker 5>I really just love giving their opinion </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they love the attention that even if</v>

1517
01:12:12.981 --> 01:12:13.670
<v Speaker 5>they have a point,</v>

1518
01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:16.910
<v Speaker 4>well that's part of MK Ultra mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>

1519
01:12:16.911 --> 01:12:21.911
<v Speaker 4>You say it is what I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many times do you use the word </v>

1520
01:12:21.911 --> 01:12:23.990
<v Speaker 4>binary because that it is a binary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1521
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:28.450
<v Speaker 4>what Mk ultra does is it's like these </v>
<v Speaker 4>two groups there,</v>

1522
01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.630
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1523
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:34.750
<v Speaker 4>they both work for the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They both get paid from the same people,</v>

1524
01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:39.470
<v Speaker 4>the Democrats and the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they do is they use monopoly.</v>

1525
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.950
<v Speaker 4>They tried to monopolize the definition </v>
<v Speaker 4>so they can fundraise.</v>

1526
01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.540
<v Speaker 4>And I say it's like the fundraising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those parties are the fundraising arm of</v>

1527
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.900
<v Speaker 4>the prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>military media,</v>

1528
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.690
<v Speaker 4>wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>industrial complex,</v>

1529
01:12:53.691 --> 01:12:54.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1530
01:12:54.831 --> 01:12:59.831
<v Speaker 4>they just want to confuse people so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people vote against their own better </v>

1531
01:12:59.831 --> 01:13:03.170
<v Speaker 4>judgment and their own best interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's their strategy.</v>

1532
01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:08.171
<v Speaker 4>That's their whole mk alter strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How they get people to stop thinking </v>

1533
01:13:08.931 --> 01:13:13.010
<v Speaker 4>that they deserve an answer and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution for the tax monies they pay.</v>

1534
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:18.250
<v Speaker 4>That is what the tea party was </v>
<v Speaker 4>originally about before it got waylaid </v>

1535
01:13:18.951 --> 01:13:20.870
<v Speaker 4>by punk ass hoes.</v>

1536
01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.900
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that what always happens?</v>

1537
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.040
<v Speaker 5>So occupy Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said at one point in time they </v>

1538
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.720
<v Speaker 5>think that one of the three people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>occupy Wall Street was really like FBI.</v>

1539
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.790
<v Speaker 5>They're really like some undercover </v>
<v Speaker 5>agents.</v>

1540
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.820
<v Speaker 5>They infiltrate and doesn't that happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>with everything that happened with the </v>

1541
01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.091
<v Speaker 5>tea party as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people that thought that the tea </v>

1542
01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:40.091
<v Speaker 5>party was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1543
01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:42.860
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna demand a responsible </v>
<v Speaker 5>government and a government that follows</v>

1544
01:13:42.861 --> 01:13:45.590
<v Speaker 5>the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then all of a sudden these crazy Fox got</v>

1545
01:13:45.591 --> 01:13:50.591
<v Speaker 5>involved in racism and nuttiness yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What better way to diffuse a movement </v>

1546
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:53.210
<v Speaker 5>then to make to marginalize them by </v>
<v Speaker 5>making them look ridiculous?</v>

1547
01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do send in their people and I'm </v>

1548
01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:58.240
<v Speaker 5>always have always will</v>

1549
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.220
<v Speaker 4>monopoly of definition again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is that.</v>

1550
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:04.230
<v Speaker 4>Then they can control their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposition and you know,</v>

1551
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:06.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that works at that work.</v>

1552
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 4>That's how power does it.</v>

1553
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.200
<v Speaker 5>That's what ideologies due to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>monopoly of definition that you </v>

1554
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 5>described,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is such a great phrase again.</v>

1555
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.370
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

1556
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.470
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is the issue with the left.</v>

1557
01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:22.471
<v Speaker 5>That's the issue with the right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the issue with having teams is </v>

1558
01:14:22.471 --> 01:14:25.741
<v Speaker 5>like you decide that this is how we look</v>
<v Speaker 5>at things and how we look at things is </v>

1559
01:14:25.741 --> 01:14:26.380
<v Speaker 5>how they are.</v>

1560
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1561
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.690
<v Speaker 4>the left does it for a certain reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's how they fundraise out of</v>

1562
01:14:30.691 --> 01:14:33.720
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the leather bags,</v>

1563
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.730
<v Speaker 4>like the Democrats begged for money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we need $3 by midnight.</v>

1564
01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.650
<v Speaker 4>Have you gotten those emails are not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of that list.</v>

1565
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:44.960
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1566
01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:47.100
<v Speaker 4>they're begging for money and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Republicans,</v>

1567
01:14:47.101 --> 01:14:49.590
<v Speaker 4>like they begged for money too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they demand it,</v>

1568
01:14:49.591 --> 01:14:54.591
<v Speaker 4>like they have the right to it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>its sovereignty that they're defending </v>

1569
01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:59.150
<v Speaker 4>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're frigging yanking people to get </v>

1570
01:14:59.150 --> 01:14:59.150
<v Speaker 4>their money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all they're doing.</v>

1571
01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They work together.</v>

1572
01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:06.530
<v Speaker 4>They are a system of mind control that </v>
<v Speaker 4>helps them move public money into </v>

1573
01:15:07.261 --> 01:15:10.950
<v Speaker 4>private pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking ridiculous.</v>

1574
01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel sorry for people that they have </v>

1575
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.081
<v Speaker 4>been so manipulated and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time they're losing everything.</v>

1576
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1577
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.680
<v Speaker 5>it's horrible that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

1578
01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:27.140
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a disgusting aspect of human beings</v>

1579
01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 5>and a weird thing where we're tribal </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and I think ultimately we have </v>

1580
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.160
<v Speaker 5>that instinct to be a part of a group </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when people are part of that group,</v>

1581
01:15:34.161 --> 01:15:37.520
<v Speaker 5>you see this group think is so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so prevalent.</v>

1582
01:15:37.521 --> 01:15:40.550
<v Speaker 5>I've had conversations with people about</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1583
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:42.950
<v Speaker 5>I had a conversation with a guy who I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1584
01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.570
<v Speaker 5>before this conversation I respected </v>
<v Speaker 5>them online will about um,</v>

1585
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.240
<v Speaker 5>abortion where the Richard Dawkins it </v>
<v Speaker 5>said that a,</v>

1586
01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:55.241
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fetus inside a woman's body is like </v>

1587
01:15:55.241 --> 01:15:55.430
<v Speaker 5>less human than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1588
01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.930
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than a pig is,</v>

1589
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:59.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go just as human as a peer,</v>

1590
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.840
<v Speaker 5>that Dale Carnegie Book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just a weird.</v>

1591
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:04.280
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird statement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1592
01:16:04.281 --> 01:16:05.120
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took,</v>

1593
01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:05.870
<v Speaker 5>I tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1594
01:16:05.871 --> 01:16:09.590
<v Speaker 5>that's silly because everyone knows that</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fetus can become a human being.</v>

1595
01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.170
<v Speaker 5>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the idea behind the abortion.</v>

1596
01:16:12.171 --> 01:16:17.171
<v Speaker 5>Like you're being very disingenuous if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you pretended the idea behind the </v>

1597
01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:19.130
<v Speaker 5>abortion isn't that what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're stopping a potential human being.</v>

1598
01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.680
<v Speaker 5>A pig is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to stop.</v>

1599
01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.240
<v Speaker 5>It's going to become a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

1600
01:16:23.241 --> 01:16:25.460
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't turn into a carriage or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking pumpkin.</v>

1601
01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a pig of a fetus is a part of a </v>

1602
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 5>person that has nothing to do with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman's right.</v>

1603
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.780
<v Speaker 5>To choose the woman's right to choose as</v>
<v Speaker 5>a completely different time.</v>

1604
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:35.480
<v Speaker 5>So he starts calling me a Republican and</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying like,</v>

1605
01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.580
<v Speaker 5>you know that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't respect.</v>

1606
01:16:37.581 --> 01:16:39.260
<v Speaker 5>Isn't this all about controlling a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman's body?</v>

1607
01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1608
01:16:39.941 --> 01:16:40.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:45.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want you to say what they are </v>

1610
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.050
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

1611
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.050
<v Speaker 4>They had a bunch of fucking.</v>

1612
01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.110
<v Speaker 5>And they want to diffuse anything that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying that might be logical.</v>

1613
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.240
<v Speaker 5>Their economies to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of that.</v>

1614
01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:52.110
<v Speaker 5>It is</v>

1615
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:52.710
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1616
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it.</v>

1617
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:57.730
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to go my way or the highway.</v>

1618
01:16:57.731 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 4>We don't allow you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

1619
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:04.681
<v Speaker 4>it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't allow old women or open their </v>

1620
01:17:04.681 --> 01:17:05.950
<v Speaker 4>fucking mouth and in the general </v>
<v Speaker 4>theater.</v>

1621
01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:07.510
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

1622
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:10.550
<v Speaker 4>That's what it feels like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I just go,</v>

1623
01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:11.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wait a minute,</v>

1624
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

1625
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with this guy that I was talking to,</v>

1626
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:17.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was he was just following the</v>

1627
01:17:17.691 --> 01:17:18.720
<v Speaker 5>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1628
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:23.770
<v Speaker 5>you're always supposed to support a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman's right to choose and you're </v>

1629
01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 5>always supposed to marginalize any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1630
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 5>anything that would point to the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 5>abortion being a bad thing.</v>

1631
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 5>And I'm saying they're not mutually </v>
<v Speaker 5>exclusive.</v>

1632
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.960
<v Speaker 5>Like I think a woman should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll do whatever she wants to do with </v>

1633
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:34.960
<v Speaker 5>our body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't control that,</v>

1634
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.270
<v Speaker 5>but it does get crazy when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about a boarding,</v>

1635
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:38.250
<v Speaker 5>an eight month old fetus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1636
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:40.430
<v Speaker 5>at what point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when does it get crazy?</v>

1637
01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:42.680
<v Speaker 5>It's not crazy when it's a group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cells.</v>

1638
01:17:42.681 --> 01:17:44.270
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're pulling out a group of cells.</v>

1639
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:46.640
<v Speaker 5>Is it crazy ones that big?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it crazy when it's that big?</v>

1640
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.310
<v Speaker 5>Is it crazy one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can exist outside of your body is.</v>

1641
01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know</v>

1642
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.400
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to say that this is not a discussion</v>

1643
01:17:53.401 --> 01:17:54.450
<v Speaker 4>for today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge,</v>

1644
01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.630
<v Speaker 4>a huge subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It needs a lot of debate and you know,</v>

1645
01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:02.631
<v Speaker 4>you have to look at what's being </v>
<v Speaker 4>censored and there's a reason why it's </v>

1646
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:02.631
<v Speaker 4>being censored.</v>

1647
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:07.110
<v Speaker 5>People are uncomfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are also uncomfortable with their </v>

1648
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.110
<v Speaker 5>decision that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1649
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.240
<v Speaker 5>they want to be able to have an </v>
<v Speaker 5>abortion.</v>

1650
01:18:07.241 --> 01:18:08.020
<v Speaker 5>Then if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1651
01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:08.620
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1652
01:18:08.621 --> 01:18:10.590
<v Speaker 5>you're killing a potential human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1653
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:11.090
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1654
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:12.400
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting ringing some cells.</v>

1655
01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At what point in time has it become a </v>

1656
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:17.610
<v Speaker 5>person is that's an actual conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a real conversation to,</v>

1657
01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:20.920
<v Speaker 5>to pretend that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a part of that whole ideology thing.</v>

1658
01:18:20.921 --> 01:18:25.921
<v Speaker 5>It's a part of that thing where people </v>
<v Speaker 5>as your fucking phone going off your </v>

1659
01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:28.220
<v Speaker 5>kids going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mom,</v>

1660
01:18:28.221 --> 01:18:29.350
<v Speaker 5>the CIA's at the house.</v>

1661
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got to say I'm on the radio.</v>

1662
01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:35.980
<v Speaker 4>I'll call you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you okay?</v>

1663
01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1664
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I told him I was going on here anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

1665
01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.580
<v Speaker 4>It tells a fucking stupid and it could </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1666
01:18:50.581 --> 01:18:54.030
<v Speaker 4>It has a simple solution like for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like me,</v>

1667
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:56.880
<v Speaker 4>like we we think different than other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1668
01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 4>but we can see that there's a simple and</v>
<v Speaker 4>much cheaper solution to all of these </v>

1669
01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:02.940
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1670
01:19:02.941 --> 01:19:05.730
<v Speaker 4>if if logic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>data and fact are applied,</v>

1671
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:11.250
<v Speaker 5>I think there are being applied now more</v>
<v Speaker 5>than ever before and that's why I have </v>

1672
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.330
<v Speaker 5>hope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then also I think this idea of teams</v>

1673
01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:16.690
<v Speaker 5>of a Republican left wing Democrat or </v>
<v Speaker 5>Democrat,</v>

1674
01:19:16.691 --> 01:19:21.691
<v Speaker 5>left wing Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right wing that's looking more and more </v>

1675
01:19:21.691 --> 01:19:22.120
<v Speaker 5>silly every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you look at Obama,</v>

1676
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:27.510
<v Speaker 5>there's so many people that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>support Obama and don't say God damn </v>

1677
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:30.271
<v Speaker 5>thing about the shit that he's done in </v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison to the shit that we're on </v>

1678
01:19:30.271 --> 01:19:31.360
<v Speaker 5>Bush about the same stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same stuff,</v>

1679
01:19:31.361 --> 01:19:36.361
<v Speaker 5>and all these liberals have proven to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>massive cowards by not coming out </v>

1680
01:19:36.361 --> 01:19:38.240
<v Speaker 5>against him the way they came out </v>
<v Speaker 5>against Bush on</v>

1681
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.710
<v Speaker 4>million different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They may be.</v>

1682
01:19:41.711 --> 01:19:44.350
<v Speaker 4>You have to look at what happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do that.</v>

1683
01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:48.850
<v Speaker 4>You know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twitter activism as it's called,</v>

1684
01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:54.120
<v Speaker 4>it's just character assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ruined fucking people's lives </v>

1685
01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.190
<v Speaker 4>because their opinion isn't in line with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your sanction opinion that you were paid</v>

1686
01:19:57.191 --> 01:19:59.850
<v Speaker 4>to get out there and lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1687
01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:00.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>

1688
01:20:00.851 --> 01:20:04.600
<v Speaker 4>people's lives are ruined if they stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>up against power.</v>

1689
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:06.220
<v Speaker 4>Let's not forget that.</v>

1690
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1691
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 2>If it's a massive amount of pallets </v>
<v Speaker 2>after whistleblowers.</v>

1692
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Now isn't that fascinating that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his case,</v>

1693
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:19.810
<v Speaker 2>the campaign website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole thing about giving </v>

1694
01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>whistleblowers relief and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and helping them expose injustices and </v>

1695
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:26.910
<v Speaker 2>then they yanked all that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What to say though?</v>

1696
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.030
<v Speaker 2>They knew who they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1697
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.860
<v Speaker 2>What do you think does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that is?</v>

1698
01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that once you get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>office they just,</v>

1699
01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:38.960
<v Speaker 2>they let you know what the real deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk all that shit you want </v>

1700
01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.421
<v Speaker 2>while you're campaigning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you get into office then you </v>

1701
01:20:41.421 --> 01:20:41.421
<v Speaker 2>find out what the fuck's up.</v>

1702
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the system.</v>

1703
01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:50.140
<v Speaker 4>The system is what's corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people are just stuck in the </v>

1704
01:20:50.241 --> 01:20:53.450
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if the system were changed,</v>

1705
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:58.510
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it would have to be changed by the </v>

1706
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:59.750
<v Speaker 4>people and the People's government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people's application of there.</v>

1707
01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Well that would result in accurate </v>
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>

1708
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:05.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the people.</v>

1709
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1710
01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:12.170
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think without that it will continue to</v>

1711
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:17.290
<v Speaker 4>replicate no matter who's there because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's stupid and it doesn't work.</v>

1712
01:21:17.391 --> 01:21:20.810
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking passe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's obsolete as time for fucking,</v>

1713
01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to stop defending what's already fucking</v>

1714
01:21:24.441 --> 01:21:27.950
<v Speaker 4>dead so you can yank people and get them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to send you fucking money.</v>

1715
01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we should just be done with </v>

1716
01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.370
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serious W we don't fucking need money.</v>

1717
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.070
<v Speaker 4>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't need gold either.</v>

1718
01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:42.340
<v Speaker 4>They need water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's make water the new fucking </v>

1719
01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.060
<v Speaker 4>currency or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1720
01:21:43.061 --> 01:21:45.740
<v Speaker 4>let's move away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It ain't that hard.</v>

1721
01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.970
<v Speaker 4>It's not that hard to create a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>just economic money system.</v>

1722
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:54.710
<v Speaker 4>It's still have rich fucking people too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you have rich people have this no</v>

1723
01:21:54.711 --> 01:21:56.480
<v Speaker 4>money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1724
01:21:56.481 --> 01:21:57.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1725
01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.880
<v Speaker 4>you would have other means to create </v>
<v Speaker 4>Commonwealth and so some people would </v>

1726
01:22:06.351 --> 01:22:07.250
<v Speaker 4>accrue more,</v>

1727
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.420
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't about the money when that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be necessarily.</v>

1728
01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree with you that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is fucked and I think that </v>

1729
01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.280
<v Speaker 2>patching it up is like taking a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a windows 95 computer and trying to make</v>

1730
01:22:19.441 --> 01:22:24.441
<v Speaker 2>it work in today's Internet and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>adding a bunch of shit to it and </v>

1731
01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:24.570
<v Speaker 2>tweaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a broken system.</v>

1732
01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Throw it out and get a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're smart enough.</v>

1733
01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We get enough smart fucking people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can put something better together.</v>

1734
01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:35.520
<v Speaker 2>We could do a lot better in a big fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hurry if we shut the fuck up and</v>

1735
01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:39.460
<v Speaker 2>mind our own God damn business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay home once in a while and uh,</v>

1736
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:42.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean up your own back fucking yard.</v>

1737
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the best example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a working government in this,</v>

1738
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:50.410
<v Speaker 2>in this planet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there one country that really stands </v>

1739
01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:50.410
<v Speaker 2>out as really having their shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

1740
01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Norway or Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an Iceland because I'm always </v>

1741
01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.121
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I going to go look </v>

1742
01:22:59.121 --> 01:22:59.121
<v Speaker 2>around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I sign,</v>

1743
01:22:59.121 --> 01:22:59.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because because</v>

1744
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:04.130
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they dumped the Fed and then they </v>

1745
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:08.271
<v Speaker 4>started arresting bankers and doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something different and they got richer </v>

1746
01:23:08.271 --> 01:23:11.651
<v Speaker 4>for doing it because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>imposing a system of dead on people </v>

1747
01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 4>there are doing something smarter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1748
01:23:13.631 --> 01:23:14.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1749
01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I just have hope that that would happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>here because we could,</v>

1750
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 4>we could nationalize the Federal Reserve</v>
<v Speaker 4>and solve,</v>

1751
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.230
<v Speaker 4>solve all our problems was saved the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar.</v>

1752
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 4>But I mean nobody will frigging do it.</v>

1753
01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1754
01:23:26.781 --> 01:23:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you about Iceland as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is also,</v>

1755
01:23:29.451 --> 01:23:32.420
<v Speaker 2>if there's an example of a one country </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can do it,</v>

1756
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:34.820
<v Speaker 2>those are people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a better.</v>

1757
01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a clear example that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your statement is,</v>

1758
01:23:37.881 --> 01:23:42.881
<v Speaker 2>that the system is corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's proof right there because </v>

1759
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:45.971
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing a system that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and the people are benefiting </v>

1760
01:23:45.971 --> 01:23:45.971
<v Speaker 2>from it and it's a healthy society.</v>

1761
01:23:45.971 --> 01:23:48.290
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything will work just fine.</v>

1762
01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.260
<v Speaker 4>Everything knows what it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do already.</v>

1763
01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.480
<v Speaker 4>If you just get the fucking people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1764
01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking it up out of the way.</v>

1765
01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:58.430
<v Speaker 4>And the best way to get them out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1766
01:23:58.431 --> 01:24:03.431
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to remind them that they can rejoin </v>

1767
01:24:03.431 --> 01:24:06.671
<v Speaker 4>the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to be on that other </v>

1768
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:06.671
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1769
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:08.840
<v Speaker 4>in that limbo exile thing that I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>they live in because I've seen it,</v>

1770
01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.890
<v Speaker 4>they can rejoin it and then fucking come</v>
<v Speaker 4>up with a solution that actually works.</v>

1771
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:18.070
<v Speaker 4>It ain't that fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are doing shit like </v>

1772
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.070
<v Speaker 4>grandmas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of this world.</v>

1773
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:21.920
<v Speaker 4>They're fixing their community with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber band and a paperclip.</v>

1774
01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not that fucking hard to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything work.</v>

1775
01:24:24.681 --> 01:24:29.681
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the default position of the universe is </v>

1776
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:30.830
<v Speaker 4>to the positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything fucking already knows what to</v>

1777
01:24:30.831 --> 01:24:32.570
<v Speaker 4>do except for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1778
01:24:32.571 --> 01:24:36.170
<v Speaker 4>criminals at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a small group of criminals at the top.</v>

1779
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a hundred percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that I like in our society </v>

1780
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 2>that have like an alcoholics </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

1781
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.160
<v Speaker 2>someone who's trapped in a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern keeps repeating the same </v>

1782
01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.131
<v Speaker 2>problems over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and driving and know just </v>

1783
01:24:50.131 --> 01:24:53.701
<v Speaker 2>fucking killing their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that probably is how our </v>

1784
01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:57.301
<v Speaker 2>society is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've got addicted to the idea of </v>

1785
01:24:57.301 --> 01:25:00.001
<v Speaker 2>extracting money out of this broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to the point where people are so </v>

1786
01:25:00.001 --> 01:25:01.060
<v Speaker 2>addicted to money and so addicted to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits of having it,</v>

1787
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.650
<v Speaker 2>that they're not willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1788
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:07.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a part of something that's </v>

1789
01:25:07.651 --> 01:25:07.651
<v Speaker 2>ultimately destructive even to me and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my children.</v>

1790
01:25:07.651 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 4>That gambling mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this people think they're.</v>

1791
01:25:10.151 --> 01:25:12.550
<v Speaker 4>If people think they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>something for nothing,</v>

1792
01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:16.110
<v Speaker 4>that's like the greatest frigging drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1793
01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 4>they disguise what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's thinking you're going to get </v>

1794
01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:22.330
<v Speaker 4>more than everybody else.</v>

1795
01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.340
<v Speaker 2>That's so true that they'd love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love getting over,</v>

1796
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.600
<v Speaker 2>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

1797
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:31.630
<v Speaker 2>They love getting over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend that will like try to </v>

1798
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:31.970
<v Speaker 2>get bargains on fucking everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1799
01:25:31.971 --> 01:25:33.290

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1801
01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:38.840
<v Speaker 2>an extra $20 off or something or $5 off </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1802
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Because I like getting over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like getting over.</v>

1803
01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.310

<v Speaker 2>if I can get it for free,</v>

1804
01:25:43.311 --> 01:25:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to get it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people want to get free and they're</v>

1805
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:46.770
<v Speaker 2>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

1806
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:50.360
<v Speaker 2>They want that thrill of figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I got rich.</v>

1807
01:25:50.361 --> 01:25:55.361
<v Speaker 2>So I know firsthand how it works on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how it works on you,</v>

1808
01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1809
01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it works on you.</v>

1810
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.680
<v Speaker 2>It does tell there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1811
01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing left of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a</v>

1812
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.810
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a hard thing.</v>

1813
01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.840
<v Speaker 3>That's hard when you can't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach get no more,</v>

1814
01:26:08.841 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 3>but then you can let go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1815
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to not do that no more.</v>

1816
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:15.820
<v Speaker 5>You was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it hard going from like not having money</v>

1817
01:26:15.821 --> 01:26:20.821
<v Speaker 5>to be in like one of the richest women </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the history of Hollywood over a </v>

1818
01:26:20.821 --> 01:26:22.210
<v Speaker 5>period the world over a period of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>many years?</v>

1819
01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>

1820
01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:29.970
<v Speaker 3>That's insane isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was fucking charging right away.</v>

1821
01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.790
<v Speaker 3>When I first came to La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first night there,</v>

1822
01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.790
<v Speaker 3>like they saw me that I got a TV show </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first night there.</v>

1823
01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Then I got the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I got a Julio Iglesias tour that </v>

1824
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:49.480
<v Speaker 3>was 10 times the money my husband worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Boston office ever made.</v>

1825
01:26:50.050 --> 01:26:50.670
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1826
01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was chaching right from the get go in</v>

1827
01:26:53.561 --> 01:26:54.970
<v Speaker 3>La dream come true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1828
01:26:55.430 --> 01:27:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you were one of the old school </v>

1829
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:02.681
<v Speaker 5>comedy store gangsters till you came up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the era where things were probably </v>

1830
01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 5>one of the most powerful errors in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>history of standup comedy.</v>

1831
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:10.890
<v Speaker 5>If you go back and look at like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>origins from Lenny Bruce Harland,</v>

1832
01:27:10.891 --> 01:27:15.891
<v Speaker 5>to what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your era of the comedy store is one of </v>

1833
01:27:15.891 --> 01:27:15.891
<v Speaker 5>the most powerful areas ever.</v>

1834
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has.</v>

1835
01:27:16.951 --> 01:27:19.020
<v Speaker 3>But there was one that proceeded me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1836
01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.460
<v Speaker 3>that was the one where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1837
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had the strike and all the comics.</v>

1838
01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a like,</v>

1839
01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:27.840
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Steinberg and you know,</v>

1840
01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:30.810
<v Speaker 3>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like in their seventies,</v>

1841
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:33.750
<v Speaker 3>late seventies now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a whole bunch of guys like that.</v>

1842
01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

1843
01:27:34.771 --> 01:27:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm so bad on names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember us.</v>

1844
01:27:36.811 --> 01:27:41.811
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a whole Elayne boosler just a little</v>

1845
01:27:42.451 --> 01:27:43.620
<v Speaker 3>bit before me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1846
01:27:43.621 --> 01:27:45.900
<v Speaker 3>they were the ones that created it broke</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1847
01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they did great work.</v>

1848
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:49.650
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1849
01:27:49.651 --> 01:27:52.830
<v Speaker 5>For folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way La Works is,</v>

1850
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:58.070
<v Speaker 5>for the longest time nobody got paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would go up and you would do spots </v>

1851
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:02.301
<v Speaker 5>and the clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would it be packed every night and the </v>

1852
01:28:02.301 --> 01:28:04.371
<v Speaker 5>comedians will be starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the local ones that are just </v>

1853
01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:04.830
<v Speaker 5>sorta start now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they would be providing,</v>

1854
01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:08.250
<v Speaker 5>providing all this entertainment but not</v>
<v Speaker 5>sharing any of the profit.</v>

1855
01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:13.251
<v Speaker 5>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy clubs weren't willing to </v>

1856
01:28:13.251 --> 01:28:13.251
<v Speaker 5>budge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1857
01:28:13.251 --> 01:28:13.251
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1858
01:28:13.251 --> 01:28:14.910
<v Speaker 5>this is the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a book that is written on it,</v>

1859
01:28:14.911 --> 01:28:19.911
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Irish should fear was reading it </v>

1860
01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:19.911
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it's called.</v>

1861
01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:20.580
<v Speaker 5>See what you find that Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1862
01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.630
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1863
01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:25.200
<v Speaker 5>the strike itself was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was very important and now comedians get</v>

1864
01:28:25.201 --> 01:28:28.680
<v Speaker 5>paid for their sets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of weird that they would think</v>

1865
01:28:28.681 --> 01:28:33.681
<v Speaker 5>that it would be okay to have people </v>
<v Speaker 5>perform and you profit off them </v>

1866
01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:34.320
<v Speaker 5>performing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you keep all the money.</v>

1867
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw that in Denver too.</v>

1868
01:28:36.531 --> 01:28:40.190
<v Speaker 3>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a little club there and everybody</v>

1869
01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:44.060
<v Speaker 3>worked for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the owner's like,</v>

1870
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:48.200
<v Speaker 3>start buying second homes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying up here.</v>

1871
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:50.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the name of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1872
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1873
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:57.610
<v Speaker 3>when you see the owner who's another </v>
<v Speaker 3>comic and he's buying a second house and</v>

1874
01:28:57.681 --> 01:28:58.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1875
01:28:58.161 --> 01:29:03.161
<v Speaker 3>adding on to the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like any still doing time on </v>

1876
01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:03.161
<v Speaker 3>Monday</v>

1877
01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:04.140
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still working in the club,</v>

1878
01:29:04.570 --> 01:29:06.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they think they're doing you some</v>

1879
01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:09.330
<v Speaker 2>good by letting you performed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they said to us.</v>

1880
01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.010
<v Speaker 2>More like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're going to pay.</v>

1881
01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>And because they won in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

1882
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:17.420
<v Speaker 2>So it went all across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went all across the country that,</v>

1883
01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:22.650
<v Speaker 2>that ripple of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea behind is pretty fucking </v>

1884
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:26.151
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know the adjust because the </v>

1885
01:29:26.151 --> 01:29:28.311
<v Speaker 2>comics are benefiting from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're not like that is your whole </v>

1886
01:29:28.311 --> 01:29:31.431
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's profit sharing again and </v>

1887
01:29:31.431 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>commonwealth and all that same stuff at </v>
<v Speaker 2>any club owner that will do,</v>

1888
01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:36.831
<v Speaker 2>that's a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he club owner that wouldn't want to </v>

1889
01:29:36.831 --> 01:29:36.831
<v Speaker 2>compensate the comedians that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing from.</v>

1890
01:29:36.831 --> 01:29:39.420
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to work for free while you have</v>

1891
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 2>your place packed every fucking night.</v>

1892
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.920
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't feel they're going to get</v>

1893
01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.240
<v Speaker 2>a lot out or they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>

1894
01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like all artists in Hollywood </v>

1895
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.430
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean anybody who can put two words </v>

1896
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.430
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1897
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:56.660
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd rather not pay you a dime of </v>

1898
01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:56.850
<v Speaker 2>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>musicians,</v>

1899
01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 2>songwriters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1900
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:01.170
<v Speaker 2>they want to own everything now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got their copyright laws,</v>

1901
01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:03.200
<v Speaker 2>they want on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people do,</v>

1902
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.990
<v Speaker 2>but there's one of the beautiful things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about small clubs that I've always loved</v>

1903
01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:07.840
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1904
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 2>if I'll do like xannies in Nashville or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1905
01:30:10.261 --> 01:30:12.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like the club owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to these places,</v>

1906
01:30:12.451 --> 01:30:14.870
<v Speaker 2>like they actually liked the art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>

1907
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a good exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They enjoy it,</v>

1908
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1909
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:23.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enjoy the idea of having performers </v>

1910
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.470
<v Speaker 2>on the stage and the people have a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and that their business flourishes.</v>

1911
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 2>They're happy to pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1912
01:30:27.331 --> 01:30:32.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of great comics out there </v>

1913
01:30:32.331 --> 01:30:34.281
<v Speaker 2>getting old now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any money and there's a </v>

1914
01:30:34.281 --> 01:30:38.520
<v Speaker 2>bunch of shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave their whole lives for comedy </v>

1915
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:38.980
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't get rich like I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1916
01:30:38.981 --> 01:30:41.360
<v Speaker 2>and a few of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just as you know,</v>

1917
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.770
<v Speaker 2>they're great writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great comics,</v>

1918
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.560
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get broke down by that system,</v>

1919
01:30:46.561 --> 01:30:49.680
<v Speaker 2>like all artists and creative people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1920
01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I think we're a lot of these guys too </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1921
01:30:51.251 --> 01:30:53.290
<v Speaker 2>They're also very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>woe is me as a quote.</v>

1922
01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Quite a few of those guys that never </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out social media,</v>

1923
01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:57.360
<v Speaker 2>they never figured out how to promote </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1924
01:30:57.361 --> 01:30:59.400
<v Speaker 2>They stop writing new material and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1925
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.710
<v Speaker 2>they feel like I've been doing standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 30 years.</v>

1926
01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't sell at a club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1927
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you do?</v>

1928
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:05.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean like what did you do with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

1929
01:31:05.491 --> 01:31:10.491
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of your time did you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually invest in continuing your </v>

1930
01:31:10.491 --> 01:31:13.191
<v Speaker 2>career?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of your time did you actually </v>

1931
01:31:13.191 --> 01:31:13.590
<v Speaker 2>invest in writing and how much did you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just think that it was just due to you?</v>

1932
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Because you've been around for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just due to me.</v>

1933
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 2>You sound like my representatives now.</v>

1941
01:31:37.891 --> 01:31:42.120
<v Speaker 2>this new type of woman stand up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1942
01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Even more powerful than kinison was as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>male standup.</v>

1943
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:51.800
<v Speaker 2>You came along and you had this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>new thing going on and you were a woman </v>

<v Speaker 5>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she likes to stay in her sixties.</v>

1953
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.980
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she likes stand up and uh,</v>

1954
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:20.600
<v Speaker 5>I think she was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost positive it was her,</v>

1955
01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:21.880
<v Speaker 5>but she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta see this woman?</v>

1956
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She made me laugh like no woman has ever</v>

1957
01:32:24.821 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 5>made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that statement,</v>

1958
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:29.780
<v Speaker 5>like it was a different kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she said it that way.</v>

1959
01:32:29.781 --> 01:32:34.781
<v Speaker 5>I mean she was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just trying to say how much he enjoyed </v>

1960
01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:34.781
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was a true statement.</v>

1961
01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:39.211
<v Speaker 5>Like she made you laugh in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you never laughed at a woman comic </v>

1962
01:32:39.211 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 5>before you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you owned it.</v>

1963
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.400
<v Speaker 5>Were a lot of these women who came </v>
<v Speaker 5>before you.</v>

1964
01:32:42.401 --> 01:32:47.401
<v Speaker 5>Although we're very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wanted people to like them and you </v>

1965
01:32:47.401 --> 01:32:49.160
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you guys.</v>

1966
01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I learned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1967
01:32:51.001 --> 01:32:52.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that on stage.</v>

1968
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did learn a lot of it from my dad </v>

1969
01:32:57.830 --> 01:33:00.770
<v Speaker 3>because my dad was just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like one of the funniest ones </v>

1970
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.840
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1971
01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he had to get a job,</v>

1972
01:33:02.761 --> 01:33:03.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he had kids.</v>

1973
01:33:03.901 --> 01:33:05.430
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1974
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:06.860
<v Speaker 3>and he did some funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

1975
01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.980
<v Speaker 3>did you stand up nowhere near the house </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when people called Israel always had</v>

1976
01:33:14.641 --> 01:33:19.641
<v Speaker 3>the mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We lived in Salt Lake in the Mormons </v>

1977
01:33:19.641 --> 01:33:19.710
<v Speaker 3>always came to our house to teach us </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1978
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:23.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book of Mormon and my mom was a nice</v>

1979
01:33:23.851 --> 01:33:28.851
<v Speaker 3>woman so she always let a man and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess you want somebody to talk to or </v>

1980
01:33:28.851 --> 01:33:30.240
<v Speaker 3>whatever it plus they were handsome as </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>

1981
01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:34.170
<v Speaker 3>And my mom's like that pretty girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>

1982
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:37.440
<v Speaker 3>So she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she was 70 she like,</v>

1983
01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:41.310
<v Speaker 3>I can still get a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa man.</v>

1984
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I'm so neurotic because.</v>

1985
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.030
<v Speaker 3>So she would invite a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my dad,</v>

1986
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.940
<v Speaker 3>he didn't like him because he was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist.</v>

1987
01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:55.530
<v Speaker 3>So he used to go down the basement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>scream up a bar.</v>

1988
01:33:55.590 --> 01:34:00.590
<v Speaker 3>The better thing he did was when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock on the door after they'd been </v>

1989
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.590
<v Speaker 3>there a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1990
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Barr in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1991
01:34:02.281 --> 01:34:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Barr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Barr is in jail for 28 days.</v>

1992
01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:14.240
<v Speaker 3>We have nothing to discuss it and we ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids are just wouldn't be pee in our </v>

1993
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:16.240
<v Speaker 3>pants.</v>

1994
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:19.260
<v Speaker 5>So who does do that to fuck with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>to entertain?</v>

1995
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:20.040
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1996
01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:21.690
<v Speaker 5>the heart of a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1997
01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus his lines were pretty good too.</v>

1998
01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was funny.</v>

1999
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:28.280
<v Speaker 3>My whole family was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all slams.</v>

2000
01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Every slamming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

2001
01:34:29.931 --> 01:34:34.931
<v Speaker 3>I got the first slam when I was four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My uncle Sherman was sitting there </v>

2002
01:34:34.931 --> 01:34:38.380
<v Speaker 3>eating my grandma's soup and he always </v>
<v Speaker 3>called her a greenhorn,</v>

2003
01:34:38.490 --> 01:34:41.240
<v Speaker 3>the self care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was an immigrant and so he's like,</v>

2004
01:34:41.241 --> 01:34:46.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in America they don't put an inch of </v>

2005
01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:49.270
<v Speaker 3>chicken fat on top of their soap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like four and I think he's talking</v>

2006
01:34:50.511 --> 01:34:54.920
<v Speaker 3>about by grandma and I really want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>film this too because I felt like wonder</v>

2007
01:34:54.921 --> 01:34:56.870
<v Speaker 3>woman and I knew I was going to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2008
01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:57.960
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

2009
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.870
<v Speaker 2>came to me and I was going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2010
01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:02.990
<v Speaker 2>that thing you get when you a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2011
01:35:02.991 --> 01:35:06.430
<v Speaker 2>then how come you eat two bowls of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2012
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone laughed and he got really </v>

2013
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.960
<v Speaker 2>pissed that I was only four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got pissed.</v>

2014
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:13.880
<v Speaker 2>So then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh boy,</v>

2015
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I can own this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you remember the first time you ever </v>

2016

<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

2018
01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I remember every section you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out of the park and you had the </v>

2019
01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:31.541
<v Speaker 2>feeling that you get when you go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage and you have an idea because he </v>

2020
01:35:31.541 --> 01:35:33.260
<v Speaker 2>was fat and no one could say he was fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't say,</v>

2021
01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:38.261
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a tub or anything like that to </v>

2022
01:35:38.261 --> 01:35:38.550
<v Speaker 2>him because he was sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was a bully.</v>

2023
01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of fat people are bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2024
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.900
<v Speaker 2>they're not all jolly well there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fat people that are uncomfortable,</v>

2025
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2026
01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

2027
01:35:46.071 --> 01:35:47.810
<v Speaker 2>But they're mean and he's the one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2028
01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating too much.</v>

2029
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:55.830
<v Speaker 2>UHM,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was penetrating the shield of </v>

2031
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:04.001
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't tell him he fucking is a big </v>

<v Speaker 2>shield of bullshit.</v>

2035
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:14.600
<v Speaker 2>The bad thing is when you are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me and my dad given it back.</v>

2036
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Then you have kids and they give it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and the God damn it.</v>

2037
01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My kid already gives it to her.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I told her she had to go to bed.</v>

2041
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:31.270
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2042
01:36:31.271 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a job.</v>

2043
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:38.290
<v Speaker 2>She just looked at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was say daddy has to get up in the </v>

2044
01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:38.290
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has a job.</v>

2045
01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:43.241
<v Speaker 2>I got to go to sleep zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I tell her she got to go to </v>

2046
01:36:43.241 --> 01:36:43.241
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

2047
01:36:43.241 --> 01:36:43.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what job being just looking</v>

2048
01:36:43.461 --> 01:36:43.940
<v Speaker 2>at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2049
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh snap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before she was even going to </v>

2050
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:48.970
<v Speaker 2>preschool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was four when she said that,</v>

2051
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I know it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's coming,</v>

2052
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:58.430
<v Speaker 2>but that's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karma and no parent escapes it.</v>

2053
01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be.</v>

2054
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I want her to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want her to have her own opinions and </v>

2055
01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:09.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean the arguing about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>she should have to go to bed is the </v>

2056
01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:13.241
<v Speaker 2>beginning of arguing whether or not she </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have a terrible job arguing </v>

2057
01:37:13.241 --> 01:37:14.860
<v Speaker 2>whether she should have an existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she doesn't enjoy,</v>

2058
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:19.930
<v Speaker 2>whether she should have been in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that you think sucks to </v>

2059
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:20.870
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a good point.</v>

2060
01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2061
01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:25.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I told her go to bed.</v>

2062
01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2063
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I made her watch one more half hour of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Max and Ruby and then go to bed.</v>

2064
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Give her 30 minutes.</v>

2065
01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't tell her that the line deserves</v>
<v Speaker 2>reward because I didn't want her to be </v>

2066
01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:38.510
<v Speaker 2>encouraged to continue it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just had explained it to her.</v>

2067
01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:43.511
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important when you're young to </v>

2068
01:37:43.511 --> 01:37:43.511
<v Speaker 2>get your sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2069
01:37:43.511 --> 01:37:44.360
<v Speaker 2>because you're a growing organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2070
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:49.430
<v Speaker 2>so I tried to explain like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed her some pictures when she was a </v>

2071
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.430
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2072
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:50.480
<v Speaker 2>you see what you look like now or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't look like that anymore.</v>

2073
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:55.510
<v Speaker 2>That's all from sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sleep turns you from a baby into </v>

2074
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>this four year old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Talk to me.</v>

2075
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:56.850
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2076
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2077
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's thinking and it's learning.</v>

2078
01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:01.680
<v Speaker 2>That's all important too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sleep is big.</v>

2079
01:38:01.681 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2080
01:38:03.031 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to hurt you if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch one more show.</v>

2081
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:07.180
<v Speaker 2>So we'll watch one more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Dad.</v>

2082
01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so important that girls have a good</v>

2083
01:38:09.871 --> 01:38:12.960
<v Speaker 2>dad that they can talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girls need that more.</v>

2084
01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 2>More than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2085
01:38:14.671 --> 01:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's important for God to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good mom.</v>

2086
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:19.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something funny.</v>

2087
01:38:19.831 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 2>My Dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2088
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 2>we are Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2089
01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 2>in Salt Lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2090
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come Santa doesn't come to our </v>

2091
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.910
<v Speaker 2>house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2092
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I was about eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe six.</v>

2093
01:38:31.951 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 2>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come it doesn't come over our house?</v>

2094
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Because Santa is an antisemite.</v>

2095
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.420
<v Speaker 2>It was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible thing for a kid to hear.</v>

2096
01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You already knew you enjoyed it.</v>

2097
01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:54.180
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are raised to be a comic essentially.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He told me,</v>

2106
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.210
<v Speaker 2>he broke it all down for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2107
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:16.860
<v Speaker 2>this guy is actively resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy has a resistor.</v>

2108
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:18.590
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a,</v>

2113
01:39:31.351 --> 01:39:33.750

<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2114
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:38.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want it to be a comic because you </v>

2115
01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:38.770
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be the fucking government</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually thought that was good.</v>

2116
01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:41.430
<v Speaker 2>The opposite side when you've got these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are getting arrested because</v>

2117
01:39:41.431 --> 01:39:43.980
<v Speaker 2>they went to a meeting and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about socialism.</v>

2118
01:39:43.981 --> 01:39:46.890
<v Speaker 2>So they're getting arrested and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting blacklisted from Hollywood.</v>

2119
01:39:46.891 --> 01:39:50.400
<v Speaker 2>They getting their fucking jobs taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from them for going to meetings and</v>

2120
01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:55.401
<v Speaker 2>talking to people about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That blacklisting thing and the left </v>

2121
01:39:57.541 --> 01:40:02.541
<v Speaker 2>joins in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'll notice that the left joins in </v>

2122
01:40:02.541 --> 01:40:02.541
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2123
01:40:02.541 --> 01:40:04.210

<v Speaker 2>coming after him.</v>

2124
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:09.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Times that they've come after me </v>

2125
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:11.301
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't understand a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times I've said stupid things and uh,</v>

2126
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2127
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:15.300
<v Speaker 2>You don't get into it.</v>

2128
01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Why would I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as an example.</v>

2129
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:19.530
<v Speaker 2>So if people don't know that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this,</v>

2130
01:40:19.531 --> 01:40:20.950

2132
01:40:23.281 --> 01:40:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in a fight with the transgenders,</v>

2133
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:29.000
<v Speaker 2>the transgenders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it about all of them?</v>

2134
01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of them are,</v>

2135
01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:35.250
<v Speaker 2>are Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful people.</v>

2136
01:40:35.251 --> 01:40:37.620
<v Speaker 2>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know a lot of them,</v>

2137
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:39.870
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assholes are in every group.</v>

2138
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 2>What you were talking about tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's no family.</v>

2139
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Say when they pervert tribalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what they do too.</v>

2140
01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:49.980
<v Speaker 2>They make him defend everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

2141
01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's not good because you're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator right</v>

2142
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.000
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2143
01:40:55.170 --> 01:40:57.940
<v Speaker 4>The Predator is the one every group </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be against.</v>

2144
01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 4>It is time to read every community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every type,</v>

2145
01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:06.810
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every street of predators who liked aid </v>

2146
01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:10.770
<v Speaker 4>people taking people's money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking public money and putting it in </v>

2147
01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:10.930
<v Speaker 4>private pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2148
01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:11.820
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

2149
01:41:11.821 --> 01:41:15.270
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent is saying that all </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have this nationality,</v>

2150
01:41:15.271 --> 01:41:17.490
<v Speaker 5>those are my people or all people with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this gender.</v>

2151
01:41:17.491 --> 01:41:20.760
<v Speaker 5>Those are my people or all people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are transgender are my people.</v>

2152
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 5>It's all equally ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got households in their </v>

2153
01:41:26.050 --> 01:41:26.930
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just be anti asshole would be.</v>

2154
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:32.070
<v Speaker 5>I could not agree more and that has </v>
<v Speaker 5>always been my problem with the idea of </v>

2155
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.070
<v Speaker 5>feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2156
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:36.720
<v Speaker 5>like I'm 100 percent for equality for </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that we should look down on </v>

2157
01:41:37.171 --> 01:41:42.171
<v Speaker 5>men who were abusing women the same way </v>
<v Speaker 5>we look down on women abusing men the </v>

2158
01:41:42.171 --> 01:41:45.690
<v Speaker 5>same way we look at men abusing men the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same way we look at women abusing women.</v>

2159
01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:49.320
<v Speaker 5>It's a gross thing that humans do where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they victimize each other.</v>

2160
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:54.330
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there should be one fucking way to </v>

2161
01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:56.991
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One law for everybody that gets rid of </v>

2162
01:41:56.991 --> 01:41:56.991
<v Speaker 4>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of that shit.</v>

01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:42.151
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Milwaukee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't give a fuck about being from </v>

2182
01:42:42.151 --> 01:42:45.151
<v Speaker 4>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a statement that a person in </v>

2183
01:42:45.151 --> 01:42:48.991
<v Speaker 4>Milwaukee is likely to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you bring up Chicago Patrick </v>

2184
01:42:48.991 --> 01:42:49.660
<v Speaker 4>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2185
01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.530
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a natural thing.</v>

2186
01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.400
<v Speaker 4>It's being taught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to agree with you.</v>

2187
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:59.800
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do have hope?</v>

2188
01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a different kind of hope </v>

2189
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:05.920
<v Speaker 4>because my hopes based on my helping </v>
<v Speaker 4>other human beings.</v>

2190
01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.510
<v Speaker 4>So as is mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as his mom,</v>

2191
01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't have like any umbrella fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hope that the right thing is going to </v>

2192
01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.080
<v Speaker 4>happen as people are fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they are.</v>

2193
01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:17.740
<v Speaker 4>They're stupid in their followers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are too busy to think,</v>

2194
01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:19.960
<v Speaker 4>but they're also beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant.</v>

2195
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.080
<v Speaker 4>The reason why we're having this </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation at all is because someone </v>

2196
01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.481
<v Speaker 4>figured out a way to put all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>electronics shit into this tube that's </v>

2197
01:43:27.481 --> 01:43:30.940
<v Speaker 4>only like six inches long and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to this wire that's attached to</v>

2198
01:43:30.941 --> 01:43:35.941
<v Speaker 4>a fucking computer as a distribution </v>
<v Speaker 4>vehicle for information than I would </v>

2199
01:43:37.921 --> 01:43:39.090
<v Speaker 4>have never been able to figure out on </v>
<v Speaker 4>my.</v>

2200
01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:40.060
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2201
01:43:40.061 --> 01:43:42.040
<v Speaker 4>I want to say you're changing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject.</v>

2202
01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:47.220
<v Speaker 4>I want to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that people are fucked </v>

2203
01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.460
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that they have,</v>

2204
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:51.340
<v Speaker 4>that they are a slave to their worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>impulses.</v>

2205
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some are more,</v>

2206
01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.320
<v Speaker 4>but I think the majority of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>not like that.</v>

2207
01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.950
<v Speaker 4>I think the majority of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually good,</v>

2208
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:06.010
<v Speaker 4>but they are for people kept away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the seats of power and if we could just </v>

2209
01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:08.240
<v Speaker 4>get one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them somewhere,</v>

2210
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:11.000
<v Speaker 4>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yemen,</v>

2211
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:15.430
<v Speaker 4>anywhere one of them will will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will change it.</v>

2212
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just one intelligent person.</v>

2213
01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:19.590
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2214
01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I think one intelligent person can reach</v>
<v Speaker 4>all intelligence,</v>

2215
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:28.310
<v Speaker 4>even in the greediest lowest a backward </v>
<v Speaker 4>bastard on earth.</v>

2216
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I think you're 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that that noise is going to</v>

2217
01:44:30.961 --> 01:44:32.580
<v Speaker 2>drive people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

2218
01:44:32.610 --> 01:44:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Is that you banging on this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone next door to someone next door.</v>

2219
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:41.660
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making something that's loud as </v>

2220
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.550
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably are listening to the </v>

2221
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:47.470
<v Speaker 2>podcast and they hate me banging on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>door because they know it's next door.</v>

2222
01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:49.380
<v Speaker 2>They have cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a CIA,</v>

2223
01:44:49.381 --> 01:44:54.381
<v Speaker 2>setting up a listening station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many good people there are in our </v>

2224
01:44:54.381 --> 01:44:58.520
<v Speaker 2>government and people report this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say this to people.</v>

2225
01:44:58.530 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 2>They do report to me that there,</v>

2226
01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:05.710
<v Speaker 4>there are good people everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's good people in our </v>

2227
01:45:05.710 --> 01:45:10.091
<v Speaker 4>government and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now they're proving that because </v>

2228
01:45:10.311 --> 01:45:13.850
<v Speaker 4>of they had solutions that made common </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense to people.</v>

2229
01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:19.060
<v Speaker 4>They're being promoted and getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>closer to a logical seats of power.</v>

2230
01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:21.800
<v Speaker 4>So I think that</v>

2231
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:26.980
<v Speaker 2>good to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think that this is what I was </v>

2232
01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:26.980
<v Speaker 2>saying when I did the Internet and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2233
01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:31.890
<v Speaker 2>the transparency of information that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have today is going to sort of reinforce</v>

2234
01:45:32.151 --> 01:45:34.250
<v Speaker 2>those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to represent people,</v>

2235
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.670
<v Speaker 2>you have to represent them in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits the people and that's possible.</v>

2236
01:45:37.671 --> 01:45:39.770
<v Speaker 2>It's possible to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2237
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:41.510
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're both on the same page.</v>

2238
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Just a little more extreme than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2239
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Chem trails and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mk Ultra and aliens.</v>

2240
01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:54.630
<v Speaker 2>That's where you draw the line I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there might be row.</v>

2241
01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I think there might be robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the news might all be </v>

2242
01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.600
<v Speaker 2>manufactured outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty sure in a studio.</v>

2243
01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they probably have lookalikes </v>

2244
01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:07.650
<v Speaker 2>playing the party.</v>

2245
01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Did you see wag the dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2246
01:46:09.651 --> 01:46:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2247
01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.290
<v Speaker 2>And that was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2248
01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.560
<v Speaker 2>before they had the kind of CGI that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have today.</v>

2249
01:46:16.090 --> 01:46:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're definitely fake some </v>

2250
01:46:21.090 --> 01:46:22.541
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CIA printed in the paper during the </v>

2251
01:46:22.541 --> 01:46:23.330
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the Iraq invasion that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to release fake stories.</v>

2252
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It was on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to release fake stories </v>

2253
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:28.480
<v Speaker 2>for the good of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2254
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the troops or whatever the fuck it was,</v>

2255
01:46:29.121 --> 01:46:34.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's it when you're admitting </v>

2256
01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:34.160
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying their records,</v>

2257
01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:39.670
<v Speaker 2>that's what people who believe the tower</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven thing was the tower seven </v>

2258
01:46:39.670 --> 01:46:43.630
<v Speaker 2>confusion or I'm a conspiracy rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there was so much evidence </v>

2259
01:46:44.121 --> 01:46:49.121
<v Speaker 2>inside that building that could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked them bank stuff and Ron and ron </v>

2260
01:46:49.121 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>stuff and it was the</v>

2261
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 5>CIA had offices in that building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The NSA had offices in that building.</v>

2262
01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.820
<v Speaker 5>That building was a crazy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>building of information and shit.</v>

2263
01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.740
<v Speaker 5>That was the black male center maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck it was,</v>

2264
01:47:01.770 --> 01:47:05.960
<v Speaker 5>but I know that that building imploded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucky it was detonated those,</v>

2265
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.100
<v Speaker 5>those other two buildings to me look </v>
<v Speaker 5>like buildings.</v>

2266
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:13.101
<v Speaker 5>I got hit by a plane and horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>structural damage and everything fell </v>

2267
01:47:13.101 --> 01:47:13.740
<v Speaker 5>because they failed the way something </v>
<v Speaker 5>would fall.</v>

2268
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:18.770
<v Speaker 5>It was collapsing and falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That tower seven thing felt like it was </v>

2269
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 5>a controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2270
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:24.770
<v Speaker 5>obviously I'm not an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nor I'm an architect or a construction </v>

2271
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:28.371
<v Speaker 5>expert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know if a fire could make a </v>

2272
01:47:28.371 --> 01:47:29.760
<v Speaker 5>building do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be able to because look,</v>

2273
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:31.720
<v Speaker 5>the things or weird things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

2274
01:47:31.721 --> 01:47:34.050
<v Speaker 5>It's weird to be able to detonate a </v>
<v Speaker 5>building in the first place.</v>

2275
01:47:34.051 --> 01:47:35.960
<v Speaker 5>It's weird when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2276
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:41.060
<v Speaker 5>sometimes shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes things don't go the way you </v>

2277
01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:41.570
<v Speaker 5>would think they would go through lack </v>
<v Speaker 5>of management.</v>

2278
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:46.330
<v Speaker 4>There is a of what they think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like people are swimming in theory.</v>

2279
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2280
01:47:46.931 --> 01:47:48.490
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so.</v>

2281
01:47:48.491 --> 01:47:53.491
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also so enticing to believe that </v>

2282
01:47:53.491 --> 01:47:56.331
<v Speaker 5>tower seven was the place where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were holding all this information and </v>

2283
01:47:56.331 --> 01:47:57.280
<v Speaker 5>they detonated in front of everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes on television.</v>

2284
01:47:57.281 --> 01:47:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got away with it because it's,</v>

2285
01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:04.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you were inclined to lean towards </v>

2286
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:04.890
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be one of the possibilities.</v>

2287
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 5>The reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2288
01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.830
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what I got out of it.</v>

2289
01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:09.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well get here.</v>

2290
01:48:09.211 --> 01:48:10.610
<v Speaker 4>We can watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get to watch it fall.</v>

2291
01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get that five seconds.</v>

2292
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:16.330
<v Speaker 5>Watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Play that,</v>

2293
01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:17.880
<v Speaker 5>play that again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>

2294
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.510
<v Speaker 5>it's anybody that says it's not weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is hilarious.</v>

2295
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Office is that seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

2296
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:29.331
<v Speaker 5>it's free fall speed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the things that they did </v>

2297
01:48:29.331 --> 01:48:29.490
<v Speaker 5>prove and they tried to argue it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is hilarious.</v>

2298
01:48:29.491 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 5>The nist guys tried to argue that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't free fall speed.</v>

2299
01:48:32.701 --> 01:48:33.780
<v Speaker 5>They tried to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2300
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:36.040
<v Speaker 5>it was like a second slower than free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>False.</v>

2301
01:48:36.041 --> 01:48:38.700
<v Speaker 5>Be like you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>collapse of a building.</v>

2302
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Like even if it's a second flow is </v>
<v Speaker 5>slower than free fall speed.</v>

2303
01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:47.090
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That thing just imploded into its own </v>

2304
01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:48.450
<v Speaker 5>base.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch it one more time.</v>

2305
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.010
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>look how it does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody that doesn't think that's nuts.</v>

2307
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:53.570
<v Speaker 5>Your nut.</v>

2308
01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.680
<v Speaker 4>That's the set there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how when they go like this on </v>

2309
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:00.040
<v Speaker 4>the side and they take it down?</v>

2310
01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2312
01:49:02.651 --> 01:49:07.651
<v Speaker 5>the set and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a screen or a stage for a play </v>

2313
01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:07.651
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2314
01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:10.020
<v Speaker 4>except for the people who survived on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the streets.</v>

2315
01:49:10.021 --> 01:49:13.320
<v Speaker 4>The horror of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really what it was about.</v>

2316
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:18.350
<v Speaker 4>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also the thing I knew it was the </v>

2317
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:20.871
<v Speaker 4>fucking end of the world when I say that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was like I couldn't believe </v>

2318
01:49:20.871 --> 01:49:25.131
<v Speaker 4>it because all these guys in suits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were lined up on the sides of the </v>

2319
01:49:26.371 --> 01:49:31.371
<v Speaker 4>roads and they were applauding for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>firemen and the workers who do the </v>

2320
01:49:31.371 --> 01:49:34.410
<v Speaker 4>actual work and they were like handing </v>
<v Speaker 4>them water and I went,</v>

2321
01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:39.440
<v Speaker 4>this is the fucking end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans are actually like applauding </v>

2322
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.181
<v Speaker 4>the way things actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys in the suits or actually </v>

2323
01:49:44.181 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 4>applauding the first responders and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2324
01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:48.090
<v Speaker 4>I thought this has got</v>

2325
01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the hand of the bullshit.</v>

2326
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Met the touch,</v>

2327
01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:56.350
<v Speaker 3>you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they say meets the road?</v>

2328
01:49:57.190 --> 01:50:00.100
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember those days?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like right after nine slash 11.</v>

2329
01:50:00.650 --> 01:50:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2330
01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:04.530
<v Speaker 5>Those are crazy days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a weird feeling in the air,</v>

2331
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:05.380
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like.</v>

2332
01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:08.530
<v Speaker 5>It was also a weird comradery between </v>
<v Speaker 5>Americans.</v>

2333
01:50:08.531 --> 01:50:13.531
<v Speaker 5>Like everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody had American flags on their </v>

2334
01:50:13.531 --> 01:50:13.531
<v Speaker 5>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was nuts,</v>

2335
01:50:13.531 --> 01:50:17.470
<v Speaker 3>but it was for the right stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At first it was like they were taking </v>

2336
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:19.370
<v Speaker 3>know they were bringing water and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were bringing supplies and it was like,</v>

2337
01:50:19.371 --> 01:50:21.470
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going.</v>

2338
01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:26.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like really amazing because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're going to win out of goodness </v>

2339
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:29.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how it felt then.</v>

2340
01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:31.220
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2341
01:50:31.230 --> 01:50:36.230
<v Speaker 3>that people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were so good and they were so </v>

2342
01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:39.710
<v Speaker 3>caring and they were coming together </v>
<v Speaker 3>against a common foe.</v>

2343
01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.800
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2345
01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:46.810
<v Speaker 5>the love of the first responders to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a big thing when I was in New </v>

2346
01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:50.480
<v Speaker 5>York in 2002 and I couldn't believe how </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice people were being the cops and </v>

2347
01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:53.130
<v Speaker 5>firemen like yelling out to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waving to him,</v>

2348
01:50:53.131 --> 01:50:55.680
<v Speaker 5>honking their horns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying we love you.</v>

2349
01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:57.000
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was crazy.</v>

2350
01:50:57.001 --> 01:51:00.450
<v Speaker 5>It was like you could feel the tangible </v>
<v Speaker 5>result of them realizing like,</v>

2351
01:51:00.451 --> 01:51:02.860
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're in a situation where we were,</v>

2352
01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:07.940
<v Speaker 5>we got attacked like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and these are the people that saved </v>

2353
01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.551
<v Speaker 5>people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this weird feeling of mortality </v>

2354
01:51:10.551 --> 01:51:10.551
<v Speaker 5>now and a real risk</v>

2355
01:51:10.551 --> 01:51:12.190
<v Speaker 3>New York when I was driving down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

2356
01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.410
<v Speaker 3>because I'm always watching people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2357
01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:19.860
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was watching people walking down the </v>

2358
01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:19.860
<v Speaker 3>street after that for quite some time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe six months,</v>

2359
01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:24.780
<v Speaker 3>a few times I checked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were actually making eye contact </v>

2360
01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:28.000
<v Speaker 3>with other people and smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like a few years later,</v>

2361
01:51:28.001 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the Bush,</v>

2362
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:34.470
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were back to just the looking </v>

2363
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.840
<v Speaker 3>straight down thing and avoiding eye </v>
<v Speaker 3>contact.</v>

2364
01:51:35.110 --> 01:51:36.040
<v Speaker 3>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2365
01:51:36.041 --> 01:51:41.041
<v Speaker 3>that was a mind meld going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a positive love mindmeld </v>

2366
01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:42.160
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2367
01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It only lasted for a little while.</v>

2368
01:51:43.581 --> 01:51:44.900
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long did it last?</v>

2369
01:51:44.901 --> 01:51:45.620
<v Speaker 5>Last few years</v>

2370
01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.430
<v Speaker 3>lasted until Bush got up there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2371
01:51:48.431 --> 01:51:50.130
<v Speaker 3>what did that act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2372
01:51:50.131 --> 01:51:52.140
<v Speaker 3>that sketch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2373
01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.730
<v Speaker 3>One where he went on the boat.</v>

2374
01:51:54.210 --> 01:51:55.710
<v Speaker 5>Mission accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:58.370
<v Speaker 5>I think people also realize that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a,</v>

2376
01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:02.460
<v Speaker 5>that the powers that be had capitalized </v>
<v Speaker 5>on all this,</v>

2377
01:52:03.210 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2378
01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:07.230
<v Speaker 5>this sort of patriotism and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2379
01:52:07.231 --> 01:52:10.840
<v Speaker 5>there's this enthusiasm and America had </v>
<v Speaker 5>for revenge and</v>

2380
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:13.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing they cut the benefits of the</v>

2381
01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.800
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2382
01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:18.410
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I thought,</v>

2383
01:52:18.411 --> 01:52:20.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last did Wall Street and do it,</v>

2384
01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:21.170
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>

2385
01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:26.570
<v Speaker 5>But nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that nine slash 11 more likely </v>

2386
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:28.770
<v Speaker 5>than not was the result of a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrorists that attacked America.</v>

2387
01:52:29.010 --> 01:52:34.010
<v Speaker 5>And why did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most likely because of what America has </v>

2388
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.010
<v Speaker 5>been doing overseas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2389
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:35.640
<v Speaker 5>we create enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We do it from the beginning.</v>

2390
01:52:35.770 --> 01:52:37.350
<v Speaker 5>We've done it from the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2391
01:52:37.410 --> 01:52:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Every nation that's been in power has </v>
<v Speaker 5>always tried to steal the natural </v>

2392
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:42.820
<v Speaker 5>resources of other nations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As A.</v>

2393
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 5>I've always tried to influence the </v>
<v Speaker 5>governments of other nations and there's</v>

2394
01:52:45.771 --> 01:52:47.510
<v Speaker 5>a blowback from that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2395
01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:52.520
<v Speaker 5>the people think that they know that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most embarrassing and I'm in </v>

2396
01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 5>enraging thing about what the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 5>administration,</v>

2397
01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.920
<v Speaker 5>the way they would flavor it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hate us for our freedom.</v>

2398
01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:01.330
<v Speaker 5>But he actually said that on TV once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They hate us for our freedom.</v>

2399
01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.630
<v Speaker 5>But who is he talking to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You talking about the terrorists?</v>

2400
01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:09.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talking to the people he </v>

2401
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:09.020
<v Speaker 4>represents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are they investor classes?</v>

2402
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:12.780
<v Speaker 4>He said it himself and they and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>do hate their freedom because it's their</v>

2403
01:53:12.781 --> 01:53:14.130
<v Speaker 4>freedom to be predators.</v>

2404
01:53:14.210 --> 01:53:16.240
<v Speaker 5>I think he was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to.</v>

2405
01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:19.410
<v Speaker 5>I think he was talking to the duck </v>
<v Speaker 5>dynasty fans are fucking stupid and they</v>

2406
01:53:19.411 --> 01:53:24.411
<v Speaker 5>were Rah Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they didn't want to put any thought </v>

2407
01:53:24.411 --> 01:53:24.411
<v Speaker 5>to it though he hate us for our freedom </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>

2408
01:53:24.411 --> 01:53:27.470
<v Speaker 5>let's go get some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he was doing.</v>

2409
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:32.471
<v Speaker 5>I think he was just patronizing </v>
<v Speaker 5>knuckleheads and that this idea that </v>

2410
01:53:32.811 --> 01:53:37.811
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another people wouldn't like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people are having a good time </v>

2411
01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:37.811
<v Speaker 5>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're willing to kill themselves by</v>

2412
01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:39.750
<v Speaker 5>flying fucking planes into buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2413
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.610
<v Speaker 5>it's insulting.</v>

2414
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's one way of looking at it.</v>

2415
01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard a lot of opinion,</v>

2416
01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:48.590
<v Speaker 4>another band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

2417
01:53:48.591 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now what has happened all over the world</v>

2418
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:54.420
<v Speaker 4>is now happening in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2419
01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of that.</v>

2420
01:53:56.421 --> 01:53:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Or people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2421
01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2422
01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:03.170
<v Speaker 4>this can't happen here or anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2423
01:54:03.171 --> 01:54:08.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got to go win over there so they </v>

2424
01:54:08.171 --> 01:54:08.171
<v Speaker 4>don't come here</v>

2425
01:54:08.171 --> 01:54:11.180
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a weird feeling that people </v>

2426
01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:13.611
<v Speaker 5>have years later after the fact that not</v>
<v Speaker 5>only have we not capitalized on the </v>

2427
01:54:13.611 --> 01:54:15.890
<v Speaker 5>situation and used it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2428
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.900
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the potential to sort of rectify some</v>

2429
01:54:18.901 --> 01:54:23.901
<v Speaker 5>of the problems that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But instead we ruined the way the rest </v>

2430
01:54:23.901 --> 01:54:25.740
<v Speaker 5>of the world looks at America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We destroyed all the goodwill,</v>

2431
01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:30.860
<v Speaker 5>all the praise and happiness that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>had for America responding to this </v>

2432
01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:34.311
<v Speaker 5>horrible tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the love that people had sent to </v>

2433
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:34.620
<v Speaker 5>America from all across the world within</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2434
01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:36.720
<v Speaker 5>six years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>America to become the Great Satan again.</v>

2435
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:42.040
<v Speaker 5>Half the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They squandered a squad they don't </v>

2436
01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:42.040
<v Speaker 5>under.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They capitalized on it.</v>

2437
01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 5>That's the big thing to capitalize on </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2438
01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:46.150
<v Speaker 4>They get their money off the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2439
01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.170
<v Speaker 4>and then they let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sell the weapons,</v>

2440
01:54:49.171 --> 01:54:52.140
<v Speaker 4>they get their money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not around when the war start,</v>

2441
01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.500
<v Speaker 4>when we go back and have to get smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hip to that shit and just go,</v>

2442
01:54:55.501 --> 01:55:00.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna you know what we're </v>

2443
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:01.911
<v Speaker 4>gonna do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna do what we did after nine </v>

2444
01:55:01.911 --> 01:55:04.161
<v Speaker 4>slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to like do the right thing </v>

2445
01:55:04.161 --> 01:55:07.110
<v Speaker 4>and the good thing for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to do what you fucking,</v>

2446
01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to be tools in your </v>

2447
01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:15.711
<v Speaker 4>useless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obsolete wars where you make the stock </v>

2448
01:55:15.711 --> 01:55:19.140
<v Speaker 4>markets go up because poverty increased </v>
<v Speaker 4>amongst workers in the world.</v>

2449
01:55:19.710 --> 01:55:23.790
<v Speaker 4>That's not gonna happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's slowly happening.</v>

2450
01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:24.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

2451
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:27.140
<v Speaker 4>So you agree everything's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do agree,</v>

2452
01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:30.570
<v Speaker 4>but I also agree and my daughter says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh mother,</v>

2453
01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 4>just because you are getting old enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>to die doesn't mean that any tire world </v>

2454
01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.291
<v Speaker 4>as a die with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what baby boomers think because </v>

2455
01:55:39.291 --> 01:55:40.680
<v Speaker 4>you guys are so fucking narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only have we run the world and blah,</v>

2456
01:55:40.681 --> 01:55:42.450
<v Speaker 4>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2457
01:55:42.451 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 4>maybe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's because I'm</v>

2458
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.740
<v Speaker 2>getting old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a boy.</v>

2459
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see a big fucking dent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bullshit and machine this bullshit </v>

2460
01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:52.290
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've already had a big dent.</v>

2461
01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:55.110
<v Speaker 2>We just haven't realized it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I was going to say is that</v>

2462
01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:59.850
<v Speaker 2>in when we look back in history and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the Iraq war and thing,</v>

2463
01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:02.790
<v Speaker 2>they find out that a guy who's a ceo of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton,</v>

2464
01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:05.730
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another got to be the vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the United States.</v>

2465
01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:10.350
<v Speaker 2>We went into a war under dubious </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretenses that there are some weapons of</v>

2466
01:56:10.351 --> 01:56:15.351
<v Speaker 2>mass destruction in some assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty fucking country in the middle of </v>

2467
01:56:15.351 --> 01:56:19.311
<v Speaker 2>nowhere a million people die when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the profits that were </v>

2468
01:56:19.311 --> 01:56:22.671
<v Speaker 2>distributed to Halliburton and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different companies that profited from </v>

2469
01:56:22.671 --> 01:56:24.450
<v Speaker 2>the rebuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so fucking transparent.</v>

2470
01:56:24.451 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 2>When they stop and they step back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at it,</v>

2471
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:30.360
<v Speaker 2>and then I think the other thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be this Edward Snowden thing.</v>

2472
01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:35.690
<v Speaker 2>People just made it possible for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>survivors of the nine slash 11 victims </v>

2473
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:39.900
<v Speaker 2>to sue Saudi Arabia that that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed last week.</v>

2474
01:56:39.901 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>admission for people to look at.</v>

2475
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:46.080
<v Speaker 2>People need to read about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2476
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:48.090
<v Speaker 2>the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hostages were.</v>

2477
01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hijackers were Saudis.</v>

2478
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2479
01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:53.490
<v Speaker 2>but there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who did it,</v>

2480
01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dead if they,</v>

2481
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.350
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the story.</v>

2482
01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:59.550
<v Speaker 2>People say that it was just a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>

2483
01:56:59.551 --> 01:57:00.800
<v Speaker 2>a vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2484
01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>

2485
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:07.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole banking empire that runs </v>

2486
01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:07.950
<v Speaker 2>through the whole thing that they set it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2487
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:13.370
<v Speaker 2>they did it theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that seem like that would be a </v>

2488
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:14.310
<v Speaker 2>really fucking difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrange and that would be really hard to</v>

2489
01:57:14.311 --> 01:57:19.311
<v Speaker 2>pull off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull off getting people to commit </v>

2490
01:57:19.311 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 2>suicide by flying planes into buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2491
01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:24.480
<v Speaker 2>you mean getting operatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting people to do that,</v>

2492
01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:29.560
<v Speaker 2>getting people to commit suicide by </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a little plane and flying them </v>

2493
01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:29.560
<v Speaker 2>right into a building.</v>

2494
01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:29.640
<v Speaker 2>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had like,</v>

2495
01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2496
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:34.080
<v Speaker 2>enough whores and drugs and money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they sat their family up,</v>

2497
01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:39.770
<v Speaker 2>people will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's incredibly difficult to </v>

2498
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:43.340
<v Speaker 2>arrange that plan that I'm saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia had anything to do with it.</v>

2499
01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:47.430
<v Speaker 2>What do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you certainly did?</v>

2500
01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea that the bankers </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized it and set it up in order to </v>

2501
01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.520
<v Speaker 2>rob people more that the government set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in order to use it as a pretest,</v>

2502
01:57:55.550 --> 01:58:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Iveta invade Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more likely that the </v>

2503
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:03.711
<v Speaker 2>capitalized on a situation and look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>an opening that they had been looking </v>

2504
01:58:03.711 --> 01:58:05.620
<v Speaker 2>for in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were practicing it for a while.</v>

2505
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Always have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always have been,</v>

2506
01:58:07.291 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 2>always will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2507
01:58:08.221 --> 01:58:09.030
<v Speaker 2>they're always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always,</v>

2508
01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:12.510
<v Speaker 2>they're all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all connected.</v>

2509
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 2>All the people who do that kind of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>all around the world,</v>

2510
01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you know their arms merchants and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know their operatives well,</v>

2511
01:58:22.291 --> 01:58:27.291
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected like that all around the </v>

2512
01:58:27.291 --> 01:58:29.331
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly people that profit </v>

2513
01:58:29.331 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 2>from from war all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think much more likely though this was</v>

2514
01:58:29.731 --> 01:58:33.420
<v Speaker 2>the consequence of our actions overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that,</v>

2515
01:58:33.421 --> 01:58:34.530
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

2516
01:58:34.531 --> 01:58:39.531
<v Speaker 2>People say it was Silverstein getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance payout out more sense to me.</v>

2517
01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Tower</v>

2518
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:42.840
<v Speaker 5>seven as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2519
01:58:42.841 --> 01:58:44.160
<v Speaker 5>That was the thing that he said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull it.</v>

2520
01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He told them to pull it.</v>

2521
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:47.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing,</v>

2522
01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:49.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

2523
01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:54.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to burn your building down to </v>

2524
01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:54.680
<v Speaker 4>get the insurance money</v>

2525
01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:56.080
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] it wasn't getting rented.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2526
01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:56.890
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

2527
01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:57.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2528
01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:02.520
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is something we've seen on smaller </v>

2529
01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:02.520
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2530
01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.530
<v Speaker 5>we've seeded on lower levels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The homeowners like their house on fire.</v>

2531
01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 5>There was a guy recently who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>indicted for murder because he opened up</v>

2532
01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:14.080
<v Speaker 5>his gas line and then set a timer and </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a spark to go off.</v>

2533
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:19.260
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had no idea how much of an </v>

2534
01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:22.051
<v Speaker 5>explosion of create and he blew up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighbor's house to and killed a couple </v>

2535
01:59:22.051 --> 01:59:22.051
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2536
01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:24.090
<v Speaker 5>it's just some crazy asshole that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted.</v>

2537
01:59:24.091 --> 01:59:25.060
<v Speaker 5>He wanted some money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2538
01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Here's how they fix the world.</v>

2539
01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:30.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2540
01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:35.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to get rid of insurance </v>

2541
01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:36.210
<v Speaker 4>because it's the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fucking scam.</v>

2542
01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Especially life insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gambling.</v>

2543
01:59:38.041 --> 01:59:43.041
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to have an insurance </v>

2544
01:59:43.041 --> 01:59:43.920
<v Speaker 4>policy saying you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2545
01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:46.380
<v Speaker 4>because you are so already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking scam.</v>

2546
01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:49.890
<v Speaker 4>And everything in this country is run by</v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance.</v>

2547
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:55.070
<v Speaker 4>Ha Hack insurance salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically a bunch of guys that used to </v>

2548
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:56.070
<v Speaker 4>be in prison and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2549
01:59:56.071 --> 02:00:00.360
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't get a real fucking job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they started in insurance sales.</v>

2550
02:00:00.650 --> 02:00:05.650
<v Speaker 5>So a guy like Larry Silverstein who </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have in the conspiracy model to </v>

2551
02:00:06.621 --> 02:00:11.621
<v Speaker 5>have those buildings destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would have no incentive to do that </v>

2552
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:11.621
<v Speaker 5>because he couldn't be able to get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get money from it.</v>

2553
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:12.620
<v Speaker 5>So it stopped things like that from </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

2554
02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that.</v>

2555
02:00:15.011 --> 02:00:19.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying people are saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying these are things I've heard.</v>

2556
02:00:20.230 --> 02:00:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2557
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:23.950
<v Speaker 4>if you go on those fucking customer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all,</v>

2558
02:00:23.951 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 4>they all make as much sense to the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2559
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:31.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that they make as much </v>

2560
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.430
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2561
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:32.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of chaos in,</v>

2562
02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:33.750
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in horrible tragedies.</v>

2563
02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:36.000
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of people look for order in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that chaos.</v>

2564
02:00:36.001 --> 02:00:37.890
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things they look for is </v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy.</v>

2565
02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:38.850
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a natural.</v>

2566
02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's any conspiracy that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of rich guys get together who own </v>

2567
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.200
<v Speaker 4>everything on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get together and hang out.</v>

2568
02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:49.230
<v Speaker 4>That's not any conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they do.</v>

2569
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:52.620
<v Speaker 4>They all fucking know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have carlyle group,</v>

2570
02:00:52.621 --> 02:00:54.720
<v Speaker 4>so the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know what they're doing,</v>

2571
02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:55.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2572
02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.410
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make money from the shit they,</v>

2573
02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:01.260
<v Speaker 4>they set up like going to the roulette </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheel.</v>

2574
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read on 22.</v>

2575
02:01:04.230 --> 02:01:05.430
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's another thing that,</v>

2576
02:01:05.431 --> 02:01:10.431
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone said I repeated a wish I could </v>

2577
02:01:10.431 --> 02:01:11.680
<v Speaker 5>credit the original person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a might actually been awesome.</v>

2578
02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:13.180
<v Speaker 5>Were stoned as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember.</v>

2579
02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 5>But the original quote was that </v>
<v Speaker 5>September 11th when,</v>

2580
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.690
<v Speaker 5>when people talk about conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 5>theories,</v>

2581
02:01:19.691 --> 02:01:22.030
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people always go,</v>

2582
02:01:22.031 --> 02:01:23.860
<v Speaker 5>do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about September 11th?</v>

2583
02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:29.340
<v Speaker 5>I always ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you believe the September 11th </v>

2584
02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:29.340
<v Speaker 5>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

2585
02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:31.530
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you believe that planes were,</v>

2586
02:01:31.570 --> 02:01:36.570
<v Speaker 5>were hijacked?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they flew them into buildings and </v>

2587
02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:36.570
<v Speaker 5>they killed a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you believe that that happened?</v>

2588
02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:36.850
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people say yes.</v>

2589
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:42.270
<v Speaker 5>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then you believe in conspiracies </v>

2590
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.270
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

2591
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>they conspired to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to be a conspiracy.</v>

2592
02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>The only way you get planes to fly into </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings show it's fake where they show</v>

2593
02:01:48.261 --> 02:01:52.040
<v Speaker 2>it to all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably CIA shit right there.</v>

2594
02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:57.190
<v Speaker 2>That's probably to diffuse the </v>
<v Speaker 2>architects and engineers for nine slash </v>

2595
02:01:57.190 --> 02:02:01.001
<v Speaker 2>11 truth and pink along those lines that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are asking for for answers because even </v>

2596
02:02:01.281 --> 02:02:06.281
<v Speaker 2>if they're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still stirring the pot so much </v>

2597
02:02:06.281 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>that it makes it hot for anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in public office.</v>

2598
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 2>It makes it difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a natural inclination.</v>

2599
02:02:11.850 --> 02:02:15.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the other conspiracy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody talks about.</v>

2600
02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:20.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a fascinating one that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been wanting more and more lately </v>

2601
02:02:20.170 --> 02:02:21.560
<v Speaker 2>to pin on Lee Harvey Oswald as being the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lone gunman.</v>

2602
02:02:21.730 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's hilarious because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are moving away from that.</v>

2603
02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:26.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2604
02:02:26.341 --> 02:02:26.660
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2605
02:02:26.661 --> 02:02:29.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that guy that wrote that book?</v>

2606
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Cape Vincent Bugliosi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however you say his last name,</v>

2607
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:35.150
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book called case closed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking retarded.</v>

2608
02:02:35.151 --> 02:02:40.151
<v Speaker 2>It's not closed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that there's a lot of </v>

2609
02:02:40.151 --> 02:02:40.151
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2610
02:02:40.151 --> 02:02:41.150
<v Speaker 2>that were witness to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2611
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:45.320
<v Speaker 2>that wound up murdered a wound up dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>in very strange ways.</v>

2612
02:02:45.321 --> 02:02:50.321
<v Speaker 2>More than a hundred over 10 years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said that the odds of those people </v>

2613
02:02:50.321 --> 02:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>all dying like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some fucking astronomical number.</v>

2614
02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating to follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2615
02:02:54.650 --> 02:02:59.650
<v Speaker 2>All these years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was in about the fifth </v>

2616
02:02:59.650 --> 02:03:02.111
<v Speaker 2>grade when they came in and they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're were Latin school out early </v>

2617
02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:05.220
<v Speaker 2>on account of our president has just </v>
<v Speaker 2>been set.</v>

2618
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>His Dad being shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was freaky.</v>

2619
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those you never forget </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you were moments,</v>

2620
02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so mad because that night I was </v>

2621
02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:18.641
<v Speaker 2>having my first slumber party and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have the scary movies and </v>

2622
02:03:20.451 --> 02:03:24.930
<v Speaker 2>there's only like three channels and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was all about the president in that.</v>

2623
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:29.950
<v Speaker 2>So they preempted all the scary movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cancel my party was.</v>

2624
02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:34.400
<v Speaker 2>That sucks because back then do you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a VCR?</v>

2625
02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to deal with it,</v>

2626
02:03:36.881 --> 02:03:41.881
<v Speaker 2>but it was the movie I wanted to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that one about the clay to burrata?</v>

2627
02:03:43.461 --> 02:03:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Nick tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2628
02:03:45.291 --> 02:03:46.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll hit the fuck.</v>

2629
02:03:46.461 --> 02:03:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2630
02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.740
<v Speaker 2>the guy with the spaceship and from came</v>
<v Speaker 2>from outer space?</v>

2631
02:03:51.741 --> 02:03:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't more of worlds?</v>

2632
02:03:54.981 --> 02:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Was it more of worlds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was war of worlds.</v>

2633
02:03:57.170 --> 02:04:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody that claimed to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to say that when I was running </v>

2634
02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:07.691
<v Speaker 2>for president so bad on a stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many war of worlds have there been?</v>

2635
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Those are the 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One which was full.</v>

2636
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:17.690
<v Speaker 2>People were screaming in the streets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought we really had been invaded.</v>

2637
02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 2>They say they're going to do another one</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2638
02:04:19.941 --> 02:04:24.941
<v Speaker 2>a fake alien invasion movie and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm projected onto the stuff that is in </v>

2639
02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:31.331
<v Speaker 2>the chem trails and that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see a fault and artificial </v>

2640
02:04:31.331 --> 02:04:35.531
<v Speaker 2>reality right before their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's got it the day the earth stood </v>

2641
02:04:35.531 --> 02:04:35.531
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

2642
02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.250
<v Speaker 2>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched that the other day actually.</v>

2643
02:04:38.290 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I just said though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes I did.</v>

2644
02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I see people like</v>

2645
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:45.420
<v Speaker 4>are programmed in America that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't hear that they can't hear it.</v>

2646
02:04:45.770 --> 02:04:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they would actually do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2647
02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was something like a war </v>
<v Speaker 2>of worlds type thing?</v>

2648
02:04:52.041 --> 02:04:57.041
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember winning the Orson Welles did </v>

2649
02:04:57.041 --> 02:04:57.041
<v Speaker 2>that on the radio and freak the pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>population out.</v>

2650
02:04:57.041 --> 02:04:58.100
<v Speaker 2>You could get sued if he did something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that today,</v>

2651
02:04:58.101 --> 02:05:03.101
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had like a fake news story and </v>

2652
02:05:03.101 --> 02:05:03.101
<v Speaker 2>people are committing suicide because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought the aliens were attacking,</v>

2653
02:05:03.101 --> 02:05:06.200
<v Speaker 2>they say they're going to do it to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that run to the fema camps.</v>

2654
02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I've got one place where there's water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and food,</v>

2655
02:05:12.711 --> 02:05:14.900
<v Speaker 2>so they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one piece of advice.</v>

2656
02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Whoever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to them anymore.</v>

2657
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:18.590
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're telling you some crazy shit.</v>

2658
02:05:18.650 --> 02:05:20.150
<v Speaker 2>It's all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they say.</v>

2659
02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:24.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a base a say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets to the FEMA camps.</v>

2660
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make any sense.</v>

2661
02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:27.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what doesn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

2662
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:30.380
<v Speaker 2>You can't get a straight answer anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet.</v>

2663
02:05:30.650 --> 02:05:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It's all fucking bullshit on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The where's the real news,</v>

2664
02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:37.640
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem with the Fema </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp thing.</v>

2665
02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Here's the number one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to feed this fucking people.</v>

2666
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:42.440
<v Speaker 2>You gotta take care of either going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill them,</v>

2667
02:05:42.650 --> 02:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>which costs money because you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to get rid of the bodies and shoot </v>

2668
02:05:47.650 --> 02:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>them and all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're not going to contribute</v>

2669
02:05:47.650 --> 02:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>any money to tax dollars anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>

2670
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:54.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't lock up your own tax base and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet that's what they're doing.</v>

2671
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Started locking everybody up for pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really locking up though.</v>

2672
02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>A lot of kids that work a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2673
02:06:01.161 --> 02:06:04.340
<v Speaker 2>but there's also they're profiting off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of putting people in prison.</v>

2674
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:09.550
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them young black men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting people that are a part </v>

2675
02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>of this disenfranchised system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2676
02:06:10.071 --> 02:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>and Latino and they're profiting off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2677
02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.350
<v Speaker 2>They're just using them to make profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

2678
02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:18.260
<v Speaker 2>They're not taking like the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baddest tax donators in the world.</v>

2679
02:06:18.261 --> 02:06:23.261
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going after people that are in </v>

2680
02:06:23.261 --> 02:06:23.261
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

2681
02:06:23.261 --> 02:06:24.620
<v Speaker 2>because those people oftentimes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to the system as far as tax</v>

2682
02:06:24.621 --> 02:06:27.110
<v Speaker 2>money anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might buy like sales tax and things</v>

2683
02:06:27.111 --> 02:06:32.111
<v Speaker 2>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're probably not making enough </v>

2684
02:06:32.111 --> 02:06:32.111
<v Speaker 2>money declared to pay a significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of income tax.</v>

2685
02:06:32.590 --> 02:06:35.780
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing left to be robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2686
02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other also the got a fucking </v>

2687
02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:40.840
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roll the dice by life threatening.</v>

2688
02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:45.220
<v Speaker 2>They start out in massive debt from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump because they're born into some </v>

2689
02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.901
<v Speaker 2>terrible society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're born into a horrible </v>

2690
02:06:49.901 --> 02:06:49.901
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible parents,</v>

2691
02:06:49.901 --> 02:06:53.771
<v Speaker 2>terrible crime filled streets around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that exploits the many for the </v>

2692
02:06:54.411 --> 02:06:56.390
<v Speaker 2>benefit of the few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly is.</v>

2693
02:06:56.430 --> 02:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that can easily be changed.</v>

2694
02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>It can be changed by some people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some fucking brains in their head.</v>

2695
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:02.530
<v Speaker 2>They'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

2696
02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to live on top of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain behind 18 sets of gates.</v>

2697

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helicopter over the fucking a.</v>

2699
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Grand Canyon Grocery still.</v>

2700
02:07:19.570 --> 02:07:20.420

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2701
02:07:20.421 --> 02:07:25.421
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I got to have bodyguards in </v>

2702
02:07:25.421 --> 02:07:25.421
<v Speaker 2>the helicopter over the roof of Ralph's.</v>

2703
02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:29.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't divorce.</v>

2704
02:07:29.421 --> 02:07:33.290
<v Speaker 4>You can't like take that may steps back </v>
<v Speaker 4>from humanity.</v>

2705
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They I'll go nuts to do you see the shit</v>

<v Speaker 4>they do because they're so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2707
02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:44.700
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing that's consistent in this </v>

2708
02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 5>conversation is the word day and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a bad way and in a good way,</v>

2709
02:07:46.571 --> 02:07:49.030
<v Speaker 5>and I say get the good way is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>always a va,</v>

2710
02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:54.040
<v Speaker 5>which corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bunch of people acting together </v>

2711
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:56.521
<v Speaker 5>doing terrible things and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we're wrong as a culture is not </v>

2712
02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:59.530
<v Speaker 5>that we don't think of ourselves as </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals,</v>

2713
02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:03.580
<v Speaker 5>but we don't think of giant groups as </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals,</v>

2714
02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:06.070
<v Speaker 5>as being a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals together.</v>

2715
02:08:06.071 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 5>You become a part of this corporation </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you become a va.</v>

2716
02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:11.530
<v Speaker 4>I know I can get away with shady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>FIne.</v>

2717
02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:14.900
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right with that stupid fuckers.</v>

2718
02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Maybe real definitive here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think we should take advantage of that</v>

2749
02:09:35.311 --> 02:09:38.640
<v Speaker 4>and do just the opposite and get all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>american people together,</v>

2750
02:09:38.641 --> 02:09:40.440
<v Speaker 4>not to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to never vote,</v>

2751
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:43.950
<v Speaker 4>never cast another fucking boat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorporate.</v>

2752
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:49.310
<v Speaker 4>And then we'll build the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>government for the money they fucking </v>

2753
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.860
<v Speaker 4>stole from us in the first god damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2754
02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:51.570
<v Speaker 4>We'll get our money back.</v>

2755
02:09:52.410 --> 02:09:54.480
<v Speaker 5>strong words from roseanne barr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2756
02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:58.440
<v Speaker 5>strong words or not or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2757
02:09:58.441 --> 02:10:01.110
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating that you were talking about,</v>

2758
02:10:01.111 --> 02:10:05.850
<v Speaker 5>one of your reasons why you love Hawaii </v>
<v Speaker 5>is because they still have a goddess.</v>

2759
02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.190
<v Speaker 5>You still have an active goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a,</v>

2760
02:10:08.191 --> 02:10:12.360
<v Speaker 5>it's a fascinating thing in our culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>that somewhere along the line of being a</v>

2761
02:10:12.361 --> 02:10:15.750
<v Speaker 5>woman or respecting the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>goddess,</v>

2762
02:10:16.110 --> 02:10:18.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is completely eliminated from,</v>

2763
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:22.350
<v Speaker 5>from the whole structure of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kinda gone.</v>

2764
02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:25.580
<v Speaker 5>There's women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's mothers as wives.</v>

2765
02:10:25.590 --> 02:10:30.560
<v Speaker 5>Is that the strong feMinine power </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure that you know,</v>

2766
02:10:30.610 --> 02:10:33.150
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or power position of the goddess doesn't</v>

2767
02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:36.590
<v Speaker 5>exist in the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these fucked up cultures.</v>

2768
02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they get.</v>

2769
02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get rid of first because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes too much sense to women when they </v>

2770
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:46.641
<v Speaker 3>got to try to fuck with women's minds </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's what they spend 99 percent </v>

2771
02:10:46.641 --> 02:10:50.601
<v Speaker 3>of their lives doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the idiots because they got to get </v>

2772
02:10:50.601 --> 02:10:51.370
<v Speaker 3>women to continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2773
02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:52.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear bear,</v>

2774
02:10:52.770 --> 02:10:56.790
<v Speaker 3>bear kids for them to send off to wars </v>
<v Speaker 3>and molest.</v>

2775
02:10:57.540 --> 02:10:58.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what ended thinking?</v>

2776
02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:01.440
<v Speaker 5>the things that like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2777
02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:05.090
<v Speaker 5>the standard of feminine or the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2778
02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:05.510
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2779
02:11:05.511 --> 02:11:10.511
<v Speaker 5>the philosophy of feminine though </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just a natural instinct and </v>

2780
02:11:10.511 --> 02:11:12.260
<v Speaker 5>inclination is to take care of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nurturing things,</v>

2781
02:11:12.261 --> 02:11:13.190
<v Speaker 5>be loving to thing.</v>

2782
02:11:13.810 --> 02:11:16.860
<v Speaker 3>That's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not exactly.</v>

2783
02:11:16.861 --> 02:11:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Everyone says that the yang and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>union of things,</v>

2784
02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:22.020
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the correct thing.</v>

2785
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:27.310
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you See your kids going to chew on </v>

2786
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:28.150
<v Speaker 3>an electric cord,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'll do these fucking idiot.</v>

2787
02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:31.680
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fat down.</v>

2788
02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:34.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it to every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All parents say that,</v>

2789
02:11:34.410 --> 02:11:37.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's out of love that you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

2790
02:11:37.171 --> 02:11:39.330
<v Speaker 3>So that's what feminine is.</v>

2791
02:11:39.550 --> 02:11:42.100
<v Speaker 5>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would also say that there's,</v>

2792
02:11:42.130 --> 02:11:47.130
<v Speaker 5>there's a yin and a yang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The masculine is more aggressive and </v>

2793
02:11:47.130 --> 02:11:47.820
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you look at like a society that's</v>

2794
02:11:47.821 --> 02:11:50.350
<v Speaker 5>spiraling out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll go one way or the other.</v>

2795
02:11:50.351 --> 02:11:52.630
<v Speaker 5>It'll go too far one way or too far the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other way.</v>

2796
02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:53.860
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2797
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.900
<v Speaker 5>the amazons or fucking kidnapping man </v>
<v Speaker 5>and cutting their dicks off amazon </v>

2798
02:11:58.900 --> 02:11:59.290
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's that a book?</v>

2799
02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:02.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be a society like shit,</v>

2800
02:12:02.321 --> 02:12:03.910
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The women have taken control.</v>

2801
02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:04.630
<v Speaker 5>That would be awful.</v>

2802
02:12:07.690 --> 02:12:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Of course they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to cut it off.</v>

2803
02:12:09.581 --> 02:12:14.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a women like men who have </v>

2804
02:12:14.581 --> 02:12:14.581
<v Speaker 3>erections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the bottom of fucking line.</v>

2805
02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Of course they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're seeking.</v>

2806
02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:23.400
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that there are so intelligent </v>

2807
02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:28.351
<v Speaker 3>systems and it seems that women are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones who actually think of them because </v>

2808
02:12:29.531 --> 02:12:31.240
<v Speaker 3>they have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what way?</v>

2809
02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.820
<v Speaker 3>What intelligence systems?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2810
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:33.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2811
02:12:33.581 --> 02:12:34.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2812
02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:35.630
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2813
02:12:36.250 --> 02:12:40.450
<v Speaker 3>social change comes one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women start doing it also,</v>

2814
02:12:40.451 --> 02:12:42.140
<v Speaker 3>social change really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2815
02:12:42.250 --> 02:12:47.250
<v Speaker 3>and community social and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>implementing a smarter system that </v>

2816
02:12:48.941 --> 02:12:51.910
<v Speaker 3>changes things right away and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of evidence out there that you</v>

2817
02:12:51.911 --> 02:12:55.960
<v Speaker 3>can read about like right now in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole bunch of new systems,</v>

2818
02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:01.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and women are the ones who are like </v>

2819
02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:01.690
<v Speaker 3>thinking them up because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these women,</v>

2820
02:13:02.150 --> 02:13:07.150
<v Speaker 3>myself included in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to fix a whole lot of shit with </v>

2821
02:13:07.150 --> 02:13:09.700
<v Speaker 3>gestures and a rubber band and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>paperclip.</v>

2822
02:13:10.150 --> 02:13:15.150
<v Speaker 3>You had to like organize the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit load of people around you to do </v>

2823
02:13:15.150 --> 02:13:19.921
<v Speaker 3>what needed to be done for the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like hive mind and we were trained </v>

2824
02:13:19.921 --> 02:13:21.160
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2825
02:13:21.161 --> 02:13:26.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're all going to survive in this </v>

2826
02:13:26.161 --> 02:13:26.161
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I need you to do.</v>

2827
02:13:26.210 --> 02:13:30.850
<v Speaker 3>If we need to make our common goal </v>
<v Speaker 3>visible and all work towards it.</v>

2828
02:13:30.851 --> 02:13:35.851
<v Speaker 3>Not against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the mother brings to a </v>

2829
02:13:35.851 --> 02:13:39.801
<v Speaker 3>family and the father too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the mother is the one who's there </v>

2830
02:13:39.801 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in general,</v>

2831
02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:45.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm speaking in generalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's there and she implements that </v>

2832
02:13:45.651 --> 02:13:47.100
<v Speaker 3>system of sharing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And commonwealth,</v>

2833
02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.540
<v Speaker 5>do you know dr chris ryan is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever heard of.</v>

2834
02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Haven't heard of the book sex at dawn </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

2835
02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:58.010
<v Speaker 5>He's a good friend and we've had them on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the podcast several times and he's a </v>

2836
02:13:58.010 --> 02:14:00.890
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really brilliant guy and one of the </v>

2837
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.930
<v Speaker 5>things that he talked about was that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter gatherer cultures,</v>

2838
02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 5>the relationship between the man and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>woman was much,</v>

2839
02:14:04.501 --> 02:14:09.501
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much more equal because the women did a </v>

2840
02:14:09.501 --> 02:14:11.631
<v Speaker 5>huge amount of that work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A hUge amount of the reason why </v>

2841
02:14:11.631 --> 02:14:12.930
<v Speaker 5>everybody was surviving and taking care </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their children and feeding themselves</v>

2842
02:14:12.931 --> 02:14:15.930
<v Speaker 5>was because of the gathering part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't so much the hunting.</v>

2843
02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:19.680
<v Speaker 5>The men would be out doing the hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would be successful occasionally,</v>

2844
02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:22.560
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they relied on crops.</v>

2845
02:14:22.561 --> 02:14:24.450
<v Speaker 5>they relied on the things that they grew</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2846
02:14:24.451 --> 02:14:26.970
<v Speaker 5>the things that they picked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that because of that,</v>

2847
02:14:26.971 --> 02:14:30.680
<v Speaker 5>the women had a prominent position of </v>
<v Speaker 5>power and in those cultures.</v>

2848
02:14:30.681 --> 02:14:30.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2849
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:31.790
<v Speaker 3>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2850
02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.120
<v Speaker 3>we got our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our thinking is a little more circular,</v>

2851
02:14:37.610 --> 02:14:39.950
<v Speaker 3>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in generalities,</v>

2852
02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:42.590
<v Speaker 3>a little more connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more,</v>

2853
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're men seems to be um,</v>

2854
02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:49.580
<v Speaker 3>a equals b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems this way.</v>

2855
02:14:49.581 --> 02:14:54.581
<v Speaker 3>What do you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hierarchal or something and they're </v>

2856
02:14:54.581 --> 02:14:54.581
<v Speaker 3>trained to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2857
02:14:54.581 --> 02:14:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't doubt that it could be switched </v>
<v Speaker 3>at any point if you're training people,</v>

2858
02:14:57.051 --> 02:15:00.080
<v Speaker 3>but after you've been doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple thousand years,</v>

2859
02:15:00.110 --> 02:15:04.690
<v Speaker 3>it kinda comes into your dna and nine it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets like it's your default because you,</v>

2860
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:07.460
<v Speaker 3>you've been while bread or program for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2861
02:15:07.461 --> 02:15:10.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that is who we are.</v>

2862
02:15:10.791 --> 02:15:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I think were much smarter than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're allowed to be.</v>

2863
02:15:13.791 --> 02:15:15.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2864
02:15:15.370 --> 02:15:20.370
<v Speaker 3>if we had ultimate freedom and small </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups of communities of self rule where</v>

2865
02:15:22.381 --> 02:15:27.381
<v Speaker 3>it was the goal of each community to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable and justice and trade with </v>

2866
02:15:27.891 --> 02:15:32.891
<v Speaker 3>your neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd be a lot better because </v>

2867
02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:33.470
<v Speaker 3>that is who we are before we all got </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up with this shit.</v>

2868
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:38.770
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that one of the things that </v>

2869
02:15:38.770 --> 02:15:38.770
<v Speaker 5>these things represent what you started </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about,</v>

2870
02:15:38.770 --> 02:15:42.971
<v Speaker 5>like an ancient culture that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>favored women more or culture over here </v>

2871
02:15:42.971 --> 02:15:47.321
<v Speaker 5>that favors men more or get weirdness </v>
<v Speaker 5>like papau new Guinea where they </v>

2872
02:15:47.321 --> 02:15:49.550
<v Speaker 5>sexually molest young boys from the time</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're young.</v>

2873
02:15:49.551 --> 02:15:51.340
<v Speaker 5>They take them away from their parents </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

2874
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:53.330
<v Speaker 5>they make them ingest men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>semen,</v>

2875
02:15:53.331 --> 02:15:55.310
<v Speaker 5>they call them semen warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2876
02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:57.410
<v Speaker 5>But what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that represents this,</v>

2877
02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:01.120
<v Speaker 5>this crazy range that we have of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of behavior patterns.</v>

2878
02:16:01.121 --> 02:16:06.121
<v Speaker 5>So people tend to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that discussion and </v>

2879
02:16:06.121 --> 02:16:08.510
<v Speaker 5>communication and things like these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these conversations are what lead people</v>

2880
02:16:08.511 --> 02:16:13.511
<v Speaker 5>to start analyzing the behavior </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure and the conversation makes </v>

2881
02:16:13.511 --> 02:16:17.500
<v Speaker 5>people look at the way things are and </v>
<v Speaker 5>compare them to whether it's passive </v>

2882
02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:19.880
<v Speaker 5>realizations or civilizations like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Iceland or whatever it is.</v>

2883
02:16:20.150 --> 02:16:25.150
<v Speaker 5>And they start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>reorganizing and reengineering the </v>

2884
02:16:25.150 --> 02:16:27.440
<v Speaker 5>system because the system is just that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something that people create and it</v>

2885
02:16:27.441 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 5>might be good and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people</v>

2886
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.380
<v Speaker 3>have accepted because they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>brainwashed into it.</v>

2887
02:16:33.550 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 3>They've been brainwashed into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's our master,</v>

2888
02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:38.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's our tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2889
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:43.651
<v Speaker 3>it take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a government that makes that </v>

2890
02:16:43.651 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just efficient,</v>

2891
02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:47.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>efficient government.</v>

2892
02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like we've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never really had that here.</v>

2893
02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.480
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's so corrupt now at this point </v>

2894
02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:56.460
<v Speaker 5>that I agree with what you said earlier </v>
<v Speaker 5>before that thing.</v>

2895
02:16:57.070 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

2896
02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.440
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2897
02:16:59.710 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have hope in my fellow humans,</v>

2898
02:17:02.051 --> 02:17:05.950
<v Speaker 3>not in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in any fairy tale way,</v>

2899
02:17:05.951 --> 02:17:07.290
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2900
02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:10.150
<v Speaker 3>there's a movement now and starting in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2901
02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:15.300
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Italy and it's going to go </v>

2902
02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:15.300
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the five star movement.</v>

2903
02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:16.110
<v Speaker 3>And it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2904
02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:21.120
<v Speaker 3>new systems of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the international tribunal of common law</v>

2905
02:17:22.090 --> 02:17:24.220
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm saying it wrong,</v>

2906
02:17:24.250 --> 02:17:28.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's like common commonwealth common</v>
<v Speaker 3>law and uh,</v>

2907
02:17:28.391 --> 02:17:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like taking the idea of sovereignty</v>

2908
02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.090
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on behalf of,</v>

2909
02:17:34.091 --> 02:17:36.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regular people of this planet,</v>

2910
02:17:37.130 --> 02:17:40.570
<v Speaker 3>all the citizens of this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2911
02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:45.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judging the people who have caused an </v>

2912
02:17:45.630 --> 02:17:47.170
<v Speaker 3>imposed misery for no reason by profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2913
02:17:47.171 --> 02:17:50.080
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do have that power and it is coming</v>

2914
02:17:50.081 --> 02:17:55.081
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is because of the internet and it is </v>

2915
02:17:55.081 --> 02:17:55.081
<v Speaker 3>because the shows like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can talk this way,</v>

2916
02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have faith in my menu or generation,</v>

2917
02:17:58.751 --> 02:18:01.030
<v Speaker 3>younger people might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kids are your age,</v>

2918
02:18:01.031 --> 02:18:03.220
<v Speaker 3>little bit younger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably just your age,</v>

2919
02:18:03.250 --> 02:18:03.980
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2920
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.970
<v Speaker 3>y'all are getting smarter and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>

2921
02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:10.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2922
02:18:10.091 --> 02:18:12.910
<v Speaker 3>you're going to solve a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're smart and you have the,</v>

2923
02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:17.350
<v Speaker 3>you have the technology and the tools at</v>
<v Speaker 3>your disposal to do so.</v>

2924
02:18:17.410 --> 02:18:19.550
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really the people far </v>
<v Speaker 5>younger than me that are,</v>

2925
02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:22.270
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to people like us having these</v>

2926
02:18:22.271 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 5>conversations and these are the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>first exposures.</v>

2927
02:18:25.301 --> 02:18:28.360
<v Speaker 5>They've had these ideas and he'll shape </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and change them while they're still</v>

2928
02:18:28.361 --> 02:18:33.361
<v Speaker 5>young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the rigid people that get into </v>

2929
02:18:33.361 --> 02:18:33.790
<v Speaker 5>their thirties with mortgages and </v>
<v Speaker 5>forties and what have you,</v>

2930
02:18:34.090 --> 02:18:36.010
<v Speaker 5>those are the really hard ones to </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking change.</v>

2931
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:38.700
<v Speaker 5>But you get a hold of some 18 year old </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid is just out of high school and knows</v>

2932
02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:40.520
<v Speaker 5>whose parents are retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2933
02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:43.780
<v Speaker 5>he goes to college and he listens to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast where rosanne breaks down what's</v>

2934
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:48.781
<v Speaker 5>wrong that that plants a seed in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>head or her head and then from there </v>

2935
02:18:48.781 --> 02:18:53.130
<v Speaker 5>they go on and they improve the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the structure from where they can access</v>

2936
02:18:53.441 --> 02:18:57.090
<v Speaker 5>it as at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at any point it can be,</v>

2937
02:18:57.091 --> 02:18:57.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2938
02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:58.800
<v Speaker 3>even one small change</v>

2939
02:18:59.210 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 5>right out of college not being saddled </v>
<v Speaker 5>down with mortgages and kids and all </v>

2940
02:19:04.671 --> 02:19:06.050
<v Speaker 5>this different stuff that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

2941
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:11.230
<v Speaker 5>really hard to change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But be free from the jump and then </v>

2942
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 5>engineer your life and in turn affect a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>

2943
02:19:14.370 --> 02:19:14.760
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

2944
02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:16.800
<v Speaker 3>it's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

2945
02:19:16.801 --> 02:19:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

2946
02:19:18.331 --> 02:19:21.800
<v Speaker 3>it's far younger than even them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have a lot of.</v>

2947
02:19:21.810 --> 02:19:26.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of hope for autistic </v>

2948
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 3>people think</v>

2949
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:32.780
<v Speaker 4>because they are very solution driven </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm on that spectrum,</v>

2950
02:19:32.781 --> 02:19:33.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2951
02:19:33.890 --> 02:19:37.340
<v Speaker 4>but they're able to conceive of the idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of actual solutions,</v>

2952
02:19:37.341 --> 02:19:41.150
<v Speaker 4>actual problems instead of how am I </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to make money off this problem,</v>

2953
02:19:41.151 --> 02:19:44.570
<v Speaker 4>which is like my generation and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappearing.</v>

2954
02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.400
<v Speaker 4>But kids as young as nine years old are </v>
<v Speaker 4>implementing incredible systems on the,</v>

2955
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.100
<v Speaker 4>on the internet that actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2956
02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:53.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2957
02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:00.520
<v Speaker 4>what do you call it for battering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>battering and fuel batteries and fuel </v>

2958
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:03.880
<v Speaker 4>and all kinds of new things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2959
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:06.890
<v Speaker 4>These guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are unbelievable.</v>

2960
02:20:06.891 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 4>These young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really young and especially the ones who</v>

2961
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:15.761
<v Speaker 4>have intense focus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their focus is so intense that they can </v>

2962
02:20:15.761 --> 02:20:16.820
<v Speaker 4>only do one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when applied,</v>

2963
02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:22.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are like some of the greatest </v>

2964
02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:22.370
<v Speaker 4>thinkers as per solutions that have ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>existed.</v>

2965
02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:25.760
<v Speaker 4>And now this is like the time of magic </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I really like.</v>

2966
02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Because one time I want to tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>

2967
02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:29.480
<v Speaker 4>but you finished and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

2968
02:20:29.490 --> 02:20:30.110
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please do.</v>

2969
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was like a thing that really fucked</v>

2970
02:20:31.871 --> 02:20:35.480
<v Speaker 4>up my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at this party in,</v>

2971
02:20:35.481 --> 02:20:38.090
<v Speaker 4>there was all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2972
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:43.330
<v Speaker 4>from all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was this guy there and he had </v>

2973
02:20:43.330 --> 02:20:44.750
<v Speaker 4>done all the satellite work for ted </v>
<v Speaker 4>turner at the time,</v>

2974
02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:49.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they started cable news and </v>

2975
02:20:49.751 --> 02:20:49.751
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>

2976
02:20:49.751 --> 02:20:53.440
<v Speaker 4>he was telling me what his opinion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the impact of technology and,</v>

2977
02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:56.690
<v Speaker 4>and freedom of information for people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to.</v>

2978
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:58.370
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's what he said,</v>

2979
02:20:58.371 --> 02:21:01.100
<v Speaker 4>because I think of it everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for the first time in history,</v>

2980
02:21:01.101 --> 02:21:06.101
<v Speaker 4>human history information reaches the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people without any state,</v>

2981
02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:10.790
<v Speaker 4>without any church stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said this,</v>

2982
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:16.030
<v Speaker 4>this is going to give birth to something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the people in the who look at the </v>

2983
02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:18.920
<v Speaker 4>renaissance as like a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

2984
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:20.840
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a million times.</v>

2985
02:21:20.890 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 4>But he said this is going to be the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>of great freedom.</v>

2986
02:21:23.661 --> 02:21:25.670
<v Speaker 4>And he said in the greatest thing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is that,</v>

2987
02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:30.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ills of the world will begin to </v>

2988
02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.581
<v Speaker 4>disappear because people will be smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough when we won't want to walk over </v>

2989
02:21:33.581 --> 02:21:35.870
<v Speaker 4>dead bodies anymore because they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that what they do,</v>

2990
02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:39.890
<v Speaker 4>it is who they are and anyone into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole thing.</v>

2991
02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:42.090
<v Speaker 4>And I think I think of it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2992
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:46.460
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look for evidence that it's true and I</v>

2993
02:21:46.461 --> 02:21:48.260
<v Speaker 4>find it everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the internet.</v>

2994
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know the right thing to do.</v>

2995
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:56.140
<v Speaker 4>They know that this at the time were </v>
<v Speaker 4>they know us just deciding that we're </v>

2996
02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.310
<v Speaker 4>going to do the right thing for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right reason at the right time.</v>

2997
02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:03.520
<v Speaker 4>It's never been done and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible in this the first time that </v>

2998
02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:07.241
<v Speaker 4>it's really been possible for people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like really get together and um,</v>

2999
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:14.170
<v Speaker 4>demand and bring change and a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whole new world,</v>

3000
02:22:15.050 --> 02:22:20.050
<v Speaker 4>a whole new world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we can do it all with everything </v>

3001
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:23.111
<v Speaker 4>that already exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to have any wars and we </v>

3002
02:22:23.111 --> 02:22:23.270
<v Speaker 4>don't have to reinvent the wheel either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all exists.</v>

3003
02:22:23.271 --> 02:22:26.550
<v Speaker 4>What we need is the right intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence</v>

3004
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:28.800
<v Speaker 3>and philosophy at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving it.</v>

3005
02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:30.390
<v Speaker 3>And that exists to.</v>

3006
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:33.350
<v Speaker 5>You're so much more positive than you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were two hours ago.</v>

3007
02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's why I'm positive because he is as</v>

3008
02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:42.560
<v Speaker 3>positive vr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know about zen and stuff for as </v>

3009
02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:42.560
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to stay in balance.</v>

3010
02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:46.920
<v Speaker 3>The reason that you can be that positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you are aware of how negative it is,</v>

3011
02:22:47.430 --> 02:22:49.800
<v Speaker 3>you need what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have both.</v>

3012
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:54.090
<v Speaker 3>You've got to have both because you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see how fucking stupid shit is.</v>

3013
02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:57.120
<v Speaker 5>I often think that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that motivates good things,</v>

3014
02:22:57.230 --> 02:23:02.230
<v Speaker 5>is it seeing eviL in the world and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like it has to exist in order to </v>

3015
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:05.250
<v Speaker 5>motivate good because we're so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're so far from perfect.</v>

3016
02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:07.510
<v Speaker 5>We're so far from finished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3017
02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:10.120
<v Speaker 5>if we used to be monkeys and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>at this,</v>

3018
02:23:10.410 --> 02:23:11.450
<v Speaker 5>we're not done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

3019
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:16.520
<v Speaker 5>We're not stopping right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever we're going to be a million </v>

3020
02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:17.360
<v Speaker 5>years from now is going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult to do.</v>

3021
02:23:17.490 --> 02:23:19.980
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 5>compare to what we are today.</v>

3022
02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:21.420
<v Speaker 5>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going gonna change.</v>

3023
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:23.640
<v Speaker 5>We're gonna evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to this point,</v>

3024
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 5>we're going to continue to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether we evolve or they don't like the</v>

3025
02:23:26.881 --> 02:23:31.881
<v Speaker 5>word evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they elect to use the word have only </v>

3026
02:23:31.881 --> 02:23:31.881
<v Speaker 5>evolved with genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>advanced,</v>

3027
02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:34.050
<v Speaker 5>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>culturally advanced,</v>

3028
02:23:34.051 --> 02:23:39.051
<v Speaker 5>biologically advancing our understanding</v>
<v Speaker 5>of each other and advance even further </v>

3029
02:23:39.051 --> 02:23:41.310
<v Speaker 5>in our ability to spread information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not done.</v>

3030
02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:46.460
<v Speaker 5>So the evil almost motivates that work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It almost motivates that positive work </v>

3031
02:23:46.981 --> 02:23:47.880
<v Speaker 5>to get things done.</v>

3032
02:23:48.420 --> 02:23:50.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like the evil thing,</v>

3033
02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:54.990
<v Speaker 3>after it's done killing everything good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It like cancer,</v>

3034
02:23:54.991 --> 02:23:56.970
<v Speaker 3>the cancer cell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is genetics.</v>

3035
02:23:57.450 --> 02:24:02.190
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop killing until the host </v>
<v Speaker 3>is dead [inaudible] and then it,</v>

3036
02:24:02.250 --> 02:24:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes the host and updates itself.</v>

3037
02:24:05.610 --> 02:24:06.780
<v Speaker 3>It eats its own tail</v>

3038
02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:09.900
<v Speaker 5>well and even on a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at it,</v>

3039
02:24:09.901 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 5>what we're talking about earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 5>New York,</v>

3040
02:24:11.641 --> 02:24:16.641
<v Speaker 5>about people experiencing that horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>evil of this attack and thousands of </v>

3041
02:24:16.641 --> 02:24:18.990
<v Speaker 5>people dead and then millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>being friendly to each other.</v>

3042
02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:21.150
<v Speaker 5>There's this burst in the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>direction</v>

3043
02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:23.190
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me that was like,</v>

3044
02:24:23.191 --> 02:24:28.191
<v Speaker 3>this is the messiah moment that first of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that wall street appreciated the </v>

3045
02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:32.700
<v Speaker 3>work that people who do the actual work </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes things go.</v>

3046
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Like when they go to the wall and flip </v>
<v Speaker 3>that switch.</v>

3047
02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:37.200
<v Speaker 3>The people that make the electricity </v>
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>

3048
02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you know the people that raise their </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and put the food on their tables </v>

3049
02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:45.981
<v Speaker 3>and grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people that do the actual work </v>

3050
02:24:45.981 --> 02:24:49.410
<v Speaker 3>that they were being very appreciative </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought this is a mind blowing </v>

3051
02:24:49.410 --> 02:24:51.330
<v Speaker 3>fucking revolutionary moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

3052
02:24:51.331 --> 02:24:55.740
<v Speaker 3>History were bullshit is not walking and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit is not talking,</v>

3053
02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:00.980
<v Speaker 3>but reality and reality is being honored</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are so fucking happy.</v>

3054
02:25:01.471 --> 02:25:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were all smiling at each other.</v>

3055
02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:06.780
<v Speaker 3>They were tripping over themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give somebody a hand.</v>

3056
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It was intense and I never will forget </v>
<v Speaker 3>it neither.</v>

3057
02:25:11.310 --> 02:25:13.110
<v Speaker 5>I won't forget it either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember that feeling.</v>

3058
02:25:13.111 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 5>It was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

3059
02:25:13.831 --> 02:25:18.831
<v Speaker 5>very strange time and it didn't last,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it let me know that that that time </v>

3060
02:25:18.831 --> 02:25:23.121
<v Speaker 5>is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that things like that can take place </v>

3061
02:25:23.121 --> 02:25:23.320
<v Speaker 5>where people do wake up and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize and think.</v>

3062
02:25:23.321 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 5>One of the big things</v>

3063
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:29.190
<v Speaker 2>was that it happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been so lucky when you consider </v>

3064
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:32.821
<v Speaker 2>how much war the United States has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in and how little of it has </v>

3065
02:25:32.821 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 2>been on the United States soil outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pearl harbor,</v>

3066
02:25:34.811 --> 02:25:39.811
<v Speaker 2>which is barely on United States soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's in the middle of the </v>

3067
02:25:39.811 --> 02:25:39.811
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Hawaii,</v>

3068
02:25:39.811 --> 02:25:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be its own nation.</v>

3069
02:25:41.021 --> 02:25:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a totally unique thing.</v>

3070
02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it should have its own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3071
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 2>its own rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own government.</v>

3072
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I think they need the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for certain things because of </v>

3073
02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:53.550
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fuck that.</v>

3074
02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:58.640
<v Speaker 2>It's moved to where it's like the leader</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the United States because it's the </v>

3075
02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:01.300
<v Speaker 2>only place where either they've outlawed</v>
<v Speaker 2>gmos and China just said,</v>

3076
02:26:01.301 --> 02:26:04.150
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to buy any gmo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there you go.</v>

3077
02:26:04.151 --> 02:26:09.151
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole market there that Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very set up to be able to fulfill.</v>

3078
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:16.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a paradise nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a paradise in the middle of the </v>

3079
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:18.721
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that it's a part of the United </v>

3080
02:26:18.721 --> 02:26:18.721
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy,</v>

3081
02:26:18.721 --> 02:26:19.240
<v Speaker 2>but they've been attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pearl harbor thing was the only time,</v>

3082
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:24.510
<v Speaker 2>so we didn't have a point of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're involved in all this shit </v>

3083
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:26.170
<v Speaker 2>that's going on over the globe where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are involved in Iraq.</v>

3084
02:26:26.171 --> 02:26:31.171
<v Speaker 2>We are involved in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you and I and everybody that's here </v>

3085
02:26:31.171 --> 02:26:31.180
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't feel that.</v>

3086
02:26:31.390 --> 02:26:36.390
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you have friends or loved ones </v>

3087
02:26:36.390 --> 02:26:36.390
<v Speaker 2>that are over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel it.</v>

3088
02:26:36.390 --> 02:26:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people have send their children </v>

3089
02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:42.151
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people feel like there's a bunch </v>

3090
02:26:42.221 --> 02:26:47.221
<v Speaker 2>of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who felt it and what's really sickening </v>

3091
02:26:47.221 --> 02:26:49.760
<v Speaker 2>to me is that those people who sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids over there to fight for what,</v>

3092
02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:55.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea that they agreed with and that </v>

3093
02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:55.210
<v Speaker 2>everybody agrees with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they were sold.</v>

3094
02:26:55.210 --> 02:27:00.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they come home to find that </v>

3095
02:27:00.210 --> 02:27:00.520
<v Speaker 2>their pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their parents,</v>

3096
02:27:00.521 --> 02:27:02.830
<v Speaker 2>that class of people who've lost their </v>
<v Speaker 2>homes.</v>

3097
02:27:03.490 --> 02:27:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people put that one together,</v>

3098
02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I always hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3099
02:27:07.810 --> 02:27:09.250
<v Speaker 2>of course I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3100
02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:14.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the american people deserve healthcare.</v>

3101
02:27:14.290 --> 02:27:17.980
<v Speaker 2>And if they had given us healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't had any war in Iraq.</v>

3102
02:27:17.981 --> 02:27:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I want somebody to put that together </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3103
02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:25.320
<v Speaker 2>That was all bankster bullshit to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying for medicare for all because they</v>

3104
02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:30.100
<v Speaker 2>needed to get away from what they call a</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialist model.</v>

3105
02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:35.280
<v Speaker 2>So they start breaking it down and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was all around healthcare and it would </v>

3106
02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:38.350
<v Speaker 2>have been a whole fuck of a lot cheaper </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just give people healthcare.</v>

3107
02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:39.400
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3108
02:27:39.490 --> 02:27:44.490
<v Speaker 2>It paid off those private contractors </v>
<v Speaker 2>who go over to other countries and not </v>

3109
02:27:44.651 --> 02:27:48.100
<v Speaker 2>only do they blow everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they rebuild it.</v>

3110
02:27:48.490 --> 02:27:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Then they blow it up again and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild it.</v>

3111
02:27:51.650 --> 02:27:55.900
<v Speaker 2>They're getting paid four times of doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it's just a fucking scam.</v>

3112
02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:00.960
<v Speaker 2>When you say it's about healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that they shifted where the </v>

3113
02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:01.780
<v Speaker 2>money would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would have to go to war.</v>

3114
02:28:01.781 --> 02:28:03.070
<v Speaker 2>so there wouldn't be money for health </v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

3115
02:28:03.071 --> 02:28:06.760
<v Speaker 2>It was up there because they didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>any socialist solution.</v>

3116
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I just say socialist solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it,</v>

3117
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3118
02:28:11.130 --> 02:28:16.130
<v Speaker 2>they've got people thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism means you're behind barbed </v>

3119
02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:19.671
<v Speaker 2>wire with a gun to your head or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're weak and lazy and you don't want </v>

3120
02:28:19.671 --> 02:28:24.061
<v Speaker 2>to do any work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's how you fucking a middle </v>

3121
02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:24.061
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take</v>

3122
02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:24.140
<v Speaker 3>the shit from the top and move it to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle.</v>

3123
02:28:24.350 --> 02:28:26.960
<v Speaker 3>So they just bullshitted everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3124
02:28:26.961 --> 02:28:29.600
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use the way they always use.</v>

3125
02:28:29.601 --> 02:28:32.560
<v Speaker 3>They use a lot of racism and they use an</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute classes,</v>

3126
02:28:32.561 --> 02:28:37.561
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to divide people against each other and </v>

3127
02:28:37.561 --> 02:28:38.230
<v Speaker 3>do their fundraising shit or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they and,</v>

3128
02:28:38.231 --> 02:28:42.740
<v Speaker 3>and all the laws that they changed since</v>
<v Speaker 3>reagan were deregulation laws and it was</v>

3129
02:28:42.741 --> 02:28:45.500
<v Speaker 3>so that there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they deregulated the insurance company,</v>

3130
02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:50.501
<v Speaker 3>so like bosses can take peasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance out on their employees and so </v>

3131
02:28:50.501 --> 02:28:51.230
<v Speaker 3>if they die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a kickback,</v>

3132
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:53.540
<v Speaker 3>judges get a kickback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3133
02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:58.541
<v Speaker 3>they took public money and put it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>private pockets and they did it all </v>

3134
02:28:58.541 --> 02:29:02.430
<v Speaker 3>through their lobbyists who sit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>congress and have nothing to do with </v>

3135
02:29:02.430 --> 02:29:03.320
<v Speaker 3>serving the needs of the people who sent</v>
<v Speaker 3>them there.</v>

3136
02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Now that is some bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking hilarious.</v>

3137
02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:11.460
<v Speaker 3>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you can write comedy like </v>

3138
02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:11.460
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3139
02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3140
02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's hilarious.</v>

3141
02:29:12.441 --> 02:29:17.441
<v Speaker 2>I think it's disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I agree with you that it's </v>

3142
02:29:17.441 --> 02:29:17.441
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking transparent it is.</v>

3143
02:29:17.441 --> 02:29:19.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think that you breaking it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is going to let people sort of</v>

3144
02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:24.400
<v Speaker 2>look at it from that point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got everybody fired by boat flagged</v>

3145
02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:29.820
<v Speaker 2>by both bible facts because you made me </v>
<v Speaker 2>forget to verado nickname used to </v>

<v Speaker 4>against it doesn't mean shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get shit for it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your kid ain't going to get nowhere.</v>

3149

<v Speaker 4>old lady gets up there.</v>

3152
02:29:51.891 --> 02:29:53.390
<v Speaker 4>It made me so fucking mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be able to send my grandkids,</v>

3157

<v Speaker 4>They're depressed as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>America takes two thirds of the world's </v>

3165
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:39.621
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants and then they got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>antidepressant booster on top of every </v>

3166
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:44.670

3167
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:45.870
<v Speaker 4>quick enough and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just drowning in bullshit,</v>

3168
02:30:45.871 --> 02:30:46.600
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3169
02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:51.060
<v Speaker 4>they want bullshit more than they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's all fucking bullshit because it's.</v>

3173
02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Truth is scary</v>

3174
02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:08.310
<v Speaker 4>because it's simple and they can't stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>simple because they don't feel smart and</v>

3175
02:31:08.311 --> 02:31:13.311
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all convoluted labyrinths of </v>

3176
02:31:13.311 --> 02:31:13.311
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3177
02:31:13.311 --> 02:31:14.850
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the simple truth is fucking overwhelming</v>

3178
02:31:14.851 --> 02:31:17.580
<v Speaker 4>to them because they're fucking liars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're like,</v>

3179
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:18.960
<v Speaker 4>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how am I going to stand here?</v>

3180
02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Have something to come</v>

3181
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.470
<v Speaker 3>out of my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How am I going to do that?</v>

3182
02:31:22.471 --> 02:31:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't be getting paid for that.</v>

3183
02:31:24.470 --> 02:31:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people themselves that are addicted </v>

3184
02:31:29.470 --> 02:31:29.470
<v Speaker 3>to the bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3185
02:31:29.470 --> 02:31:29.470
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

3186
02:31:29.470 --> 02:31:31.080
<v Speaker 3>what's feasible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I say I don't use it.</v>

3187
02:31:31.410 --> 02:31:34.070
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have convoluted hope until people,</v>

3188
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:34.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3189
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:39.670
<v Speaker 3>there's hope that you're gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's hope you're going to climb out </v>

3190
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.670
<v Speaker 3>of that hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's hope,</v>

3191
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:43.911
<v Speaker 3>there's a payoff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's hope you're going to win in the </v>

3192
02:31:43.911 --> 02:31:43.911
<v Speaker 3>casino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't any fucking hope.</v>

3193
02:31:43.911 --> 02:31:45.330
<v Speaker 3>All there is is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3194
02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:50.480
<v Speaker 3>united with other people helping each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other to get rid of fucking criminals </v>

3195
02:31:50.480 --> 02:31:52.080
<v Speaker 3>that are robbing us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly the best hope.</v>

3196
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:56.430
<v Speaker 3>So I hope that people will fucking wake </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck up.</v>

3197
02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:58.440
<v Speaker 3>That's where I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they are.</v>

3198
02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they are.</v>

3199
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:02.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that helped.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can and I like to just go and </v>

<v Speaker 3>tell you what it means to.</v>

3206
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3207
02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:20.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3208
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:24.960
<v Speaker 3>that's the service I can provide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm full of shit on some topics.</v>

3209
02:32:24.961 --> 02:32:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Look it up for yourself and then come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and tell me if I am or not.</v>

3210
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

3211
02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:33.810
<v Speaker 3>somebody's got to put this complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>system of obsolete bullshit.</v>

3212
02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:39.140
<v Speaker 3>They start laughing at to scorn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking replace it with something that </v>

3213
02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:39.840
<v Speaker 3>fucking makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3214
02:32:39.841 --> 02:32:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

3215
02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what's going to be the trigger.</v>

3216
02:32:44.310 --> 02:32:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's not something catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some some sort of big event that has to </v>

3217
02:32:49.310 --> 02:32:52.020
<v Speaker 3>take place in order for them to rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing and try to do it in some</v>

3218
02:32:52.021 --> 02:32:56.820
<v Speaker 3>sort of ethical and moral way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I to do is write down the debt.</v>

3219
02:32:56.821 --> 02:32:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Like fdr did move the zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>

3220
02:32:59.521 --> 02:33:02.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pen on paper.</v>

3221
02:33:02.011 --> 02:33:04.260
<v Speaker 3>That's all they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they want,</v>

3222
02:33:04.290 --> 02:33:06.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to get better in a fucking hurry.</v>

3223
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:10.320
<v Speaker 3>They can write down the debt of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>american people.</v>

3224
02:33:10.321 --> 02:33:12.840
<v Speaker 3>They can have a debt jubilee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can forgive the debt.</v>

3225
02:33:12.841 --> 02:33:17.640
<v Speaker 3>student loan debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do that or if they want to,</v>

3226
02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:20.400
<v Speaker 3>it's totally possible.</v>

<v Speaker 3>communities and people for,</v>

02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:10.230
<v Speaker 3>They just take people's money and put it</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their friends pocket.</v>

3270
02:35:10.470 --> 02:35:15.470

<v Speaker 3>that they're not a,</v>

3271
02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:18.600
<v Speaker 3>nothing they do is in the public </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest or,</v>

3272
02:35:18.601 --> 02:35:20.670
<v Speaker 3>or for american citizens.</v>

3283
02:35:53.471 --> 02:35:58.471

<v Speaker 5>they're working very hard to restrict </v>

3284
02:35:58.471 --> 02:36:00.571
<v Speaker 5>those freedoms and that's what's scary </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the nsa holding things on over </v>

<v Speaker 5>This is geraldo rivera back when he was </v>

3326
02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:58.870
<v Speaker 5>super slick with a beautiful mustache </v>
<v Speaker 5>and lovely hair.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And it was geraldo show.</v>

3328
02:38:01.961 --> 02:38:06.550
<v Speaker 5>He was the most radical did he was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>young man and he was a wild fuck.</v>

3329
02:38:07.090 --> 02:38:10.060
<v Speaker 5>He was very different than he is now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His little fox news.</v>

3330
02:38:11.010 --> 02:38:11.630
<v Speaker 7>Bruter film.</v>

3331
02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Dick gregory got ahold of this video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Time magazine owned it from 1963 on </v>

3332
02:38:18.111 --> 02:38:20.600
<v Speaker 5>zapruder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Submitted it to them in 1963.</v>

3333
02:38:20.601 --> 02:38:24.290
<v Speaker 5>They bought it and then no one released </v>
<v Speaker 5>it until 1970.</v>

3334
02:38:24.291 --> 02:38:25.340
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seventy what?</v>

3335
02:38:25.730 --> 02:38:27.710
<v Speaker 5>Seventy five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So think about that.</v>

3336
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:31.610
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about eight years after </v>
<v Speaker 5>the murder was the first time it gets on</v>

3337
02:38:31.611 --> 02:38:32.420
<v Speaker 5>tv,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and here it is.</v>

3338
02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:36.860
<v Speaker 5>This is the first time people see </v>
<v Speaker 5>kennedy's head explode on television and</v>

3339
02:38:36.861 --> 02:38:41.410
<v Speaker 5>go back into the left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd never seen that before and</v>

3340
02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:46.110
<v Speaker 7>that all of the shots were fired from </v>
<v Speaker 7>behind by lee harvey oswald alone,</v>

3341
02:38:46.270 --> 02:38:51.090
<v Speaker 7>assassin firing at the president,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and as you could see clearly the head is</v>

3342
02:38:51.091 --> 02:38:53.460
<v Speaker 7>thrown violently backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can completely.</v>

3343
02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:55.570
<v Speaker 5>That's a dIck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gregory.</v>

3344
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Dick gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put that on television.</v>

3345
02:38:57.490 --> 02:39:00.300
<v Speaker 5>So your hero was responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something you didn't even know about.</v>

3346
02:39:00.310 --> 02:39:05.310
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the big moments where </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the United States started </v>

3347
02:39:05.310 --> 02:39:05.310
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3348
02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.190
<v Speaker 5>The kennedy assassination was the one </v>
<v Speaker 5>for me when I was.</v>

3349
02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:10.870
<v Speaker 5>I was living in New York and my friend </v>
<v Speaker 5>john,</v>

3350
02:39:11.370 --> 02:39:16.370
<v Speaker 5>he had this buddy who was over the house</v>
<v Speaker 5>who had this book that was a fucking </v>

3351
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:16.660
<v Speaker 5>wave it around talking all this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit about this book.</v>

3352
02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:19.210
<v Speaker 5>It was called best evidence by this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>david lifton.</v>

3353
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:22.960
<v Speaker 5>David liftin was an accountant start </v>
<v Speaker 5>going over the warren commission reports</v>

3354
02:39:22.961 --> 02:39:27.961
<v Speaker 5>and he was one of the only guys that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>anal enough to go through all fucking </v>

3355
02:39:27.961 --> 02:39:31.111
<v Speaker 5>who knows how many hundreds and hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 5>of pages and find all these </v>

3356
02:39:31.111 --> 02:39:33.820
<v Speaker 5>inconsistencies and contradictions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all this hypocrisy and craziness and all</v>

3357
02:39:33.821 --> 02:39:35.080
<v Speaker 5>incorrect shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he.</v>

3358
02:39:35.081 --> 02:39:40.081
<v Speaker 5>He made like a long list of what it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>and explained and then went on this </v>

3359
02:39:40.390 --> 02:39:45.390
<v Speaker 5>lifelong quest to get to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened during the kennedy </v>

3360
02:39:45.390 --> 02:39:47.320
<v Speaker 5>assassination and the result was this </v>
<v Speaker 5>book called best evidence that is one of</v>

3361
02:39:47.321 --> 02:39:52.270
<v Speaker 5>the most analytical books ever and </v>
<v Speaker 5>analytical about the crime in a way that</v>

3362
02:39:52.271 --> 02:39:54.340
<v Speaker 5>was not emotional.</v>

3363
02:39:54.490 --> 02:39:59.490
<v Speaker 5>IT wasn't theatrical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't trying to lead you in one </v>

3364
02:39:59.490 --> 02:40:02.131
<v Speaker 5>direction or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just simply stating the facts </v>

3365
02:40:02.131 --> 02:40:04.000
<v Speaker 5>like the reason why the single bullet </v>
<v Speaker 5>theory was concocted in the first place.</v>

3366
02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:09.120
<v Speaker 5>The single bullet itself appearing on </v>
<v Speaker 5>connelly's gurney magically at the </v>

3367
02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.381
<v Speaker 5>hospital and being responsible for going</v>
<v Speaker 5>through to people's bodies and leaving </v>

3368
02:40:13.381 --> 02:40:15.270
<v Speaker 5>more in residue of the bullets and </v>
<v Speaker 5>connally's body.</v>

3369
02:40:15.271 --> 02:40:17.460
<v Speaker 5>Then was missing from the actual bullet </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

3370
02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:22.490
<v Speaker 5>So much horseshit involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>concoction of the single bullet theory </v>

3371
02:40:22.490 --> 02:40:24.660
<v Speaker 5>in the first place because they only did</v>
<v Speaker 5>it because they had a.</v>

3372
02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:28.110
<v Speaker 5>They had a makeup for a guy getting hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a ricochet and the underpass.</v>

3373
02:40:28.470 --> 02:40:33.470
<v Speaker 5>A guy went to the hospital and he got </v>
<v Speaker 5>hit and he was doing interviews and </v>

3374
02:40:33.470 --> 02:40:36.141
<v Speaker 5>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got hit with a bullet that hit the </v>

3375
02:40:36.141 --> 02:40:36.141
<v Speaker 5>curb stone and the ricochet hit him in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the head so he.</v>

3376
02:40:36.141 --> 02:40:40.370
<v Speaker 5>This guy had to be treated so they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>to account for that bullet and one of </v>

3377
02:40:40.370 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 5>the ways the accounted for that bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was all these different wounds on two</v>

3378
02:40:41.611 --> 02:40:43.800
<v Speaker 5>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They attributed in the one bullet.</v>

3379
02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

3380
02:40:45.391 --> 02:40:47.490
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're getting shot from all over</v>
<v Speaker 5>the place.</v>

3381
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 5>We were getting shot from the front and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shot from the back.</v>

3382
02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:55.400
<v Speaker 5>They tied it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first bullet hole and kennedy's </v>

3383
02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:55.400
<v Speaker 5>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They turned thAt into a trake wound.</v>

3384
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:58.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a different wound in the protest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Maryland hospital as it is,</v>

3385
02:40:58.651 --> 02:41:03.651
<v Speaker 5>and the dallas hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way it was described in the dallas </v>

3386
02:41:03.651 --> 02:41:04.440
<v Speaker 5>hospital was an entry wound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way it was described in bethesda,</v>

3387
02:41:04.470 --> 02:41:09.470
<v Speaker 5>Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the time they got ahold of the body </v>

3388
02:41:09.470 --> 02:41:09.510
<v Speaker 5>and fluid across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they turned it into a tracheotomy.</v>

3389
02:41:09.810 --> 02:41:11.790
<v Speaker 5>You don't do a tracheotomy and a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have a head,</v>

3390
02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:15.470
<v Speaker 5>the guy's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never heard any of this.</v>

3391
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:19.290
<v Speaker 5>They had to make something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had to account for the fact that he</v>

3392
02:41:19.291 --> 02:41:22.050
<v Speaker 5>had a hole in his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they turned it into a trake wound.</v>

3393
02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 5>You've got shot from a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different angles.</v>

3394
02:41:24.330 --> 02:41:26.070
<v Speaker 5>There's probably several people shooting</v>
<v Speaker 5>at them.</v>

3395
02:41:26.071 --> 02:41:27.660
<v Speaker 5>One of them might've been lee harvey </v>
<v Speaker 5>oswald.</v>

3396
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:29.490
<v Speaker 5>It's not an either or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3397
02:41:29.491 --> 02:41:31.130
<v Speaker 5>people say lee harvey oswald acted </v>
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>

3398
02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:33.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might've acted that either or thing.</v>

3399
02:41:34.060 --> 02:41:39.060
<v Speaker 3>That's that binary mind control thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'd go back and forth like you're </v>

3400
02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:39.060
<v Speaker 3>getting all bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3401
02:41:39.450 --> 02:41:42.380
<v Speaker 3>going back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't see the real truths.</v>

3402
02:41:42.381 --> 02:41:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right there in your face.</v>

3403
02:41:43.681 --> 02:41:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's some real facts of it.</v>

3404
02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Not that those aren't real facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that Gerald Ford was the head of the</v>

3405
02:41:49.801 --> 02:41:53.180
<v Speaker 3>warren commission that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out with a,</v>

3406
02:41:53.181 --> 02:41:58.181
<v Speaker 3>a certain report and then became the </v>
<v Speaker 3>analects and president of the United </v>

3407
02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:00.460
<v Speaker 3>States for a lot</v>

3408
02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:02.240
<v Speaker 5>the creep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>arlen specter,</v>

3409
02:42:02.241 --> 02:42:07.241
<v Speaker 5>he was on the warrant commission.</v>
<v Speaker 5>THe warren commission was filled with </v>

3410
02:42:07.241 --> 02:42:10.031
<v Speaker 5>criminals and crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mad men that were designed to </v>

3411
02:42:10.031 --> 02:42:11.630
<v Speaker 5>disseminate propaganda and dress it up </v>
<v Speaker 5>as the truth.</v>

3412
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:16.750
<v Speaker 5>Whoever killed kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it was lee harvey oswald </v>

3413
02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:18.080
<v Speaker 5>delivered the shot or the idea that what</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're getting is the truth,</v>

3414
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:23.170
<v Speaker 5>the whole truth and nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's the most hilarious thing </v>

3415
02:42:23.170 --> 02:42:23.170
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would they ever do that?</v>

3416
02:42:23.170 --> 02:42:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I agree with you,</v>

3417
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:30.030
<v Speaker 3>but did you see obama shaking raul </v>
<v Speaker 3>castro's hand at mandela's funeral </v>

3418
02:42:30.030 --> 02:42:30.520
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3419
02:42:30.730 --> 02:42:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about that?</v>

3420
02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:36.850
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but did you see the guy who was doing </v>

3421
02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:37.640
<v Speaker 5>the fucking translation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sign language at mandela's funeral?</v>

3422
02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:40.280
<v Speaker 5>Just making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>TO me,</v>

3423
02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:45.340
<v Speaker 5>that shows where there's a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theory that most of the time </v>

3424
02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:49.240
<v Speaker 5>it's in competence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's human and competence more than </v>

3425
02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:51.881
<v Speaker 5>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you got a guy that's just </v>

3426
02:42:51.881 --> 02:42:54.131
<v Speaker 5>making up sign language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit standing three feet away from the </v>

3427
02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:54.131
<v Speaker 5>president who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3428
02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:54.650
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go back in his past,</v>

3429
02:42:54.651 --> 02:42:59.651
<v Speaker 5>turns out that he was arrested for </v>
<v Speaker 5>murder and he might've been also </v>

3430
02:42:59.651 --> 02:43:00.950
<v Speaker 5>responsible for rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like all these crazy accusations</v>

3431
02:43:00.951 --> 02:43:02.120
<v Speaker 5>about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a violence,</v>

3432
02:43:02.121 --> 02:43:07.121
<v Speaker 5>gets a frantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'd already been arrested at one other </v>

3433
02:43:07.121 --> 02:43:07.121
<v Speaker 5>time for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very same thing.</v>

3434
02:43:07.121 --> 02:43:08.480
<v Speaker 5>He got in trouble rather for doing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>very same thing.</v>

3435
02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.170
<v Speaker 5>He did it before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how he got there.</v>

3436
02:43:11.171 --> 02:43:16.171
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who hired him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had done that before we had gone </v>

3437
02:43:16.171 --> 02:43:16.171
<v Speaker 5>up and pretended to be a sign language </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

3438
02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:18.230
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're given all,</v>

3439
02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:23.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're telling obama something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because remember when you went to south </v>

3440
02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:25.440
<v Speaker 3>America and his guys got busted for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes.</v>

3441
02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:27.930
<v Speaker 5>Well that was actually secret service </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

3442
02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:33.190
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe some of the people that get </v>

3443
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:35.891
<v Speaker 3>next to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not really being vetted very </v>

3444
02:43:35.891 --> 02:43:35.891
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

3445
02:43:35.891 --> 02:43:36.120
<v Speaker 5>I certainly think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's incompetence.</v>

3446
02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I was saying,</v>

3447
02:43:37.171 --> 02:43:42.171
<v Speaker 5>I think there's more than competence in </v>
<v Speaker 5>government than we would ever imagine </v>

3448
02:43:42.171 --> 02:43:45.880
<v Speaker 5>and when you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can tell that the smart </v>

3449
02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:46.680
<v Speaker 5>guide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wizards there,</v>

3450
02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:50.040
<v Speaker 5>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they're smart in some ways,</v>

3451
02:43:50.041 --> 02:43:51.750
<v Speaker 5>but I think in order to fuck people </v>
<v Speaker 5>over,</v>

3452
02:43:51.751 --> 02:43:53.430
<v Speaker 5>you have to be a liar in order to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lawyer.</v>

3453
02:43:53.431 --> 02:43:55.650
<v Speaker 5>You got a lot of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's any people,</v>

3454
02:43:55.740 --> 02:44:00.740
<v Speaker 5>any people that are dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are honest with themselves because </v>

3455
02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:03.291
<v Speaker 5>if they're honest with themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would recognize the terrible </v>

3456
02:44:03.291 --> 02:44:05.811
<v Speaker 5>feeling that comes along with leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaving a legacy of of sadness and </v>

3457
02:44:05.811 --> 02:44:10.761
<v Speaker 5>destruction behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaving a legacy of people upset about </v>

3458
02:44:10.761 --> 02:44:10.980
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your personal actions.</v>

3459
02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:13.200
<v Speaker 5>That's not a Way to be in harmony with </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

3460
02:44:13.201 --> 02:44:15.280
<v Speaker 5>That's not a way to be happy and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>why people,</v>

3461
02:44:15.350 --> 02:44:17.930
<v Speaker 3>but it is for those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said earlier,</v>

3462
02:44:17.931 --> 02:44:19.400
<v Speaker 3>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get over.</v>

3463
02:44:19.610 --> 02:44:21.950
<v Speaker 3>That is a joy for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3464
02:44:21.951 --> 02:44:26.450
<v Speaker 3>In that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those people are either die that</v>

3465
02:44:26.451 --> 02:44:31.451
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just ride that bitch right into the </v>

3466
02:44:31.451 --> 02:44:31.451
<v Speaker 3>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my fuck you.</v>

3467
02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:32.840
<v Speaker 3>That's all there is,</v>

3468
02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:38.440
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think even those people are not </v>

3469
02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.480
<v Speaker 5>optimally happy and they they probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>in some way in the back of the head </v>

3470
02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:40.970
<v Speaker 5>realized that maybe they drank it away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they pill it away,</v>

3471
02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:46.330
<v Speaker 5>but the way to be happy is to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>people around you feel happy and that's </v>

3472
02:44:46.330 --> 02:44:46.550
<v Speaker 5>not the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just by fucking people over and when you</v>

3473
02:44:46.551 --> 02:44:50.270
<v Speaker 5>have a million dollars or a billion </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars and you got so much money in the</v>

3474
02:44:50.271 --> 02:44:55.271
<v Speaker 5>bank that you can't even spend it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to notice the </v>

3475
02:44:55.271 --> 02:44:58.391
<v Speaker 5>victories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're doing is just continuing to </v>

3476
02:44:58.391 --> 02:44:58.391
<v Speaker 5>play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>

3477
02:44:58.391 --> 02:45:00.080
<v Speaker 5>that's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you became super wealthy,</v>

3478
02:45:00.350 --> 02:45:04.990
<v Speaker 5>do you mean you went from being this </v>
<v Speaker 5>person who struggled with and you know,</v>

3479
02:45:05.010 --> 02:45:10.010
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're really fucking in in poverty and </v>

3480
02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:10.010
<v Speaker 5>then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

3481
02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:10.790
<v Speaker 5>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible wealth.</v>

3482
02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.350
<v Speaker 5>Once the dust settles you still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roseanne is still rosanna.</v>

3483
02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:16.280
<v Speaker 5>You got to deal with new bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're still,</v>

3484
02:45:16.281 --> 02:45:16.640
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

3485
02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm still me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know if he's still doing it.</v>

3486
02:45:19.481 --> 02:45:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Destroyed my nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

3487
02:45:21.671 --> 02:45:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I love to charge a harrison said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one time,</v>

3488
02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:26.680
<v Speaker 3>but they said the beetle thing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3489
02:45:26.681 --> 02:45:31.681
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cost was our nervous system because </v>

3490
02:45:31.681 --> 02:45:31.681
<v Speaker 3>of the fame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pressure.</v>

3491
02:45:31.681 --> 02:45:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of pressure.</v>

3492
02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:35.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of fame and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't handle it.</v>

3493
02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if I can even know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck it was.</v>

3494
02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed like another bullshit </v>

3495
02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:44.160
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3496
02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:44.160
<v Speaker 5>How old were you when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you hit,</v>

3497
02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:47.660
<v Speaker 5>when it really got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the same thing</v>

3498
02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:50.080
<v Speaker 3>saying I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3499
02:45:50.081 --> 02:45:51.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3500
02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did go all the way.</v>

3501
02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:55.300
<v Speaker 3>fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First thing I did,</v>

3502
02:45:55.301 --> 02:46:00.301
<v Speaker 3>I started like a given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started giving away the fucking money </v>

3503
02:46:00.370 --> 02:46:05.370
<v Speaker 3>because I have like basic beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they were all sold out and </v>

3504
02:46:05.370 --> 02:46:07.570
<v Speaker 3>compromise now I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3505
02:46:07.571 --> 02:46:09.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta you do this,</v>

3506
02:46:09.521 --> 02:46:14.521
<v Speaker 3>set this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I set up all of these crazy fucking </v>

3507
02:46:14.521 --> 02:46:17.060
<v Speaker 3>nonprofit organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used my money to like,</v>

3508
02:46:17.061 --> 02:46:17.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3509
02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:19.430
<v Speaker 3>try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to do what I,</v>

3510
02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:23.330
<v Speaker 3>what I really thought I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3511
02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:28.390
<v Speaker 3>blows against the empire shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was so fun because it's lIke </v>

3512
02:46:28.390 --> 02:46:30.230
<v Speaker 3>being a pirate or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3513
02:46:30.231 --> 02:46:31.880
<v Speaker 3>of course there's a certain time where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3514
02:46:31.881 --> 02:46:34.780
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a face lift.</v>

3515
02:46:36.330 --> 02:46:39.560
<v Speaker 3>And then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I got all gm mode like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got fucking gem mode.</v>

3517
02:46:42.901 --> 02:46:46.270
<v Speaker 3>It was exciting and especially because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pills I gave you,</v>

3518
02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:49.610
<v Speaker 3>they give you these fucking awesome </v>
<v Speaker 3>painkillers and shit.</v>

3519
02:46:50.290 --> 02:46:53.300
<v Speaker 3>So I just kept having more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery and you know,</v>

3520
02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:56.020
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of uh,</v>

3521
02:46:56.810 --> 02:47:00.200
<v Speaker 3>psychotropic drugs and like I used </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking three or four.</v>

3522
02:47:00.390 --> 02:47:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I about 15 nervous breakdowns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luckily no one noticed.</v>

3523
02:47:06.460 --> 02:47:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry my fucking family around me </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticing any difference.</v>

3524
02:47:09.540 --> 02:47:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you categorize that miss nervous </v>

3525
02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:14.540
<v Speaker 3>breakdowns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3526
02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:17.480
<v Speaker 3>they were a shitload of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of pressure.</v>

3527
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:18.830
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3528
02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:20.720
<v Speaker 3>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3529
02:47:20.721 --> 02:47:25.721
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I admire people who are handling it </v>

3530
02:47:25.721 --> 02:47:25.721
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why don't you get up to that certain</v>

3531
02:47:25.721 --> 02:47:26.300
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3532
02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:28.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying a lot of people,</v>

3533
02:47:28.671 --> 02:47:31.670
<v Speaker 3>they don't survive that level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would see that,</v>

3534
02:47:31.671 --> 02:47:32.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

3535
02:47:32.730 --> 02:47:36.810
<v Speaker 5>like when you see a miley cyrus going </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy or a justin bieber going crazy and</v>

3536
02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:38.520
<v Speaker 5>everybody has their own criticisms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

3537
02:47:38.521 --> 02:47:40.220
<v Speaker 5>you have a particular way of looking at </v>

3553
02:48:12.621 --> 02:48:14.791
<v Speaker 5>face everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like justin bieber can take a shit </v>

<v Speaker 5>without someone having a camera in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>toilet.</v>

3555
02:48:14.791 --> 02:48:15.930

<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

3556
02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:18.090

3557
02:48:18.130 --> 02:48:23.130
<v Speaker 3>That's like a stocking,</v>

3558
02:48:23.130 --> 02:48:24.940

3559
02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:26.470
<v Speaker 3>cause that'd be some good ratings.</v>

02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Well they also feel like they're allowed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

3561
02:48:27.930 --> 02:48:32.930
<v Speaker 5>They're allowed to just shove cameras in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your face because you're the famous </v>

3562
02:48:32.930 --> 02:48:32.930
