00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unprecedented occurrence here.</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett was on his way and not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he run into ridiculous traffic,</v>

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:12.001
<v Speaker 1>but Josh is so gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drives a 1969 automobile around and </v>

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.610
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately got a flat tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drove that bitch all the way up </v>

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.861
<v Speaker 1>because it work on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could throw that pitch all the way </v>

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:19.861
<v Speaker 1>from Orange County.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that on a regular basis.</v>

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought the thing to be a daily driver,</v>

8
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I got kind of tired of how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't drive anything </v>

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 2>passionless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just want to drive an old car.</v>

11
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

12
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I liked the simplicity of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the noise.</v>

13
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I like the feel of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

14
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>And plus it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not anything super special.</v>

15
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a bunch of fancy motard </v>
<v Speaker 2>outbreaks and all.</v>

16
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all pretty much old school </v>

17
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what I'm dealing with and</v>

18
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can fix it.</v>

19
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Not a problem.</v>

20
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't bother you.</v>

21
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a long time for those things to</v>

22
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 3>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to brace,</v>

23
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta account</v>

24
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is true.</v>

25
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

26
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to driving old cars all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

27
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I've driven a lot worse than this and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>so it will be four wheel disc brakes.</v>

29
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 2>It's still going to take way longer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop and say my challenger,</v>

30
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm okay with that.</v>

37
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 3>like when you want to start it and start</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I didn't really get to see that head</v>

120
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>get crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where,</v>

121
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 2>where can I pick that up at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

122
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 2>what movies got that in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

123
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 2>the faces of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get into all that?</v>

124
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Actually I was more into like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian,</v>

125
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.991
<v Speaker 2>like full cheese Zombie movies and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're horrible and the dubbing is </v>

126
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 2>the worst ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

127
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 2>people are like vomiting out their </v>
<v Speaker 2>insights,</v>

128
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaginas start talking and eating things,</v>

129
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's a movie,</v>

130
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 2>you should probably see it.</v>

131
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 3>And there was a whole series in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was the sixties and the </v>

132
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.060
<v Speaker 3>seventies of just what they would call </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gore movies.</v>

133
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 3>What movies were unbelievably gory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember I picked up a magazine </v>

134
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 3>about at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

135
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:52.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of those just looking through</v>

136
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 3>random magazines like what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

137
00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 3>like Fangoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was all about one type of</v>

138
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Gore film at this one duties to make it</v>

139
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>herschell Gordon Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that hasn't maniacs.</v>

140
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

141
00:06:04.591 --> 00:06:06.250
<v Speaker 2>the wizard of Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 2>And so he came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

143
00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 2>when they were making like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're x rated at the time,</v>

144
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.700
<v Speaker 2>they weren't hardcore but like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these exploitation films at one point,</v>

145
00:06:14.701 --> 00:06:16.800
<v Speaker 2>and then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't enough.</v>

146
00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So they created this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed people getting their tongues</v>

147
00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:24.090
<v Speaker 2>cutoff and I mean they're really cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bad,</v>

148
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>but still starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back then it really fucked people's </v>

149
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>minds up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

150
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was,</v>

151
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just,</v>

152
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.660
<v Speaker 2>that was their new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden the audience was flipped</v>

153
00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:35.160
<v Speaker 2>out about it and they had to get more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

154
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing that as a little kid </v>

155
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woo,</v>

156
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 1>fuck wants to wash this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is just disturbing.</v>

157
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I understand a good Zombie movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good vampire movie,</v>

158
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something fun.</v>

159
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck wants to watch people just </v>

160
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.610
<v Speaker 1>get chopped up like that.</v>

161
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people know with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>with you've got the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

163
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.680
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

164
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Eli Roth thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a torture film.</v>

165
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.830
<v Speaker 2>But they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

166
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Which I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done.</v>

167
00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:08.781
<v Speaker 2>Two of them I think were the travelers </v>
<v Speaker 2>end up in Romania and then they get into</v>

168
00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 2>some place by hobbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hostile.</v>

169
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only saw the first one.</v>

171
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

172
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 2>and then of course even the rich people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will pay to the court.</v>

173
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.540
<v Speaker 2>But honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really it's all the women's fault.</v>

174
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.250
<v Speaker 2>The chicks lured them in those course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vagina ruins lives.</v>

175
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.110
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly can,</v>

176
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go up for a piece of strange and you</v>

177
00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 2>get a fucking splinters shoved into your</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>

178
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>

179
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no protection for that.</v>

180
00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't make a condom for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

181
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

182
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you fought all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

183
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fun Russia,</v>

184
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I have never fallen Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.840
<v Speaker 1>do you ever hear he's hearing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of going to the hospital and</v>

186
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 1>it looked like dawn of he dead bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>laying out there and just stitching </v>

187
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>people up in front of you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

188
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love bodies like laying on,</v>

189
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>on like vodka probably for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiseptic.</v>

190
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was during the dark age when </v>

191
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:05.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think times were really fucking </v>

193
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>hard there for a long time.</v>

194
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's still some of that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be found over in Russia because it's </v>

195
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 2>such a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

196
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.010
<v Speaker 2>and class at this point it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uber rich and then there's not,</v>

197
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.780
<v Speaker 2>not really a middleclass to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding people.</v>

198
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.050
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm moving like hostile works</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

199
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you look at these pretty girls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

200
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.180
<v Speaker 2>if they were really cold hearted killers</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Russia,</v>

201
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 2>they could sneak you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull your butt cheeks apart until you </v>

202
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.371
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they really are that people </v>

203
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:40.191
<v Speaker 2>that are willing to pay people to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>about thinking about all the perverted </v>

204
00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 2>shit that we think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

205
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:46.761
<v Speaker 2>And then we go and then we go look up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and watch on the Internet while </v>

206
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 2>masturbating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak for yourself.</v>

207
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Some of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of us are easily amused.</v>

208
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing being is that you can </v>

209
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.870
<v Speaker 2>think of all kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>

210
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 2>weird fetish and there is at least a </v>
<v Speaker 2>handful of people out there.</v>

211
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:04.491
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you can imagine someone's </v>

212
00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:04.491
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

213
00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't imagine someone being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to organize a place where you could</v>

214
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:11.531
<v Speaker 1>actually go to torture people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like somebody is going to tell </v>

215
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>

216
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

218
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't put anything past humanity is </v>

219
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.521
<v Speaker 2>the most fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the most beautiful thing is easily </v>

220
00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:21.680
<v Speaker 2>as one of the other.</v>

221
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the Bohemian Grove </v>
<v Speaker 1>footage?</v>

222
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anything about Bohemian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grove?</v>

223
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a bunch of hippies.</v>

224
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the opposite.</v>

225
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of like banker type dudes and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dignitaries from foreign countries and,</v>

226
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.430
<v Speaker 1>and like skull and bones type dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get together and who knows what the</v>

227
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:42.370
<v Speaker 1>fuck is really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have this giant Molek,</v>

228
00:09:42.371 --> 00:09:44.860
<v Speaker 1>the owl God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all dress up in robes.</v>

229
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

230
00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 1>it's been proven that there's a secret.</v>

231
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like larping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>larping,</v>

232
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.920
<v Speaker 2>larping black factored roleplaying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

233
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.260
<v Speaker 2>running around</v>

234
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>when these guys that are in skull and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and there's a lot of weird,</v>

235
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ritualistic shit that they are doing.</v>

236
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And apparently they're literally are </v>

<v Speaker 1>filmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking people are.</v>

239
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>They're burning in effigy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have sticks wrapped up there,</v>

240
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>burning it for the sacrifice of the owl </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

241
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

242
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.770
<v Speaker 1>he's like millionaires and it's</v>

243
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't have chose something </v>

244
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 2>better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Molex a bad motherfucker,</v>

245
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've never.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

248
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.050
<v Speaker 2>but why not a grizzly bear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would definitely be scary than it.</v>

249
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 2>That will totally be scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it even gnarlier noise.</v>

250
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:46.881
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't sound scary and it took a long </v>

251
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:49.521
<v Speaker 2>time from Allah kill you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably would win if you had to go toe </v>

252
00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:50.300
<v Speaker 2>to toe in an owl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put my money on myself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it could flesh out whenever we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about what we're talking about </v>

<v Speaker 2>life and death and kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill it.</v>

257
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.610
<v Speaker 2>But even a small brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black bear,</v>

258
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll fuck you up man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of bears are scared of you so you </v>

259
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:09.620
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about them as much.</v>

260
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.030
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to have like a cougar sized cat is like </v>

<v Speaker 2>my pet.</v>

265
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean like pet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want to lock it around on a </v>

266
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.201
<v Speaker 2>leash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want someone to break into my </v>

267
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:30.201
<v Speaker 2>house while I'm gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know the,</v>

268
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>the variation being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you got your dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the Robert Breaks in or whatever</v>

<v Speaker 2>the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they run away.</v>

271
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Well the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drama breaks in,</v>

272
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 2>she's keeps stealing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

273
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:44.751
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unhooking your TV and all of this and </v>

274
00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:47.780
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden there's going to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that roar from a Puma and it's on his </v>

275
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>neck just murdering him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you come home and you're like,</v>

276
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see you had someone to play with while</v>

277
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I was gone.</v>

278
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.030
<v Speaker 1>They see that if you see a mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

279
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>that it's very likely that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to attack you if you see him </v>

280
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that a pcs,</v>

281
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might not be able to resist it.</v>

282
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he knows that you don't know what the</v>

283
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:12.481
<v Speaker 1>fuck has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that rush of just creeping up on </v>

284
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:15.421
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jack knew bushwhacking speech so </v>

285
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:15.421
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they love.</v>

286
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:16.020
<v Speaker 1>So what they should do is I should get</v>

287
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.140
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions to be the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread the gospel of Jesus around </v>

288
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.140
<v Speaker 2>because then nobody would know that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were around.</v>

289
00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.450
<v Speaker 2>They could sneak up on you and I,</v>

290
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been to talk about our Lord </v>

291
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.680
<v Speaker 1>and Savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

292
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.680
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where'd you come from?</v>

293
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.150
<v Speaker 1>They would do it a little differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they would introduce you to them </v>

294
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.521
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least if you get killed by a cat </v>

295
00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill you know,</v>

296
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.700
<v Speaker 1>barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just start eating it.</v>

297
00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Just hold it down and start eating you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

298
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot more of a pain in the ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

299
00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:47.601
<v Speaker 1>But that guy in Africa student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got eaten by a bear fucked up by </v>

300
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

301
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>they dragged him a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged him a mile,</v>

302
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.460
<v Speaker 1>beat the fucking shit out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged them under a fence and then </v>

303
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>dragged them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we blame Kubrick for that?</v>

304
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these chimps were all problem chimps.</v>

305
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.390
<v Speaker 1>They were all chimps that had been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>zoo's and captivity.</v>

306
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to reintroduce that CDC</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

307
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Champs should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody should have a problem.</v>

308
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Chips are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

309
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:19.010
<v Speaker 1>They're not even wild chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps that they're trying to </v>

310
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:19.610
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce the wild zoo champs circus </v>
<v Speaker 1>champions.</v>

311
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed therapy.</v>

312
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>And then these chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

313
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 1>They finally got issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those chimps,</v>

314
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.070
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they get milk,</v>

315
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.170
<v Speaker 1>mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're naturally a supposed to be in </v>

316
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.681
<v Speaker 1>a wild situation where you're all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts are tuned into protecting </v>

317
00:13:37.681 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking around,</v>

318
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>making sure that nothing sneaking up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and yet you live in front of a giant</v>

319
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 1>glass wall where every day these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>pink monkeys are staring at you and your</v>

320
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 1>senses are going off and you have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the fuck to do.</v>

321
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>He just becomes normal and you get used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>

322
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but every day you probably go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably crazy.</v>

323
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's completely unnatural environment</v>

324
00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:00.270
<v Speaker 2>because they have the the higher brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to to to to logically work out </v>

325
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're at,</v>

326
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:08.551
<v Speaker 2>how this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this whole deal works and how many </v>

327
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:08.551
<v Speaker 2>of them are or abused.</v>

328
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of them get abused.</v>

329
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:13.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the scenario that took place in </v>

330
00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that a planet of the apes movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most recent one was that one guy was</v>

331
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:16.290
<v Speaker 1>an asshole spraying the champs with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hose.</v>

332
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they the news,</v>

333
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure they're assholes too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should.</v>

334
00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>They do country things and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking spray the chimp with a hose.</v>

335
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't doubt that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen him raping frogs?</v>

336
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

337
00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fuck a frog.</v>

338
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Who put them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do?</v>

339
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Throw the frog in there at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like monkey ruthless frog.</v>

340
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it was just a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrence.</v>

341
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:41.430
<v Speaker 1>The frog just fucked up and wound up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

342
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.820
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like a thing where you can't </v>

343
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:46.820
<v Speaker 1>climb out.</v>

344
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's some like 19 year old</v>

345
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>zookeeper dip shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like people and animals.</v>

346
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>What a strange combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real weird if we find </v>

347
00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.281
<v Speaker 1>out that something much smarter than us </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're going to have to figure </v>

348
00:15:00.281 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 1>out how to convince it to not put us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a zoo.</v>

349
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I think about the way we treat all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's just barely a little less.</v>

350
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>A little less than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that they would have to be</v>

351
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 1>convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we do it to ourselves anyways,</v>

352
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>probably reality television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

353
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.200
<v Speaker 1>the idea of sticking out behind a cage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and letting us act like the biggest </v>

355
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.240
<v Speaker 1>assholes we could possibly think of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally in New Jersey.</v>

356
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

359
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.380
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways or that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeal is that you don't know anybody </v>

360
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:34.380
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

361

<v Speaker 1>You're not introducing anybody like </v>

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 1>those idiots in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet you can watch them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty complex for calling </v>

369
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>another won't really common common and </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's very common,</v>

371
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 1>but the guy was joe who's calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Josephine,</v>

372
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.200

<v Speaker 1>If anybody like that was talking to your</v>

377
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:16.511
<v Speaker 1>house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would immediately start mocking them </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other cultures have been doing things</v>

<v Speaker 1>stick fucking robots.</v>

414
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 2>You're living in a jungle and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even trying to be about </v>

<v Speaker 2>modernization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just living your life.</v>

476
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.241
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old does that make you feel to have </v>

477
00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:27.241
<v Speaker 3>that very old,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

480
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.360
<v Speaker 2>we've lived through arrows and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar with,</v>

481
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>with evolutions of fashion as it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just we've seen,</v>

482
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not nearly as preposterous.</v>

483
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

484
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:47.451

<v Speaker 2>And yet and not nearly as offensive </v>

485
00:20:47.451 --> 00:20:49.970
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we started off on from [inaudible] </v>

486
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.211
<v Speaker 2>77,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I remember when bell bottoms are </v>

487
00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:53.370
<v Speaker 2>still kind of hanging around and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>mork and mindy vest,</v>

<v Speaker 2>into the eighties and they're like the,</v>

490

492
00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 2>all the androgynous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was the super tight stuff.</v>

493
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.970
<v Speaker 2>There was a really colorful stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like everything.</v>

494
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 2>The girls that look like Nagel </v>
<v Speaker 2>paintings.</v>

495
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.460

496
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.961
<v Speaker 2>nineties and then it just got okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sagging pants and like weird odd colors </v>

497
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 2>and shoulder pads and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the 2000 and then you start.</v>

498
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Now we start combining fashion stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

499
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.090
<v Speaker 2>from classic era's and Amin all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is making all kinds of comebacks.</v>

500

<v Speaker 3>That's the least understandable rockstar</v>

505
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:46.530
<v Speaker 3>on</v>

506
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.660
<v Speaker 2>stage and you're sagging your jeans a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and you're looking like </v>

507
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 2>particular you're deliberately trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like,</v>

508
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 2>like you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a pile of shit,</v>

509
00:21:56.051 --> 00:22:01.051
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of thrown together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just sloppy son of a bitch on </v>

510
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

511
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To a degree when you were like a size 30</v>

512
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.420
<v Speaker 2>waist and you've got 40 genes on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just piled around your ankles </v>

513
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 2>and just what the fuck are you thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>of buying like quadruplex shirts that </v>

514
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.360
<v Speaker 2>hang down past your knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who wears shirts that are so </v>

515
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.301
<v Speaker 2>big that it covers their whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women do when they sleep at night and </v>

516
00:22:27.301 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pregnant yet or when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant,</v>

517
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:34.591
<v Speaker 2>they were that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or girls wear that when you're like 14 </v>

518
00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:34.591
<v Speaker 2>your 90 shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

519
00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Silly Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got to pants you.</v>

520
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You push you over and pull your shirt </v>

521
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:41.970
<v Speaker 3>over the top of your face and then give </v>
<v Speaker 3>you nuggets.</v>

522
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.680
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

523
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.010
<v Speaker 3>and I can't believe it's still around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense and I think it has</v>

524
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:53.011
<v Speaker 3>something to do with the fact that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not fulfilling our hunter gatherer </v>

525
00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:55.890
<v Speaker 3>jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hunter gatherer genes are being </v>

526
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:55.890
<v Speaker 3>ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 genes,</v>

527
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>$100 jeans are sagging our warrior </v>
<v Speaker 3>genes.</v>

528
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.910
<v Speaker 3>They're not being fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have all these genetic impulses </v>

529
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 3>that are all suppressed and so what do </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do?</v>

530
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.570
<v Speaker 3>What goes off in aberrations and some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some aberrations are like sagging jeans.</v>

531
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.480
<v Speaker 3>They do stupid shit because they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're not.</v>

532
00:23:09.481 --> 00:23:14.481
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were out in fucking Alaska and </v>

533
00:23:14.481 --> 00:23:14.481
<v Speaker 3>you were running away from bears all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

534
00:23:14.481 --> 00:23:16.340
<v Speaker 3>you would have your belt buckles cinched</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

<v Speaker 3>have your fucking boots tied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk outside the door and you would the </v>

<v Speaker 3>asshole because I don't have anything to</v>

00:25:26.801 --> 00:25:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And they disagree because you made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>definite statement.</v>

583
00:25:28.901 --> 00:25:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You took a stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made yourself,</v>

584
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think black is the new.</v>

585
00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

586
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.470
<v Speaker 2>If you think differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

587
00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:37.150
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get into an argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

588
00:25:37.151 --> 00:25:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I might run you over with my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

589
00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:40.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is how I feel about it.</v>

590
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.570
<v Speaker 2>If you say I kind of thing that I get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

591
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 2>it gives you that wiggle room that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can fucking slinkier way out.</v>

592
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.330
<v Speaker 2>You can use your greased up and slide it</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the door kind of.</v>

593
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Speaker 2>And I fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a common part of speech at </v>

594
00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:58.450
<v Speaker 2>this point that even I find myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>

595
00:25:58.451 --> 00:26:01.930
<v Speaker 2>and kind of here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't stand it.</v>

596
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I hate when I catch myself saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

597
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not all about the like either,</v>

598
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of this sort of that and no,</v>

599
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.900
<v Speaker 2>it isn't kind of or sorta anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of shit in this world is not Kinda </v>

600
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:15.970
<v Speaker 2>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is.</v>

601
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.060
<v Speaker 2>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get away from that.</v>

602
00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>

603
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a huge pet peeve of mine </v>

604
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 2>dealing with people on a regular basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

605
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.100
<v Speaker 2>it's so much easier for someone to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

606
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Always have the ability to excuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves from it.</v>

607
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:38.130
<v Speaker 2>So that way they don't ever have to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brunt of the responsibility either </v>

608
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:38.170
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

609
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.560
<v Speaker 3>reason for not liking that and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's that you would hate to see ever</v>

610
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>in yourself.</v>

611
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weakness we've all been seeing.</v>

612
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well done.</v>

613
00:26:46.961 --> 00:26:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Those things are all done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

614
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the difference being is when you</v>

615
00:26:51.701 --> 00:26:53.230
<v Speaker 2>realize that that was bullshit.</v>

616
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learned.</v>

617
00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people aren't learning some and</v>

618
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where they need to.</v>

619
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Someone needs to kick him in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody needs to say,</v>

620
00:27:00.651 --> 00:27:02.540
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to catch the fuck up.</v>

621
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn from your mistakes and then </v>

622
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.540
<v Speaker 1>improve and move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a continual cycle of </v>

623
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.750
<v Speaker 1>failing and trying to get back on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse and failing.</v>

624
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It's learned how to ride a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

625
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not how many times you fall off the</v>

626
00:27:15.621 --> 00:27:17.210
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall off the fucking horse again.</v>

627
00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Train the Horse,</v>

628
00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:23.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ride the horse right and don't fall off </v>

629
00:27:23.951 --> 00:27:25.961
<v Speaker 1>the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be Christopher if you keep </v>

630
00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:25.961
<v Speaker 1>falling off horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you want to get a horse to</v>

631
00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:27.460
<v Speaker 1>jump over some shit that he doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jump over.</v>

632
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I will never understand that</v>

633
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

634
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot to say that you could master</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal like that,</v>

635
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.010
<v Speaker 2>but it is a massive fucking animal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he doesn't want to do what it wants</v>

636
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:40.930
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how are you?</v>

637
00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.630
<v Speaker 2>How do you think it's great that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>use our intellect to control this thing,</v>

638
00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:46.910
<v Speaker 2>but when it came down to the physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects,</v>

639
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 2>like you can't make a fucking horse do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it doesn't want to know.</v>

640
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Pullover shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>

641
00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:55.781
<v Speaker 1>if you run a trail horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want the horse to ride on the trail </v>

642
00:27:55.781 --> 00:27:58.730
<v Speaker 1>horse with a 200 pound man on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not that big a deal for a </v>

643
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.650
<v Speaker 1>horse and they can safely walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you want a horse to jump over shit.</v>

644
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.680
<v Speaker 1>You want it to fly through the air with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a person the back.</v>

645
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's what?</v>

647
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:10.190
<v Speaker 1>What if you ever tried?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of other shit,</v>

648
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cars are great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have breaks there.</v>

651
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 2>They're fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They learn how to steer the very </v>

652
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 2>predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fucking animal.</v>

653
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Some crazy might of its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wants to jump for whatever </v>

654
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

<v Speaker 2>have you ever been to a Sushi </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant?</v>

699
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does every woman in la?</v>

700
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Why don't eat fucking raw fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>

701
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Because it's what other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think every other woman in La.</v>

702
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Those really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

703
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was because it was now me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>

704
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go eat Sushi.</v>

705
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't wake up one day and just </v>

706
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

707
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:35.641
<v Speaker 2>I might use to want fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say yes to everything </v>

708
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:37.410
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

709
00:30:37.411 --> 00:30:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I forced me and it was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

710
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

711
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 1>what do you even like the other one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing he like almost above everything </v>

712
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.850
<v Speaker 1>else during your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your diet or you'd be fairly clean,</v>

713
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 1>like nutrition minded or flavor?</v>

714
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to be both.</v>

715
00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do really enjoy the red meat hamburger</v>

716
00:31:00.721 --> 00:31:05.721
<v Speaker 2>or steak or you can do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty personal too with that,</v>

717
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:06.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

718
00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.630
<v Speaker 2>So most satisfying food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one thing is,</v>

719
00:31:09.631 --> 00:31:10.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

720
00:31:10.801 --> 00:31:15.280
<v Speaker 2>or if I just had some serious piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass,</v>

721
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:20.390
<v Speaker 2>the very next thing I want to hand to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing I want is a fucking him </v>

722
00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've left.</v>

723
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I've left departments at odd hours of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night just tracking down any 24 hour</v>

724
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Carl's Jr and Jack in the box because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need a fucking hamburger immediately.</v>

725
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with the late night hamburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I switched over,</v>

726
00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I try to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to eat some chicken sandwiches.</v>

727
00:31:42.721 --> 00:31:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat like a carl's jr chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich or something like that.</v>

728
00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:50.001
<v Speaker 1>But the progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either in and out or Wendy's and </v>

729
00:31:50.001 --> 00:31:50.001
<v Speaker 1>the other tapping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

730
00:31:50.001 --> 00:31:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't do Mcdonald's burgers too.</v>

731
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't almost.</v>

732
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I almost never eat any of that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest.</v>

733
00:31:55.511 --> 00:31:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to have a burger,</v>

734
00:31:57.581 --> 00:32:02.581
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of places I could go that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that meat is a lot healthier and </v>

735
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I understand also the idea of keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs at those so far overboard in terms</v>

736
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 2>of what corporations is people try to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save a buck.</v>

737
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Basically you through all integrity out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the window,</v>

738
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:16.510
<v Speaker 2>so I can't support them</v>

739
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

740
00:32:17.661 --> 00:32:22.661
<v Speaker 1>That's not even a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen those pictures where they </v>

741
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:24.731
<v Speaker 1>could take a Mcdonald's burger and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they track it for six months and it </v>

742
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:24.731
<v Speaker 1>doesn't rot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just sits there.</v>

743
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I heard I did read about that because my</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy did the same thing in his gym,</v>

744
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 2>a crossfit breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took the Bergens,</v>

745
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.310
<v Speaker 2>left it there and it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I read something about,</v>

746
00:32:34.311 --> 00:32:36.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got so much salt in it,</v>

747
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>so it's more of a salt thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

748
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.840
<v Speaker 2>They said the weirdest thing about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't really the Burger.</v>

749
00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 2>It's thought that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not molding.</v>

750
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:50.290
<v Speaker 2>That's where that's the most fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the whole thing and you should </v>

751
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:50.720
<v Speaker 2>really be the most worried about putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in your mouth.</v>

752
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Really that phrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured that a piece of bread,</v>

753
00:32:55.110 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can salt meat to a degree that you </v>

754
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it keeps for a long time.</v>

755
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:05.201
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing that forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean long before we had </v>

756
00:33:05.201 --> 00:33:06.280
<v Speaker 2>refrigeration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all meat with salt and pretty much so.</v>

757
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 2>And you can make it into Jerky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bond,</v>

758
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 2>we don't really write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have that kind of shelf life.</v>

759
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>What is the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they putting in there?</v>

760
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 2>So insane preservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

761
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:23.770
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something totally Ireland that you </v>

762
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:23.770
<v Speaker 2>really probably shouldn't be putting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

763
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:28.130
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in order to feed the amount of the </v>

764
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.130
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that we have packed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cities,</v>

765
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.370
<v Speaker 1>like you just drove here from Orange </v>
<v Speaker 1>County,</v>

766
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.720
<v Speaker 1>think of that crazy drive which is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the worst drives in the country as </v>

767
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.181
<v Speaker 1>far as population centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is an enormous amount of </v>

768
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:38.181
<v Speaker 1>people from the four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

769
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 1>five for the five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole area is,</v>

770
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible amount of pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going through</v>

771
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.170
<v Speaker 2>through all these different demographics</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole way.</v>

772
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.410
<v Speaker 2>And the only food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody needs food.</v>

773
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

774
00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:51.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Penn and teller,</v>

775
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:56.821
<v Speaker 2>I love watching of filler bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had their whole thing on </v>

776
00:33:56.821 --> 00:33:57.570
<v Speaker 2>organic food and about how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:02.850
<v Speaker 2>the various chemicals also determined </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's something can be called </v>

778
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.941
<v Speaker 2>organic or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then some certified or things that </v>

779
00:34:05.941 --> 00:34:09.901
<v Speaker 2>can be considered organic in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pesticides are actually worse than that </v>

780
00:34:09.901 --> 00:34:09.901
<v Speaker 2>than the things that they've created </v>
<v Speaker 2>since then.</v>

781
00:34:09.901 --> 00:34:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Well fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's that fine line where if you </v>

782
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take it to this point.</v>

783
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To a degree.</v>

784
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.650
<v Speaker 2>But people take it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

785
00:34:20.651 --> 00:34:25.070
<v Speaker 2>they want to save that extra thirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>cents on the dollar while,</v>

786
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:30.090
<v Speaker 2>or three cents on the dollar and cent on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dollar and pink slime.</v>

787
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:33.420
<v Speaker 2>That should just never be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should just never be excellent.</v>

788
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

789
00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:38.871
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pace that they throw into the </v>

790
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:38.871
<v Speaker 2>burgers.</v>

791
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:38.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally,</v>

792
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:43.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the really gnarly treated with </v>

793
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.780
<v Speaker 1>like ammonia see you kill all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria that's in it.</v>

794
00:34:45.781 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that that's a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous that in a burger.</v>

795
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would they do to fast food burgers?</v>

796
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:53.840
<v Speaker 1>The fillers and all the different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>

797
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck out.</v>

807
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.720
<v Speaker 1>They're equally delicious</v>

808
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.910
<v Speaker 2>in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan.</v>

<v Speaker 2>head?</v>

848
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Started off just getting into metal from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic rock side of things and my </v>

849
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:29.271
<v Speaker 2>dad used to play guitar and just for fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Blues and Classic Rock and grew up </v>

<v Speaker 2>listening to Sabbath and led Zeppelin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Beatles and what have you.</v>

851
00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:38.691
<v Speaker 2>And then I found like this kid that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the son of where my babysitter,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like seen iron gate.</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

857
00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 2>They call him Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember he had this killer's </v>

858
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.250
<v Speaker 2>shirt for the new album killers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott and he's like holding like some </v>

<v Speaker 4>I've got somewhere to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll be right back.</v>

1047
00:47:16.121 --> 00:47:21.121
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't supersized in the morning </v>

1048
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:21.121
<v Speaker 4>thinking about hills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking do it.</v>

1049
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How was the.</v>

1050
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 4>How could anybody consider that to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>something interesting?</v>

1051
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:27.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have that.</v>

1052
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.940
<v Speaker 4>We have an understanding and that I know</v>
<v Speaker 4>a secret that is</v>

1053
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it for entertainment.</v>

1054
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Never understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are into like I can </v>

1055
00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.111
<v Speaker 1>understand wanting to be in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can understand like crossfit </v>

1056
00:47:42.111 --> 00:47:42.111
<v Speaker 1>competitions and stuff like that</v>

1057
00:47:42.111 --> 00:47:47.070
<v Speaker 2>to be the best in the world of working </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and be the best in the world at </v>

1058
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:47.070
<v Speaker 2>doing cleans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1059
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Olympic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1060
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.500
<v Speaker 2>no 100 cleans in a row with 50 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1061
00:47:52.501 --> 00:47:57.270
<v Speaker 2>like we need to know what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here for bodybuilding.</v>

1062
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.540
<v Speaker 2>So is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1063
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has a,</v>

1064
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using the way that they're going</v>

1065
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:08.641
<v Speaker 2>to live for a specific purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'll say I think bodybuilding is </v>

1066
00:48:08.641 --> 00:48:11.321
<v Speaker 2>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the point of putting all that </v>

1067
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:11.780
<v Speaker 2>time and effort to look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look a certain way.</v>

1068
00:48:11.781 --> 00:48:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I never use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got the crossfit,</v>

1069
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:18.170
<v Speaker 2>which is the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing,</v>

1070
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:22.370
<v Speaker 2>but just they're an actual better </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall shape and you know,</v>

1071
00:48:22.371 --> 00:48:27.371
<v Speaker 2>they use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they only use it for more working </v>

1072
00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:29.291
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're basically just jerking off the </v>

1073
00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:30.230
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all anybody is doing.</v>

1074
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 2>They're just jerking themselves off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1075
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1076
00:48:33.381 --> 00:48:38.090
<v Speaker 2>well why don't you body build because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you to look better on screen or do power</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting because you want to be stronger </v>

1078
00:48:43.131 --> 00:48:48.131
<v Speaker 2>and then do crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever workout for your anaerobic </v>

1079
00:48:48.471 --> 00:48:52.610
<v Speaker 2>endurance animal and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like take it and then go play a</v>

1080
00:48:52.611 --> 00:48:56.390
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go play football with your friends or go</v>

1081
00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:01.480
<v Speaker 2>hiking or climbing a mountain or </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling or something like that and </v>

1082
00:49:02.301 --> 00:49:05.690
<v Speaker 2>then apply it into a skilled deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this video where there was,</v>

1083
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:10.950
<v Speaker 2>it was the gist of it was these two nfl </v>
<v Speaker 2>dues are boxers are very.</v>

1084
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Nfl guys are former NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just come from facts and they did </v>

1085
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.631
<v Speaker 2>some prostitute workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crossfit gym in La and they did an </v>

1086
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:23.981
<v Speaker 2>x amount of time then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's our crossfit guys that are </v>

1087
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:26.180
<v Speaker 2>here all the time that the kids did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than the other guys.</v>

1088
00:49:26.181 --> 00:49:29.270
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can catch a fucking football.</v>

1089
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.960
<v Speaker 2>You can just run around with a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like an asshole.</v>

1090
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.080
<v Speaker 2>That's all you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do 100 kipping pull ups.</v>

1091
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a great.</v>

1092
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Well let's just stop you from no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1093
00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:44.570
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are not going to fall into a </v>

1094
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:44.570
<v Speaker 2>stadium and pay millions of dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>

1095
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Pull ups are about someone trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and someone else trying to </v>

1096
00:49:48.421 --> 00:49:51.050
<v Speaker 1>stop them from doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So multifaceted.</v>

1097
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Sort of the competition when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing a bunch of chips.</v>

1098
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.620
<v Speaker 1>No stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says you have chefs and it's,</v>

1099
00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a weird halfway sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

1100
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I can see how it's athletic or conceal </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires willpower and discipline.</v>

1101
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's impressive when got incredible </v>

1102
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:09.800
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would rather,</v>

1103
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I would rather learn a martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather learn how to play a game.</v>

1104
00:50:12.961 --> 00:50:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather learn to do rather learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey anything.</v>

1105
00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of be more input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more going on than just standing</v>

1106
00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:21.210
<v Speaker 1>there doing cleans.</v>

1107
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.270
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it either.</v>

1108
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:30.271
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like that's the you do to make </v>

1109
00:50:30.271 --> 00:50:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you help you be better at the real thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do.</v>

1110
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to.</v>

1111
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 1>I slept competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition in class.</v>

1112
00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Take some intermural basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do something we were talking to play,</v>

1113
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 1>go play a tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do crossfit,</v>

1114
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 2>be in shape and Api the way these days </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape and an API it don't,</v>

1115
00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.930
<v Speaker 2>don't go run around the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1116
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 2>So like don't look at other somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else and be like,</v>

1117
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 2>well when I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know francine and I did Zelda.</v>

1118
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I did it 17 minutes and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1119
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 2>No name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

1120
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:15.700
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>name Tommy and rescue and Nikki's deck,</v>

1121
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.270
<v Speaker 2>like a righteous indignation when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>order the green tea at starbucks.</v>

1122
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even.</v>

1123
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And I think the root,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff isn't doing.</v>

1124
00:51:29.421 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Crossfit isn't doing any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't be any.</v>

1125
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 2>You could substitute crossfit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

1126
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:39.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just something comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets to a certain level where people </v>

1127
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 2>start jumping on it because one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's good or it's bad,</v>

1128
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:47.231
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's new and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and it and it and it is a </v>

1129
00:51:47.231 --> 00:51:50.501
<v Speaker 2>change from what the norm was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so therefore everybody feels like </v>

1130
00:51:50.501 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 2>they're like they're improving who they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1131
00:51:51.591 --> 00:51:56.591
<v Speaker 2>they're they're growing and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of something that's more special </v>

1132
00:51:56.591 --> 00:52:00.730
<v Speaker 2>and therefore then that by a group gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken way out of context and then the </v>

1133
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:04.380
<v Speaker 2>after effects of that are people </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming Douche bags</v>

1134
00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 1>mathematically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broadway,</v>

1135
00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 1>lot of Nice people and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't want to just go to the</v>

1136
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:20.050
<v Speaker 1>gym and lift weights and be bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they take the shitty stuff.</v>

1137
00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's good stuff</v>

1138
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:26.410
<v Speaker 2>not working out and staying healthy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1139
00:52:26.411 --> 00:52:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I love that crossfit is as looked back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to older,</v>

1140
00:52:30.041 --> 00:52:32.880
<v Speaker 2>simpler ways of training and brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to the,</v>

1141
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.000
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the populace.</v>

1142
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I think that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1143
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.710
<v Speaker 2>strongman type stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old schools,</v>

1144
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.910
<v Speaker 2>the old school thought processes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1145
00:52:39.911 --> 00:52:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab heavy shit and lifted,</v>

1146
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:47.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of flawed reasoning in my </v>

1147
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:47.020
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behind some of that too,</v>

1148
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.130
<v Speaker 2>and also like I get so sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I,</v>

1149
00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like a fighter,</v>

1150
00:52:49.481 --> 00:52:50.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you're not,</v>

1151
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>you're not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same trying to choke the </v>

1152
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:56.370
<v Speaker 2>life out of you brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.780
<v Speaker 2>and if you go to kickboxing class at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1154
00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:01.090
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make you a fighter either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fighters are fighters,</v>

1155
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.010
<v Speaker 2>people that do martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial art,</v>

1156
00:53:03.011 --> 00:53:03.700
<v Speaker 2>martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1157
00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:08.701
<v Speaker 2>the train training is know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be realistic and there's nothing </v>

1158
00:53:09.341 --> 00:53:09.820
<v Speaker 2>wrong with that.</v>

1159
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.160
<v Speaker 2>If you're not going to be a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you've trained in martial </v>

1160
00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:15.160
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

1161
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.670
<v Speaker 2>People talk to me about coming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to jam or or whatever.</v>

1162
00:53:18.671 --> 00:53:19.870
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1163
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it because you want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

1164
00:53:21.401 --> 00:53:23.250
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to be a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fighter,</v>

1165
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:24.180
<v Speaker 2>not a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1166
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to every level that you need to,</v>

1167
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 2>which these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably never going to amount to</v>

1168
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:32.310
<v Speaker 2>anything with fighting because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The odds are totally against you,</v>

1169
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:37.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the reason you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Because of success that you think </v>

1170
00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:40.701
<v Speaker 2>are going to get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it because you're driven and you </v>

1171
00:53:40.701 --> 00:53:43.370
<v Speaker 2>love it and you have to do it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way that you can ever fully </v>

1172
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 2>realized that most of your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More people are going to fail,</v>

1173
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:50.631
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but honestly if you are better when you </v>

1174
00:53:50.631 --> 00:53:54.651
<v Speaker 2>end it and when you started and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any regrets and you </v>

1175
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:57.320
<v Speaker 2>absolutely succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get the metals you need to </v>

1176
00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.391
<v Speaker 2>get the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you took you as you stood here today</v>

1177
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and became something better and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>encompassing and have lived a life </v>

1178
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 2>experience because you decided to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and do it like you mean it.</v>

1179
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's hard for people to wrap their</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads around that,</v>

1180
00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go into the gym,</v>

1181
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be better than when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>step off of that than I was when I </v>

1182
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:21.540
<v Speaker 2>stepped on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some days aren't so great.</v>

1183
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Some days are amazing and I also have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this huge mean streak.</v>

1184
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I hate losing whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also.</v>

1185
00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 2>And as much as that is always a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>who I am,</v>

1186
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to temper that and I have to look</v>

1187
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:37.950
<v Speaker 2>at all the data that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I do when I'm in the gym</v>

1188
00:54:37.951 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 2>and then break it down and then be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

1189
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:42.950
<v Speaker 2>But I think that guy he used up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1190
00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:44.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1191
00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:47.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my head I'm thinking I'm going to jab</v>

1192
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 2>the living shit out of that fucker until</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Dick Falls off.</v>

1193
00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:52.440
<v Speaker 2>That's how much I'm going to jab that </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1194
00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jab in so many times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's never been to want to get in the </v>

1195
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:57.460
<v Speaker 2>ring with me ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>

1196
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think this is about training?</v>

1197
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also have to sit back,</v>

1198
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.110
<v Speaker 2>but I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was he able to Jab me?</v>

1199
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 2>What did I do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do,</v>

1200
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this so effective?</v>

1201
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:13.310
<v Speaker 2>How do I take that and make it mine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how do I analyze that and see the </v>

1202
00:55:13.681 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 2>patterns before they become a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1203
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 5>isn't it in the development of a martial</v>
<v Speaker 5>arts to see someone set an incredibly </v>

1204
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.400
<v Speaker 5>high level and realize that that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the market set</v>

1205
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:27.740
<v Speaker 2>can be the best at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's somebody out there,</v>

1206
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:33.310
<v Speaker 2>there's probably plenty of people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that I can just annihilate and </v>

1207
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:38.081
<v Speaker 2>uses the toothpick with their user bones</v>
<v Speaker 2>as tooth toothpicks when I'm done with </v>

1208
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:40.340
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances are they're out of that group of</v>

1209
00:55:40.341 --> 00:55:45.341
<v Speaker 2>people that I'm talking about therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>within that there's things that they do </v>

1210
00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:48.140
<v Speaker 2>better than I do that maybe that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or maybe a couple of things,</v>

1211
00:55:48.141 --> 00:55:53.141
<v Speaker 2>but they're better at it by far so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could look at them and paste something </v>

1212
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:58.721
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter how much better of a </v>

1213
00:55:58.721 --> 00:56:01.121
<v Speaker 2>fighter I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much to be to be seen or </v>

1214
00:56:01.121 --> 00:56:02.090
<v Speaker 2>taken in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a million ways that the body can</v>

1215
00:56:02.091 --> 00:56:07.091
<v Speaker 2>move and one way you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I realized that there's some things </v>

1216
00:56:07.091 --> 00:56:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to be great at because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the physicality,</v>

1217
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.060
<v Speaker 2>physical limitations or injuries or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1218
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:16.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm never going to get with rubber </v>

1219
00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:16.340
<v Speaker 2>guard because my knees are too fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1220
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:22.190
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have torn ligaments sent home and </v>

1221
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:24.371
<v Speaker 2>they're just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been repaired on the right </v>

1222
00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:28.261
<v Speaker 2>before and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't take it if I pull on him </v>

1223
00:56:28.261 --> 00:56:28.370
<v Speaker 2>through our like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll start.</v>

1224
00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 1>It was sent out to like lock master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a man that's got to be kind of </v>

1225
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.130
<v Speaker 1>tricky to be a dry with no injuries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a guy.</v>

1226
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I just need a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have a very good feel for it and </v>

1227
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:46.451
<v Speaker 2>I know what I can get away with and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know a lot of like lost her ankle goes </v>

1228
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:50.921
<v Speaker 2>before it needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my ankles are not the greatest thing </v>

1229
00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:50.921
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1230
00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:54.560
<v Speaker 2>he's just sort of understand what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with and then go from there.</v>

1231
00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:59.620
<v Speaker 2>But I have nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I know that I'm never going to be </v>

1232
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.940
<v Speaker 2>someone that can affect it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like be a good rubber guard guy.</v>

1233
00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I pay attention because Shannon like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use those setups.</v>

1234
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.350
<v Speaker 2>So she's working on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go to her and go,</v>

1235
00:57:09.351 --> 00:57:09.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you,</v>

1236
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get angled like this because look at the</v>

1237
00:57:12.351 --> 00:57:17.351
<v Speaker 2>way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pushes your body weight and your </v>

1238
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:17.390
<v Speaker 2>pressure against their joint there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1239
00:57:17.391 --> 00:57:20.390
<v Speaker 2>and this is where now you're creating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness in them at this angle,</v>

1240
00:57:20.391 --> 00:57:23.600
<v Speaker 2>so you can defeat that angle here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Hey,</v>

1241
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.240
<v Speaker 2>this guy's really good rubber guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Watch how he's going to.</v>

1242
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 2>He's going to try and get these angles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and these positions on you because this </v>

1243
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 2>is where it's going to take you out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1244
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:35.650
<v Speaker 2>So this entire you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeat them because fulcrums levers,</v>

1245
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.730
<v Speaker 2>it's all relative.</v>

1246
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.570
<v Speaker 1>If you work on your flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do,</v>

1247
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.480
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get there.</v>

1248
00:57:42.481 --> 00:57:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm older.</v>

1249
00:57:43.351 --> 00:57:48.351
<v Speaker 1>And how much of a fighter success do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is a timing issue?</v>

1250
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Like getting involved in a sport at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right age time?</v>

1251
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

1252
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is bulldog determination </v>

1253
00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 1>and just your ability to learn from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and despite the bad feelings,</v>

1254
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.750
<v Speaker 2>it's mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>

1255
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.020
<v Speaker 2>mental aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1256
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:12.200
<v Speaker 2>because that's kind of the mental aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the thing that is going to not only </v>

1257
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.410
<v Speaker 2>make you want to fight when you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>quit,</v>

1258
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:18.660
<v Speaker 2>but it'll also be a step back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that all these things,</v>

1259
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:24.140
<v Speaker 2>all these circumstances came about </v>
<v Speaker 2>within these moments and how to take </v>

1260
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.460
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change them,</v>

1261
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:31.500
<v Speaker 2>understand them and make the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes and additions crashes from your </v>

1262
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:35.930
<v Speaker 2>game to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be analytical like that and </v>

1263
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.540
<v Speaker 2>you have to remove emotion from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from those circumstances because when </v>

1264
00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:41.370
<v Speaker 2>she get emotionally attached and worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up about it,</v>

1265
00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:46.371
<v Speaker 2>then it will defeat your ability to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>as useful as possible.</v>

1266
00:58:46.651 --> 00:58:47.580
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1267
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.370
<v Speaker 2>especially in the case of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1268
00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:55.550
<v Speaker 2>most people are never going to be really</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful with fighting if they choose </v>

1269
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 2>that as their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as their,</v>

1270
00:58:55.601 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 2>a pair occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to make the money for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to pay one.</v>

1272
00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it shouldn't hurt somebody.</v>

1273
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.850
<v Speaker 2>They should just do it because they love</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1274
00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a lecture by Alan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending,</v>

1275
00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I think his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like that on pessimism.</v>

1276
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.440
<v Speaker 2>The philosophical lecture on pessimism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and about how one of the reasons why you</v>

1277
00:59:13.441 --> 00:59:18.441
<v Speaker 2>get so upset about things and you get so</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked up is because you have these </v>

1278
00:59:18.441 --> 00:59:19.320
<v Speaker 2>expectations that things are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>going gonna work out well,</v>

1279
00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 2>but if she put the reality of most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't work out at all.</v>

1280
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.610
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost always more failure than </v>

1281
00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:27.610
<v Speaker 2>there is success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're so primed for success.</v>

1282
00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:32.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to believe that this will </v>
<v Speaker 2>always work in your favor and it's like </v>

1283
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.620
<v Speaker 2>a traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1284
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you get so mad and angry and pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and we only traffic,</v>

1285
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.650
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is is that there's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

1286
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Traffic is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1287
00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.430
<v Speaker 2>the not the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't the norm.</v>

1288
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 2>So when you encounter it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he so mad?</v>

1289
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:51.040
<v Speaker 2>It's always there and it always occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's more unusual for there to be any</v>

1290
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:56.381
<v Speaker 2>traffic at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have this concept in our head </v>

1291
00:59:56.381 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 2>that even getting behind the wheel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving down the road,</v>

1292
00:59:57.651 --> 01:00:02.651
<v Speaker 2>it's all gonna work out for us instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us having to waste just like every </v>

1293
01:00:02.651 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 2>other schmo because things are the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

1294
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny way of looking at it.</v>

1295
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1296
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1297
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>one thing I can appreciate failure as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool for success,</v>

1298
01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because every time that I've ever,</v>

1299
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>especially as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best,</v>

1300
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>most motivating factors is bombing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

1301
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you eat a dick on stage,</v>

1302
01:00:23.281 --> 01:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you never want that to happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll tighten everything up.</v>

1303
01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>You'll go over your material with a fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth comb.</v>

1304
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Think about your delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listened to recordings.</v>

1305
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:37.310
<v Speaker 1>He don't want that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long does it joke suck before it </v>

1306
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>becomes good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know,</v>

1307
01:00:37.921 --> 01:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

1308
01:00:39.121 --> 01:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll come up with a joke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect the moment it comes up.</v>

1309
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>And then other times it might take a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1310
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>a year for Joe to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>

1311
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm Louis Ck was telling me that Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock,</v>

1312
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock has this one really </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial bit.</v>

1313
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1314
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I love black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate niggas you ever heard that bit?</v>

1315
01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have</v>

1316
01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>brilliant bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1317
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1318
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the difference between a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mind,</v>

1319
01:01:05.501 --> 01:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Nigga and um,</v>

1320
01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time to work.</v>

1321
01:01:10.271 --> 01:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it took like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bombing for a year.</v>

1322
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>He would go on to an each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get it to work and then it </v>

1323
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:20.071
<v Speaker 1>became eventually became a closing bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became a bit that it was just </v>

1324
01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>destroying perfect old school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic bit.</v>

1325
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those things where every</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit's got its own timeline.</v>

1326
01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Every bit has its own shelf life to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>bits are timeless and some bits they're </v>

1327
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>only good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a monster for six months.</v>

1328
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's topical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe things change can make a joke </v>

1329
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>about vhs tapes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a shit thing.</v>

1330
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Time moves on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1331
01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a great joke about nextel</v>

1332
01:01:40.601 --> 01:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fuck about next time.</v>

1333
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1334
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>some of them will last for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them don't.</v>

1335
01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are done the moment you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it,</v>

1336
01:01:49.421 --> 01:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>the first time on stage,</v>

1337
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>that's its lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

1338
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Only the first time hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1339
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Is it.</v>

1340
01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>There's some of that and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>bits that are there are fully formed bit</v>

1341
01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>the moment out of your mouth and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last few years it's totally different,</v>

1342
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>

1343
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:08.350
<v Speaker 1>it completely depends on the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on what you're trying to say,</v>

1344
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how silly or complex it is.</v>

1345
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Usually the more common</v>

1346
01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>has I imagine also what bits led into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1347
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1348
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Bits go from exile and what not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes being said,</v>

1349
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:23.771
<v Speaker 2>but what tone is being set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all of a sudden you're going one </v>

1350
01:02:23.771 --> 01:02:23.771
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You change gears.</v>

1351
01:02:23.771 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that immediacy hard stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed,</v>

1352
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:30.140
<v Speaker 2>catches people off Guard and reserve any</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes them laugh or at least you </v>

1353
01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:33.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets their mind spinning in a way </v>

1354
01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.941
<v Speaker 2>that sets up the next stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes it just confuses them and </v>

1355
01:02:34.941 --> 01:02:36.140
<v Speaker 2>flux the whole rest of the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1356
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes of jokes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just knowing that you can be a comedian,</v>

1357
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.320
<v Speaker 2>could easily be a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just having this conversation and </v>

1358
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:44.320
<v Speaker 2>knowing that I always tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

1359
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.240
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that complicated,</v>

1360
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1361
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to,</v>

1362
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:53.901
<v Speaker 2>a comedian was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was sitting with a friend who was a </v>

1363
01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:55.510
<v Speaker 2>comedian and they were going to go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on.</v>

1364
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hanging in the pre show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all,</v>

1365
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:00.000
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of us were all just hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1366
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Iowa and I'm just being the crack</v>

1367
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>and stupid jokes and doing wordplay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1368
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1369
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 2>you work in at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1370
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.900
<v Speaker 2>I got a little boehner and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little.</v>

1371
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just thought,</v>

1372
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a comedian at all where you </v>

1373
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:19.820
<v Speaker 2>think I'm fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that you can do it.</v>

1374
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1375
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a normal skill that </v>

1376
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.181
<v Speaker 2>everyone sort of has a small form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people at least try to have like </v>

1377
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>one or two things they could say that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>witty in their life,</v>

1378
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of cultivating those </v>

1379
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and becoming like a woody farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

1380
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.880
<v Speaker 2>how many people can keep their nerve too</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1381
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a little of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1382
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 2>If I had to get on stage and deliver </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up,</v>

1383
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 2>that would would freak me the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be more.</v>

1384
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:51.780
<v Speaker 2>That's more way more fearful than </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting even five guys all at one time,</v>

1385
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 2>like that's okay by me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you do it a couple times,</v>

1386
01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it would be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1387
01:03:57.091 --> 01:04:02.091
<v Speaker 2>I have been in some of these public </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking scenarios where people are so </v>

1388
01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:02.091
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1389
01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm shitting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So scary.</v>

1390
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.650
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shitting yourself.</v>

1391
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1392
01:04:09.151 --> 01:04:10.480
<v Speaker 2>No real fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1393
01:04:10.481 --> 01:04:11.370
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1394
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard thing to get past is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>

1395
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I know that that all this fear is all </v>
<v Speaker 2>self created.</v>

1396
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 2>If everybody thought I was an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

1397
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It only matters what I think.</v>

1398
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:26.010
<v Speaker 2>If I don't think I'm an idiot and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay with it,</v>

1399
01:04:26.011 --> 01:04:28.550
<v Speaker 2>then fuck you all like go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fucking.</v>

1400
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.020
<v Speaker 2>You can all burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that shit.</v>

1401
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Take a long time to get to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort filled.</v>

1402
01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:37.661
<v Speaker 2>That is part of being a man and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important parts of being a man </v>

1403
01:04:37.661 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 2>is getting to a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely,</v>

1404
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:42.050
<v Speaker 2>truly don't give a fuck if someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like what you like.</v>

1405
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.560
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I like.</v>

1406
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few people really don't.</v>

1407
01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>And even once we get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is the one area?</v>

1408
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.840
<v Speaker 2>A couple areas I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1409
01:04:53.841 --> 01:04:56.250
<v Speaker 2>we make those exceptions obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1410
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.890
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He breaks you.</v>

1411
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Policy Ruins the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brakes.</v>

1412
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus you just tragic.</v>

1413
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It can break a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus he was one of my song and listen to</v>

1414
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:12.861
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a from every time I died I got this </v>

1415
01:05:12.861 --> 01:05:12.861
<v Speaker 2>great lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1416
01:05:12.861 --> 01:05:12.861
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

1417
01:05:12.861 --> 01:05:17.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not lack of ambition that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>women not lack of ambition that keeps </v>

1418
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 2>good men bedridden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1419
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know dudes that it becomes a,</v>

1420
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:24.520
<v Speaker 5>it becomes such a massive part of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>life that eclipses all else.</v>

1421
01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him like glue do his fucking </v>

1422
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.630
<v Speaker 2>phone and it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be integrated into his body.</v>

1423
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:37.710
<v Speaker 2>He is on it so much and yet it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly chattered little text here </v>

1424
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:38.990
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>

1425
01:05:38.991 --> 01:05:41.600
<v Speaker 2>you know an hour's gone by on this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I need to resend a response there and</v>

1426
01:05:41.601 --> 01:05:46.601
<v Speaker 2>just constant communication between </v>
<v Speaker 2>women the whole time because that's the </v>

1427
01:05:47.271 --> 01:05:51.470
<v Speaker 2>amount of effort it takes to to bang </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much fucking tail.</v>

1428
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>And I remember sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the patience for this at </v>

1429
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.140
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it'll just get to a certain point.</v>

1430
01:05:58.141 --> 01:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Then if I deal with enough stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1431
01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get off of my fucking phone.</v>

1432
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Who's my number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk to you anymore.</v>

1433
01:06:04.191 --> 01:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>It's hard enough for me to even have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with you with my thumbs,</v>

1434
01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.060
<v Speaker 2>let alone have to think about the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of putting aside a block of time to run </v>

1435
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>into you to work you up to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying just to have sex with you.</v>

1436
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:22.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets to a weird point where some </v>

1437
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.030
<v Speaker 5>people just want to chat all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's up?</v>

1438
01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Like you get a text like what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

1439
01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.940
<v Speaker 5>Some of you thinking of going to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gym.</v>

1440
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.760
<v Speaker 5>Fucking go fucking go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut.</v>

1441
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Tell me how it turns out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1442
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what your facebook is for you to </v>

1443
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>tell me that you're going to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym telling me that you,</v>

1444
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1445
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 2>how good of a workout you had you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat up with a face to face and go,</v>

1446
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.120
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time is very precious for me.</v>

1447
01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:49.800
<v Speaker 2>My Vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina,</v>

1448
01:06:49.801 --> 01:06:50.520
<v Speaker 2>vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina,</v>

1449
01:06:50.521 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does it.</v>

1450
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.760
<v Speaker 2>So it takes a certain amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is probably why I'm a single </v>

1451
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:56.850
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1452
01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.120
<v Speaker 5>also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's also why men try so hard to </v>

1453
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.421
<v Speaker 5>be bad motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They try so hard to be bad </v>

1454
01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:05.421
<v Speaker 5>motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Partially.</v>

1455
01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.950
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons to dominate is to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>more attractive to women.</v>

1456
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:08.790
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural.</v>

1457
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:13.830
<v Speaker 2>But I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between being a real bad </v>

1458
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker and being an outwardly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly bad motherfucker is night and </v>

1459
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:17.320
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an outwardly,</v>

1460
01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:19.290
<v Speaker 2>if you seem like you're a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

1461
01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:22.890
<v Speaker 2>then people think than most people think</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are right.</v>

1462
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.080
<v Speaker 2>The real bad motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody really ever knows it and they </v>

1463
01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:28.150
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to tell the world,</v>

1464
01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:29.770
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like someone who asked me the other</v>

1465
01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 2>day about if I ever get into street </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights or anything like that.</v>

1466
01:07:32.861 --> 01:07:34.060
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1467
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>because the people that even when I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight them,</v>

1468
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:36.910
<v Speaker 2>they won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1469
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:37.500
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they all,</v>

1470
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would fight you?</v>

1471
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know who I am.</v>

1472
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a celebrity.</v>

1473
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.280
<v Speaker 2>They don't know our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst martial artists.</v>

1474
01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1475
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:51.600
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give me my little pocket of </v>

1476
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:51.600
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1477
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking somebody there.</v>

1478
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.790
<v Speaker 2>But in general you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure dog on.</v>

1479
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm so popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so amazingly.</v>

1480
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm just all flammable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the rest of the world,</v>

1481
01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows who the fuck I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that.</v>

1482
01:08:00.491 --> 01:08:01.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1483
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I've had guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I balled me,</v>

1484
01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever I've seen the fucking the signs</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1485
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.010
<v Speaker 2>You think if anybody knows when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight gonna happen and be a fighter.</v>

1486
01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:14.011
<v Speaker 2>So when I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if someone's being a Dick </v>

1487
01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:15.400
<v Speaker 2>deliberately in my presence or to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman that's,</v>

1488
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that's around or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I step up and I say something like,</v>

1489
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to fight me and I owe </v>

1490
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:24.450
<v Speaker 2>because you're bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1491
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:24.450
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got nothing to do any of that.</v>

1492
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Because when you look into somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

1493
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you can tell who really wants to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck people up.</v>

1494
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Who really doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't get upset.</v>

1495
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't yell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't scream.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do any of that.</v>

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I just look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell them how it's going to be and I </v>

1498
01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:41.620
<v Speaker 2>let him know if this is what we want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1500
01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 2>let's just please make this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said the one guy,</v>

1501
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many friends do you got?</v>

1502
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:49.250
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1503
01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just tell you that much.</v>

1504
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Or I told one dude or do you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody that knows anybody that knows </v>

1505
01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:57.610
<v Speaker 2>anybody that knows anybody that kicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>my ass.</v>

1506
01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1507
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 5>But getting a bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I laughed at a guy to anthrax,</v>

1508
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing there with a girl and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps trying to nudge.</v>

1509
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:10.470
<v Speaker 2>People keep trying to manage through </v>
<v Speaker 2>right where we're at and I'm like,</v>

1510
01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>of all places you see a dude and a chick</v>
<v Speaker 2>go somewhere else.</v>

1511
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:16.530
<v Speaker 2>So I'm standing right there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided that's it.</v>

1512
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to start going </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1513
01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:19.190
<v Speaker 2>So I keep my elbows out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tries.</v>

1514
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.090
<v Speaker 2>I feel as dude bumping into me on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rise,</v>

1515
01:09:21.091 --> 01:09:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't get through and he tries to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown the left,</v>

1516
01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just standing tall so he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get around it.</v>

1517
01:09:25.501 --> 01:09:30.501
<v Speaker 2>But he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like pushing him over him running </v>

1518
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:30.960
<v Speaker 2>himself into my own elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he starts getting mad.</v>

1519
01:09:30.961 --> 01:09:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's yelling at me about something.</v>

1520
01:09:33.031 --> 01:09:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is trying to get through man?</v>

1521
01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:39.010
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

1522
01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1523
01:09:40.141 --> 01:09:42.060
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I go?</v>

1524
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Anthrax is playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking hear what you're saying.</v>

1525
01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>And he's looking at me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1526
01:09:46.891 --> 01:09:51.891
<v Speaker 2>just walk up to the front and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>all fucking wild eyed and he's looking </v>

1527
01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:53.430
<v Speaker 2>at me crazy and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this what you want to do?</v>

1528
01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started laughing at him.</v>

1529
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just need to keep moving,</v>

1530
01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.330
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the girl in front reaches</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and grabs a hold of his arm,</v>

1531
01:10:00.331 --> 01:10:01.950
<v Speaker 2>pulls down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do this,</v>

1532
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 2>don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just smiling the whole time and he </v>

1533
01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 2>just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he leaves.</v>

1534
01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.120
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the posture and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

1535
01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>When I look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1536

1537
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.070
<v Speaker 5>Recurring this in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're recreating this in your mind.</v>

1538
01:10:13.071 --> 01:10:18.071
<v Speaker 5>I can see your pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quicken your testosterone that I stay </v>

1539
01:10:18.071 --> 01:10:20.370
<v Speaker 5>calm but carry a grudge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You carry your story.</v>

1540
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.810
<v Speaker 5>So I'm a Scorpio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so apparently according to all the books</v>

1541
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:25.050
<v Speaker 5>that are out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1542
01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:25.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cary grow,</v>

1543
01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:27.560
<v Speaker 5>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's total stripper talk.</v>

1544
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I love being in those violent </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontations.</v>

1547
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Why do you like that?</v>

1548
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.580
<v Speaker 5>Is it because when you were picked on </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you were a kid,</v>

1549
01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:47.670
<v Speaker 5>you still harbor some resentment?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Towards people that we fuck with you </v>

1550
01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:48.310
<v Speaker 5>because you're a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would never fuck with anybody,</v>

1551
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:53.430
<v Speaker 5>but if someone was fucking with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like now you have a license </v>

1552
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.430
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I can't put a finger on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1554
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed fighting when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like being in the fights.</v>

1556
01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't start the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you gave me a reason,</v>

1557
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:08.950
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my mom said I was the angriest </v>

1558
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.950
<v Speaker 2>kid ever.</v>

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:31.840
<v Speaker 5>the eagle from the muppets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the muppets and I never even thought </v>

1610
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:37.730
<v Speaker 5>about the eagle is such a prominent </v>
<v Speaker 5>frown asshole path.</v>

1611
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:42.590
<v Speaker 5>That's a funny fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I want to take that test to also see</v>

1612
01:13:42.591 --> 01:13:44.600
<v Speaker 5>if I got the warrior gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1613
01:13:44.601 --> 01:13:46.040
<v Speaker 5>There is a warranty supposed to make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make</v>

1614
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.060
<v Speaker 2>People Kinda gnarly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is like,</v>

1615
01:13:50.061 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to have anything personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>or any girls.</v>

1616
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't to get into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I enjoyed it.</v>

1617
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I even getting hit hitting back like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the whole thing.</v>

1618
01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I know for me fighting is a time I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>most alive and free in the entire world </v>

1619
01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:09.940
<v Speaker 2>because I can go out there and do just </v>
<v Speaker 2>about anything I can do with who I am </v>

1620
01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and no one's going to try and stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you prefer</v>

1621
01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm old school rules rules?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer for those who don't know,</v>

1622
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 5>super raw was soccer kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stomps.</v>

1623
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Had I prefer headbutts elbows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1624
01:14:22.431 --> 01:14:23.470
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

1625
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 5>No gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our gloves,</v>

1626
01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 5>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they were gloves.</v>

1627
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:31.411
<v Speaker 5>Do you prefer gloves or no gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer gloves only for your own kind </v>

1628
01:14:31.411 --> 01:14:32.560
<v Speaker 5>of fit but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or broken hands.</v>

1629
01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:38.090
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to say that it's really been doing </v>

1630
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.890
<v Speaker 5>much shinier hand wrote this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a broken leg.</v>

1631
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.950
<v Speaker 5>A lot of broken hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nma.</v>

1632
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1633
01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 5>but a super common,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1634
01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:43.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very.</v>

1635
01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:45.730
<v Speaker 5>Is there any way around that?</v>

1636
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:49.940
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's an equipment thing.</v>

1637
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible to pad the gloves more or</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it just that one thing I noticed and </v>

1638
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:56.720
<v Speaker 5>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't that many broken hands.</v>

1639
01:14:56.721 --> 01:14:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I was asking that once too,</v>

1640
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.680
<v Speaker 5>and I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it a better glove?</v>

1641
01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.360
<v Speaker 5>Is a pride glove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a thicker glove?</v>

1642
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:07.470
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily son I would say because </v>

1643
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.470
<v Speaker 5>it's all fixed fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1644
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:11.720
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say that he's so crazy.</v>

1645
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said some of that shed about like the</v>

1646
01:15:14.001 --> 01:15:15.240
<v Speaker 5>like pride fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1647
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1648
01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:18.120
<v Speaker 5>some of that is just,</v>

1649
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 2>it's brilliant stance to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a,</v>

1650
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.280
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fucking aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just obnoxious thing to say someone is </v>

1651
01:15:27.071 --> 01:15:32.071
<v Speaker 2>bound to get run now who's done or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that gets mad at the person who </v>

1652
01:15:32.071 --> 01:15:32.071
<v Speaker 2>says it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>person gets mad</v>

1653
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.200
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is there's a wee bit a </v>

1654
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.880
<v Speaker 5>truth in the fact that some fights in </v>
<v Speaker 5>pride.</v>

1655
01:15:38.881 --> 01:15:41.250
<v Speaker 5>We're staged.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like if you look at Coleman Takata,</v>

1656
01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:43.800
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty obvious or something going </v>
<v Speaker 5>on there.</v>

1657
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.140
<v Speaker 5>There's a few every now and that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1658
01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:48.780
<v Speaker 5>you look at like a cro cop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nogueira.</v>

1659
01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:51.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a real fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1660
01:15:51.931 --> 01:15:54.300
<v Speaker 5>That's a real fucking fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But man,</v>

1661
01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 5>you watched Coleman tap out to that heel</v>
<v Speaker 5>hooks from Chicago.</v>

1662
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:02.100
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1663
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best example of pride.</v>

1664
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:11.370
<v Speaker 5>What was it like being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were there in the golden era,</v>

1665
01:16:11.371 --> 01:16:16.371
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you were there during the time </v>

1666
01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:16.740
<v Speaker 5>when pride was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

1667
01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:21.570
<v Speaker 5>like put on some of the greatest shows </v>
<v Speaker 5>in mixed martial arts history to pride,</v>

1668
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.990
<v Speaker 5>openlink Grand Prix,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the middleweight Grand Prix.</v>

1669
01:16:24.991 --> 01:16:29.991
<v Speaker 5>I mean you just look at just the </v>
<v Speaker 5>historic fights like minute Toro versus </v>

1670
01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:34.281
<v Speaker 5>Bob Sapp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was some crazy historic </v>

1671
01:16:34.281 --> 01:16:35.230
<v Speaker 5>fights from your era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a.</v>

1672
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.120
<v Speaker 5>You were there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1673
01:16:36.121 --> 01:16:38.400
<v Speaker 5>You were there for all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was that like?</v>

1674
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Unfucking believable dude was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing for was the biggest crowd you</v>

1675
01:16:42.921 --> 01:16:46.920
<v Speaker 2>did a biggest crowd ever fought in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of was $50,000.</v>

1676
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.520
<v Speaker 2>The biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest crowd I ever stepped out in </v>

1677
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:52.520
<v Speaker 2>front of them at least grabbed the mic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 93.</v>

1678
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Jesus to want to tell you how big it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and I go,</v>

1679
01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.400
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in America it's once it hits the </v>

1680
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.540
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way American media is,</v>

1681
01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:06.380
<v Speaker 2>things blow up in such a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity than they do in Japan,</v>

1682
01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:10.230
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were stepping in front of $30,000</v>

1683
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a show with Hulk Hogan,</v>

1684
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hulk Hogan wrestling shown on 55,000</v>

1685
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:20.440
<v Speaker 2>people and I fought a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1686
01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.280
<v Speaker 2>she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

1687
01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.510
<v Speaker 2>independent my king of pancreas in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tokyo Dome.</v>

1688
01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:25.370
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

1689
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Those shows were on such a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>level than what we see here in the </v>

1690
01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:33.590
<v Speaker 2>states and the feeling of course feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be different in terms of the</v>

1691
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 2>culturally it's going to be way </v>
<v Speaker 2>different because you have Japan,</v>

1692
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:42.101
<v Speaker 2>this incredible homogeneous society with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ways and very specific versus </v>

1693
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1694
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 2>So trying to compare that sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not really fair.</v>

1695
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Apples and oranges really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are different everywhere you go </v>

1696
01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 2>hold those fights in Uganda or you hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in Transylvania or what.</v>

1697
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.560
<v Speaker 2>They're always going to be different </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people's cultures are different.</v>

1698
01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:02.980
<v Speaker 2>A plaid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they felt so dynamic.</v>

1699
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were so big,</v>

1700
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.040
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just the lights and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mood,</v>

1701
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the setting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that music would start up and the </v>

1702
01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:15.220
<v Speaker 2>lights would drop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1703
01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:15.310
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1704
01:18:15.311 --> 01:18:20.311
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're sitting in back and I'm </v>

1705
01:18:20.311 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 2>fighting like ninth or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm all of a sudden I'm just wired,</v>

1706
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1707
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:24.260
<v Speaker 2>let's just fucking grab swords and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and running down the ramp.</v>

1708
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:27.150
<v Speaker 5>A lot of pageantry to those events too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1709
01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.920
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not appreciate it sometimes when I</v>

1710
01:18:29.921 --> 01:18:34.921
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just get into the fucking fights </v>

1711
01:18:34.921 --> 01:18:36.541
<v Speaker 5>already,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like six hours long and you like to be </v>

1712
01:18:36.541 --> 01:18:37.270
<v Speaker 5>so jazzed up in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but looking back,</v>

1713
01:18:37.271 --> 01:18:39.610
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when everybody would line up,</v>

1714
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they would introduce fighters one </v>

1715
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:44.640
<v Speaker 5>at a time and they would all line up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1716
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.600
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going to be a fucking epic </v>

1717
01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.151
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really did build it up and it really </v>

1718
01:18:51.151 --> 01:18:52.060
<v Speaker 5>did make it more of a special event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1719
01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the UFC,</v>

1720
01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:56.680
<v Speaker 5>they've kind of done away with even some</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the walk ins,</v>

1721
01:18:56.681 --> 01:18:56.920
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1722
01:18:56.921 --> 01:19:01.921
<v Speaker 5>we're pressed for time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes guys are already in the cage </v>

1723
01:19:01.921 --> 01:19:02.020
<v Speaker 5>and there's no walking at all.</v>

1724
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:05.600
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even have walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1725
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1726
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:11.510

<v Speaker 2>a TV product definitely changes things </v>

1727
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.510
<v Speaker 2>and in Japan they're TV system is way </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than they,</v>

<v Speaker 2>than we run out.</v>

1729
01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.010
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll deal over.</v>

1730
01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.790
<v Speaker 5>I'll get burned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1731
01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:16.300

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:20.760
<v Speaker 2>he was a big fan of Michael Jackson's </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he thought it would be real cool</v>

1733
01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 5>to set himself on fire before he went </v>
<v Speaker 5>out and fought.</v>

1734
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Not what Jerry curl before he lit up.</v>

<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

1736
01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:36.450
<v Speaker 5>And Pre ripped jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck did those exist?</v>

1737

<v Speaker 5>He'll got hit with.</v>

1738
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.920
<v Speaker 2>He was in the wrong spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the marker was wrong or </v>

1739
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:47.601
<v Speaker 2>he lost in translation and he got hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some pyrotechnics and it just lit </v>

1740
01:19:48.661 --> 01:19:49.680
<v Speaker 2>him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1741
01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Thankfully he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1742
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.900
<v Speaker 2>with the burns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was able to,</v>

1743
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:56.010
<v Speaker 2>to come back and he even fought again in</v>
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>

1744
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm really,</v>

1745
01:19:59.040 --> 01:19:59.940
<v Speaker 2>really glad that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1746
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:04.970
<v Speaker 2>that was the case because you'll hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Olivia and luke delivery legend </v>

1747
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:06.780
<v Speaker 2>school nhb dude at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1748
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sad</v>

1749
01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:08.200
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sad.</v>

1750
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people don't know.</v>

1751
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the original guys back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the day,</v>

1752
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fought in some of those,</v>

1753
01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:14.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1754
01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>valley to two events,</v>

1755
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 4>the bare knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no rules,</v>

1756
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:24.591
<v Speaker 4>events there were so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when Gary Goodrich fought that </v>

1757
01:20:24.591 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Pedro grabbed this deck and they really </v>
<v Speaker 4>reached into his pants,</v>

1758
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:31.851
<v Speaker 4>there was no rule against it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So reach into his pants and crushed his </v>

1759
01:20:31.851 --> 01:20:33.870
<v Speaker 4>balls and his dick in his hand like no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one had ever thought of that.</v>

1760
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 4>No one had ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Gary went so deep,</v>

1761
01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 4>he literally grabbed the guy showed </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep.</v>

1762
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary Good.</v>

1763
01:20:41.471 --> 01:20:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Which is a fucking arm wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion with these gigantic arms.</v>

1764
01:20:45.610 --> 01:20:48.250
<v Speaker 4>And just imagine that that guy crushing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your package.</v>

1765
01:20:48.251 --> 01:20:53.251
<v Speaker 4>I think he might've started off with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tickle just to let go the underlings.</v>

1766
01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.190
<v Speaker 4>And if tickle turned into a squeeze and </v>
<v Speaker 4>see the guide,</v>

1767
01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:02.650
<v Speaker 4>the guy didn't tap out immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like saying giant black man </v>

1768
01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:03.730
<v Speaker 4>hand in my crotch screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck no.</v>

1769
01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.280
<v Speaker 4>Finger and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1771
01:21:12.281 --> 01:21:13.420
<v Speaker 4>he was giving me a shocker.</v>

1772
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:17.780
<v Speaker 5>Prostate balls were already numb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like he had taken so many.</v>

1773
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:20.570
<v Speaker 5>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why he tapped out as Gary's.</v>

1774
01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:25.920
<v Speaker 5>He's like knuckles deep and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got two knuckles in there and he's </v>

1775
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:25.920
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what to do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we need to get you out of here.</v>

1778
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.810
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks.</v>

1779
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.150
<v Speaker 5>Thank you so much.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I never stuck my nipples in a man's ass.</v>

1781
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Any event that allowed ball shots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the old he attacked me,</v>

1782
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:46.660

<v Speaker 5>Joe Simons a famous moment in mma</v>

01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:11.070

<v Speaker 5>they did a DNA scan on him.</v>

1794
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.500
<v Speaker 5>That guy used to always hang around the </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy store.</v>

1795
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:18.650
<v Speaker 5>He was always in the back room and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>comments that you'd run into him and he </v>

<v Speaker 5>It was really weird.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Really short limbs but super.</v>

1800
01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:26.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:30.320
<v Speaker 4>You'd be calling everyone now</v>

1802
01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.120
<v Speaker 5>this guy was like a mass or a gang </v>
<v Speaker 5>rapists.</v>

1803
01:22:33.121 --> 01:22:34.140
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow,</v>

1804
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.500
<v Speaker 5>what a weird guy to have hanging around </v>
<v Speaker 5>about as bad as it can be,</v>

1805
01:22:37.501 --> 01:22:40.040
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think that I would.</v>

1806
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:45.140
<v Speaker 5>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in his mind he probably said his bar </v>

1807
01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.421
<v Speaker 5>even higher than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever try any of these </v>

1808
01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 5>compression shorts?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A Cup?</v>

1809
01:22:49.351 --> 01:22:54.351
<v Speaker 5>Things like videos of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like shockoe has one and diamond mma </v>

1810
01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:54.351
<v Speaker 5>have one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1811
01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 5>I used to wear the 30 bucks everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>tour,</v>

1812
01:22:57.990 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 5>but I also learned a hard lesson of if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're wearing.</v>

1813
01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:03.450
<v Speaker 5>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1814
01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:05.120
<v Speaker 5>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worry about like Tito trunks,</v>

1815
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're wearing spandex trunks and </v>

1816
01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.120
<v Speaker 5>you put spandex shorts on underneath </v>
<v Speaker 5>that spandex and Spandex,</v>

1817
01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:18.121
<v Speaker 5>just sort of all of a sudden your outer </v>
<v Speaker 5>trunks are turned into some sort of </v>

1818
01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:20.060
<v Speaker 5>daisy Duke Wedgie up your ass and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're under trunks are hanging.</v>

1819
01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:23.620
<v Speaker 5>He just looked like a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexy as shit.</v>

1820
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:25.420
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1821
01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:27.640
<v Speaker 5>look at that little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those compression shorts is probably the</v>

1822
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:32.320
<v Speaker 5>best way to avoid a really bad ball </v>
<v Speaker 5>shots where I keep it in place.</v>

1823
01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:37.321
<v Speaker 5>Or is it a trap or Die Cup?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if you use Taco jockstrap just </v>

1824
01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:39.050
<v Speaker 5>trap with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1825
01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.400
<v Speaker 5>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with one of those flexible cups because </v>

1826
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:44.400
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my thighs are so big that a normal cup,</v>

1827
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.871
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just starts digging into the inside </v>

1828
01:23:48.871 --> 01:23:48.871
<v Speaker 5>of my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those flexible cups are good.</v>

1829
01:23:48.871 --> 01:23:49.420
<v Speaker 5>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1830
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:50.740
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've tried recently.</v>

1831
01:23:50.741 --> 01:23:55.741
<v Speaker 5>The reason why I asked this is a diamond</v>
<v Speaker 5>nma has this really intense compression </v>

1832
01:23:55.741 --> 01:23:57.740
<v Speaker 5>shorts setup with all of these straps </v>
<v Speaker 5>and his videos,</v>

1833
01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.940
<v Speaker 5>like are you sure it's for training and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not for like,</v>

1834
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.870
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got a ball gag,</v>

1835
01:24:01.871 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 5>but it's optional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The uh,</v>

1836
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:06.670
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that this guy has eliminated</v>
<v Speaker 5>the movement,</v>

1837
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:08.620
<v Speaker 5>which is where the cup fails.</v>

1838
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:13.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cup moves to the side and then you </v>

1839
01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:13.650
<v Speaker 5>get kicked in the balls and the cup </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually hits the balls,</v>

1840
01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 5>which obviously can happen if you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a loose jock strap to the side.</v>

1841
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His shit is.</v>

1842
01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:19.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no tuskie's from the side.</v>

1843
01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:24.240
<v Speaker 5>This shit is slammed in place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Kenny Florian says that a Thai Cup </v>

1844
01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:24.810
<v Speaker 5>is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says that you could if you.</v>

1845
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 5>It's uncomfortable as fuck because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>has to go up your ass like a g string.</v>

1846
01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.370
<v Speaker 5>But if you do it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not moving.</v>

1847
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just sort of saying Kenny Florian </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't the mass play.</v>

1848
01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:38.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's into that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he minds shaped inner </v>

1849
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:39.100
<v Speaker 5>thighs though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steel Cup,</v>

1850
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.880
<v Speaker 5>like a little piece of leather around </v>
<v Speaker 5>rather than balm and do is grunt.</v>

1851
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd probably have to.</v>

1852
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:45.820
<v Speaker 5>Before you get going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll probably have to use some key and</v>

1853
01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:47.880
<v Speaker 5>the size of your thighs a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kaggle's.</v>

1854
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.340
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can hear it.</v>

1855
01:24:54.341 --> 01:24:59.341
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here we're going off in the </v>

1856
01:24:59.341 --> 01:24:59.341
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking a lot about cups.</v>

1857
01:24:59.341 --> 01:25:03.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is not entirely what I thought it </v>

1858
01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:03.190
<v Speaker 5>was going to be on the table today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a terrible design.</v>

1859
01:25:03.191 --> 01:25:06.010
<v Speaker 5>The human body with the balls and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside fighting.</v>

1860
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:06.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1861
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.960
<v Speaker 5>you're a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if your involvement on the outside </v>

1862
01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:11.960
<v Speaker 5>she couldn't like true lick them while </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're adding.</v>

1863
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:13.420
<v Speaker 5>You're stroking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:14.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like a trade off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean you gotta you got the good with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bad on that.</v>

1866
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:20.590
<v Speaker 5>What a ridiculous button that every man </v>
<v Speaker 5>has his button seeing.</v>

1867
01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Ding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ding,</v>

1868
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.080
<v Speaker 5>Ding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's out there.</v>

1869
01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:28.081
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all running around vulnerable and </v>

1870
01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:28.240
<v Speaker 5>we've made countless jokes about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you couldn't,</v>

1871
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 5>didn't know that it was not only with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the painful.</v>

1872
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.960
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1873
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:36.860
<v Speaker 5>Even when you're watching an mma about </v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1874
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:38.560
<v Speaker 5>someone to get kicked in the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1875
01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:40.810
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one more time.</v>

1876
01:25:40.811 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's launch a few.</v>

1877
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:43.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we always replay it.</v>

1878
01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason to.</v>

1879
01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:49.990
<v Speaker 5>There's got to be fetishes built around </v>
<v Speaker 5>cups,</v>

1880
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1881
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:56.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure people like someone that </v>
<v Speaker 5>where's the cup and gets a boner under </v>

1882
01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:57.960
<v Speaker 5>the cup somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1883
01:25:58.110 --> 01:26:03.020
<v Speaker 5>It's like crushing is mushroom were </v>
<v Speaker 5>dudes that like jerking off to guys.</v>

1884
01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 6>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard your podcast.</v>

1885
01:26:10.581 --> 01:26:13.690
<v Speaker 6>Joseph wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What were you send them to me.</v>

1886
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:17.840
<v Speaker 2>He should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't really tell this story,</v>

1887
01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 2>but he was focusing on former UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight champion,</v>

1888
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:26.950
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great kickboxer world kickboxing </v>

1889
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.950
<v Speaker 2>champion and trained in honor of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility bill.</v>

1890
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got this leather utility belt </v>

1891
01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:36.011
<v Speaker 2>thing with pockets and pouches and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit and gadgets as monogrammed on </v>

1892
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:40.250
<v Speaker 2>it for multiple sclerosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not quite a fanny pack.</v>

1893
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the ultimate of fanny packs.</v>

1894
01:26:42.891 --> 01:26:46.910
<v Speaker 2>It's Batman utility belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little jealous.</v>

1895
01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can get one made for you.</v>

1896
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was pretty proud to tell me about </v>

1897
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.120
<v Speaker 2>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am actually mocking you.</v>

1898
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not asking for free for,</v>

1899
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:56.480
<v Speaker 2>for location on where I could have one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my own.</v>

1900
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.830
<v Speaker 2>You saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you saw Maurice,</v>

1901
01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.300
<v Speaker 2>his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I did.</v>

1902
01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I jumped out of my chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was losing my shit.</v>

1903
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.410
<v Speaker 2>It was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1904
01:27:02.411 --> 01:27:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly when it was all going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go down hill.</v>

1905
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:10.810
<v Speaker 2>There was a point because I used to spar</v>
<v Speaker 2>and race all the time and he's standing </v>

1906
01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 2>out in front of the guy and he kinda </v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got them handled.</v>

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What an idiot,</v>

1953
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:14.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't got $300.</v>

1954
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And you have now a Maurice Smith limited</v>
<v Speaker 2>edition semen stained fricking jockstrap</v>

1955
01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:24.320
<v Speaker 2>now like maybe the guys wearing it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his face,</v>

1956
01:29:24.321 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>like darth vader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's something but something.</v>

1957
01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And then it made me think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is my jock strapless?</v>

1958
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:32.970
<v Speaker 2>What I sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

1959
01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.070
<v Speaker 2>How much</v>

1960
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.770
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to get five fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four fingers,</v>

1961
01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.960
<v Speaker 5>thousand bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not impossible.</v>

1962
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:44.060
<v Speaker 5>You know what I think if you could take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's too bad.</v>

1963
01:29:44.061 --> 01:29:46.530
<v Speaker 5>You probably already watched it from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>great man.</v>

1964
01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.270
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be amazing plastic bags.</v>

1965
01:29:50.271 --> 01:29:55.271
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you should fake this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you did have plastic bags where </v>

1966
01:29:55.271 --> 01:29:59.290
<v Speaker 5>you structure your shock from the randy </v>
<v Speaker 5>couture fight is in a Ziploc bag for </v>

1967
01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.480
<v Speaker 5>medically sealed medically seal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the jock strap you were wearing </v>

1968
01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.550
<v Speaker 5>when you won the title straps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1969
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Only jockstraps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:15.290
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just had them all in a file at </v>

1971
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.290
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you should fake this,</v>

1972
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:19.390
<v Speaker 5>but if you did have like a file that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull apart and it was filled with </v>

1973
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.760
<v Speaker 5>organized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many fights have you had?</v>

1974
01:30:19.761 --> 01:30:20.020
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1975
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Fuck a unsanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1976
01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:28.370
<v Speaker 5>Included over 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if you had 50 plastic </v>

1977
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:30.630
<v Speaker 5>bags filled with every jockstrap from </v>
<v Speaker 5>every fight he'd ever been in,</v>

1978
01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 5>including some blood on him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some smeared,</v>

1979
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:38.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some with quick knockouts where you </v>

1980
01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:38.890
<v Speaker 5>didn't even really get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm stinky.</v>

1981
01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:47.010
<v Speaker 5>They would have to be hermetically seal </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the smell is a radiator shops</v>

1982
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.650
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

1983
01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:52.110
<v Speaker 5>for like a 50 mile radius of pulling </v>
<v Speaker 5>every woman and every feral dog.</v>

1984
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes at night.</v>

1985
01:30:55.490 --> 01:31:00.490
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the like the MBA one would probably be </v>

1986
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:01.860
<v Speaker 5>worth the most because there's still </v>
<v Speaker 5>like sweat inside the bag.</v>

1987
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.370
<v Speaker 5>Something like bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some moisture bubbles in the bag,</v>

1988
01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>

1989
01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.100
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go back to the pride days.</v>

1990
01:31:08.101 --> 01:31:11.960
<v Speaker 5>Those are dried out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've shrunk a little event.</v>

1991
01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:18.040
<v Speaker 5>That would be somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's going to do it now because we </v>

1992
01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:18.390
<v Speaker 5>brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We set that in motion.</v>

1993
01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 5>This is going to be sold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to pay for tires if I keep blowing</v>

1994
01:31:21.151 --> 01:31:26.151
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what better than to use a little bit </v>

1995
01:31:26.151 --> 01:31:26.820
<v Speaker 5>of a laugh around my waist might be able</v>
<v Speaker 5>to retire on this.</v>

1996
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could just stop,</v>

1997
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:29.670
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would,</v>

1998
01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 5>you could retire on something as </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous as that sounds.</v>

1999
01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 5>The jocks job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2000
01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:40.161
<v Speaker 5>we should put up a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got one more fight coming up in </v>

2001
01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:40.161
<v Speaker 5>strikeforce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2002
01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:40.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

2003
01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.750
<v Speaker 5>how long has he been going to be before </v>
<v Speaker 5>your hands healed?</v>

2004
01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I got at least another three </v>

2005
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.050
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you have to do for like physical</v>

2006
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:50.460
<v Speaker 2>therapy when that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they put a pin in it?</v>

2007
01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:55.461
<v Speaker 2>And everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have that removed at some </v>

2008
01:31:55.461 --> 01:31:58.971
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically you have to have that removed </v>

2009
01:31:58.971 --> 01:31:58.971
<v Speaker 2>or is it an option?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2010
01:31:58.971 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's smarter in the long run</v>

2011
01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:06.570
<v Speaker 2>to heal the stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way a lot of people don't have </v>

2012
01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:06.570
<v Speaker 2>plates in there on the plate is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2013
01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it does break,</v>

2014
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:11.520
<v Speaker 2>if you break the hardware and that ain't</v>
<v Speaker 2>got that crap stuck in the bone,</v>

2015
01:32:11.521 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 2>it makes it even worse.</v>

2016
01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:16.350
<v Speaker 5>Put it all back together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's a Nogueira situation like this?</v>

2017
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called a humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The upper bone snapped when a mere </v>

2018
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 5>tapped him.</v>

2019
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I think he just started rubbing off on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2020
01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2021
01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.480
<v Speaker 5>his issue right now is the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2022
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they can go in and take </v>
<v Speaker 5>it out though.</v>

2023
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.820
<v Speaker 5>Is it every fight?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2024
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.110
<v Speaker 5>he pulled out of the Congo fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can,</v>

2025
01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he apparently is in intense pain during </v>

2026
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:40.450
<v Speaker 5>wrestling when he was fine for a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>

2027
01:32:40.451 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 5>But then when it got to wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just too much pain,</v>

2028
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:45.880
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that plate,</v>

2029
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.400
<v Speaker 5>digging into your bones and digging into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the army,</v>

2030
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2031
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:56.200
<v Speaker 5>I think that has to be probably removed </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're gonna engage in sports.</v>

2032
01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:58.010
<v Speaker 5>What about um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2033
01:32:58.090 --> 01:32:58.990
<v Speaker 5>mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leg,</v>

2034
01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.350
<v Speaker 5>whatever happened with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does he still have the plate?</v>

2035
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:07.350
<v Speaker 2>And then I probably the prosthetic with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a machine gun and so great hides his </v>

2036
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:09.100
<v Speaker 2>knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still crazy,</v>

2037
01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.420
<v Speaker 2>strongest dudes walking the planet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm covered in weapons,</v>

2038
01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.210
<v Speaker 2>convert it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2039
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:15.850
<v Speaker 2>all the people that want to attack me.</v>

2040
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that's all about,</v>

2041
01:33:17.951 --> 01:33:19.790
<v Speaker 5>but he is the wrong dude to fuck.</v>

2042
01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2043
01:33:20.701 --> 01:33:22.360
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he fell down a flight of stairs,</v>

2044
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:24.240
<v Speaker 2>he stabbed and stuff to death and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2045
01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Got Two office buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trips on the sidewalk.</v>

2047
01:33:32.710 --> 01:33:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Ankle gun goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2048
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.460
<v Speaker 5>is the gas station across the street is </v>
<v Speaker 5>dictate or just stats?</v>

2049
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's up with him?</v>

2050
01:33:43.321 --> 01:33:44.790
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's already a killer?</v>

2051
01:33:44.791 --> 01:33:47.280
<v Speaker 5>And he wants to be like fully armed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the teeth when he leaves her house,</v>

2052
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:48.610
<v Speaker 5>he's like a real survivalist type.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

2053
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:53.670
<v Speaker 2>dude and that way you live in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine his survival skills are a lot </v>

2054
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.901
<v Speaker 2>different than the usual guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you avoid vomit on the </v>

2055
01:33:57.901 --> 01:34:00.451
<v Speaker 2>street?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't get into the Strip club </v>

2056
01:34:00.451 --> 01:34:00.880
<v Speaker 2>without paying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you work there,</v>

2057
01:34:00.881 --> 01:34:02.470
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what?</v>

2058
01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Vegas is a dark place though as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Vegas.</v>

2059
01:34:06.851 --> 01:34:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate Vegas.</v>

2060
01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it because it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2061
01:34:11.061 --> 01:34:16.061
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's purposefully fake an engineered to </v>

2062
01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:19.351
<v Speaker 2>fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even from the carpet from the way </v>

2063
01:34:19.351 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's kind of cool that they </v>

2064
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.650
<v Speaker 2>figured out the ways to make you gamble </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spend money and fuck your life over </v>

2065
01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.580
<v Speaker 2>to a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some formula like wow,</v>

2066

<v Speaker 1>you can attach a little chain onto it </v>

2112
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:23.600

<v Speaker 1>People can pull shit off,</v>

2120
01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:46.910

<v Speaker 2>the Falcon as it went down the road.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you were living in some fucking dirt </v>

2154
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:21.570
<v Speaker 2>hole when you discovered you had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathtub.</v>

2155

2158
01:38:27.571 --> 01:38:28.740

01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:33.741
<v Speaker 2>let's go back into a fucking hole full </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mud and have a baby in that because </v>

2160
01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:34.380
<v Speaker 2>that's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you kind of forget sometimes.</v>

2167
01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Who was the one who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it made the.</v>

2168
01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:52.200
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes perfect sense.</v>

2169
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Died constantly all the time.</v>

2176
01:39:06.301 --> 01:39:09.510

<v Speaker 2>babies from dying.</v>

2177
01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:11.250
<v Speaker 2>So why don't we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same thing.</v>

2185
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.630
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're aware of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with.</v>

2186
01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.660
<v Speaker 2>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just drove up here in [inaudible] 69 </v>

2187
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:36.660
<v Speaker 2>while barely drove up here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

2188
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:37.900
<v Speaker 2>60 nine oldsmobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know what I'm dealing with and I'm</v>

2189
01:39:37.901 --> 01:39:42.901
<v Speaker 2>okay with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't drive up here with a </v>

2190
01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:42.901
<v Speaker 2>fucking thomas map the whole time trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this.</v>

2191
01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a 68,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

2192
01:39:44.291 --> 01:39:44.920
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

2193
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Used to have a lot of cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

2194
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:51.970
<v Speaker 2>So do I bet back that back bumper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest bumpers in the </v>

2195
01:39:51.970 --> 01:39:54.250
<v Speaker 2>history of automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giant chrome shying bumper.</v>

2196
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:58.810
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of car because I had a 300 CSR</v>

2197
01:39:58.811 --> 01:40:02.140
<v Speaker 2>t a great car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had been rear ended twice,</v>

2198
01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.170
<v Speaker 2>so I never got any wrecks until I got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

2199
01:40:05.171 --> 01:40:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>

2200
01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:11.670
<v Speaker 2>We get past this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucked up traffic and I start </v>

2201
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:13.270
<v Speaker 2>driving by and I see it fucked up car on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

2202
01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.650
<v Speaker 2>which is why we're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2203
01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:19.770
<v Speaker 2>fucking California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't go a day without having </v>

2204
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:21.010
<v Speaker 2>to run yourself into somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just fucking morons.</v>

2205
01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:24.220
<v Speaker 2>And we speed up and then started slowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and I'm like,</v>

2206
01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:24.970
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2207
01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop and then right into my back.</v>

2208
01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

2209
01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.320
<v Speaker 2>And then they manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed the car from that.</v>

2210
01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:37.930
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go and I pull the trim off,</v>

2211
01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:42.931
<v Speaker 2>have all the chrome turned black and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that and make the murder of the car </v>

2212
01:40:42.931 --> 01:40:43.210
<v Speaker 2>looks awesome.</v>

2214
01:40:48.211 --> 01:40:51.091
<v Speaker 2>more years and then I'll finally get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new car and then I'm leaving at this </v>

2215
01:40:51.091 --> 01:40:51.970
<v Speaker 2>place like 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a truck and I got.</v>

2230
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Well the first thing is doing all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting shit that I've been doing high </v>

2231
01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 2>stress situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I have way better facilities than</v>

2232
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:42.211
<v Speaker 2>your average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even today I'm driving in the </v>

2233
01:41:42.211 --> 01:41:44.040
<v Speaker 2>fascinating 75 miles an hour and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wall on the one tab on the left </v>

2234
01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:45.970
<v Speaker 2>hand side of the concrete divider and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard boom.</v>

2235
01:41:45.971 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And it goes out and the car immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to go into the wall.</v>

2236
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.910
<v Speaker 2>But I manage that by breaking the car.</v>

2237
01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm applying brakes and feathering it </v>

2238
01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:57.070
<v Speaker 2>and steering the wheel and keeping it </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>

2239
01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hit a fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2240
01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a man,</v>

2241
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.900
<v Speaker 2>like a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a man,</v>

2242
01:42:01.901 --> 01:42:06.901
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that once I wrote that ditch and I </v>

2243
01:42:06.901 --> 01:42:08.270
<v Speaker 2>fucked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked good and then ate it and then it.</v>

2244
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And then I became buffered and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually dominant.</v>

2245
01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.040
<v Speaker 2>My prowess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sperm count went up so long.</v>

2246
01:42:15.041 --> 01:42:18.160
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing this almost two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>

2247
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.800
<v Speaker 2>45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go and I get hit.</v>

2248
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the truck,</v>

2249
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:25.600
<v Speaker 2>first thing I do when to get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car and I jog over to where the truck is</v>

2250
01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:30.601
<v Speaker 2>pulled over onto the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I noticed different truck come </v>

2251
01:42:30.601 --> 01:42:30.601
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look,</v>

2252
01:42:30.601 --> 01:42:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and I see these two dudes in the car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like freaking out.</v>

2253
01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2254
01:42:35.771 --> 01:42:36.690
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I just did.</v>

2255
01:42:36.690 --> 01:42:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're upset about getting into an </v>

2256
01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:42.460
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Drunk at all.</v>

2257
01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So we texted each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even one of the two,</v>

2258
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:48.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe both at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>texting while blown each other,</v>

2259
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.670
<v Speaker 2>texting you about how good it felt to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>blown away.</v>

2260
01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2261
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:56.680
<v Speaker 2>so after that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2262
01:42:56.681 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the idea of having a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>allsteel car,</v>

2263
01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.330
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and run into this.</v>

2264
01:43:01.331 --> 01:43:03.220
<v Speaker 2>See how that's gonna work out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2265
01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:05.140
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing about those old cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2266
01:43:05.141 --> 01:43:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a fucking hell of a wallop.</v>

2267
01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:12.900
<v Speaker 2>You can smash into stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I finally lose it and I just </v>

2268
01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:13.360
<v Speaker 2>started going Berserk on the freeway and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting people,</v>

2269
01:43:13.361 --> 01:43:15.100
<v Speaker 2>then this is going to be the vehicle to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

2270
01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.070
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prius.</v>

2271
01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's better than,</v>

2272
01:43:19.491 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 2>than a fucking Prius.</v>

2273
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I assault you seen windows on the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax.</v>

2274
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000
<v Speaker 2>They're the worst because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even fit any luggage in the trunk </v>

2275
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:30.760
<v Speaker 2>headache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

2276
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything against hybrid </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies or cleaner,</v>

2277
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:38.650
<v Speaker 2>safer burning stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

2278
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the rumble of the V eight.</v>

2279
01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you can't.</v>

2280
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:43.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's the thing,</v>

2281
01:43:43.211 --> 01:43:45.100
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to drive that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for it.</v>

2282
01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:50.140
<v Speaker 2>You think you're saving the environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>by creating a bunch of fucking shitty </v>

2283
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:50.140
<v Speaker 2>batteries that are going to pollute </v>
<v Speaker 2>something somewhere.</v>

2284
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Then all whatever minerals from Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2285
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything designed that it's all a </v>

2286
01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2287
01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been ways I'm sure that you </v>

2288
01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:07.721
<v Speaker 2>could have the most fuel efficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>gasoline powered car that we have no </v>

2289
01:44:07.721 --> 01:44:12.671
<v Speaker 2>idea because every one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been shelved on purpose by the oil </v>

2290
01:44:12.671 --> 01:44:16.271
<v Speaker 2>companies themselves because what good </v>
<v Speaker 2>would it do to you to have to buy less </v>

2291
01:44:16.271 --> 01:44:18.670
<v Speaker 2>gas is probably a car that can run on </v>
<v Speaker 2>water running.</v>

2292
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

01:44:23.601 --> 01:44:28.601
<v Speaker 2>but it has no soul hybrid cars have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>souls whatsoever.</v>

2295
01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I've driven a hybrid car and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2296
01:44:31.251 --> 01:44:32.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's fine and does what it means to do,</v>

2298
01:44:34.161 --> 01:44:39.161
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like I'm in a soulless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifeless box and you sPend so much time,</v>

2299
01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 2>especially if you live in la behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel.</v>

2300
01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to drive something that makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel good about being in it.</v>

2301
01:44:44.601 --> 01:44:49.601
<v Speaker 2>That makes me get out of bed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and go to get my car and be </v>

2302
01:44:49.601 --> 01:44:50.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn,</v>

2303

<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she knows her way around the block a</v>

2306
01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:03.180
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2307
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:08.030
<v Speaker 2>she smoked a about 687,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes in her life and you know,</v>

2308
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:13.660
<v Speaker 2>now she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she talks with some of those little </v>

2309
01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:13.940
<v Speaker 2>fucking microphone dailies in her neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2310
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got personality and the car is not </v>

2311
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 2>perfect and that's fine.</v>

2312
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mechanically sound and it runs </v>

2313
01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 2>great and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And trying to explain the appeal though.</v>

2314
01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's of like one of those having like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>v eight engine.</v>

2315
01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.600
<v Speaker 2>It has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You turn the car over and it's got a </v>

2316
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:33.600
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2317
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up here?</v>

2318

<v Speaker 2>Are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are we?</v>

2319
01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:37.280
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to do?</v>

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.290
<v Speaker 2>My run some shit over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go fast.</v>

2321
01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:41.570
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could just hang out,</v>

2322
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000
<v Speaker 2>just fucking get on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely different experience </v>

2323
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:47.690
<v Speaker 2>that corolla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though corollas and french car come</v>

2324
01:45:47.691 --> 01:45:52.691
<v Speaker 2>get you where you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lacking that and this something </v>

2325
01:45:52.691 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 2>that was captured in the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those cars.</v>

2326
01:45:53.691 --> 01:45:57.260
<v Speaker 2>These cars are steel and they're solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're meant to last a very long time.</v>

2327
01:45:57.590 --> 01:46:02.590
<v Speaker 2>They are and there are touches in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of comfort and of just style that are so</v>

2328
01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:06.800
<v Speaker 2>stupid like you didn't.</v>

2329
01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:11.920
<v Speaker 2>That's obnoxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you didn't have to create little </v>

2330
01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:14.231
<v Speaker 2>emblems if some little fucker had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>paint himself and then put them on the </v>

2331
01:46:14.231 --> 01:46:17.890
<v Speaker 2>inside of the interior like no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to pay attention to half of </v>

2332
01:46:17.890 --> 01:46:17.930
<v Speaker 2>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did it anyways,</v>

2333
01:46:17.931 --> 01:46:22.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like sinking the lights in </v>

2334
01:46:22.931 --> 01:46:24.381
<v Speaker 2>in a certain way and having to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>chrome around that bezel and going the </v>

2335
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:27.521
<v Speaker 2>extra mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extra 30 of mile that is,</v>

2336
01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna get in a car nowadays </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be in that kind of.</v>

2337
01:46:32.361 --> 01:46:37.361
<v Speaker 2>It's like going into those old buildings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and seeing all those touches that they </v>

2338
01:46:37.361 --> 01:46:40.211
<v Speaker 2>put into the flooring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the mantles and you're getting </v>

2339
01:46:40.211 --> 01:46:44.051
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a vehicle you can tell the </v>

2340
01:46:44.051 --> 01:46:44.690
<v Speaker 2>difference between factory just churning</v>
<v Speaker 2>out some,</v>

2341
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four wheeled immobile to get you </v>

2342
01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:51.461
<v Speaker 2>wherever and somebody even a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a factory line where people are putting </v>

2343
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:52.950
<v Speaker 2>these things together.</v>

2344
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you appreciate a technologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced cars?</v>

2345
01:46:55.891 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nissan gtr</v>

2346
01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:59.760
<v Speaker 2>bruised in the godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:46:59.950 --> 01:47:02.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's amazing that they can make </v>
<v Speaker 2>over 4,000</v>

2348
01:47:02.201 --> 01:47:04.710
<v Speaker 2>pound car run that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's quite that heavy.</v>

2349
01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 3,930</v>
<v Speaker 2>8:50.</v>

2350
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.490
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very heavy.</v>

2351
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Four wheel drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero to 60 in less than three seconds.</v>

2352
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.960
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unreal or their car and then it'll </v>

2353
01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.941
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in such a way that what my race or </v>

2354
01:47:19.941 --> 01:47:24.171
<v Speaker 2>friends will telling me that almost any </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot can get behind the wheel of that </v>

2355
01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.700
<v Speaker 2>car and learned to be fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I in fact in.</v>

2356
01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.420
<v Speaker 2>So some folks were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get one of those.</v>

2357
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2358
01:47:28.051 --> 01:47:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just sitting on a grant.</v>

2359
01:47:30.321 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go run out and buy a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2360
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:33.900
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

2361
01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:38.901
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna you're going to get </v>

2362
01:47:38.901 --> 01:47:38.901
<v Speaker 2>bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2363
01:47:38.901 --> 01:47:38.901
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to this and that.</v>

2364
01:47:38.901 --> 01:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually it's like there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun in this isn't it?</v>

2365
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it doesn't scare the shit out of </v>

2366
01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:45.970
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't come as everything.</v>

2367
01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does everything and does it all well </v>

2368
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:51.991
<v Speaker 2>and it takes all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the efforts and a lot of the skills out </v>

2369
01:47:51.991 --> 01:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>of learning and adapting to a vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it takes it away.</v>

2370
01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take all that shit</v>

2371
01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.550
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can shut off all that shit.</v>

2372
01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:02.580
<v Speaker 1>You can shut off all that electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and treated like you're on a </v>

2373
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:02.580
<v Speaker 1>race track and then it'll scare the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of here.</v>

2374
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:04.360
<v Speaker 1>You can go sideways on that car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2375
01:48:04.361 --> 01:48:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2376
01:48:05.201 --> 01:48:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you just have to just shut off all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability system.</v>

2377
01:48:08.231 --> 01:48:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2378
01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I love the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the coolest cars on </v>

2379
01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:13.400
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>

2380
01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:13.400
<v Speaker 1>It's almost ridiculous to get anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2381
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:15.110
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to get a car that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

2382
01:48:15.111 --> 01:48:16.970
<v Speaker 1>like that car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is it go fast,</v>

2383
01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's super tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most advanced </v>

2384
01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:26.860
<v Speaker 1>technological achievement as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can do today to get you to go </v>

2385
01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:29.360
<v Speaker 1>fast and safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most efficient</v>

2386
01:48:29.630 --> 01:48:32.490
<v Speaker 2>a car that costs three times as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2387
01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I,</v>

2388
01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:38.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to somebody about the </v>

2389
01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:38.800
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's okay that gtr will do it,</v>

2390
01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:43.241
<v Speaker 2>but when you get in that gtr and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look around and it is comfortable and </v>

2391
01:48:43.241 --> 01:48:45.821
<v Speaker 2>it's got everything you need or if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in that ferrari or that all of a </v>

2392
01:48:45.821 --> 01:48:45.821
<v Speaker 2>sudden things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not okay.</v>

2393
01:48:45.821 --> 01:48:48.860
<v Speaker 2>The ferrari isn't maybe quite as fast or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's as fast,</v>

2394
01:48:48.861 --> 01:48:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but you look at the way it was put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a way to let it remain.</v>

2395
01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.040
<v Speaker 2>But hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a huge difference there </v>

2396
01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:59.380
<v Speaker 2>and I would have trouble with a frog is </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to get behind the wheel,</v>

2397
01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:03.200
<v Speaker 2>which I've never done and drive the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of one and treat it like,</v>

2398
01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:03.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2399
01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.100
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is totally true.</v>

2400
01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:07.900
<v Speaker 2>She is all over.</v>

2401
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2402
01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too expensive.</v>

2403
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.000
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that and all of a sudden the bill</v>

2404
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:21.160
<v Speaker 2>shows up for changing oil breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that fun.</v>

2405
01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2406
01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:25.330
<v Speaker 2>the nomenclature that says you had it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all done,</v>

2407
01:49:25.331 --> 01:49:29.490
<v Speaker 2>then the value starts going down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's just too much fucking money.</v>

2408
01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Which is also why I bought a sIxty nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>olds cutlass.</v>

2409
01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:36.460
<v Speaker 2>That is not a super special one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not super pretty.</v>

2410
01:49:36.461 --> 01:49:38.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it gets dinged,</v>

2411
01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:41.470
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2412
01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things I've always </v>

2413
01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 2>said why there's something to be said </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a corvette zr one.</v>

2414
01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like what they've done is just</v>

2415
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.860
<v Speaker 1>blown everything out of the water as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as performance.</v>

2416
01:49:50.861 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 1>As far as zero to 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right up there with every other car</v>

2417
01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:55.800
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero $60.</v>

2418
01:49:55.801 --> 01:50:00.801
<v Speaker 1>Zero stops quicker than any car that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been made has got one of the most </v>

2419
01:50:00.801 --> 01:50:03.520
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous norberg ring times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

2420
01:50:03.810 --> 01:50:05.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interior is friends.</v>

2421
01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look.</v>

2422
01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put all that shit aside.</v>

2423
01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>The fuck it's or works right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit that,</v>

2424
01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 1>that gas pedal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real engine bitch.</v>

2425
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:20.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a 638 horsepower va that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like.</v>

2426
01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Like like hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like the fires of hell</v>

2427
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:29.160
<v Speaker 2>world challenge a road racing for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a scca.</v>

2428
01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:34.170
<v Speaker 2>They have a team of a cadillac and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those fucking cts bees.</v>

2429
01:50:35.190 --> 01:50:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Those are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start rolling around the crack.</v>

2430
01:50:37.481 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 2>They sound bad.</v>

2431
01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2432
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:43.160
<v Speaker 1>they sound like even if they don't take </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2433
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:45.550
<v Speaker 1>they at least let everybody know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were there.</v>

2434
01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.830
<v Speaker 1>So beastly fucking car and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ctsv are ridiculous.</v>

2435
01:50:48.831 --> 01:50:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't believe you're in a four </v>
<v Speaker 1>door sedan that's a cadillac,</v>

2436
01:50:52.530 --> 01:50:56.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were like 560 something fucking</v>

2437
01:50:56.181 --> 01:51:01.181
<v Speaker 1>horsepower essentially the same engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep tuned version of the zr one </v>

2438
01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:04.340
<v Speaker 1>gesture and just hauling ass and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a wagon so you just take your kids in</v>

2439
01:51:04.341 --> 01:51:07.070
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows the g force on a wagon.</v>

2440
01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.740
<v Speaker 1>We live in an awesome time as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're,</v>

2441
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:12.250
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's possible too.</v>

2442
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I think so I think our cars have come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a different level.</v>

2443
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I love my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my gt $500 [inaudible].</v>

2444
01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.160
<v Speaker 2>It's such a bad ass car and my sponsors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody have helped me to make it </v>

2445
01:51:23.681 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 2>even more gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I have a gt 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a 2011 convertible.</v>

2447
01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.360
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking grave.</v>

2448
01:51:30.361 --> 01:51:33.430
<v Speaker 1>But he's just an amazing car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so good.</v>

2449
01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.980
<v Speaker 1>You could slide the tail out if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2450
01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:41.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it has some sort of traction </v>

2451
01:51:41.010 --> 01:51:41.890
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fucking live actual car.</v>

2452
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really enjoyable.</v>

2453
01:51:44.050 --> 01:51:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I went and took all that enjoyable </v>

2454
01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:49.050
<v Speaker 2>thing and then turned it into like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderer.</v>

2455
01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:52.960
<v Speaker 2>So why put a whipple supercharger on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's 686 horsepower.</v>

2456
01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:55.930
<v Speaker 2>I got kw and bmr for suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2457
01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I braced the whole fucking thing up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have coil overs all around.</v>

2458
01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:01.150
<v Speaker 2>And the wider tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not yet,</v>

2459
01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:02.540
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.810

<v Speaker 2>a hrd is supposed to make the wheels for</v>

2461
01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:05.710
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the car.</v>

2462
01:52:05.711 --> 01:52:10.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting on somebody to step on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brakes because it's going to be in </v>

2463
01:52:10.711 --> 01:52:10.711
<v Speaker 2>the optimal ultimate streetcar </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges.</v>

2464
01:52:10.711 --> 01:52:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Here I've got one piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon,</v>

2465
01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:17.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one piece of aluminum drive line from </v>

2466
01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:17.180
<v Speaker 2>lethal performance and like all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>different stuff.</v>

2467
01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had somebody drive the car,</v>

2468
01:52:18.791 --> 01:52:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I took the rear seats out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled all the rivers,</v>

2469
01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.790
<v Speaker 2>all the rear stuff out by this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal set in a.</v>

2470
01:52:24.190 --> 01:52:26.600
<v Speaker 2>I've got to put a roll cage in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2471
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:31.750
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm still taking weight out of the </v>

2472
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.750
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And doing the thing,</v>

2473
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got the stereo in it,</v>

2474
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it's got everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2475
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I put these amazing recaro seats in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>

2476
01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super comfy.</v>

2477
01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:42.570
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've got this magnaflow exhaust all </v>

2478
01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:42.880
<v Speaker 2>through these three inch pipes and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I turned the car over,</v>

2479
01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know that my neighbors are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking rambling.</v>

2480
01:52:47.130 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Just a stock exhaust and the gt fIve </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking amazing.</v>

2481
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

2482
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the greatest sounds ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the roar of a good va,</v>

2483
01:52:56.710 --> 01:52:58.920
<v Speaker 2>great exhaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2484
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I let I let this guy drive it and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

2485
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.230
<v Speaker 2>it's cars trying to murder you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2486
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:04.430
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

2487
01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I tell everyone it's a 30 slash 30 car </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 30 seconds to 30 feet.</v>

2488
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Some joe schmoe gets behind the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've wrecked it because it'll just go</v>

2489
01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:16.751
<v Speaker 2>out from underneath you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take anything to blow the </v>

2490
01:53:16.751 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 2>tires on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way too much power for those back tires.</v>

2491
01:53:17.091 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2492
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:19.520
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the suspension,</v>

2493
01:53:19.730 --> 01:53:24.730
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving a belt optima challenge last </v>

2494
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:24.730
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just watching.</v>

2495
01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 2>And I decided to go through death valley</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of.</v>

2496
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:32.950
<v Speaker 2>And then meet up with the 15 so it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just stretches of just empty road and </v>

2497
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I've got this little problem right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to sort that out.</v>

2498
01:53:36.411 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 2>So I like to put the car in limp mode so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop it.</v>

2499
01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I can pull into stuff I pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll cruise at 140 flat as fuck.</v>

2500
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.280
<v Speaker 2>And if you go into a 55 mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour corner at 1:20</v>

2501
01:53:47.281 --> 01:53:49.370
<v Speaker 2>and just rolls right through it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes right back out.</v>

2502
01:53:49.371 --> 01:53:54.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this suspension from kw and all the </v>

2503
01:53:54.371 --> 01:53:57.730
<v Speaker 2>chassis embracing shift from bmr just </v>
<v Speaker 2>has this thing rocked on the ground and </v>

2504
01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I took it to this guy out in west la.</v>

2505
01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:02.750
<v Speaker 2>And Then this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tom can't remember the name of his shop,</v>

2506
01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:07.751
<v Speaker 2>but at any moment you could have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>$11 million with the cars all sitting </v>

2507
01:54:07.751 --> 01:54:12.100
<v Speaker 2>around this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a dump and you don't even </v>

2508
01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:12.780
<v Speaker 2>know it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's fantastic with doing suspension</v>

2509
01:54:12.781 --> 01:54:17.781
<v Speaker 2>and tweaking these cars out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they set it up for my weight and </v>

2510
01:54:17.781 --> 01:54:19.960
<v Speaker 2>everything and dropped it and lowered it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and set all the suspensions.</v>

2511
01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Your physical way because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavier guy,</v>

2512
01:54:23.091 --> 01:54:24.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because you have to to,</v>

2513
01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.880
<v Speaker 2>to adjust for that 250 pounds sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the driver's seat and how that affects </v>

2514
01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 2>suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do they have like an asymmetric </v>

2515
01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 2>suspension?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

2516
01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Like one side is like at a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>height or something?</v>

2517
01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly to keep it basically is have </v>

2518
01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 2>your fat ass sit in there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking adjust to adjust.</v>

2519
01:54:44.901 --> 01:54:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And I take the measurements and then do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the adjustments as need be.</v>

2520
01:54:47.770 --> 01:54:49.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my cat,</v>

2521
01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.400
<v Speaker 2>my buddy chris from kw and he works with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the drift guys like dai yoshihara </v>

2522
01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 2>and all them and sets their suspensions </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and everything comes up with trick,</v>

2523
01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 2>different ways of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the whole drift movement?</v>

2524
01:55:01.131 --> 01:55:06.131
<v Speaker 2>What is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people like to go sideways and </v>

2525
01:55:06.131 --> 01:55:06.131
<v Speaker 2>cars basically will one because it looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

2526
01:55:06.131 --> 01:55:06.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does look pretty,</v>

2527
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:11.711
<v Speaker 2>it looks fuckinG cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would call drift the </v>

2528
01:55:11.711 --> 01:55:15.110
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the combination of stunt driving </v>

2529
01:55:15.110 --> 01:55:18.020
<v Speaker 2>and racing because they have to go fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough through it.</v>

2530
01:55:18.021 --> 01:55:19.580
<v Speaker 2>They've got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've got a.</v>

2531
01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about going sideways </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they do it in those tandems,</v>

2532
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:28.090
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is like to try and match </v>
<v Speaker 2>your and get as close and as tight into </v>

2533
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.040
<v Speaker 2>any late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys run in front of you as tight as</v>

2534
01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:33.380
<v Speaker 2>possible without hitting him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the wall,</v>

2535
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:38.500
<v Speaker 2>hitting anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing it as fast and as skillful as </v>

2536
01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:38.500
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I look at it,</v>

2537
01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a violent auto ballet.</v>

2538
01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny way.</v>

2539
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:51.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a really fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've got like djs and it's like a </v>

2540
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 2>huge party the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long island auto belay,</v>

2541
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:52.610
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatic.</v>

2542
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:57.720
<v Speaker 2>How do they judge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based on judge on a speed.</v>

2543
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:02.870
<v Speaker 2>They look at the speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at how now they have these </v>

2544
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:04.851
<v Speaker 2>clipping point things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've got these lights that will </v>

2545
01:56:04.851 --> 01:56:04.851
<v Speaker 2>monitor up if you get within a foot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them with your car.</v>

2546
01:56:04.851 --> 01:56:07.710
<v Speaker 2>So they measure how close you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these clipping points.</v>

2547
01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.380
<v Speaker 2>They also measure how closely you follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2548
01:56:10.450 --> 01:56:13.260
<v Speaker 2>You hit the right apex is in lines for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the drips,</v>

2549
01:56:13.261 --> 01:56:17.490
<v Speaker 2>but also how closely and tightly you </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the guy ahead of you.</v>

2550
01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:19.950
<v Speaker 2>The lead car in the fall and you're as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the follow car,</v>

2551
01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:24.260
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of crashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a decent amount of wacky stuff.</v>

2552
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ShIt.</v>

2553
01:56:25.450 --> 01:56:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not catastrophic.</v>

2554
01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.290
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2555
01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.360
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of their body panels or title and </v>

2556
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:33.360
<v Speaker 2>zip ties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just fucking rip right off.</v>

2557
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2558
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:38.180
<v Speaker 2>On purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just so that because we have all </v>

2559
01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:40.350
<v Speaker 2>these fucking zoots fittings all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place,</v>

2560
01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 2>locked in there and it gets torn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No instead,</v>

2561
01:56:43.111 --> 01:56:45.960
<v Speaker 2>now just breaks it some little spot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls off real easy.</v>

2562
01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So instead of tearing like a whole bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fairing off of the car or something </v>

2563
01:56:51.230 --> 01:56:54.831
<v Speaker 2>and just tears off a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the bumper rips off and you can go </v>

2564
01:56:54.831 --> 01:56:55.000
<v Speaker 2>ahead and fix that real quick and zip it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right back on again.</v>

2565
01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:55.480
<v Speaker 2>That's interest.</v>

2566
01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:00.740
<v Speaker 1>So there's sort of like altered them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the constant collision.</v>

2567
01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and like there are some amazing </v>

2568
01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:07.300
<v Speaker 2>moments where someone's coming through </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2569
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:09.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up against the wall and they're,</v>

2570
01:57:09.611 --> 01:57:12.810
<v Speaker 2>they're getting that back end out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get so close with their back end,</v>

2571
01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:16.020
<v Speaker 2>hits the wall just enough to fold it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they come off,</v>

2572
01:57:16.021 --> 01:57:17.190
<v Speaker 2>it pops back out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2573
01:57:17.191 --> 01:57:19.480
<v Speaker 2>that's holy shit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2574
01:57:19.481 --> 01:57:21.420
<v Speaker 2>you literally ran your car into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall,</v>

2575
01:57:21.450 --> 01:57:22.950
<v Speaker 2>but just enough that it was still okay.</v>

2576
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one day there's going to be.</v>

2577
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Every car is going to be like a gtr </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everything is calculated to going </v>

2578
01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:29.960
<v Speaker 1>to see things coming in</v>

2579
01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:34.970
<v Speaker 2>except it's not going to go that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the governments can tell you where </v>

2580
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.970
<v Speaker 2>to drive.</v>

2581
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:35.070
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2582
01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had heard something about,</v>

2583
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is a true story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really researched it,</v>

2584
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 1>but someone was really driving really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast on the highway and the cops,</v>

2585
01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:45.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called a,</v>

2586
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.350
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onstar.</v>

2587
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:48.210
<v Speaker 1>And they shut the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

2588
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is,</v>

2589
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.390
<v Speaker 1>is that really possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2590
01:57:51.391 --> 01:57:56.391
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not people getting aWay from the </v>

2591
01:57:56.391 --> 01:58:00.861
<v Speaker 1>cops either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am not also for the fucking </v>

2592
01:58:00.861 --> 01:58:01.380
<v Speaker 1>skynet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut your car off.</v>

2593
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Know that drives me nuts.</v>

2594
01:58:03.230 --> 01:58:06.650
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one thing is to,</v>

2595
01:58:06.651 --> 01:58:08.470
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with the problem.</v>

2596
01:58:08.471 --> 01:58:13.471
<v Speaker 2>And then he is to take it so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much further that all of a sudden </v>

2597
01:58:13.471 --> 01:58:14.480
<v Speaker 2>everybody's freedoms are impinged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not okay.</v>

2598
01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I'd rather have to deal </v>

2599
01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:21.101
<v Speaker 2>with cops chasing somebody down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it ended up in my house getting </v>

2600
01:58:21.101 --> 01:58:24.731
<v Speaker 2>ruined because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then having the big brother able to make</v>

2601
01:58:24.891 --> 01:58:26.960
<v Speaker 2>everybody do everything the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

2602
01:58:26.961 --> 01:58:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

2603
01:58:29.751 --> 01:58:31.370
<v Speaker 2>And I was talking to this gal and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2604
01:58:31.371 --> 01:58:36.371
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if cars start driving </v>

2605
01:58:36.371 --> 01:58:36.371
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were talking about that magnetic</v>

2606
01:58:36.371 --> 01:58:39.521
<v Speaker 2>system where they had the cars following</v>
<v Speaker 2>and traffic and stopping and slowing </v>

2607
01:58:39.521 --> 01:58:40.640
<v Speaker 2>down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing accidents.</v>

2608
01:58:40.641 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think safety is great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but life is dangerous,</v>

2609
01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:46.210
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

2610
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.330
<v Speaker 2>we die everyday.</v>

2611
01:58:47.410 --> 01:58:48.810
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2612
01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.260
<v Speaker 2>You know what cormac mccarthy talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

2613
01:58:52.261 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything is about games,</v>

2614
01:58:54.650 --> 01:58:55.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this booklet and marine.</v>

2615
01:58:55.871 --> 01:58:57.330
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes on about how it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2616
01:58:57.370 --> 01:58:58.780
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men love games,</v>

2617
01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:00.530
<v Speaker 2>boys love games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they love,</v>

2618
01:59:00.610 --> 01:59:05.610
<v Speaker 2>the thing about a game that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>more important or less is what's at </v>

2619
01:59:05.610 --> 01:59:08.611
<v Speaker 2>stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So war being the ultimate game because </v>

2620
01:59:08.611 --> 01:59:11.161
<v Speaker 2>death is at stake if and that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate ultimate wager is life and it's</v>

2621
01:59:13.181 --> 01:59:18.181
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was no consequences for the </v>

2622
01:59:18.181 --> 01:59:18.181
<v Speaker 2>things that for a lot of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did,</v>

2623
01:59:18.181 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 2>there would be no that wouldn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

2624
01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course getting into the ring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting somebody with no consequence of</v>

2625
01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 2>injury or death or whatever wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't hold nearly as much interest.</v>

2626
01:59:30.341 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't have the same meaning behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2627
01:59:32.801 --> 01:59:37.801
<v Speaker 2>And then it has to be very careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the samurai fighting starts </v>

2628
01:59:37.801 --> 01:59:38.680
<v Speaker 2>becoming really popular and do start </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually sword fighting.</v>

2629
01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Then people aren't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch mma especially.</v>

2630
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a whole collection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sword fighting videos right now.</v>

2631
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it's put as a boy with cox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2632
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I could do?</v>

2633
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

2634
01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Was like night of the warrior fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>with swords.</v>

2635
02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible for us to go back down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like the romans and the christians to</v>

2636
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:09.410
<v Speaker 2>the lions and all that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

2637
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything's possible.</v>

2638
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2639
02:00:11.511 --> 02:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look it.</v>

2640
02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Look at the way that the government is </v>
<v Speaker 2>today versus where it was saying,</v>

2641
02:00:16.401 --> 02:00:19.490
<v Speaker 2>and in the fifties or in the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds,</v>

2642
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
<v Speaker 2>it's much more intrusive by far our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by far and,</v>

2643
02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:30.060
<v Speaker 2>or just look at how radical tastes may </v>
<v Speaker 2>change in terms of what content you'll </v>

2644
02:00:30.351 --> 02:00:33.470
<v Speaker 2>see on television versus what you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2645
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>let's say even in the most risky part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twenties and thirties.</v>

2646
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Technology of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always has a lot to do with that.</v>

2647
02:00:40.251 --> 02:00:45.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have cameras and that anybody can </v>

2648
02:00:45.251 --> 02:00:47.711
<v Speaker 2>use the shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course it's much easier to make </v>

2649
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:48.560
<v Speaker 2>porn than it was back in when you had an</v>
<v Speaker 2>edison machine or whatever.</v>

2650
02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually had a day.</v>

2651
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:55.880
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta have a good strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm and you gotta you gotta have </v>

2652
02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:56.270
<v Speaker 2>coordinates that jerk off and wind a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel at the same time.</v>

2653
02:00:56.690 --> 02:00:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2654
02:00:58.190 --> 02:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but look at if you just turn into </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular advertising,</v>

2655
02:01:02.330 --> 02:01:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2656
02:01:02.970 --> 02:01:07.970
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that there are just men </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking off on corners everywhere they </v>

2657
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:09.440
<v Speaker 2>go because there's so much sex being </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown at you all the time.</v>

2658
02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.670
<v Speaker 2>The best way to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2659
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:14.560
<v Speaker 2>and how much we can get away with in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of flesh and,</v>

2660
02:01:14.850 --> 02:01:16.700
<v Speaker 2>and provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and,</v>

2661
02:01:16.730 --> 02:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>and what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we see these things as being an,</v>

2662
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything against any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2663
02:01:21.441 --> 02:01:26.441
<v Speaker 2>but back in the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people would have an aneurysm </v>

2664
02:01:26.441 --> 02:01:28.860
<v Speaker 2>unthought of to see something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just things progress.</v>

2665
02:01:28.861 --> 02:01:33.861
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could things progressed to where people </v>

2666
02:01:33.861 --> 02:01:33.861
<v Speaker 2>are really sort of fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2667
02:01:33.861 --> 02:01:37.121
<v Speaker 2>I suppose so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to have a few natural </v>

2668
02:01:37.121 --> 02:01:37.490
<v Speaker 2>disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People wanted to sword fight.</v>

2669
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't they be allowed to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if they choose to do it,</v>

2670
02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:43.020
<v Speaker 5>if they choose to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2671
02:01:43.410 --> 02:01:44.440
<v Speaker 5>If they choose to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2672
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:47.440
<v Speaker 5>if people want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want the ultimate contests.</v>

2673
02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:49.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like if they don't do that,</v>

2674
02:01:49.441 --> 02:01:54.441
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are temporary being if you choose </v>

2675
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:54.441
<v Speaker 5>to go out that actually</v>

2676
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:56.620
<v Speaker 2>as a highlander,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to sword fight to live forever.</v>

2677
02:01:57.070 --> 02:01:57.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2678
02:01:58.330 --> 02:01:59.650
<v Speaker 2>There can be only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2679
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:01.430
<v Speaker 5>Josh barnett.</v>

2685

<v Speaker 5>so you said about three months before </v>
<v Speaker 5>people can look forward to seeing you </v>

2686
02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:14.390
<v Speaker 5>very much before you can go back into </v>
<v Speaker 5>training.</v>

2687
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to say I got to follow up on friday</v>

2688
02:02:17.471 --> 02:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I've got good range of motion</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it but I do want to take,</v>

2689
02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's going to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little longer to cut this back open and </v>

2690
02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:25.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't like surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get cut open.</v>

2691
02:02:25.601 --> 02:02:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go under but I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in the long run it's going to be a</v>

2692
02:02:28.391 --> 02:02:31.870
<v Speaker 2>lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to do that soon and then you</v>

2693
02:02:31.871 --> 02:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>have to recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2694
02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2695
02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm even looking into like there's like </v>

2696
02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>what can they do for bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2697
02:02:41.681 --> 02:02:44.290
<v Speaker 2>nowadays and I mean this is my </v>
<v Speaker 2>livelihood.</v>

2698
02:02:44.291 --> 02:02:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I need to make sure if this shit doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen again.</v>

2699
02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:51.540
<v Speaker 2>What kennedy can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having online about micro wars </v>

2700
02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.010
<v Speaker 2>because there's any fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so those kinda,</v>

2701
02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:56.180
<v Speaker 2>those cannot punch just about anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2702
02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:01.200
<v Speaker 2>And there's like chinese iron palm </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques and these people work on it </v>

2703
02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.921
<v Speaker 2>and so it seems like it would condition </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands the war or those kinds of </v>

2704
02:03:04.921 --> 02:03:05.430
<v Speaker 2>giant knuckles and it seems like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would help little.</v>

2705
02:03:05.590 --> 02:03:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I've seen documentary the duties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hits a little piece of steel </v>

2706
02:03:10.590 --> 02:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fu dude is legit,</v>

2707
02:03:12.161 --> 02:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy he doesn't feel to look at doing</v>

2708
02:03:15.341 --> 02:03:17.410
<v Speaker 2>something like that and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2709
02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:22.740
<v Speaker 2>what forms of calcium or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was supposedly something called </v>

2710
02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:22.930
<v Speaker 2>forteo out there which was a bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>density drug.</v>

2711
02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give it to us,</v>

2712
02:03:24.971 --> 02:03:29.971
<v Speaker 2>throw the women with osteoporosis with </v>
<v Speaker 2>high a likelihood of fracture.</v>

2713
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might be able to like a healthy </v>

2714
02:03:35.550 --> 02:03:35.710
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jack up your bone density I suppose.</v>

2715
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is we're losing bone density</v>

2716
02:03:37.770 --> 02:03:38.490
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2717
02:03:38.491 --> 02:03:41.460
<v Speaker 5>That is a problem with getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with fighting the power man,</v>

2718
02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.610
<v Speaker 5>fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really</v>

2719
02:03:42.850 --> 02:03:47.850
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every cell that we have in our body is </v>

2720
02:03:47.850 --> 02:03:50.970
<v Speaker 2>constantly being attacked and they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerate over time and can't live </v>

2721
02:03:50.970 --> 02:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're here,</v>

2723
02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to be able to use it as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have no feelings.</v>

2745
02:04:41.911 --> 02:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I have no emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about anyone,</v>

2746
02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about my life anymore.</v>

2747
02:04:46.591 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2748
02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I have a little set list of songs I </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to you in my,</v>

2749
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>my hotel room before I go to and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2750
02:04:52.771 --> 02:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>like a couple tiers might fall from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2751
02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without out any sound,</v>

2752
02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of nowhere.</v>

2753
02:05:00.171 --> 02:05:05.171
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that those tiers are for the </v>

2754
02:05:05.171 --> 02:05:05.400
<v Speaker 1>life that I no longer own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is gone.</v>

2755
02:05:05.401 --> 02:05:10.401
<v Speaker 1>I am dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more into my life and is no longer </v>

2756
02:05:10.401 --> 02:05:11.070
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am this,</v>

2757
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:16.130
<v Speaker 1>this is me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking the life of a dead person </v>

2758
02:05:16.130 --> 02:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to go is to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and let's go to the death.</v>

2759
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just I have nothing to lose because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing anymore.</v>

2760
02:05:22.171 --> 02:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel nothing.</v>

2761
02:05:23.551 --> 02:05:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I care for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of that,</v>

2762
02:05:26.451 --> 02:05:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the most intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of all time.</v>

2763
02:05:28.641 --> 02:05:30.410
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the middle of the cage,</v>

2764
02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:33.620
<v Speaker 1>like your last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most recent will call me and you,</v>

2765
02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you guys are both throwing down and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you both had broken hands at that point </v>

2766
02:05:38.650 --> 02:05:42.491
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be one of the most intense </v>

2767
02:05:42.491 --> 02:05:42.491
<v Speaker 1>and realistic forms of struggle on her.</v>

2768
02:05:42.491 --> 02:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately that's where it's </v>

2769
02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:48.440
<v Speaker 2>great where your corner man can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can give you that input to,</v>

2770
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:49.190
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2771
02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:52.940
<v Speaker 2>to aim your direction because I got on </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and broke my hand,</v>

2772
02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:56.990
<v Speaker 2>made a couple fucked up a couple times </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and then all of a sudden I went</v>

2773
02:05:56.991 --> 02:05:59.570
<v Speaker 2>into fight to the death mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a fight to the death.</v>

2774
02:05:59.750 --> 02:06:02.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight for five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't finish it in five,</v>

2775
02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>chances are on those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't really.</v>

2776
02:06:07.191 --> 02:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2777
02:06:07.731 --> 02:06:08.530
<v Speaker 2>people looking at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2778
02:06:08.590 --> 02:06:10.910
<v Speaker 2>you're like blonde blood out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>nose and just,</v>

2779
02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming out.</v>

2780
02:06:11.751 --> 02:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>People never stopped coming forward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to murder.</v>

2781
02:06:14.151 --> 02:06:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2782
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:20.660
<v Speaker 2>but in front of three judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a referee and five rounds,</v>

2783
02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got paid less.</v>

2784
02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's still a learning process.</v>

2785
02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know it's,</v>

2786
02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2787
02:06:33.191 --> 02:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>it is a learning process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that for me,</v>

2788
02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:38.500
<v Speaker 2>being like that feeling that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2789
02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:44.130
<v Speaker 2>that's there's days I feel like most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time I feel like that's the way I </v>

2790
02:06:44.351 --> 02:06:47.110
<v Speaker 2>really am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I get my strip off.</v>

2791
02:06:47.170 --> 02:06:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Everything that society has imparted on </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and him and parts on me like pushes </v>

2792
02:06:53.141 --> 02:06:55.840
<v Speaker 2>on and be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I throw it all away and it to.</v>

2793
02:06:56.070 --> 02:07:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling like your dead is pretty free.</v>

2794
02:07:02.610 --> 02:07:07.610
<v Speaker 2>You really feel free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never appreciated life more when </v>

2795
02:07:07.610 --> 02:07:08.170
<v Speaker 2>you've already given it away.</v>

2796
02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2797
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as intense as things can get.</v>

2798
02:07:15.710 --> 02:07:17.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no other way.</v>

2799
02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is as intense.</v>

2800
02:07:18.961 --> 02:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing other than actual war </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

2801
02:07:21.590 --> 02:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more intense.</v>

2802
02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:24.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2803
02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also,</v>

2804
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2805
02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:28.740
<v Speaker 2>you start getting a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

2806
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just do it.</v>

2807
02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.430
<v Speaker 2>If there's something that must be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>

2808
02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:33.780
<v Speaker 2>You just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2809
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

2810
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:37.600
<v Speaker 2>everything doesn't have to always be to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of know,</v>

2811
02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2812
02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:44.160
<v Speaker 2>the walking dead and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have any emotion or feeling </v>

2813
02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.010
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a girl I was in love with,</v>

2814
02:07:45.011 --> 02:07:50.011
<v Speaker 2>break the living shit out of my heart as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as I had to go off over to Japan </v>

2815
02:07:50.011 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 2>and I had pro wrestling matches to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and I'm destroyed inside.</v>

2816
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally ruined and I'm giving press </v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences and shit like that.</v>

2817
02:07:56.501 --> 02:07:59.230
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to see a hero.</v>

2818
02:07:59.231 --> 02:08:01.570
<v Speaker 2>But inside I just feel like a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2819
02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:06.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel terrible and I'll go out there </v>

2820
02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and wrestle.</v>

2821
02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Matt and I had a wrestling match in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of 12,000</v>

2822
02:08:07.931 --> 02:08:12.400
<v Speaker 2>people and make it look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did and we fucking,</v>

2823
02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>we tore the house down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a,</v>

2824
02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:16.540
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2825
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:21.600
<v Speaker 2>You feel like death right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like the lowest form and your </v>

2826
02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:23.980
<v Speaker 2>heart is so broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody paid for that.</v>

2827
02:08:24.490 --> 02:08:25.990
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't really matter how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>

2828
02:08:25.991 --> 02:08:30.991
<v Speaker 2>Right now you have this in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this must be accomplished and you </v>

2829
02:08:30.991 --> 02:08:33.700
<v Speaker 2>can anybody make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse you for cIrcumstances,</v>

2830
02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:35.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sorry.</v>

2831
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:40.800
<v Speaker 2>There really is no excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is only the result and only you </v>

2832
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:42.370
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you do it or you don't.</v>

2833
02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>What's it like for you to see guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you came up with?</v>

2834
02:08:46.250 --> 02:08:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Guys like pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own that have reached pretty much </v>

2835
02:08:51.250 --> 02:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>the end and you see the end and did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

2836
02:08:51.651 --> 02:08:55.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you take like a mental account?</v>

2837
02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Dionte</v>

2838
02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:02.160
<v Speaker 2>have there ever been training even </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm tired of getting hit in the </v>

2839
02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:03.570
<v Speaker 2>head by fucking monsters that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2840
02:09:03.571 --> 02:09:08.571
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that part of the reason I tried </v>

2841
02:09:08.571 --> 02:09:09.730
<v Speaker 2>to read as much as I do and I do want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be a more,</v>

2842
02:09:09.731 --> 02:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>well everyday that I have a chance to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a better person and learn more and be,</v>

2843
02:09:14.070 --> 02:09:17.070
<v Speaker 2>have a broader sense of this world at </v>
<v Speaker 2>large,</v>

2844
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is necessary.</v>

2845
02:09:20.041 --> 02:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of my,</v>

2846
02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:26.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just right as a person to do so.</v>

2847
02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:28.420
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

2848
02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:30.960
<v Speaker 2>you should have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2849
02:09:32.010 --> 02:09:37.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the stable way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects of that kind of shit of </v>

2850
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:41.540
<v Speaker 2>dementia and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm getting mad and practice </v>

2851
02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:42.630
<v Speaker 2>constantly and then I go in the ring and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get hit in the head some more and,</v>

2852
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:44.640
<v Speaker 2>and it damages your brain.</v>

2853
02:09:44.730 --> 02:09:49.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are more susceptible to the </v>

2854
02:09:49.730 --> 02:09:52.640
<v Speaker 2>side effects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of catching pugilistic dementia and the </v>

2855
02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.790
<v Speaker 2>different becoming punchdrunk and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that there've been times </v>

2856
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:58.650
<v Speaker 2>where I find myself trying to catch a </v>
<v Speaker 2>word and I'm like,</v>

2857
02:09:58.651 --> 02:10:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I can't think of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

2858
02:10:00.601 --> 02:10:05.601
<v Speaker 2>but that's maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's because I'm getting hit in </v>

2859
02:10:05.601 --> 02:10:06.270
<v Speaker 2>the head by eric prindle who's 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

2860
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:11.830
<v Speaker 2>but so why not just save it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save that brain so that I can use more </v>

2861
02:10:11.911 --> 02:10:16.911
<v Speaker 2>of it and even I'm still going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit in the head no matter what </v>

2862
02:10:16.911 --> 02:10:16.911
<v Speaker 2>headgear I have on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2863
02:10:16.911 --> 02:10:18.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take things to the point</v>

2864
02:10:18.901 --> 02:10:23.901
<v Speaker 2>where I've made a disability for myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally or physically with fighting.</v>

2865
02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:30.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think you'll be able to discern </v>

2866
02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:30.940
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll be.</v>

2867
02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I think if I'm honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>

2868
02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:31.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2869
02:10:31.891 --> 02:10:36.891
<v Speaker 2>but why watch guys like pedro can't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>a punch like he used to and part of me </v>

2870
02:10:36.891 --> 02:10:39.040
<v Speaker 2>feels bad when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2871
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I do feel sad for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're at now compared to where </v>

2872
02:10:44.050 --> 02:10:48.761
<v Speaker 2>they used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also more so happy that they are</v>

2873
02:10:50.091 --> 02:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>here on this earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving their life,</v>

2874
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:58.400
<v Speaker 2>still being able to exert themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ring and be a part of this.</v>

2875
02:10:58.430 --> 02:11:01.190
<v Speaker 2>And if they decide to retire or when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to that point,</v>

2876
02:11:01.191 --> 02:11:02.900
<v Speaker 2>they need to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they did it,</v>

2877
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:05.090
<v Speaker 2>that they had the opportunity to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>that life.</v>

2878
02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:10.091
<v Speaker 2>They took those experiences into </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and they can stand there in </v>

2879
02:11:10.091 --> 02:11:11.180
<v Speaker 2>front of anybody and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>

2880
02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I made my mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my success is I did this.</v>

2881
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I did it with everything I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

2882
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 2>you can't take any of that away from me </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2883
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:23.360
<v Speaker 2>It's all mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I earned it.</v>

2884
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:24.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's beautiful,</v>

2885
