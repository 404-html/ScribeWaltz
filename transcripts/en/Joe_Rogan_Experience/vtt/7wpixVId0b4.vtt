00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.470

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>not nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

54
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an honor it is,</v>

55
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 1>a company that sells supplements to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase your performance,</v>

56
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cognitively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's physically.</v>

57
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a shroom tech sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing,</v>

58
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>amazing supplement that we put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from the quarter seps mushroom and </v>

59
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it is there certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants like cordyceps,</v>

60
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:08.191
<v Speaker 1>mushroom being an excellent law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really a plant because </v>

61
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>cordyceps mushroom is a crazy kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fungus.</v>

62
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weird sort of a living </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

63
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's closer to funguses or I believe I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to speak out of school,</v>

64
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but I believe they're closer to humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and plants is right.</v>

65
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this quarter,</v>

67
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>eps mushroom stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:26.251
<v Speaker 1>the first experimented it apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>when in high altitude hurting </v>

70
00:03:26.251 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found that the cows are more active</v>

71
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>after the ate these mushrooms and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of put it together and the way</v>

72
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:37.081
<v Speaker 1>it's grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grown like on caterpillars or some </v>

73
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:40.291
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this really freaky fucking </v>

74
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>process to create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it is,</v>

75
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing endurance supplement.</v>

76
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantastic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really obvious effect if you </v>

77
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:54.571
<v Speaker 1>have like a brutal workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go a do a spin class </v>

78
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Duncan and get ferocious to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties music,</v>

79
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking Pat Benatar and you're </v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

81
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just an excellent supplement for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>for endurance.</v>

84
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Anybody's doing Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing kettlebells,</v>

85
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.200
<v Speaker 1>anything along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of [inaudible] in it as </v>

86
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real noticeable effect.</v>

87
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain is,</v>

88
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another supplement that we have that,</v>

89
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear by it,</v>

90
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:25.941
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking this shit forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been taking nootropics forever </v>

91
00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:29.731
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it only makes sense to me </v>

92
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>that if it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as I'm not starving as long as I</v>

93
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>have money to buy supplements and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't spend your money on healthy food,</v>

94
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>but if you have the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always think that what,</v>

95
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is like really important?</v>

96
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

97
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>What is really important when one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that's really important to me is </v>

98
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the way my brain functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:53.251
<v Speaker 1>because I know it's variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a big difference between </v>

100
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>the way I am when I'm hung over.</v>

101
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am when I'm jet lagged and when I'm in</v>

102
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:02.611
<v Speaker 1>the groove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I feel great and my words are </v>

103
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>flowing and conversations are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoothly and you're in the middle of.</v>

104
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck causes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rest,</v>

106
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's health and I also </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's nutrition.</v>

107
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And my experience with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>started off with Bill Roman [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

109
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It's called neuro one and he created </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because he,</v>

110
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>he got a bunch of concussions from </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing football,</v>

111
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>famous football player and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.951
<v Speaker 1>he was fighting against it and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things he did is try to improve the </v>

113
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>quality of his brain and improve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of the functioning of his mind.</v>

114
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So he started experimenting with various</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients that do that and uh,</v>

115
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's sorta where Alpha brain took </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

116
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>From there we just tried to put together</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best combination of what we know so </v>

117

129
00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a subtle difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it's a real difference,</v>

130
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it improves,</v>

131
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>it improves the quality of my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds crazy,</v>

132

<v Speaker 1>if you just google nootropic and o,</v>

135
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:36.521

<v Speaker 1>had been done on it and it's shown </v>

136
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>increases in memory and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating stuff.</v>

137
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.140

<v Speaker 1>and very controversial as I sent.</v>

138
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a real,</v>

139
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.740

<v Speaker 3>increasing your swagger.</v>

189
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I saw it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Isn't that important?</v>

199
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.690

202
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a like a genuine name,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the perfect frequency and you have that </v>

207
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.341
<v Speaker 3>feeling like you just walk up like is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that it's not swagger.</v>

208
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:43.800

<v Speaker 3>so we have to have another word for it.</v>

211
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 3>What is that feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feeling like when you're at your </v>

212
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 3>past like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>been a being in the zone,</v>

214

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dude's legit power lifter.</v>

234
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that supplement to increase </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's production of testosterone,</v>

235
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:10.401
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a little hotties at a bar and it </v>

236
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:14.761
<v Speaker 3>was like no grinding cocaine for brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>powder on it.</v>

237
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 3>That's an enormous person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That swag.</v>

238
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he's got swag?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you just say?</v>

239
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Would you not even tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we just say swag?</v>

240
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd run from that date.</v>

241
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I saw that.</v>

242
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 3>Cue The music man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually code named Brogan and go fuck </v>

243
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.861
<v Speaker 3>yourself Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We love you.</v>

244
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Powerful dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your back man.</v>

245
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm back back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back from the precipice.</v>

246
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Back from the precipice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well none of us are ever like from the </v>

247
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 3>precedence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw a big sign today.</v>

248
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.880
<v Speaker 3>It was something about surviving cancer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the lady was a smile and laugh and </v>

249
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.861
<v Speaker 3>then she was like holding a baby or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that and it says </v>

250
00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:13.861
<v Speaker 3>something about surviving cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought about it.</v>

251
00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really survive shit.</v>

252
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

253
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 4>There's no surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

254
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Something we do for a little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We put it off for the amount of time </v>

255
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 4>that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're sentient.</v>

256
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.000
<v Speaker 4>You extended the amount of time that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have consciousness.</v>

257
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a very funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like our age starts.</v>

258
00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:36.941
<v Speaker 4>The moment that matter were composed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wakes up to an awareness of itself and </v>

259
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:38.240
<v Speaker 4>stops the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not aware of itself anymore,</v>

260
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.250
<v Speaker 4>but what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not really our age.</v>

261
00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:44.660
<v Speaker 4>It's much longer than that and surviving</v>
<v Speaker 4>means you've extended the amount of self</v>

262
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:49.661
<v Speaker 4>awareness by some number of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't really surviving.</v>

263
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something I've been entirely on </v>

264
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:54.830
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole surviving cancer thing is a.</v>

265
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.170
<v Speaker 4>it's an annoying term to like now I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer survivor.</v>

266
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be that.</v>

267
00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:03.710
<v Speaker 4>That's it's so many other things I'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to be represented by then.</v>

268
00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Then that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not there.</v>

269
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 4>Anyone out there who's fighting cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

270
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.590
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep up the good fight.</v>

271
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:14.591
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole brotherhood that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out there if people and and </v>

272
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:16.190
<v Speaker 4>sisterhood of people who are dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this shit and it's beautiful.</v>

273
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.340
<v Speaker 4>So I don't mean to denigrate your </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggle that you're going through.</v>

274
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.860
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish there was another word for it.</v>

275
00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:22.950
<v Speaker 4>And then then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

276
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.410
<v Speaker 4>then survivor such a dire term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a dire term.</v>

277
00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:30.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like you just climbed out of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dragon's mouth.</v>

278
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:34.070
<v Speaker 4>There's are smoldering car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

279
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a real problem whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 3>label anything,</v>

280
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 3>call people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

281
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:40.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cancer victim,</v>

282
00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:42.300
<v Speaker 3>a cancer survivor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cancer,</v>

283
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.320
<v Speaker 3>a success in the war on cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

284
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.950
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you,</v>

285
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

286
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.160
<v Speaker 3>you automatically categorize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls into this sort of package.</v>

287
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.660
<v Speaker 4>They want to classify everything man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even not just fucking,</v>

288
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

289
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

290
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.110
<v Speaker 4>can't find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a cancer survivor.</v>

291
00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I had and I don't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a term I I care for,</v>

292
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.600
<v Speaker 4>but fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's weird is when people really </v>

293
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.380
<v Speaker 4>that's becomes their new identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what they were before,</v>

294
00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:14.381
<v Speaker 4>they didn't die from a disease or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing becomes insignificant to this one </v>

295
00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:19.811
<v Speaker 4>little moment of overcoming something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's where it's weird to </v>

296
00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:20.420
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

297
00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:21.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

298
00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:23.660
<v Speaker 4>you're the sum total of everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've done,</v>

299
00:14:23.661 --> 00:14:28.661
<v Speaker 4>not just some inevitable Blewett that </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerged that you climbed out of or </v>

300
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.530
<v Speaker 4>temporarily managed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

301
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.600
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you wearing a pink ribbon?</v>

302
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know?</v>

303
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.140
<v Speaker 4>How do you know what's tied around my </v>
<v Speaker 4>cock cock ring?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Who's the first sick fuck that figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a cock ring?</v>

305
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I got to figure out how to get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood in my dick.</v>

306
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Hm?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It might be a good idea.</v>

308
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:57.671

<v Speaker 3>when you're like a little too drunk and </v>

309

<v Speaker 3>Hard to like squeeze the base of it to </v>

00:16:56.491 --> 00:17:00.690
<v Speaker 3>There was a woman in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a Russian woman who could</v>

349
00:17:00.691 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 3>stick something in her pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

351
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like actually like a jaw.</v>

352
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:12.831
<v Speaker 3>It would clamp down on this shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick like a ball on a rope and they're </v>

353
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.940
<v Speaker 3>posting and then clamp down and lift </v>
<v Speaker 3>weights.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a hair tail</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's lifting weights with her pussy.</v>

361
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.860
<v Speaker 3>She is like all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's all about milking cock.</v>

362
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.220
<v Speaker 3>That's all she is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's her number one thing online that </v>

363
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.670
<v Speaker 3>says she's so good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can't wait to get a cock in there to</v>

364
00:17:44.671 --> 00:17:46.550
<v Speaker 3>shock the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably,</v>

365
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.790
<v Speaker 3>and it probably mostly new Cox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know these guys like.</v>

366

<v Speaker 3>And then what's the big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

368
00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean she could pick up weights with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her pussy.</v>

369
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.270
<v Speaker 3>It's probably way stronger than her hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's developed it and like some</v>

370
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 3>crazy way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious the way people spend time</v>

371
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:10.941
<v Speaker 3>on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that some people are just </v>

372
00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:10.941
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

373
00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Make my pussy strong in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>incarnation.</v>

374
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doing it with.</v>

375
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it was amazing though?</v>

376
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 3>What if it made a huge difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

377
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

378
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 3>like grossly key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there's better worse.</v>

379
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:27.111
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it's a funny thing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you came out of a spaceship on some </v>

380
00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 3>alien planet and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

381
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:33.381
<v Speaker 3>while I'm on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make it so my badge final </v>

382
00:18:33.381 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 3>muscles are fucking strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

383
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 3>if you enjoy sex though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you enjoy pleasure.</v>

384
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Can we tell them it is possible that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can make the,</v>

385
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 3>the vaginal muscles strong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can then.</v>

386
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 3>But why wouldn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do that if I was a chick.</v>

387
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you want to a Super Pussy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Pills?</v>

388
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.440
<v Speaker 3>You do those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:56.450
<v Speaker 3>we all deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not leveling judgment on these </v>

390
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 3>wonderful women who are making their </v>
<v Speaker 3>vaginas strong and I encourage it.</v>

391
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I think you should do it if you're drawn</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards that.</v>

392
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's a curious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way people spend their time.</v>

393
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly of the ways people </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend their time.</v>

394
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 3>That is a fascinating way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also fascinating the idea of like,</v>

395
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:16.731
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Viagra or something along those </v>

396
00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a pill that makes your dick hard.</v>

397
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.580
<v Speaker 3>And what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if there was a wooded flood was </v>

398
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 3>like exercise you could do that could </v>
<v Speaker 3>make your dick bigger and harder.</v>

399
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.640
<v Speaker 3>You like you could grow your dick the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way a dude grows his chest muscles.</v>

400
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just steady workout gyms would be </v>

401
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:37.880
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the video I posted about the</v>

402
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Indian guy that wraps his cock up in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick and stretches it out?</v>

<v Speaker 3>stream because you don't really see it </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

417
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.930

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you do like the Dick Pills and</v>
<v Speaker 3>use the Zma like I've been doing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Create.</v>

431
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 3>If I was going to do a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get the real chemical.</v>

432
00:20:56.141 --> 00:20:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

433
00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.160
<v Speaker 3>you're taking a crazy gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What these fucking 7:11</v>

434
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

436
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten to the point where like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized 7:11</v>

437
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.440
<v Speaker 3>takes the safe route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like their products are little bit </v>

438
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.350
<v Speaker 3>weaker and not say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you go to some of these like </v>

439
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.350
<v Speaker 3>miscellaneous gas stations that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give a shit.</v>

440
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 3>There's these things called like ml two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like good for two weeks and you're like,</v>

441
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:19.670
<v Speaker 3>how is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then take it and like,</v>

442
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cover.</v>

443
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a skull in a boob or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

444
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.030
<v Speaker 3>The way they're getting away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Aubrey told us was that they're </v>

445
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 3>taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking,</v>

446
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.500
<v Speaker 3>they're taking giant amounts of generic </v>
<v Speaker 3>cialis and generic Viagra and those </v>

447
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:40.261
<v Speaker 3>chemicals are not that expensive and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get those chemicals and if you sell </v>

448
00:21:40.261 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 3>it in like little single serving forms </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a gas station,</v>

449
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 3>it's actually profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these crazy flux,</v>

450
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 3>they're just selling Viagara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

451
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's Cialis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Viagra.</v>

452
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I should go grab the one that's in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>car and just show you how ridiculous is </v>

453
00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also should really listen to what </v>

454
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Tim Ferriss said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

455
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I know Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a brilliant guy,</v>

456
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 3>has a great quote.</v>

457
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 3>And the quote is he doesn't believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a biological free lunch.</v>

458
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.490
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's doing hasn't has that </v>

459
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.431
<v Speaker 3>positive and impact in one direction </v>
<v Speaker 3>will have most likely and equal equally </v>

460
00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:21.241
<v Speaker 3>positive reaction in another direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very possible that it could cause </v>

461
00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:25.501
<v Speaker 3>real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about something super </v>

462
00:22:25.501 --> 00:22:25.501
<v Speaker 3>potent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

463
00:22:25.501 --> 00:22:25.501
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

464
00:22:25.501 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a fascinating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one thing.</v>

465
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.640
<v Speaker 3>There's always a weird trade off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

466
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 3>what could it be that your Dick doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work without that stuff?</v>

467
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with Dick Pills,</v>

468
00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 3>it's better to burn out than to fade </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

469
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 3>Did you just went deaf?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leopard Leppard us.</v>

470
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

471
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you might have a good point.</v>

472
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 3>It depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

473
00:22:55.631 --> 00:23:00.631
<v Speaker 3>would you rather have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it every 10 years of life </v>

474
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:03.661
<v Speaker 3>left with boners or 30 years of life </v>
<v Speaker 3>with basically start you start off with </v>

475
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 3>three quarter Chubby this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only do it half a Chubby next year,</v>

476
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 3>but you'll know it shuts off and within </v>
<v Speaker 3>five or six years and then basically the</v>

477
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:18.250
<v Speaker 3>rest of your life you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

478
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.310
<v Speaker 3>walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only do it when I go to strip clubs </v>

479
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.710
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless I know that there's a guaranteed </v>

480
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 3>good lineup of sex that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

481

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

495
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:58.660
<v Speaker 4>it depends on what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

496
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 4>what would it go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way to go.</v>

497
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great way to go.</v>

498
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 4>But those pills you gave me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hot Rods,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like first time you see porn when you're</v>

501
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.170
<v Speaker 4>a terminal boaters criminal like insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hiroshima,</v>

502
00:24:18.171 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 4>boner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

503
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Also why it's sold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's sold,</v>

504
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 4>because it's soda for gay people to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>clubbing.</v>

505
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:30.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a straight guys going take </v>

506
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.891
<v Speaker 4>advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that Boehner in the and the and the </v>

507
00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:33.470
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

508
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It says on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I researched this stuff,</v>

509
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.530
<v Speaker 4>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this made me think that our breeze,</v>

510
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:44.750
<v Speaker 4>cialis theory was totally dead on </v>
<v Speaker 4>because on the website it says that the </v>

511
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 4>ingredient is crushed up and I know amp </v>
<v Speaker 4>owners,</v>

512
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 4>but that's something someone lying says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like saying anything.</v>

513
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Nobody fucking cares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have great boners.</v>

514
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:57.940
<v Speaker 4>Don't care when you could say</v>

515
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.880
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it saved.</v>

516
00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.420
<v Speaker 3>They're totally bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

517
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.700
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Odds bugs crushed up and give a fuck </v>

518
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.331
<v Speaker 3>what it is to make sure the questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to sell some illegal shit.</v>

519
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the food and drug </v>

520
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 3>administration ever shake loose a tablet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's on an ad in this bucket,</v>

521
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 3>do they shake loose tablets</v>

522
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 6>and then by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it might be possible that there's a </v>

523
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.981
<v Speaker 6>toxin in certain answers that could give</v>
<v Speaker 6>you a hard on because they know that </v>

524
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 6>spider has it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure does.</v>

525
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 6>That that spider in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the walking spider,</v>

526
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.340
<v Speaker 6>it apparently it just wanders around the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ground and if it stings you,</v>

527
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 6>it gives you the most in possibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>painful Boehner where you dick splits </v>

528
00:25:47.641 --> 00:25:49.380
<v Speaker 6>open like a ballpark frank.</v>

529
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>

530
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.040
<v Speaker 3>It's super good.</v>

531
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.170
<v Speaker 6>Do Bird toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

532
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.470
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't just give you this ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 6>boner it most.</v>

533
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.110
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time it kills people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if it doesn't kill you,</v>

534
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.810
<v Speaker 6>your Dick is done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your Dick's broken forever.</v>

535
00:26:04.811 --> 00:26:07.030
<v Speaker 6>Why do we allow that to exist?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That spider,</v>

536
00:26:07.031 --> 00:26:10.630
<v Speaker 6>it's a red lining.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dick bug it just red lines or dick.</v>

537
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like taking it</v>

538
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.360
<v Speaker 6>like engine deep into the fucking piston</v>
<v Speaker 6>starts smoking ganja.</v>

539
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why we allow that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Jesus Christ,</v>

540
00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:24.420
<v Speaker 6>that's a scary fucking animal insect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rather you dilute it down enough.</v>

541
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.490
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you mix it with enough stuff.</v>

542
00:26:26.491 --> 00:26:27.450
<v Speaker 6>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

543
00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 6>That's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

544
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:29.880
<v Speaker 6>that's what they're thinking now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Spider.</v>

545
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.120
<v Speaker 6>But they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to figure out a way to do</v>

546
00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:38.121
<v Speaker 6>it and apparently that's connected to </v>
<v Speaker 6>nitric oxide and nitric oxide.</v>

547
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.720
<v Speaker 6>I believe I'm saying it right is what is</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a lot those like not to explode,</v>

548
00:26:45.631 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 6>like all these different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>supplements.</v>

549
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:53.630
<v Speaker 6>He's like workout supplements and get </v>
<v Speaker 6>people pumped up because apparently </v>

550
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 6>Viagra,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cialis,</v>

551
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:55.770
<v Speaker 6>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

552
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.260
<v Speaker 6>their performance enhancing its far as </v>
<v Speaker 6>like your,</v>

553
00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:04.290
<v Speaker 6>your body's ability to pump blood like </v>
<v Speaker 6>through itself and makes you more </v>

554
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 6>efficient and it gives you an endurance </v>
<v Speaker 6>benefit.</v>

555
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 6>So I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

556
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.340
<v Speaker 6>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're making it.</v>

557
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's illegal in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he can't be on.</v>

558
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.930
<v Speaker 6>I know you can't be on that pro provigil</v>
<v Speaker 6>that provigil is illegal in the </v>

559
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.821
<v Speaker 6>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They test for that shit now and I </v>

560
00:27:22.821 --> 00:27:22.821
<v Speaker 6>believe they test for this as well.</v>

561
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that provigils pretty awesome too.</v>

562
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:25.720
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

563
00:27:25.721 --> 00:27:30.721
<v Speaker 4>I just found this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started looking up like my favorite </v>

564
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 4>authors to see if they were on speed </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I read and like the majority of </v>

565
00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:38.600
<v Speaker 4>my favorite authors are on speed and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that.</v>

566
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.450
<v Speaker 4>And that really got me thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

567
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:43.450
<v Speaker 4>that really got me thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like [inaudible] pro vigil,</v>

568
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 4>adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are modern speed.</v>

569
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.440
<v Speaker 4>It's speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And forgive me for saying this man,</v>

570
00:27:50.441 --> 00:27:55.120
<v Speaker 4>but my experience with speed and Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain outbrain is speed.</v>

571
00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Like you can call it an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it has like thought enhancing </v>

572
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.530
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's speed.</v>

573
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 4>When you take that drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel that</v>

574
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.580
<v Speaker 6>he feels like Alpha remix.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel speed.</v>

575
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 6>Low level adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

576
00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:13.430
<v Speaker 6>I've never done adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what Alpha brain does for me,</v>

577
00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:17.380
<v Speaker 6>it never makes me feel it's accelerated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We feel like smoother.</v>

578
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.170
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

579
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:21.820

<v Speaker 4>it gives me a mild speed</v>

580
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.750
<v Speaker 6>bump.</v>

582
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.530
<v Speaker 6>what do you do are you're doing the old </v>
<v Speaker 6>formula or the newer forming?</v>

583
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.570
<v Speaker 6>The new formula is more conservative </v>
<v Speaker 6>because some people were having </v>

584
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.570
<v Speaker 6>headaches.</v>

585
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.260
<v Speaker 4>It was the old formula.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what made me feel weird and it did </v>

586
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:36.260
<v Speaker 4>give me weird dreams.</v>

630
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The girth is what's really good about </v>

631
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.120

<v Speaker 3>You have like a shorter dick,</v>

633
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.760
<v Speaker 3>but it was just stretch out a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

634
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.180
<v Speaker 3>What's the hook also like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always put my boner like underneath</v>

635
00:30:41.181 --> 00:30:42.710
<v Speaker 3>my belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my whole life.</v>

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like facing my head,</v>

637

<v Speaker 3>The whole child.</v>

639
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I'll never have a boner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just put them behind my belt and then </v>

640
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.660
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I forget about it too long and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hurts.</v>

641
00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 3>So you like stretching your dick out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way those African ladies do with their </v>

642
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.810
<v Speaker 3>neck and the rings pointed towards your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own face.</v>

00:31:02.811 --> 00:31:05.620
<v Speaker 3>It makes it ben and grow towards your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own face thing.</v>

644

<v Speaker 3>Kirby as Dick's.</v>

646
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.030
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that would really do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was trauma.</v>

647
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.950
<v Speaker 3>You can get a broken dick.</v>

<v Speaker 3>crazy girl trying to get,</v>

672
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:26.850
<v Speaker 3>talking to sleep with her.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

677
00:32:32.671 --> 00:32:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I get really fucking horny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

678
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.600
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

679
00:32:36.601 --> 00:32:38.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's two,</v>

680
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

681
00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I tend to</v>

682
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 4>have a girlfriend and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm monogamous,</v>

683
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.060
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

684
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when that's not happening,</v>

685
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 4>then generally there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I get,</v>

686
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 4>I really get up in my head about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think about,</v>

687
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.720
<v Speaker 4>I overthink it like I'm way in my head </v>
<v Speaker 4>about everything.</v>

688
00:32:56.721 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in my head most of the time and,</v>

689
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 4>and when you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's good things about living in your</v>

690
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 4>head and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes to fucking and jumping</v>

691
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:10.511
<v Speaker 4>into this primal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>animalistic state that creates the best </v>

692
00:33:10.511 --> 00:33:12.070
<v Speaker 4>sexual experience where you just let go </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

693
00:33:12.071 --> 00:33:13.310
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

694
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.360
<v Speaker 4>it's more difficult to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially out on the fucking road </v>

695
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

696
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I consider the lead up to it and I </v>

<v Speaker 4>ultimate,</v>

699
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 4>because with porn you jerk off to porn </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's it.</v>

700
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.890
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to like walk porn to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that you've looked at is not going to </v>

703

<v Speaker 4>call you up and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking pregnant.</v>

704
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:48.850
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just done and so you just get this </v>

705
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:49.040
<v Speaker 4>middle thing when you watch porn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see the beginning,</v>

706
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.100
<v Speaker 4>you don't see what happens right before </v>
<v Speaker 4>the porn shoot or God forbid,</v>

707
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:53.020
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

708
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

709
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:58.991
<v Speaker 4>the girl like walking in on her dad </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking a dog or something or getting </v>

710
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 4>fingered by her uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just see this incredible,</v>

711
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 4>beautiful primal moment of fucking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see afterwards,</v>

712
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 4>after the porn shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

713
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 4>That weird moment in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>driving back from a porn shoot,</v>

714
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wipe a little jazz out of your hair,</v>

715
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't use that whole thing.</v>

716
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 4>You just get that one burst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

717
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:20.840
<v Speaker 4>So on the road it's like fucking on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

718
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:25.430
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there's a lot of pitfalls </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and a lot of weird dangers.</v>

719
00:34:25.431 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot more than just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

720
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:30.110
<v Speaker 4>what a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be in his seventies movie,</v>

721
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.670
<v Speaker 4>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think too much.</v>

722
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.190
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think clearly overthinking it.</v>

723
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Satanists are all about doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

724
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who was a satanist and he</v>

725
00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 4>said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

726
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.280
<v Speaker 4>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I remember it was really,</v>

727
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.420
<v Speaker 4>it's really rough when it Satan says </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that seems like absolutely </v>

728
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.560
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's like,</v>

729
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is coming from a guy with lucifer </v>

730
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 4>tattooed on his chest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he said,</v>

731
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in life he said,</v>

732
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:04.211
<v Speaker 4>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell is not someplace where you burn </v>

733
00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:06.860
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell is that moment that you're dying.</v>

734
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 4>That moment when you're at your death </v>
<v Speaker 4>bed or you're in the car,</v>

735
00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:11.930
<v Speaker 4>you're sitting at the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck you are,</v>

736
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.830
<v Speaker 4>you're dying and your mind goes back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks about all those opportunities you</v>

737
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:22.961
<v Speaker 4>had to experience life to the fullest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those chances you had to dive into </v>

738
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 4>life and suck the marrow out of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you did not have fear.</v>

739
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:32.080
<v Speaker 4>That's hell now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was coming from no hills way worse </v>

740
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.740
<v Speaker 4>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can just jerk off and ticketing</v>

741
00:35:34.741 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 4>them if that's what your life is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not that bad.</v>

742
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:43.430
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean pink?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disappointed in life is not as bad as </v>

743
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.430
<v Speaker 3>being tortured by Mongols.</v>

744
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was saying how he doesn't </v>

745
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 4>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

746
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 4>the whole Christian idea now is </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>

747
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.620
<v Speaker 4>That the only real house since there is </v>
<v Speaker 4>no how.</v>

748
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was obviously if there was a </v>

749
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.961
<v Speaker 4>real Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are demons fly down and put their </v>

750
00:35:57.961 --> 00:35:57.961
<v Speaker 4>balls in your mouth and like slice you </v>
<v Speaker 4>into bits every five years.</v>

751
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you be surprised if there </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually was a.</v>

752
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.880
<v Speaker 3>How fucked up would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was a hell of hell was real.</v>

753
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about how fucking stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would feel if you were actually like</v>

754
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.310
<v Speaker 3>being confronted by demons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were flipping your eternal soul.</v>

755
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.990
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

756
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>

757
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.890
<v Speaker 4>They warned me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

758
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

759
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 3>If you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how crazy would it be if you got down </v>

760
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 3>there and there was a devil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dude.</v>

761
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.780
<v Speaker 3>He's got goat horns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

762
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

763
00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:33.550
<v Speaker 3>they just start ripping you apart piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>by piece over and over again,</v>

764
00:36:33.551 --> 00:36:35.680
<v Speaker 3>and they put you back together again for</v>
<v Speaker 3>eternity.</v>

765
00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

766
00:36:36.221 --> 00:36:37.990
<v Speaker 4>this is the funny thing about hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

767
00:36:37.991 --> 00:36:40.900
<v Speaker 4>when you want to really get into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell talk or the hell trip.</v>

768
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 4>I know people who've had held trips </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've ever,</v>

769
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.530
<v Speaker 4>you've probably never had the hell </v>
<v Speaker 4>trick,</v>

770
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.750
<v Speaker 4>the bad trips and felt like they were in</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>

771
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:48.690
<v Speaker 4>Where are you start thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

772
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because look,</v>

773
00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.420
<v Speaker 4>when you were talking about how we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about a torture chamber created </v>

774
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.620
<v Speaker 4>by the general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously I did not believe this,</v>

775
00:36:56.621 --> 00:37:01.621
<v Speaker 4>but if we're talking about how it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>torture chamber created by the creator </v>

776
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:05.761
<v Speaker 4>of the known universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it is the most advanced torture </v>

777
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:08.461
<v Speaker 4>chamber that could possibly exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's created by the most advanced being </v>

778
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:12.690
<v Speaker 4>psychotic in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the most advanced being so when our </v>

779
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 4>real torture chamber the year means of </v>
<v Speaker 4>torture,</v>

780
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:19.090
<v Speaker 4>not going to be so obvious is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>burning fire and it burns your skin.</v>

781
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:24.390
<v Speaker 4>The first thing you'd want people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think is that they're not in a torture </v>

782
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.661
<v Speaker 4>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd want them to think that there's </v>

783
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:28.960
<v Speaker 4>some hope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some hope for peace as long as they were</v>

784
00:37:28.961 --> 00:37:33.961
<v Speaker 4>hoping for peace and thinking that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to be some moment of </v>

785
00:37:33.961 --> 00:37:37.321
<v Speaker 4>tranquility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would like increase their levels of </v>

786
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:37.630
<v Speaker 4>disappointment to the maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the health trip.</v>

787
00:37:37.631 --> 00:37:39.250
<v Speaker 4>The trip is where you start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

788
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.720
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>

789
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.360
<v Speaker 4>This is how we've been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

790
00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:48.361
<v Speaker 4>this is the ultimate torture device </v>
<v Speaker 4>device by some maniacal insane God that </v>

791
00:37:49.691 --> 00:37:53.710
<v Speaker 4>everyone's popped into and instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like remembering where they're at,</v>

792
00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.820
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

793
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:59.821
<v Speaker 4>this is totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And gotta go through traffic in the </v>

794
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:01.210
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to go through three hour commute.</v>

795
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.520
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you don't even know you're </v>

796
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:06.520
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know you're there.</v>

797
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe slowly you start with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that by the way,</v>

798
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.300
<v Speaker 4>the opposite works too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

799
00:38:10.301 --> 00:38:13.180
<v Speaker 4>you can also think that this is heaven </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're just too dumb to see it.</v>

800
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.500
<v Speaker 4>You get to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

801
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:18.490
<v Speaker 4>you can pick where those two a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>mythological constructs</v>

802
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:24.100
<v Speaker 3>just abandoned those ideas and just deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the present because it's the only </v>

803
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.110
<v Speaker 3>thing you really know and we do know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you live in hell,</v>

804
00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.450
<v Speaker 3>when we use that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that guy lives in hell.</v>

805
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a series of shitty choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad circumstance,</v>

806
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 3>bad luck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>combination</v>

807
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 6>of all of the above.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

808
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most,</v>

809

820
00:39:10.091 --> 00:39:15.091

<v Speaker 6>are forced to wear a crazy fucking </v>

821

<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

823
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 6>work conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to wear a suit and tie.</v>

824
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 6>You have to fucking be very formal </v>
<v Speaker 6>around the office.</v>

825
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 6>Nobody can fuck around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody can relax all day.</v>

826
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 6>Most of your day is just buttoned up in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>locked down.</v>

827
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

828
00:39:28.851 --> 00:39:33.851
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's definitely one version of when </v>

829
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:33.851
<v Speaker 4>you hear people say that they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it's uh,</v>

830
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:34.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still,</v>

831
00:39:34.491 --> 00:39:36.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this idea,</v>

832
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Krishna Murti ever heard of Krishna </v>

833
00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Murti?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

834
00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Jay Krishna Murti,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's this philosopher,</v>

835
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 4>the Indian philosopher who is like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid who was discovered by the </v>

836
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.000
<v Speaker 4>theosophists and theosophy were this </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange spiritual group and I don't know</v>

837
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:55.001
<v Speaker 4>a lot about them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have madam blood tasky and was </v>

838
00:39:55.001 --> 00:39:56.570
<v Speaker 4>the woman's name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they spotted this Indian kid,</v>

839
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beach and one of them was like,</v>

840
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 4>his aura is amazing or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they sort of took this kid in and </v>

841
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.401
<v Speaker 4>groom this child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any eventually became this brilliant </v>

842
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.130
<v Speaker 4>philosopher and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as part of his,</v>

843
00:40:10.131 --> 00:40:12.680
<v Speaker 4>like evolution turned his back on </v>
<v Speaker 4>theosophy and said,</v>

844
00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:14.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

845
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:19.270
<v Speaker 4>it's more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got really into the idea of being in </v>

846
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.270
<v Speaker 4>the moment.</v>

847
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.270
<v Speaker 4>And I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted my podcast.</v>

848
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.951
<v Speaker 4>I put a awesome sound clip of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about how the past you carry the</v>

849
00:40:24.771 --> 00:40:27.320
<v Speaker 4>past with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The past is in you right now.</v>

850
00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:29.210
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no past.</v>

851
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.720
<v Speaker 4>There's just your encoded memories of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that have happened.</v>

852
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:36.680
<v Speaker 4>And the future is something you create </v>
<v Speaker 4>through everything that you do.</v>

853
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.760
<v Speaker 4>But there's no future either in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're this packet,</v>

854
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.800
<v Speaker 4>like a d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the DNA packet,</v>

855
00:40:42.801 --> 00:40:47.420
<v Speaker 4>the way their DNA for sort of spawns a </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific type of cell.</v>

856
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:52.750
<v Speaker 4>What you do with what you carry around </v>
<v Speaker 4>with you in every single moment spawns </v>

857
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.570
<v Speaker 4>your reality around you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why people who you know,</v>

858
00:40:56.571 --> 00:40:57.770
<v Speaker 4>you always will run into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are like,</v>

859
00:40:57.771 --> 00:40:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why this always happens to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

860
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I always get dumped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand it.</v>

861
00:41:01.911 --> 00:41:06.320
<v Speaker 4>I always get dumped or I always end up </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this predicament or that predicament,</v>

862
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:11.321
<v Speaker 4>or the reason is you're like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>caterpillar or a silkworm and you're </v>

863
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:14.430
<v Speaker 4>spinning your reality with every action </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you do because that's all there is.</v>

864
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:15.860
<v Speaker 4>It's just this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know this moment.</v>

865
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.440
<v Speaker 4>So you end up with a shit boss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

866
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.290
<v Speaker 4>and you've ended up there just because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been diluted by that,</v>

867
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 4>by your perception of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that's the fucking trick </v>

868
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 4>because people listening to this habit </v>
<v Speaker 4>shitbox shit,</v>

869
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.480
<v Speaker 4>white shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend,</v>

870
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>husband,</v>

871
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:31.220
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

872
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.270
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

873
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this sound clip J.</v>

874
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Krishna Murti says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that you can do is right </v>

875
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.671
<v Speaker 4>now at this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a radical psychological change in </v>

876
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:45.920
<v Speaker 4>your apprehension of the universe at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this moment,</v>

877
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:51.340
<v Speaker 4>at this moment where the ship boss with </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it takes this radical like you </v>

878
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:56.321
<v Speaker 4>have to break free of everything you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been taught because we've all been </v>

879
00:41:56.321 --> 00:42:00.071
<v Speaker 4>taught to think that there's a future </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we've all been taught to think </v>

880
00:42:00.071 --> 00:42:00.071
<v Speaker 4>there's a past.</v>

881
00:42:00.071 --> 00:42:04.300
<v Speaker 6>There's also an issue that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This narrative has been sort of spelled </v>

882
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 6>out for us by our parents and then as we</v>
<v Speaker 6>get old enough,</v>

883
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.010
<v Speaker 6>when we get into our twenties or </v>
<v Speaker 6>thirties,</v>

884
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 6>we really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were like,</v>

885
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 6>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were just clueless.</v>

886
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:18.461
<v Speaker 6>Folks just like we are like the idea </v>
<v Speaker 6>that anybody had a handle on how to do </v>

887
00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

888
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 6>and then you just look at the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people,</v>

889
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:28.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean your parents and my parents are </v>
<v Speaker 6>from a generation where they got into </v>

890
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 6>our age before there was an internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're,</v>

891
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.840
<v Speaker 6>they're literally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're different human beings.</v>

892
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.900
<v Speaker 6>It's a completely different style of </v>
<v Speaker 6>human being to human being one where </v>

893
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:45.890
<v Speaker 6>human being to human being three that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are being born right now,</v>

894
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:51.180
<v Speaker 6>you know that will only know insane </v>
<v Speaker 6>levels of technological proficiency from</v>

895
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:56.300
<v Speaker 6>the time that they're aware when they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>three or four till till they're dead,</v>

896
00:42:56.301 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 6>when it's insane.</v>

897
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These are.</v>

898
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:04.121
<v Speaker 6>This is the strangest times of all and </v>
<v Speaker 6>no one knows how to run it now.</v>

899
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.580
<v Speaker 6>No one knows how to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one knows.</v>

900
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:13.060
<v Speaker 6>The more information keeps coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the weirder things start getting the </v>

901
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.740
<v Speaker 6>fucking meteors landing in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that no one even saw those </v>

902
00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.461
<v Speaker 6>coming and that there was a giant </v>
<v Speaker 6>asteroid that whipped overhead within a </v>

903
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 6>day of that he asked and it was inside </v>
<v Speaker 6>the outer band of satellites.</v>

904
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 6>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a whole lot of weirdness to this</v>

905
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:33.400
<v Speaker 6>world that we live in that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 6>not taking into consideration</v>

906
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.220
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All.</v>

907
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well fuck yeah man.</v>

908
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.410
<v Speaker 4>And it all started me and generally with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people it all like that.</v>

909
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.730
<v Speaker 4>That thing where we like just don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about them as a species.</v>

910
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:49.210
<v Speaker 4>We are living in the same way a modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual lives as species as a whole </v>

911
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.460
<v Speaker 4>is living in a state of delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The species as a whole is pretending </v>

912
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.860
<v Speaker 4>that the most important thing is solving</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever little religious war or a </v>

913
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:06.370
<v Speaker 4>territory based war or economic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that's the most important </v>

914
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:11.021
<v Speaker 4>thing in the way we're living as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>species is all based on the notion of </v>

915
00:44:11.021 --> 00:44:13.700
<v Speaker 4>there being a of the individual instead </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the totality of the race.</v>

916
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this way of living is one of denial,</v>

917
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 4>so the human race right now exists on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet where we blow each other up every</v>

918
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 4>single day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight these ridiculous wars,</v>

919
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.590
<v Speaker 4>fight against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and completely ignore the fact that we </v>

920
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 4>are floating in the void and this on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>regs,</v>

921
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 4>on the regs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get smashed by fucking media whores.</v>

922
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck would we not be doing the </v>

923
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:42.260
<v Speaker 4>obvious thing which would be in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation?</v>

924
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 4>If the first thing you would do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out,</v>

925
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:50.121
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's come up with a foolproof way to </v>

926
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:50.121
<v Speaker 4>control media yours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'll then we'll fight.</v>

927
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:50.121
<v Speaker 4>They don't fight it,</v>

928
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.550
<v Speaker 6>b one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and not only that,</v>

929
00:44:52.551 --> 00:44:54.530
<v Speaker 6>a lot of these asteroids that they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>picking up,</v>

930
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.590
<v Speaker 6>they're coming in from amateur amateur </v>
<v Speaker 6>astronomers,</v>

931
00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:59.060
<v Speaker 6>like a good percentage of them.</v>

932
00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

933
00:45:00.291 --> 00:45:02.990
<v Speaker 4>but that's not that many professionals </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching the sky.</v>

934
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is the whole thing.</v>

935
00:45:04.281 --> 00:45:08.270
<v Speaker 4>Or they say like one month know we </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped one month of war in Afghanistan.</v>

936
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that that number,</v>

937
00:45:10.911 --> 00:45:15.911
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you stop the war for one month in </v>

938
00:45:15.911 --> 00:45:17.771
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could pay for everybody in the </v>

939
00:45:17.771 --> 00:45:19.610
<v Speaker 4>United States to go to college for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some kind of crazy number.</v>

940
00:45:19.611 --> 00:45:21.350
<v Speaker 4>Now that number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be two months.</v>

941
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 4>So in the same way if you consider that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

942
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:29.091
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't saying it as a species are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>priorities are a little weird and as an </v>

943
00:45:29.091 --> 00:45:31.790
<v Speaker 4>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know people in the same way.</v>

944
00:45:31.791 --> 00:45:36.791
<v Speaker 4>They spend most of their time ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that there is a subjective </v>

945
00:45:36.791 --> 00:45:39.320
<v Speaker 4>media or that's going guaranteed going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to smash into your life at some point,</v>

946
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.370
<v Speaker 4>which is old age disease and death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way around it,</v>

947
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.700
<v Speaker 4>so people spend their time ignoring that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact as well.</v>

948
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:48.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

949
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.840
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

950
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.420
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it so fucking intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot easier to worry about your </v>

951
00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.380
<v Speaker 4>own personal problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The little things,</v>

952
00:45:57.381 --> 00:45:57.740
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

953
00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to,</v>

954
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.590
<v Speaker 6>I want to find this military budget cut </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

955
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 6>If that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>done one month of the military budget.</v>

956
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:08.130
<v Speaker 6>If you cut it out,</v>

957
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:14.530
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out what the yearly military budget</v>

958
00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:15.700
<v Speaker 4>is and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

959
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is this,</v>

960
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.680
<v Speaker 4>this is the fucking thing that Neil </v>
<v Speaker 4>degrasse tyson posts,</v>

961
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 4>which is like the picture of the media </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever and this is why we need to </v>

962
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

963
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:26.620
<v Speaker 4>so I need to work on the space program.</v>

964
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:27.380
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can we.</v>

965
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:30.140
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that schools should be free.</v>

966
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.280
<v Speaker 6>I think we should be paying for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for whatever it is,</v>

967
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:35.900
<v Speaker 6>college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>high school,</v>

968
00:46:35.901 --> 00:46:36.790
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I,</v>

969
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.800
<v Speaker 6>I think school should be free always.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it should be free and it should </v>

970
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.730
<v Speaker 6>be encouraged and we should pay for it </v>
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

971
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:45.110
<v Speaker 6>with our taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

972
00:46:45.111 --> 00:46:50.111
<v Speaker 6>I would rather pay for fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a really high level school that </v>

973
00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:51.470
<v Speaker 6>kids could go to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even if there are poor,</v>

974
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:56.770
<v Speaker 6>I would way rather pay for that then pay</v>
<v Speaker 6>for more military bullshit.</v>

975
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.760
<v Speaker 6>More drones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drones above.</v>

976
00:46:58.761 --> 00:47:01.180
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could do that,</v>

977
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:01.700
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

978
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 6>that could be something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 6>done.</v>

979
00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the thing,</v>

980
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:10.061
<v Speaker 4>but that it can't be done as long as </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're confused as a species into </v>

981
00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:10.940
<v Speaker 4>thinking that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

982
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:16.430
<v Speaker 4>religions that are more important than </v>
<v Speaker 4>religions are countries that are more </v>

983
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.271
<v Speaker 4>important than other countries or people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are more important than other </v>

984
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:19.460
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as we're stuck in that modality,</v>

985
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.640
<v Speaker 4>well then we're never going to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up to the fact that we have to </v>

986
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:24.640
<v Speaker 4>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

987
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 4>and it's saying the staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

988
00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:28.490

<v Speaker 4>Goddamn a John Lennon song,</v>

989
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's fucking hit them motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

990
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 4>I have a John Lennon is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was banging Yoko Ono.</v>

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 1>the microphone like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Bird does this bid on it.</v>

996
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.860

<v Speaker 1>you have to see it on youtube.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr,</v>

998
00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.230

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hole.</v>

1000
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.090
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1001
00:48:02.091 --> 00:48:06.260
<v Speaker 4>but back then wasn't Asians more rare?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was almost like dating,</v>

1002
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.760
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because like all the war and </v>

1003
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.260
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that weren't easy to find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a dangling.</v>

1004
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were in Florida,</v>

1005
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not that important that a person's </v>
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

1006
00:48:18.321 --> 00:48:20.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like who the fuck are they?</v>

1007
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1008
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that checks alone.</v>

1009
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was probably so in back.</v>

1010
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.440
<v Speaker 4>Probably like dating men hate.</v>

1011
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what he loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1012
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame them.</v>

1013
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that I disagree with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on.</v>

1014
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was brilliant.</v>

1015
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:40.350
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty brilliant man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody ever gets the </v>

1016
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:40.350
<v Speaker 1>whole package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1041
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:40.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partially Scottish and there's some </v>

1042
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 4>native American in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be so cool to like analyze all your</v>

1043
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:43.240
<v Speaker 4>particles and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

1044
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 4>Four percent of you came from the Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 4>Centauri star cluster and the other two,</v>

1045
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:53.580
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To be super cool to know like just the </v>

1046
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.230
<v Speaker 4>various star particulates that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are comprised of the incredible</v>

1047
00:49:55.231 --> 00:49:56.820
<v Speaker 4>or animals like seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven years</v>

1048
00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.860
<v Speaker 1>percent cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard this and I'm not sure if it's </v>

1049
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a disclaimer before,</v>

1050
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:05.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I talk about it,</v>

1051
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:09.490
<v Speaker 1>but they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

1052
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember this now of trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1053
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 1>it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too weird.</v>

1054
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1055
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll get back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get back to it.</v>

1056
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember how it goes.</v>

1057
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck this up.</v>

1058
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look it up and make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I get it right.</v>

1059
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Speaker 1>What about that couldn't terantin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

1060
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>but before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were we just talking about?</v>

1061
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Just before that we're</v>

1062
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 6>talking about tracing your weird DNA </v>
<v Speaker 6>back and I don't know,</v>

1063
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:34.070
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember how he got there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it was.</v>

1064
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is the,</v>

1065
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Speaker 6>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if this is true,</v>

1066
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:43.600
<v Speaker 6>but they believe that within the next </v>
<v Speaker 6>100 years they will have a computer that</v>

1067
00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:49.811
<v Speaker 6>is powerful enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ready for this to take into account </v>

1068
00:50:49.811 --> 00:50:54.130
<v Speaker 6>everything that exists today and use it </v>
<v Speaker 6>in a numerical equation that will show </v>

1069
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.440
<v Speaker 6>everything that ever existed in every </v>
<v Speaker 6>action and interaction that ever took </v>

1070
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:06.590
<v Speaker 6>place in the past in order to get to </v>
<v Speaker 6>that position.</v>

1071
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.840
<v Speaker 6>So they'll basically look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>buildings,</v>

1072
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:14.080
<v Speaker 6>they'll look at all the people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll look at literally every </v>

1073
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.271
<v Speaker 6>component on earth and that computers </v>
<v Speaker 6>will be so powerful that from seeing </v>

1074
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 6>what exists now and knowing the amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>of time the earth has existed,</v>

1075
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:26.890
<v Speaker 6>the computer will be able to paint you </v>
<v Speaker 6>and incredibly accurate samuel absolute </v>

1076
00:51:27.591 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 6>simulation of every single action in its</v>
<v Speaker 6>form,</v>

1077
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:36.821
<v Speaker 6>including whatever words you said to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>girlfriend when you were pissed about </v>

1078
00:51:36.821 --> 00:51:36.821
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1079
00:51:36.821 --> 00:51:41.620
<v Speaker 6>It's all just one gigantic equation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time you hit your horn at a red </v>

1080
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 6>light,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every time you said,</v>

1081
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:46.250
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when highway to hell came on.</v>

1082
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:52.180
<v Speaker 6>All those things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can literally know everything that </v>

1083
00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.160
<v Speaker 6>happened based on everything that </v>
<v Speaker 6>exists.</v>

1084
00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:55.850
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is that.</v>

1085
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1086
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 6>Why you say it doesn't seem possible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't.</v>

1087
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:04.241
<v Speaker 6>Fart theory comes into effect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do we know if you've heard it or </v>

1088
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:04.241
<v Speaker 6>not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will the but this is the idea,</v>

1089
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:05.270
<v Speaker 6>but you're not really totally paying </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>

1090
00:52:05.271 --> 00:52:06.970
<v Speaker 6>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was just kidding you.</v>

1091
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.970
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that when you can have.</v>

1092
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.530
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's these things that they're,</v>

1093
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.160
<v Speaker 6>they're coming up with and they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1094
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:20.210
<v Speaker 6>they're almost like the size of a large </v>
<v Speaker 6>grain of sand or like smaller than a </v>

1095
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 6>grain of rice and they can take </v>
<v Speaker 6>photographs,</v>

1096
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:26.060
<v Speaker 6>video,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can send images,</v>

1097
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:27.480
<v Speaker 6>Wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wireless,</v>

1098
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:27.950
<v Speaker 6>Lee.</v>

1099
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 6>They can also have a gps locator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tells you exactly where they are.</v>

1100
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.500
<v Speaker 6>So essentially you can have a data bank </v>
<v Speaker 6>of cameras with dust.</v>

1101
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 6>You can spray dust over a city.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1102
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.420
<v Speaker 6>These little powder things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd be everywhere.</v>

1103
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:46.421
<v Speaker 6>You never cleaned them all up and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>would essentially have a rough picture </v>

1104
00:52:46.421 --> 00:52:47.990
<v Speaker 6>of everything that's going on all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

1105
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Once you got to that point,</v>

1106
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:55.040
<v Speaker 6>you could get an accurate account of </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything that exists on the earth.</v>

1107
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.580
<v Speaker 6>All the water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the.</v>

1108
00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.900
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not outside the realm of </v>

1109
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:01.900
<v Speaker 6>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we can measure right now in our crude</v>

1110
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 6>technological way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're 200 years ago,</v>

1111
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:05.750
<v Speaker 6>we were riding animals and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have cars.</v>

1112
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.670
<v Speaker 6>You couldn't take pictures within 200 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

1113
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:10.640
<v Speaker 6>We could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can tell you how many acres something</v>

1114
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:11.780
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can tell you.</v>

1115
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:16.790
<v Speaker 6>We can do a radio frequency tasks or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck they do to find out </v>

1116
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:19.160
<v Speaker 6>what's in the ground with the is made </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of.</v>

1117
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.240
<v Speaker 6>We can get a pretty rough account of </v>
<v Speaker 6>what we've got around us.</v>

1118
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:28.450
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they can get to a point where they </v>

1119
00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.020
<v Speaker 6>can literally tell you everything that </v>
<v Speaker 6>exists and have it calculated everything</v>

1120
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:36.711
<v Speaker 6>that exists in this form on earth right </v>
<v Speaker 6>now and know how long and know what we </v>

1121
00:53:36.711 --> 00:53:39.600
<v Speaker 6>know about human history and put it all </v>
<v Speaker 6>into account and be able to actually see</v>

1122
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:42.090
<v Speaker 6>a recreation of everything that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened.</v>

1123
00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:44.960
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing that the one little</v>
<v Speaker 4>piece you're missing here.</v>

1124
00:53:44.961 --> 00:53:49.961
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying this because I got super </v>

1125
00:53:49.961 --> 00:53:49.961
<v Speaker 4>stone and Vancouver and started thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about something like this,</v>

1126
00:53:49.961 --> 00:53:52.160
<v Speaker 4>but a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing you're missing.</v>

1127
00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what that is you just </v>

1128
00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.681
<v Speaker 4>described.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking time machine when you </v>

1129
00:53:59.681 --> 00:54:01.991
<v Speaker 4>add one more component to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a neurological interface that </v>

1130
00:54:01.991 --> 00:54:04.790
<v Speaker 4>instead of it's like you watching it </v>
<v Speaker 4>places you inside of the recreation,</v>

1131
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:09.970
<v Speaker 4>so now you're able to zoom backwards </v>
<v Speaker 4>through this like simulated past reality</v>

1132
00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:13.010
<v Speaker 4>based on like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well if this happened before this,</v>

1133
00:54:13.011 --> 00:54:18.011
<v Speaker 4>we can figure out what happened before </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and there would be a kind of rate </v>

1134
00:54:18.011 --> 00:54:20.210
<v Speaker 4>of entropy to based on like the further </v>
<v Speaker 4>back you got,</v>

1135
00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:24.530
<v Speaker 4>the less accurate your prediction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that happened would be.</v>

1136
00:54:24.531 --> 00:54:29.531
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you'd be able to </v>

1137
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:29.531
<v Speaker 4>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be able to do smell because</v>

1138
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:32.840
<v Speaker 4>there's no smell technology that know </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the kinds of smells like apple pie,</v>

1139
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.940
<v Speaker 4>like could simulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it could like actually kind of a </v>

1140
00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:37.940
<v Speaker 4>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what your theory is.</v>

1141
00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:37.940
<v Speaker 4>What was talking about?</v>

1142
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:43.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I'm basing it on though is events </v>

1143
00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:47.330
<v Speaker 6>and like things that have caused,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like why would you ever go to the big </v>

1144
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.781
<v Speaker 6>island you ever been to the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Big Island is actually the least </v>

1145
00:54:50.781 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 6>popular lated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's less populated than a Wahoo or,</v>

1146
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.440
<v Speaker 6>or a Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a big one,</v>

1147
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 6>half of a side of it is all lava fields.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all just like,</v>

1148
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:02.220
<v Speaker 6>you know that that fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>exploded like recently,</v>

1149
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:05.130
<v Speaker 6>like within the last who knows how many </v>
<v Speaker 6>hundred years,</v>

1150
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:10.131
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's lava rock all over the </v>

1151
00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:10.131
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you could,</v>

1152
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 6>you could accurately say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1153
00:55:12.451 --> 00:55:17.451
<v Speaker 6>well this law has been around for 150 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years and before that it was pastures </v>

1154
00:55:17.451 --> 00:55:17.451
<v Speaker 6>and they actually have photos of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1155
00:55:17.451 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 6>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could,</v>

1156
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 6>you could have hugged the locals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Describe what happened when in the 18,</v>

1157
00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:24.630
<v Speaker 6>20,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lava came over the top and cover the</v>

1158
00:55:24.631 --> 00:55:29.631
<v Speaker 6>town.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can get sort of a pretty decent </v>

1159
00:55:29.631 --> 00:55:31.401
<v Speaker 6>picture based on stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's outside of the realm </v>

1160
00:55:31.401 --> 00:55:33.990
<v Speaker 6>of possibility that they can get a </v>
<v Speaker 6>totally accurate picture of history.</v>

1161
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.520
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the other part.</v>

1162
00:55:35.521 --> 00:55:40.521
<v Speaker 4>I forgot this is another piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology that you need based on the </v>

1163
00:55:40.521 --> 00:55:42.630
<v Speaker 4>idea that you have this insanely </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced computer,</v>

1164
00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:43.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1165
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that they could count,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1166
00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing with the human genome</v>
<v Speaker 4>project.</v>

1167
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:52.731
<v Speaker 4>Somehow they finally pull that off with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human brain so that you can start </v>

1168
00:55:52.731 --> 00:55:55.290
<v Speaker 4>doing brain scans and gather people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>memories together.</v>

1169
00:55:55.530 --> 00:56:00.530
<v Speaker 4>That's the other piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then what you end up having is </v>

1170
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.201
<v Speaker 4>instead of just having these </v>
<v Speaker 4>particulates that scan the geographical </v>

1171
00:56:03.201 --> 00:56:08.090
<v Speaker 4>makeup of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you also have somehow the ability to </v>

1172
00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.910
<v Speaker 4>absorb the memories and the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual,</v>

1173
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 4>the memories of human beings.</v>

1174
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:18.950
<v Speaker 6>You imagine though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if somebody else had to go and access </v>

1175
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 6>your memories,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be like,</v>

1176
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:24.441
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck am I looking at it like </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like bolary legs and you know,</v>

1177
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 6>some girls bought where she shows it to </v>
<v Speaker 6>you and uh,</v>

1178
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:34.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a TV show that you barely can remember </v>

1179
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.710
<v Speaker 6>the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1180
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 6>how fucking accurate is your memory?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1181
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:39.130
<v Speaker 6>the idea of tapping into your memories </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then putting it on.</v>

1182
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.790
<v Speaker 6>You'd be watching like the most retarded</v>
<v Speaker 6>animated Gif file ever.</v>

1183
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:47.930
<v Speaker 6>That's what it would be really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be like a vine video,</v>

1184
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 6>but it'll be a little longer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be blurrier and blurrier.</v>

1185
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.430
<v Speaker 4>That's so true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1186
00:56:53.431 --> 00:56:56.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a funny thing you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like an existentialist idea.</v>

1187
00:56:56.641 --> 00:57:01.641
<v Speaker 4>That's an existential idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is this idea of like our actual </v>

1188
00:57:01.641 --> 00:57:05.181
<v Speaker 4>lives when you consider your pov or so </v>
<v Speaker 4>the opposite of movies and so the </v>

1189
00:57:05.611 --> 00:57:09.930
<v Speaker 4>opposite of the construct of like some </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning and some ending in some middle</v>

1190
00:57:09.931 --> 00:57:14.931
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is just this blur of like </v>

1191
00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:15.540
<v Speaker 4>coffee's going into mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn the radio,</v>

1192
00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:20.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a significant moments come </v>

1193
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:24.830
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like sort of decide the significant </v>

1194
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.471
<v Speaker 4>moments and that's what you were late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's far more moments of just </v>

1195
00:57:27.471 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 4>driving in between those significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments or walking or like that.</v>

1196
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a blur.</v>

1197
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Human existence is mostly just a blur.</v>

1198
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.930
<v Speaker 6>Memory is a blur.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Memories.</v>

1199
00:57:36.931 --> 00:57:41.931
<v Speaker 6>Very sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why people don't like Neil </v>

1200
00:57:41.931 --> 00:57:45.411
<v Speaker 6>degrasse Tyson gets out of jury duty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so as he doesn't trust eye witness </v>

1201
00:57:45.411 --> 00:57:45.411
<v Speaker 6>testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1202
00:57:45.411 --> 00:57:47.850
<v Speaker 6>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he's right,</v>

1203
00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.750
<v Speaker 6>it's been shown to be wrought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mean people have gone to jail because of</v>

1204
00:57:51.751 --> 00:57:54.990
<v Speaker 6>a false eye witness testimony with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who were testifying.</v>

1205
00:57:54.991 --> 00:57:56.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The people were testifying,</v>

1206
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.560
<v Speaker 6>were absolutely convinced that they were</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1207
00:57:58.561 --> 00:58:00.660
<v Speaker 6>but they were wrong and the wrong people</v>
<v Speaker 6>went to jail.</v>

1208
00:58:00.661 --> 00:58:02.300
<v Speaker 6>It's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sane happens.</v>

1209
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:07.460
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when you're under stressful </v>

1210
00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:07.620
<v Speaker 6>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what the fuck you're seeing,</v>

1211
00:58:07.621 --> 00:58:08.940
<v Speaker 6>what you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1212
00:58:08.941 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of these like bigfoot </v>
<v Speaker 6>sightings and you know,</v>

1213
00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 6>an animal wild animal sightings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet there's a lot,</v>

1214
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.840
<v Speaker 6>a lot to that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think when you're in a stressful </v>

1215
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:20.840
<v Speaker 6>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you something freaks you out with it's a</v>

1216
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:21.450
<v Speaker 6>bear or something.</v>

1217
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:26.450
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden that becomes bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know the mayor runs off and you're </v>

1218
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.450
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1219

<v Speaker 6>let's fucking bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1220
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:27.490
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God I was big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

1221
00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:30.270
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile it's midnight in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 6>Columbus,</v>

1222
00:58:30.271 --> 00:58:31.650
<v Speaker 6>Ohio Woods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

1223
00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:36.651
<v Speaker 6>You can't see shit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How the fuck do you know if it's </v>

1224
00:58:36.651 --> 00:58:36.651
<v Speaker 6>bigfoot?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yay.</v>

1225
00:58:36.651 --> 00:58:38.130
<v Speaker 6>Columbus Columbus weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying,</v>

1226
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:38.820
<v Speaker 6>Duncan?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1227
00:58:38.821 --> 00:58:40.070
<v Speaker 6>I do know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1228
00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.330
<v Speaker 6>Can't trust eye witness testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can try it.</v>

1229
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I got a hold of your memories and be </v>

1230
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pataki,</v>

1231
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:47.490
<v Speaker 6>what'd you do to that baby?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>

1232
00:58:47.491 --> 00:58:49.560
<v Speaker 6>no dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a doll I got.</v>

1233
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:52.650
<v Speaker 6>I got a video in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a baby</v>

1234
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:54.990
<v Speaker 4>be getting waterboarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would just be.</v>

1235
00:58:55.290 --> 00:59:00.290
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it just be murky and like </v>

1236
00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:03.180
<v Speaker 4>waterboarding only works on babies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>little esther.</v>

1237
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:08.240
<v Speaker 4>That would be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you water war babies and they start </v>

1238
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:08.240
<v Speaker 4>coughing up information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you everything.</v>

1239
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 4>They know different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like poopy carrots.</v>

1240
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Would would we be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would we support waterboarding if.</v>

1241
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:19.560
<v Speaker 4>If you could interrogate babies and find</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what happened before they were born,</v>

1242
00:59:19.561 --> 00:59:20.700
<v Speaker 4>I think it'd be worth a try.</v>

1243
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 6>We know Alex Jones believes</v>

1244
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.760
<v Speaker 4>at zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dark 30 was a government propaganda film</v>

1245
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:30.761
<v Speaker 4>supporting terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not how they got that </v>

1246
00:59:30.761 --> 00:59:32.060
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lie.</v>

1247
00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1248
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.960
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't torture babies for </v>

1249
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:40.960
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1250
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:40.960
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geneva Convention is going to allow that</v>

1251
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.971
<v Speaker 4>shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They even have a Geneva convention </v>

1252
00:59:44.971 --> 00:59:44.971
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a Geneva flea market now.</v>

1253
00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:47.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That didn't even convention.</v>

1254
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 4>That was against the Geneva Convention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a button that was like a big </v>

1255
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 4>thing in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1256
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:57.610
<v Speaker 4>So it was doing something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going against the Geneva </v>

1257
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Convention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>

1258
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:58.000
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a significant thing.</v>

1259
00:59:58.001 --> 01:00:03.001
<v Speaker 4>It's like the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's generally the criminal knows the </v>

1260
01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:03.001
<v Speaker 4>Geneva Convention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1261
01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:04.240
<v Speaker 4>you can't do this because of the Geneva </v>
<v Speaker 4>Convention.</v>

1262
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.290
<v Speaker 4>It gets left off the hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Geneva Convention.</v>

1263
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:11.020
<v Speaker 4>We need a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need a 2013.</v>

1264
01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.920
<v Speaker 4>We made it past the mayans convention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just get together and go,</v>

1265
01:00:14.921 --> 01:00:17.410
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's look at this.</v>

1266
01:00:17.411 --> 01:00:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Realistically when.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be great.</v>

1267
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.750
<v Speaker 4>When that bitch be fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I love fantasizing about,</v>

1268
01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:27.751
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love fucking thinking about that </v>

1269
01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:30.180
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing that finally happens when </v>

1270
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.730
<v Speaker 4>everything just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We finally turn away from these </v>

1271
01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.590
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1272
01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.700
<v Speaker 4>our addiction to leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1273
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:40.930
<v Speaker 4>And we turn away from our addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter and then God damn it,</v>

1274
01:00:40.931 --> 01:00:42.520
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be so fucking awesome.</v>

1275
01:00:42.521 --> 01:00:44.140
<v Speaker 4>We could really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could win.</v>

1276
01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.440
<v Speaker 4>I bet all of humanity just started </v>
<v Speaker 4>working on it right now.</v>

1277
01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Together we can whip up a spaceship that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would probably traveled.</v>

1278
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.060
<v Speaker 4>I thought we could have a light speed </v>
<v Speaker 4>traveling spaceship in 10 years.</v>

1279
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1280
01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:00.900
<v Speaker 6>one of the reasons why this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 6>resonates so much with people is the </v>

1281
01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:06.691
<v Speaker 6>conversations that we have sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>where this is not an alien way of </v>

1282
01:01:06.911 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 6>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>

1283
01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.390
<v Speaker 6>This is like a really smart way of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking.</v>

1284
01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:15.420
<v Speaker 6>It makes sense and it seems like it </v>
<v Speaker 6>would be beneficial to all including the</v>

1285
01:01:15.611 --> 01:01:18.130
<v Speaker 6>people that are in power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you hear that,</v>

1286
01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 6>if you hear someone saying something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

1287
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 6>you automatically assume that they're a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking little.</v>

1288
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1289
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not allowed to say these </v>

1290
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:29.130
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

1291
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:30.570
<v Speaker 4>there's just some basic truths though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you espouse,</v>

1292
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.500
<v Speaker 4>when you say them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people definitely get weirded out.</v>

1293
01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:37.501
<v Speaker 4>Like when you do say the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth is continence weren't named </v>

1294
01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:41.731
<v Speaker 4>that for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've already been named that for a </v>

1295
01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:42.040
<v Speaker 4>very short time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1296
01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:46.750
<v Speaker 4>North America was not North America 2000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1297
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.110
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

1298
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.920
<v Speaker 4>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you.</v>

1299
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:54.010
<v Speaker 4>So that's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number one is the names that we've </v>

1300
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:54.010
<v Speaker 4>given.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things are not the real names.</v>

1301
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.900
<v Speaker 4>Number two is when you say that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>this country,</v>

1302
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:59.510
<v Speaker 4>well it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1303
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.520
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think it's going to be this country </v>

1304
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.301
<v Speaker 4>and 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for a lot of people it doesn't </v>

1305
01:02:06.301 --> 01:02:06.301
<v Speaker 4>matter because it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1306
01:02:06.301 --> 01:02:07.900
<v Speaker 4>it gives them like a like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1307
01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking American bug off almond </v>
<v Speaker 4>butter.</v>

1308
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.500
<v Speaker 4>Second Amendment rights are always </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

1309
01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:16.810
<v Speaker 4>This is what America is about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always weird,</v>

1310
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:21.910
<v Speaker 6>but America is in a lot of ways about </v>
<v Speaker 6>those people because those people </v>

1311
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 6>represent a large chunk of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>population.</v>

1312
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 6>The people who want to keep the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people that you know,</v>

1313
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 6>like Nascar and that's what they like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As long as they're not criminals,</v>

1314
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 6>as long as they pay taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>America has to represent that and one of</v>

1315
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:39.261
<v Speaker 6>the ways you got to have some low level </v>
<v Speaker 6>of patriotism type thing going on with </v>

1316
01:02:39.261 --> 01:02:39.261
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

1317
01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:43.340
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's legit.</v>

1318
01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.930
<v Speaker 4>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets people pumped up.</v>

1319
01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.380
<v Speaker 4>They liked rooting for teams like </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1320
01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.440
<v Speaker 4>eight black people like tribal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those teams are always fucking up </v>

1321
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.030
<v Speaker 4>and went back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about there was a great team.</v>

1322
01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:01.210
<v Speaker 4>It was called the Christians and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>witches and there were incinerating </v>

1323
01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.440
<v Speaker 4>fucking witches and that was also part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of being an American at one time.</v>

1324
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1325
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:07.310
<v Speaker 4>burning the witches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing the Indians.</v>

1326
01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:12.460
<v Speaker 4>That's just like part of being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Catholic at one time was being an </v>

1327
01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:12.460
<v Speaker 4>inquisitor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1328
01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:17.231
<v Speaker 4>It's always weird that the team thing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest from a sentimental perspective </v>

1329
01:03:17.231 --> 01:03:17.450
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1330
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.400
<v Speaker 4>You want to be an American?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1331
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:20.810
<v Speaker 4>You want to love the country?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1332
01:03:20.811 --> 01:03:22.550
<v Speaker 4>I do love this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But guess what,</v>

1333
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.710
<v Speaker 4>I love fucking humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

1334
01:03:24.711 --> 01:03:29.711
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know the story behind what the </v>

1335
01:03:29.711 --> 01:03:30.320
<v Speaker 4>latest theory of the witch trials?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1336
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Or got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1337
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.130
<v Speaker 4>tripping balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

1339
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:39.470
<v Speaker 6>The latest theory involves a premature </v>
<v Speaker 6>for frost,</v>

1340
01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.390
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1341
01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.620
<v Speaker 6>they were growing wheat apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1342
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:45.770
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they have like a frost,</v>

1343
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:48.350
<v Speaker 6>when the plants freeze and then thaw </v>
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>

1344
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.100
<v Speaker 6>sometimes they get weird funguses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this one,</v>

1345
01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:57.160
<v Speaker 6>they did some soil samples and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>found that there was sometime around </v>

1346
01:03:58.431 --> 01:04:03.431
<v Speaker 6>that area around whether it was doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Salem witch trials was they had </v>

1347
01:04:03.431 --> 01:04:07.850
<v Speaker 6>early frost and they had the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they found evidence of this </v>

1348
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:08.540
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this or God stuff.</v>

1349
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:12.040
<v Speaker 6>It's very common though and on wheat and</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it.</v>

1350
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.080
<v Speaker 6>It's like acid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's basically very similar to </v>

1351
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.080
<v Speaker 6>take in house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's awesome.</v>

1352
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.930
<v Speaker 6>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well they bought.</v>

1353
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:20.570
<v Speaker 6>They're almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're almost positive.</v>

1354
01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:26.020
<v Speaker 6>That means scientifically it all lines </v>
<v Speaker 6>up because they know that it's happened </v>

1355
01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.411
<v Speaker 6>before that people have gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've gotten wheat that's been </v>

1356
01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:32.360
<v Speaker 6>poisoned by it and they've gotten sick </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they've had hallucinations.</v>

1357
01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:37.570
<v Speaker 6>So if you've got a whole country or a </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole city that's eating the wheat for </v>

1358
01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.110
<v Speaker 6>who knows how long that's filled with </v>
<v Speaker 6>God.</v>

1359
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:45.250
<v Speaker 6>But there's some speculation as to </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not it would be still </v>

1360
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.120
<v Speaker 6>psychoactive after you baked it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen people that disagree with it,</v>

1361
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.260
<v Speaker 6>but in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it.</v>

1362
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.750
<v Speaker 6>It seems to be a likely</v>

1363
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 4>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1364
01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:56.700
<v Speaker 4>there's also the thing where there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like an oppressive religious structure,</v>

1365
01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.850
<v Speaker 4>confusing people and are thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a devil.</v>

1366
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:05.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could just be a high level </v>

1367
01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:05.090
<v Speaker 4>percolation of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could just be let's burn,</v>

1368
01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:05.540
<v Speaker 4>which is let's take the ship to the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>level</v>

1369
01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:07.010
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1370
01:05:07.011 --> 01:05:09.050
<v Speaker 6>we got to blame it on something because </v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1371
01:05:09.051 --> 01:05:10.360
<v Speaker 6>you look at the stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1372
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.990
<v Speaker 6>people are getting burned as witches in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Africa right now and they're not.</v>

1373
01:05:13.991 --> 01:05:14.120
<v Speaker 6>There's</v>

1374
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.480
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no ergot.</v>

1375
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Usually there's just a bunch of Horny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry guys who want to fucking torch a </v>

1376
01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is,</v>

1377
01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like also,</v>

1378
01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:24.100
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

1379
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1380
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 4>it's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:27.940

<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

1383

<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1386
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:44.671
<v Speaker 4>It was like there was a religion that </v>
<v Speaker 4>existed before Catholicism came rolling </v>

1387
01:05:45.311 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 4>through planet earth and that religion </v>
<v Speaker 4>was what we call paganism.</v>

1388

<v Speaker 4>She's country dwellers is what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>

1408
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.870
<v Speaker 4>A Catholic saint.</v>

1409

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looper.</v>

1411
01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:51.160

<v Speaker 1>Cali.</v>

1412
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1414
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.930
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

1415
01:06:56.290 --> 01:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly pre Roman pastoral festival </v>

1416
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.800
<v Speaker 1>observed on February 13th through 15th </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avert evil spirits and purify the </v>

1417
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>city releasing health and fertility,</v>

1418
01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.040
<v Speaker 4>but read what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1419
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:13.610
<v Speaker 4>They whipped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like,</v>

1420
01:07:13.611 --> 01:07:15.960
<v Speaker 4>or they will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there was flogging involved in this</v>

1421
01:07:15.961 --> 01:07:19.950
<v Speaker 4>festival is very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what,</v>

1422
01:07:19.951 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1423
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:23.640
<v Speaker 4>that proceeded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the religion that proceeded,</v>

1424
01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1425
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.020
<v Speaker 4>the one that is the currently the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant religion and,</v>

1426
01:07:30.021 --> 01:07:32.340
<v Speaker 4>and that old religion didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

1427
01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.450
<v Speaker 4>they weren't just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1428
01:07:33.451 --> 01:07:35.520
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to worship the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Anymore.</v>

1429
01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.540
<v Speaker 4>It was that they were getting torched </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think it was based on eating</v>

1430
01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:42.000
<v Speaker 4>like fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was because the,</v>

1431
01:07:42.001 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1432
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.630
<v Speaker 4>it's to combating paradigms that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't.</v>

1433
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:48.380
<v Speaker 4>They don't work together at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1434
01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying either one isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily logical,</v>

1435
01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:55.200
<v Speaker 4>but one is more based on the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth works.</v>

1436
01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.440
<v Speaker 4>And the other one is based on the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>like old dudes try to control people.</v>

1437
01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.080
<v Speaker 4>That's where that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1438
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:05.250
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1439
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.040
<v Speaker 4>this whole fucking pope thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

1440
01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:13.070
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy and hilarious that we even </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay attention to what that clown is </v>

1441
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:14.430
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that even making the news?</v>

1442
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:19.431
<v Speaker 4>There's some weird fucking group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who do like the most bizarre </v>

1443
01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:21.570
<v Speaker 4>ceremonies who I mentioned sanctioned by</v>

1444
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:26.700
<v Speaker 6>governments in mass media.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one calls it a call to the guy's </v>

1445
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.720
<v Speaker 6>wearing a fucking wizard out with a fish</v>
<v Speaker 6>head hat.</v>

1446
01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:31.930
<v Speaker 6>It's if you try to do that today and </v>
<v Speaker 6>tried to say,</v>

1447
01:08:31.931 --> 01:08:34.600
<v Speaker 6>I am a daughter of God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has brought to me this information.</v>

1448
01:08:34.601 --> 01:08:37.720
<v Speaker 6>He tried to set up a shop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would think you were fucking loon,</v>

1449
01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.270
<v Speaker 6>but because of the fact that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 6>around for a long time,</v>

1450
01:08:40.271 --> 01:08:41.680
<v Speaker 6>this guy has a direct lineage.</v>

1451
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to take it serious where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's supposed to take it seriously and </v>

1452
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:47.850
<v Speaker 4>we're supposed to fucking ignore all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit Catholicism did.</v>

1453
01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:48.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about this shit</v>

1454
01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 6>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He released a priest that had molested </v>

1455
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.280
<v Speaker 6>200 deaf boys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>200.</v>

1456
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:57.330
<v Speaker 6>He let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

1457
01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:02.390
<v Speaker 6>He let them go into psychiatric.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instead of bringing in and getting them </v>

1458
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:06.711
<v Speaker 6>prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they brought them in for psychiatric </v>

1459
01:09:06.711 --> 01:09:08.661
<v Speaker 6>treatment and this guy went on to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They went to another parish and he </v>

1460
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:08.661
<v Speaker 6>molested more boys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1461
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:11.070
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did that time and time again.</v>

1462
01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 6>He took people away from being </v>
<v Speaker 6>prosecuted and sent them to psychiatric </v>

1463
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.200
<v Speaker 6>care and and they're free.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're free to go.</v>

1464
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.210
<v Speaker 6>They're free and they're walking around </v>
<v Speaker 6>the street.</v>

1465
01:09:19.211 --> 01:09:24.211
<v Speaker 6>Some of them are in these huge religious</v>
<v Speaker 6>retreat places that they have beautiful </v>

1466
01:09:24.211 --> 01:09:28.701
<v Speaker 6>grounds and these guys are just </v>
<v Speaker 6>wandering around taking care of for the </v>

1467
01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:28.701
<v Speaker 6>rest of their lives and the trauma.</v>

1468
01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Speaker 4>There's a place like that where I live </v>
<v Speaker 4>or.</v>

1472
01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:36.520
<v Speaker 4>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't pay fucking taxes.</v>

1473
01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 4>That is fucking okay.</v>

1474
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.010
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All that shit is crazy.</v>

1475
01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.480
<v Speaker 6>The idea that they should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>make golden buildings and not pay taxes.</v>

1476
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.370
<v Speaker 6>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you out of your fucking mind?</v>

1489
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:18.240
<v Speaker 6>money and we got to make sure that this </v>
<v Speaker 6>stops with our generation.</v>

1490
01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.670
<v Speaker 6>We got to make sure that future </v>
<v Speaker 6>generations don't.</v>

1491
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:24.780
<v Speaker 6>They don't have a gigantic religious </v>
<v Speaker 6>leader.</v>

1492
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:29.190
<v Speaker 6>Someone who tells them based on some </v>
<v Speaker 6>nutty shit that was written thousands of</v>

1493
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.860
<v Speaker 6>years ago by people drew on animal skin,</v>

1494
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.040
<v Speaker 4>but also it spreads that the way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks with [inaudible] is just one </v>

1495
01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.510
<v Speaker 4>version of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other problem is the guy who calls,</v>

1496
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 4>you know there's like an in the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a pope.</v>

1497
01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.740
<v Speaker 4>There's also a dude who calls himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>the president,</v>

1498
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.300
<v Speaker 4>but instead of representing some </v>
<v Speaker 4>phantasmo forest called God,</v>

1499
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I represent the will of the people.</v>

1500
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Yet he doesn't really represent the will</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the people.</v>

1501
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.450
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like that when he goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to when,</v>

1502
01:10:56.451 --> 01:11:01.451
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they do the polls and that as it </v>

1503
01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:01.451
<v Speaker 4>turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1504
01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:01.451
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not just the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1505
01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:06.191
<v Speaker 4>the government as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president doesn't have to tell </v>

1506
01:11:06.191 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 4>attarian power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that the president </v>

1507
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:11.231
<v Speaker 4>really represents the will of the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think Congress represents </v>

1508
01:11:11.231 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 4>the will of the people and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 4>Senate represents the will of the people</v>

1509
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:16.640
<v Speaker 4>any more than the pope represents the </v>
<v Speaker 4>will of God and I think it's this image,</v>

1510
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:21.710
<v Speaker 4>this imaginary thing that we're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to believe in because it makes us feel </v>

1511
01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:25.191
<v Speaker 4>more comfortable as though these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are really enacting the will of the </v>

1512
01:11:25.191 --> 01:11:25.191
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1513
01:11:25.191 --> 01:11:27.360
<v Speaker 4>I think the will of the people is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we want peace.</v>

1514
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 4>We want to be able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do want security,</v>

1515
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:35.421
<v Speaker 4>we want education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't want fucking war war with </v>

1516
01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want fucking war with Iraq,</v>

1517
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq.</v>

1518
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:44.481
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I forgot to say that I got some </v>

1519
01:11:44.481 --> 01:11:44.481
<v Speaker 4>start up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want it.</v>

1520
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if there is,</v>

1521
01:11:46.391 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a small faction of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweaty red face cock suckers,</v>

1522
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:55.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like that awful thin fucking </v>

1523
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.330
<v Speaker 4>scarecrow con and coulter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

1524
01:11:57.331 --> 01:12:01.530
<v Speaker 4>she's like something that Baphomet </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking coughed up like a hairball.</v>

1525
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:04.610
<v Speaker 4>That Satan or rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see her getting booted?</v>

1526
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 4>The Libertarian Convention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This fucking.</v>

1527
01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:11.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she fucking had the audacity,</v>

1528
01:12:11.281 --> 01:12:12.810
<v Speaker 4>like in front of the Libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>Convention,</v>

1529
01:12:12.811 --> 01:12:15.430
<v Speaker 4>she said they were asking her like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1530
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:18.090
<v Speaker 4>do you think gay people can get married?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

1531
01:12:18.091 --> 01:12:20.910
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gay people can get married to members of</v>

1532
01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:22.080
<v Speaker 4>the opposite sex.</v>

1533
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.860
<v Speaker 4>You Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dirty tap dancing.</v>

1534
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Scandal is bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's such a beast,</v>

1535
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:29.880
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

1536
01:12:29.881 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is there's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a small faction of these pigs.</v>

1537
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:39.170
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That grabbed the spotlight and produced </v>

1538
01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:39.170
<v Speaker 4>this illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1539
01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:39.170
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1540
01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:43.591
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and certainly the one of the great </v>

1541
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 4>illusions is the idea that the pope </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents God.</v>

1542
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Governments represent the people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Television represents reality.</v>

1543
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:53.630
<v Speaker 4>What we have happening on this planet is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dramatic cases of misrepresentation </v>

1544
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:57.840
<v Speaker 4>coming from a small minority of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who've managed to grab power.</v>

1545
01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:00.750
<v Speaker 4>And this creates an illusion that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to live by,</v>

1546
01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:05.751
<v Speaker 4>and the reason everything's all fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up is because it's not based on what's </v>

1547
01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:05.751
<v Speaker 4>really happening.</v>

1548
01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:10.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I believe that's one of the reasons </v>

1549
01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.351
<v Speaker 6>why government likes to keep religion in</v>
<v Speaker 6>positions of power and keep them tax </v>

1550
01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 6>free because it helps when people are in</v>
<v Speaker 6>big groups.</v>

1551
01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:20.601
<v Speaker 6>It helps when people are already </v>
<v Speaker 6>indoctrinated to the rules of the group </v>

1552
01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:23.310
<v Speaker 6>because then you're more likely to be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>person who listens to rules.</v>

1553
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:28.730
<v Speaker 6>The real issue with absolving all </v>
<v Speaker 6>religion is not the denial of the </v>

1554
01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:33.051
<v Speaker 6>existence of God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the denial of man's knowledge of </v>

1555
01:13:33.051 --> 01:13:33.600
<v Speaker 6>exactly what God is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who God is,</v>

1556
01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:38.601
<v Speaker 6>what God wants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and instead I could do is base it on the</v>

1557
01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:42.230
<v Speaker 6>wisdom of ancient teachings that we know</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be true today.</v>

1558
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:47.510
<v Speaker 6>Lot of that is real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Being able to treat people the way you </v>

1559
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:48.060
<v Speaker 6>would want to be treated yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in fact,</v>

1560
01:13:48.061 --> 01:13:50.430
<v Speaker 6>treat people as if they were you living </v>
<v Speaker 6>another life.</v>

1561
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:52.680
<v Speaker 6>That's how I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I literally try to do that.</v>

1562
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.260
<v Speaker 6>I try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gets a little taxing when you're like,</v>

1563
01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:57.240
<v Speaker 6>why am I such a fucking loser?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this other life,</v>

1564
01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets annoying,</v>

1565
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:02.070
<v Speaker 6>why am I a dickhead and this other life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you,</v>

1566
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 6>if you just think about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>things that people associate with </v>

1567
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.490
<v Speaker 6>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1568
01:14:08.491 --> 01:14:09.060
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1569
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1570
01:14:09.451 --> 01:14:14.451
<v Speaker 6>the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the good ideas of charity and love and </v>

1571
01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 6>family and the values of virtue in your </v>
<v Speaker 6>ethics and the way you think of,</v>

1572
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.340
<v Speaker 6>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

1573
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.440
<v Speaker 6>your fellow citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your fellow humans that you're in this </v>

1574
01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:22.440
<v Speaker 6>colony with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

1575
01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 6>those are all really super positive for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the most part.</v>

1576
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 6>It's mixed in with a lot of scare </v>
<v Speaker 6>tactics and fear and nonsense.</v>

1577
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 6>And who knows when that was all added.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the real problem.</v>

1578
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 6>But we know when we feel great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know when we feel filled with love,</v>

1579
01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:37.510
<v Speaker 6>when we know when our life is at its </v>
<v Speaker 6>best.</v>

1580
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:42.510
<v Speaker 6>And it's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's being around people that you also </v>

1581
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 6>love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They love you,</v>

1582
01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:45.100
<v Speaker 6>you're unconditional,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're all friendly,</v>

1583
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.750
<v Speaker 6>you're all happy and not having a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 6>of shit that bothers you as far as like,</v>

1584
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.030
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I should have been a singer or man,</v>

1585
01:14:52.031 --> 01:14:53.920
<v Speaker 6>I should've played baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or man,</v>

1586
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:55.750
<v Speaker 6>I should have given it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or man,</v>

1587
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.130
<v Speaker 6>why didn't I call her that night sale?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry,</v>

1588
01:14:58.131 --> 01:15:00.010
<v Speaker 6>but I have to be whatever the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

1589
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.230
<v Speaker 6>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you have regret,</v>

1590
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.690
<v Speaker 6>when you're in that weird state of </v>
<v Speaker 6>regret.</v>

1591
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm very extreme with that because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>tried to be like,</v>

1592
01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:12.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm very harsh on myself as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a monitoring what negativity and </v>

1593
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:15.350
<v Speaker 6>positivity and making sure that I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

1594
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:19.510
<v Speaker 6>a good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a good track and when you,</v>

1595
01:15:19.511 --> 01:15:24.511
<v Speaker 6>when you judge yourself to be like in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad place or that can really distract </v>

1596
01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 6>all of your creativity.</v>

1597
01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:30.900
<v Speaker 6>When it can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can completely fuck with any new </v>

1598
01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.790
<v Speaker 6>positive things that are moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's instead you've gone onto correction</v>

1599
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:38.791
<v Speaker 6>duty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you have to look at like how did </v>

1600
01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 6>this sort of behavior manifests itself?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the cause?</v>

1601
01:15:38.891 --> 01:15:41.040
<v Speaker 6>Is it alcohol induced?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's an insecurity and Derek's like,</v>

1602
01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:41.550
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

1603
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:46.570
<v Speaker 6>what happened or that were the </v>
<v Speaker 6>combinations of factors that led you to </v>

1604
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:46.570
<v Speaker 6>be a Douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1605
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:46.720
<v Speaker 6>and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:47.770
<v Speaker 6>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was,</v>

1607
01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 6>what was wrong with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1608
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:55.000
<v Speaker 6>that made you have a mediocre set.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the thing that was bugging you?</v>

1609
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:56.900
<v Speaker 6>Were you sat in front of your computer </v>
<v Speaker 6>for two hours,</v>

1610
01:15:56.901 --> 01:15:58.330
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't write chet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

1611
01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.280
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to stop whatever that is,</v>

1612
01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 6>stop whatever that is and make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't happen again and we have to sort</v>

1613
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:07.000
<v Speaker 6>of figure that out along the way.</v>

1614
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:12.350
<v Speaker 6>We.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the weirdest things </v>

1615
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:13.951
<v Speaker 6>about being a human is we're all sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>figuring this out as this thing is in </v>

1616
01:16:13.951 --> 01:16:18.781
<v Speaker 6>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I always equate it to being like we </v>

1617
01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:21.601
<v Speaker 6>woke up in the middle of a starship </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's hurling towards the planet and </v>

1618
01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:25.690
<v Speaker 6>we're like waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hitting all the instruments going,</v>

1619
01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:26.770
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where are we?</v>

1620
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 6>We're going $75,</v>
<v Speaker 6>million miles an hour.</v>

1621
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 6>How close is that planet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1622
01:16:30.941 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 6>Are we gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are we gonna?</v>

1623
01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:37.381
<v Speaker 6>Hit that plan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does anybody know how to wear the </v>

1624
01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:37.381
<v Speaker 6>breaks?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just think turn.</v>

1625
01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:37.381
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

1626
01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:40.390
<v Speaker 6>How did we get here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who built this fucking ship and how long</v>

1627
01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:43.970
<v Speaker 6>we've been asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we literally are in the middle of</v>

1628
01:16:43.971 --> 01:16:45.430
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just a process,</v>

1629
01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:50.431
<v Speaker 6>but like a journey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a process of constant reevaluation and </v>

1630
01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:54.811
<v Speaker 6>ingenuity and innovation where this </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology that we're surrounded by </v>

1631
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:59.050
<v Speaker 6>increasing in its power and ability like</v>
<v Speaker 6>tenfold every couple of years.</v>

1632
01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:03.580
<v Speaker 6>So like he's crazy quantum levels where </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're coming up with quantum computing</v>

1633
01:17:03.581 --> 01:17:08.581
<v Speaker 6>and they're talking about the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 6>put google glasses on and communicate </v>

1634
01:17:08.581 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 6>with the fucking world all at the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

1635
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.400
<v Speaker 6>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this time that we're at right now is </v>

1636
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:15.400
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1637
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.200
<v Speaker 6>it's almost as if we pick the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 6>spot for the most action,</v>

1638
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.860
<v Speaker 6>like the perfect spot for like the birth</v>
<v Speaker 6>and emergence of technology into the </v>

1639
01:17:27.891 --> 01:17:29.390
<v Speaker 6>forefront of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1640
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:34.391
<v Speaker 6>you know that a lot of new age or a say </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the reason that the earth is so </v>

1641
01:17:35.121 --> 01:17:40.121
<v Speaker 6>populated right now is because so many </v>
<v Speaker 6>different beings from infinity,</v>

1642
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 6>from the multiverse or wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 6>incarnate right now because it's such an</v>

1643
01:17:43.761 --> 01:17:48.761
<v Speaker 6>exciting thing happening to the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a great way of looking at why are</v>

1644
01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:52.450
<v Speaker 6>there so many entities and currently </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now because there's only,</v>

1645
01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:55.000
<v Speaker 6>you only get one thing like this thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>went up.</v>

1646
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 6>Planet pops,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1647
01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:59.360
<v Speaker 6>and it like wakes up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a really beautiful thing to be</v>

1648
01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:00.620
<v Speaker 6>a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love them.</v>

1649
01:18:00.621 --> 01:18:03.050
<v Speaker 6>I love that model.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't necessarily believe it.</v>

1650
01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:08.130
<v Speaker 6>And you have love that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a very empowering Melissa </v>

1651
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:10.571
<v Speaker 6>etheridge style model,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's mostly because porn is more </v>

1652
01:18:10.571 --> 01:18:12.080
<v Speaker 6>accepted and people are having more </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy sex and are open about sex.</v>

1653
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:17.081
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What younger people are having sex </v>

1654
01:18:17.081 --> 01:18:20.171
<v Speaker 6>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why there's so much of a </v>

1655
01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:20.171
<v Speaker 6>population boom at this time because.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1656
01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:20.171
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1657
01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:20.520
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1658
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:21.290
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1659
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:26.291
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because fuck exactly the same amount of </v>

1660
01:18:26.291 --> 01:18:26.291
<v Speaker 6>porn and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>poor,</v>

1661
01:18:26.291 --> 01:18:29.210
<v Speaker 6>poor and actually probably stops them </v>
<v Speaker 6>from fucking as much because they jerk </v>

1662
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.171
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe that the early 1900 </v>

1663
01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:32.171
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] it's all about family and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>

1664
01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 6>People aren't having crazy sex or you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

1665
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:39.100
<v Speaker 6>your history son.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think the roaring twenties </v>

1666
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:39.320
<v Speaker 6>were those all people fucking like wild </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>

1667
01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:41.580
<v Speaker 6>Doctors were giving abortions?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1668
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.860
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1669
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 6>I think your perceptions of the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>are a little off.</v>

1670
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:50.890
<v Speaker 6>The thing that brought people were very </v>
<v Speaker 6>conservative back to being conservative </v>

1671
01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:52.190
<v Speaker 6>was the great depression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So before the Great Depression,</v>

1672
01:18:52.191 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 6>which was in the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

1673
01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 6>they were fucking going bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People were going crazy and that was the</v>

1674
01:18:58.131 --> 01:19:00.650
<v Speaker 6>roaring twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had speakeasies checks were getting</v>

1675
01:19:00.651 --> 01:19:05.651
<v Speaker 6>banged dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're living in a bachelor or putting </v>

1676
01:19:05.651 --> 01:19:05.651
<v Speaker 6>cocaine and coke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1677
01:19:05.651 --> 01:19:08.930
<v Speaker 6>dudes were living a bachelor life to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>point where pool halls were.</v>

1678
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:13.960
<v Speaker 6>There was I think four times more pool </v>
<v Speaker 6>halls in New York City than there are </v>

1679
01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:18.950
<v Speaker 6>starbucks today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There were over a thousand pool halls in</v>

1680
01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:21.980
<v Speaker 6>New York City at the turn of the century</v>
<v Speaker 6>because people were.</v>

1681
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:24.920
<v Speaker 6>Kids were gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean kids like young,</v>

1682
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.160
<v Speaker 6>like nowadays that the average person </v>
<v Speaker 6>having sex for the first time,</v>

1683
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:31.970
<v Speaker 6>it was like 14,</v>
<v Speaker 6>15 years old back then was probably 21,</v>

1684
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.430
<v Speaker 6>22.</v>

1685
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.850
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1686
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:34.190
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're wrong.</v>

1687
01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.000
<v Speaker 6>No wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1688
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:35.950
<v Speaker 6>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1689
01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:36.970
<v Speaker 6>no people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>

1690
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.200
<v Speaker 6>We always have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People have always had sex at a young </v>

1691
01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 6>age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boys and girls have gotten together at a</v>

1692
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:47.750
<v Speaker 6>young age forever and fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't imagine that there's any more or</v>

1693
01:19:47.751 --> 01:19:50.270
<v Speaker 6>less fucking than has ever existed </v>
<v Speaker 6>amongst teenagers.</v>

1694
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 6>If you leave them alone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fuck you know,</v>

1695
01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.920
<v Speaker 6>and who fucks more than Catholic school </v>
<v Speaker 6>girls.</v>

1696
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.230
<v Speaker 6>You really think religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Religion is going to stop you.</v>

1697
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 6>Religious is not stopping a crazy bitch </v>
<v Speaker 6>with a,</v>

1698
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.120
<v Speaker 6>with a moist pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you leave almost any animal alone </v>

1699
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:05.120
<v Speaker 6>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

1700
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't buy that.</v>

1701
01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:10.650
<v Speaker 6>But the conservatism that we think of </v>
<v Speaker 6>from like the 19 fifties will,</v>

1702
01:20:10.651 --> 01:20:15.390
<v Speaker 6>that was in response to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hitler had just come along and world war</v>

1703
01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:18.330
<v Speaker 6>two came along and our grandparents had </v>
<v Speaker 6>to fight the Nazis.</v>

1704
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:23.660
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my grandfather worked in a plant that </v>

1705
01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:25.431
<v Speaker 6>made a part for the atomic bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was always the big thing that they </v>

1706
01:20:25.431 --> 01:20:25.431
<v Speaker 6>were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you brag around the house?</v>

1707
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.360
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a grandpa makes a,</v>

1708
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:30.540
<v Speaker 6>a part in his factory that is for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>atomic bomb.</v>

1709
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:32.330
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>

1710
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:37.340
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the conservatism that I think that came </v>

1711
01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:37.340
<v Speaker 6>in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fear,</v>

1712
01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.370
<v Speaker 6>the McCarthy era,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when everybody's like,</v>

1713
01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:43.371
<v Speaker 6>you comment someone's a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we were worried about Russia doing </v>

1714
01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:43.510
<v Speaker 6>the same shit we had just seen the Nazis</v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

1715
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.900
<v Speaker 6>So then the sixties come along,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

1716
01:20:45.901 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 6>Everybody finds drugs and free love and </v>
<v Speaker 6>hippy shit.</v>

1717
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:50.340
<v Speaker 6>And the government is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

1718
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 6>Like stop this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we're losing all the government saw</v>

1719
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of soft men running around in </v>
<v Speaker 6>sandals getting raped by Russians.</v>

1720
01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:03.470
<v Speaker 6>The Russians just come over here and </v>
<v Speaker 6>just store my beaches and kick us into </v>

1721
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480
<v Speaker 6>the fucking dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's on acid.</v>

1722
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:08.510
<v Speaker 6>Nobody wants to fight anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to get overtaken by the </v>

1723
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.510
<v Speaker 6>Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not commies are everywhere.</v>

1724
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:09.780
<v Speaker 6>Did you go to the communist manifesto?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dinner?</v>

1725
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 6>I just want to know is all about black </v>
<v Speaker 6>list head.</v>

1726
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 6>There was like a wild frenzy to stop the</v>
<v Speaker 6>drugs and to stop,</v>

1727
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 6>stop communism and establish the hippy </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit and,</v>

1728
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:25.521
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and put more power back to the </v>

1729
01:21:25.521 --> 01:21:25.521
<v Speaker 6>government.</v>

1730
01:21:25.521 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing I,</v>

1731
01:21:25.711 --> 01:21:27.170
<v Speaker 4>I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1732
01:21:27.171 --> 01:21:27.770
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it.</v>

1733
01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's basically two </v>
<v Speaker 4>religions in the world and that one </v>

1734
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:37.541
<v Speaker 4>religion is a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Religions pray that wrong or for when I </v>

1735
01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:40.600
<v Speaker 4>got cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mom's dying.</v>

1736
01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:45.820
<v Speaker 4>I've had a weird fucking year and in all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the turbulence man like behind it,</v>

1737
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:52.750
<v Speaker 4>this is what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Batch really severe catastrophic things </v>

1738
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:55.730
<v Speaker 4>happening in your life is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and why they call it an apocalypse.</v>

1739
01:21:55.731 --> 01:21:58.670
<v Speaker 4>Personal apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apocalypse means lifting of the veil.</v>

1740
01:21:58.671 --> 01:22:03.671
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you see this fucking thing </v>

1741
01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:08.740
<v Speaker 4>behind all the turbulence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird after you've like </v>

1742
01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.900
<v Speaker 4>gotten the initial prognosis or after </v>
<v Speaker 4>you find out the bad news that you know,</v>

1743
01:22:11.901 --> 01:22:16.901
<v Speaker 4>you go into shock kind of and then that </v>
<v Speaker 4>faith and you pace around the process </v>

1744
01:22:16.901 --> 01:22:19.970
<v Speaker 4>process and in this fades away and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing hit me.</v>

1745
01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I felt it when I've been on a lot of</v>

1746
01:22:22.161 --> 01:22:27.161
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you've kind of talked about it </v>

1747
01:22:27.161 --> 01:22:27.770
<v Speaker 4>and you're your dmt trip story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but God damn it.</v>

1748
01:22:27.771 --> 01:22:32.771
<v Speaker 4>It's this fucking thing behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that's saying everything's </v>

1749
01:22:32.771 --> 01:22:32.771
<v Speaker 4>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Okay.</v>

1750
01:22:32.771 --> 01:22:35.960
<v Speaker 4>Everything's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Oh k.</v>

1751
01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:38.060
<v Speaker 4>and you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bullshit.</v>

1752
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You're not delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really pick up on this thing,</v>

1753
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 6>what you feel is that you're caught up </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the idea of this small loop being the</v>

1754
01:22:47.531 --> 01:22:52.531
<v Speaker 6>big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that this small loop represents your </v>

1755
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:56.461
<v Speaker 6>reality and it's so important to you </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you have loved ones and because </v>

1756
01:22:56.461 --> 01:22:58.570
<v Speaker 6>you have car payments and because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a job that you enjoy,</v>

1757
01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 6>it's so important you this loop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then it allows you to see that this </v>

1758
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:08.401
<v Speaker 6>loop is just a and an infinite ball of </v>
<v Speaker 6>yarn that goes on forever and you and </v>

1759
01:23:09.411 --> 01:23:10.950
<v Speaker 6>you look at it and just go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1760
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 6>and it's going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be okay.</v>

1761
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.340
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1762
01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:18.650
<v Speaker 6>Because you realize that life in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>universe and everything we find </v>

1763
01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:25.890
<v Speaker 6>everywhere we look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fractal and that it all is infinite</v>

1764
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:32.320
<v Speaker 6>big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of it is infinitely small and </v>

1765
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:32.680
<v Speaker 6>infinitely big and it exists everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 6>we look.</v>

1766
01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 6>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We never found.</v>

1767
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:34.870
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the end.</v>

1768
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.820
<v Speaker 6>This is the end of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here it is.</v>

1769
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It hits a wall and then there's nothing </v>

1770
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:42.000
<v Speaker 6>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1771
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:42.000
<v Speaker 6>there's no wall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1772
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.480
<v Speaker 6>It goes down to subatomic particles that</v>
<v Speaker 6>blink in and out of existence.</v>

1773
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.600
<v Speaker 6>They're in a super position,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they're in two different places at </v>

1774
01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.971
<v Speaker 6>one time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're moving and still at the same </v>

1775
01:23:50.971 --> 01:23:50.971
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking madness.</v>

1776
01:23:50.971 --> 01:23:54.931
<v Speaker 6>They disappear and they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't know where the fuck they went </v>

1777
01:23:54.931 --> 01:23:56.620
<v Speaker 6>and they can measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't know what it means.</v>

1778
01:23:57.250 --> 01:24:02.250
<v Speaker 6>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like it's probably gotta be that </v>

1779
01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:06.570
<v Speaker 6>with just life in general and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

1780
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:11.910
<v Speaker 6>Consciousness in general.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we're clinging onto this one </v>

1781
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:16.530
<v Speaker 6>particular consciousness and this one </v>
<v Speaker 6>particular moment in time because I </v>

1782
01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 6>think the human race is here to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

1783
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.140
<v Speaker 6>I think we're a part of a process like </v>
<v Speaker 6>bees making honey or aunts making an ant</v>

1784
01:24:25.141 --> 01:24:30.141
<v Speaker 6>hill and that all of our wackiness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's ego or sexuality or you </v>

1785
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:35.950
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the need to conquer whatever these </v>

1786
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:38.131
<v Speaker 6>things are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all a part of this gigantic </v>

1787
01:24:38.131 --> 01:24:39.850
<v Speaker 6>calculation to bring us technologically </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the next level.</v>

1788
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:43.150
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's because we're worried about</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other guys doing it first.</v>

1789
01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.480
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's how the,</v>

1790
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:51.500
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the movement represents itself </v>

1791
01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:51.990
<v Speaker 6>represents itself through the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 6>military conquest by the,</v>

1792
01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:57.200
<v Speaker 6>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we have to hit this technological </v>

1793
01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:57.200
<v Speaker 6>superiority first,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like sorta like the moon race.</v>

1794
01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.070
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

1795
01:24:58.071 --> 01:24:59.230
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1796
01:24:59.231 --> 01:25:00.130
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>

1797
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:05.131
<v Speaker 6>when I look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of our inability to grasp what </v>

1798
01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:11.881
<v Speaker 6>we're doing and our continued movement </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the same crazy direction like </v>

1799
01:25:11.881 --> 01:25:16.120
<v Speaker 6>especially when it comes to war and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the lack of respect people have for </v>

1800
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:21.390
<v Speaker 6>poor people and the lower classes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the lack of resources that are put into </v>

1801
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:23.110
<v Speaker 6>raising the backup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I almost look at it like it's,</v>

1802
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:28.710
<v Speaker 6>it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you look at every other animal's </v>

1803
01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:32.401
<v Speaker 6>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's wolves and the Alpha Beta </v>

1804
01:25:32.401 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 6>representative in the wolf pack and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

1805
01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:35.680
<v Speaker 6>the way they have the social world </v>
<v Speaker 6>structured,</v>

1806
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:36.910
<v Speaker 6>even if it's cruel.</v>

1807
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:41.910
<v Speaker 6>We see bears eat their cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We understand that this is nature bears </v>

1808
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 6>one of their favorite things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Grizzlies,</v>

1809
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 6>they get up earlier before the females </v>
<v Speaker 6>do in the spring and they go and hunt </v>

1810
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:51.961
<v Speaker 6>for baby baby bears.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to go into the dense on </v>

1811
01:25:51.961 --> 01:25:53.290
<v Speaker 6>purpose to eat the babies a phase.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1812
01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.670
<v Speaker 6>motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1813
01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:56.700
<v Speaker 6>But that's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we know that's natural.</v>

1814
01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.870
<v Speaker 6>So we see it and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's natural.</v>

1815
01:25:58.871 --> 01:26:00.970
<v Speaker 6>That's what nature wants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's we,</v>

1816
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:04.880
<v Speaker 6>we're the only thing that we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that can stop nature.</v>

1817
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
<v Speaker 6>We can stop the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We feel like we are intelligent and </v>

1818
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.201
<v Speaker 6>aware and we are capable of stopping the</v>
<v Speaker 6>equation that we find ourselves in and </v>

1819
01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:16.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm not so sure if that even makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>sense.</v>

1820
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:18.750
<v Speaker 4>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing.</v>

1821
01:26:18.751 --> 01:26:21.320
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was reading this great book </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Ip holders,</v>

1822
01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:21.680
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1823
01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:22.590
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Brian.</v>

1824
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:27.540
<v Speaker 4>He'll tell you about boners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

1825
01:26:27.630 --> 01:26:32.630
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about that new ps four that you're </v>

1826
01:26:34.691 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 4>not excited about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1827
01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.880
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1828
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm mildly excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited about the next generation of</v>

1829
01:26:45.221 --> 01:26:47.680
<v Speaker 4>these things coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not as excited about the new xbox,</v>

1830
01:26:47.681 --> 01:26:49.750
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you been playing games at all?</v>

1831
01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:51.850
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't really been playing games.</v>

1832
01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love playing this game called far cry </v>

1833
01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:57.810
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1834
01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:58.200
<v Speaker 4>you really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're changing the game for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1836
01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because the characters in it </v>

1837
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:05.160
<v Speaker 4>are Douche bags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're like,</v>

1838
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.010
<v Speaker 4>they're really a cheesy storyline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bunch of actors get </v>

1839
01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:12.571
<v Speaker 4>kidnapped by like tribal peppers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very funny that the way that they </v>

1840
01:27:12.571 --> 01:27:16.831
<v Speaker 4>communicate with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're going to get back to Santa </v>

1841
01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:16.831
<v Speaker 4>Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

1842
01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.280
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1843
01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:18.850
<v Speaker 4>like they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1844
01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.790
<v Speaker 4>they all were in the film industry or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1845
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.740
<v Speaker 4>so it's cheesy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a chance to.</v>

1846
01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.980
<v Speaker 4>And also like the main character as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>progresses,</v>

1847
01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:31.030
<v Speaker 4>gets a tribal armband that keeps growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>on his arm.</v>

1848
01:27:31.031 --> 01:27:36.031
<v Speaker 4>Like it's definitely the game seems to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been made by somebody who is like </v>

1849
01:27:36.031 --> 01:27:38.560
<v Speaker 4>definitely into techno and cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still a very fun game.</v>

1850
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Little Esther's watching us right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been having a side </v>

1851
01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.610
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wants to get fake boobs for real.</v>

1852
01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.050
<v Speaker 4>She's just trolling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1853
01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.750
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she really does want to fake boobs.</v>

1854
01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.550
<v Speaker 4>She has a nice rug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That girl.</v>

1855
01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:56.020
<v Speaker 7>You try to think of him.</v>

1856
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:58.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen a little asterisk boobs.</v>

1857
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.440
<v Speaker 6>Apologize for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm usually very professional.</v>

1858
01:28:01.441 --> 01:28:03.420
<v Speaker 6>What comes to my urine?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gotta go,</v>

1859
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:08.550
<v Speaker 6>you gotta go drink a Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Before the whole foods started getting </v>

1860
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:11.010
<v Speaker 6>the new Kombucha is in again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know that a Kombucha tea,</v>

1861
01:28:11.011 --> 01:28:14.580
<v Speaker 6>like when you get it like Gts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kombucha or synergy?</v>

1862
01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.080
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like more than one half of one </v>

1863
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.491
<v Speaker 6>percent alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you had to be over 21 to buy and you </v>

1864
01:28:22.491 --> 01:28:25.951
<v Speaker 6>still have to be over 21 to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they just got it back on the </v>

1865
01:28:25.951 --> 01:28:26.160
<v Speaker 6>shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had like a diluted form of it.</v>

1866
01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.860
<v Speaker 6>We just still healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The kombucha still good,</v>

1867
01:28:28.861 --> 01:28:32.340
<v Speaker 6>but it's not as good as the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The True fermented live culture,</v>

1868
01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:33.750
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1869
01:28:33.751 --> 01:28:37.230
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So good.</v>

1870
01:28:37.231 --> 01:28:38.850
<v Speaker 6>You get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you did get a taste for that.</v>

1871
01:28:38.851 --> 01:28:43.851
<v Speaker 6>It's so healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll drink a diet coke and feel like a </v>

1872
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:43.851
<v Speaker 6>loser.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just like,</v>

1873
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:43.851
<v Speaker 6>what am I doing?</v>

1874
01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.900
<v Speaker 6>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do I want to fuck my body up?</v>

1875
01:28:45.901 --> 01:28:50.901
<v Speaker 6>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd rather drink a coke because I know </v>

1876
01:28:50.901 --> 01:28:50.901
<v Speaker 6>it's just fatty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1877
01:28:50.901 --> 01:28:54.510
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck these natural or unnatural</v>
<v Speaker 6>sweeteners do for you?</v>

1878
01:28:54.511 --> 01:28:57.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck they do.</v>

1879
01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1880
01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:00.570
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what's dangerous and what's</v>
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

1881
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:02.850
<v Speaker 6>but know sugar just gets you fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1882
01:29:02.851 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 6>it might give you diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have you got a wacky system,</v>

1883
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:08.640
<v Speaker 6>but basically just gets you fat when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>take that.</v>

1884
01:29:08.641 --> 01:29:13.430
<v Speaker 6>Aspartame is significant evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 6>point that that stuff causes cancer,</v>

1885
01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:16.270
<v Speaker 6>like brain cancer or.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

1886
01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.180
<v Speaker 6>I eat a lot of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:29:18.181 --> 01:29:20.490
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you should take a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>aspartame.</v>

1888
01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:26.480
<v Speaker 6>Linda's six splendid Trenta iced coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the only shit that they've shown</v>

1889
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:32.990
<v Speaker 6>that's really safe is Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stevia is eventual even taste that good.</v>

1890
01:29:34.190 --> 01:29:39.190
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even lately there has been some shit on </v>

1891
01:29:39.190 --> 01:29:39.190
<v Speaker 6>Stevia or he'll.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:29:39.190 --> 01:29:39.190
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't heard that because Stevia is a</v>

1893
01:29:39.190 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 6>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's that stuff?</v>

1894
01:29:40.651 --> 01:29:42.430
<v Speaker 6>This syrup a Gavi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty good.</v>

1895
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 6>That's what I have is actually not good </v>
<v Speaker 6>for you.</v>

1896
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:51.250
<v Speaker 6>It is so disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Gavi is high in like a sugary syrup.</v>

1897
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 6>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was fine.</v>

1898
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:56.610
<v Speaker 6>It's not like honey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>honey is actually good for you.</v>

1899
01:29:56.611 --> 01:29:58.410
<v Speaker 6>A Gaba is not good for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just sugar.</v>

1900
01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 6>What a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not bad for you.</v>

1901
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:05.070
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like the real problem with sugar is</v>

1902
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:08.190
<v Speaker 6>if you get it without all the other shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's attached to,</v>

1903
01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:13.220
<v Speaker 6>like if you get sugar from fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not nearly as bad for you is a </v>

1904
01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:17.061
<v Speaker 6>spoonful of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You take a spoonful of sugar in your </v>

1905
01:30:17.061 --> 01:30:18.330
<v Speaker 6>body just like jolt like that.</v>

1906
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to get that in that </v>
<v Speaker 6>forum and when you drink a coke,</v>

1907
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:26.360
<v Speaker 6>you're drinking like several spoonfuls </v>
<v Speaker 6>just pounded it into your bloodstream.</v>

1908
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 6>I wonder how many spoonfuls of aspartame</v>
<v Speaker 6>is in a diet coke?</v>

1909
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:31.270
<v Speaker 6>No one's done that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen that.</v>

1910
01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 6>Even juices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the criticism of fruit juices.</v>

1911
01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:39.621
<v Speaker 6>The criticism of fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fruit juices is you're getting far too </v>

1912
01:30:39.621 --> 01:30:42.441
<v Speaker 6>much sugar like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're really supposed to do is drink </v>

1913
01:30:42.441 --> 01:30:42.441
<v Speaker 6>water and eat oranges.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like.</v>

1914
01:30:42.441 --> 01:30:43.920
<v Speaker 6>Because when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an orange is attached to fiber,</v>

1915
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.800
<v Speaker 6>it's attached to cellulose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the different plant,</v>

1916
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:49.590
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck the orange to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fruit is made of.</v>

1917
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're just supposed to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1918
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:52.070
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the,</v>

1919
01:30:52.130 --> 01:30:57.130
<v Speaker 6>that's the nutritional package.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's supposed to get fiber along with </v>

1920
01:30:57.130 --> 01:30:57.130
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1921
01:30:57.130 --> 01:31:00.570
<v Speaker 6>It's like one of the reasons why Kale </v>
<v Speaker 6>shakes are show so good as opposed to </v>

1922
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:00.570
<v Speaker 6>juicing.</v>

1923
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:04.340
<v Speaker 6>Like this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole foods was talking to me about </v>

1924
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:04.340
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1925
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:04.340
<v Speaker 6>do you juice?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1926
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:04.590
<v Speaker 6>I like juicing too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like juicing.</v>

1927
01:31:04.591 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 6>Juicing is great for getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>chlorophyll,</v>

1928
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:13.470
<v Speaker 6>a lot of like you can get like highly </v>
<v Speaker 6>concentrated like Greens if you juice,</v>

1929
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.160
<v Speaker 6>but the fibers really good for you too </v>
<v Speaker 6>and when,</v>

1930
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:18.750
<v Speaker 6>if you can just choke it down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1931
01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.340
<v Speaker 6>and not a lot of people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

1932
01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.900
<v Speaker 6>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just choke it down.</v>

1933
01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:24.020
<v Speaker 6>You mean your Kale shakes?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1934
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.420
<v Speaker 6>those are disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to go ahead,</v>

1935
01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:29.880
<v Speaker 6>go piss you say they're nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're so good for you man.</v>

1936
01:31:29.881 --> 01:31:34.881
<v Speaker 6>And I can't tell you how many people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I've run into at these shows that </v>

1937
01:31:34.881 --> 01:31:38.631
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this one dude didn't in Anaheim this </v>

1938
01:31:38.631 --> 01:31:38.910
<v Speaker 6>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said that he lost 200 fucking pounds.</v>

1939
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:43.200
<v Speaker 6>He showed me a picture of him standing </v>
<v Speaker 6>next to Dan Henderson and he was like,</v>

1940
01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400
<v Speaker 6>or is it Ben Henderson?</v>

1941
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:46.560
<v Speaker 6>Hm?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not sure.</v>

1942
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.390
<v Speaker 6>Blurry picture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1943
01:31:48.391 --> 01:31:53.391
<v Speaker 6>I forgot to ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was enormous and now he's like </v>

1944
01:31:53.391 --> 01:31:53.391
<v Speaker 6>200 pounds.</v>

1947
01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 6>and realizing what can I do to affect my</v>

1951
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:08.581
<v Speaker 6>quality of life.</v>

<v Speaker 6>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>walked 200 fucking pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 6>talked about this before,</v>

1964
01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:40.660
<v Speaker 6>but this is an unconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This video is Quinn Tarantino,</v>

1965
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.430
<v Speaker 6>my favorite director of all time.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You guys are nuts,</v>

1968

01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:56.110
<v Speaker 6>he's nuts and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a brilliant director but he's a </v>

1970
01:32:56.741 --> 01:33:00.430
<v Speaker 6>chameleon socially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I noticed it when I was listening to</v>

<v Speaker 6>feminine,</v>

1974
01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.610
<v Speaker 6>like almost gay or very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I should say,</v>

1975
01:33:15.611 --> 01:33:16.870
<v Speaker 6>very submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

1976
01:33:16.871 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What we're looking for is autistic.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1978
01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:22.870

<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so Roger Avery who created that and also</v>

2156
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:31.530
<v Speaker 6>cowrote pulp fiction with Tarantino and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can see like when you see like a </v>

2157
01:41:31.630 --> 01:41:33.950
<v Speaker 6>killing zoe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you read some of his,</v>

2158
01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.360
<v Speaker 6>he was the one who got in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 6>tweeting when he was in jail.</v>

2159
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:38.680
<v Speaker 6>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>

2160
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:41.740
<v Speaker 6>Roger Avery was in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he drunk drive.</v>

2161
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:43.580
<v Speaker 6>He was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was uh,</v>

2162
01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.640
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was driving truck and he killed </v>

2163
01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:48.640
<v Speaker 6>somebody.</v>

2164
01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 6>I think he got in a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Killed one of his friends.</v>

2165
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:52.150
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he had to go to jail for a while and</v>

2166
01:41:52.151 --> 01:41:55.120
<v Speaker 6>he was tweeting from jail and there was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like some sort of a,</v>

2167
01:41:55.121 --> 01:42:00.121
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a controversy with the fact that he was </v>

2168
01:42:00.121 --> 01:42:00.121
<v Speaker 6>able to tweet from jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they moved here.</v>

2169
01:42:00.121 --> 01:42:01.840
<v Speaker 6>They want them moving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think because of it,</v>

2170
01:42:01.841 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 6>I think it like he really got fucked </v>
<v Speaker 6>over because of it.</v>

2171
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:09.091
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure if I'm telling them the </v>

2172
01:42:09.091 --> 01:42:09.091
<v Speaker 6>exact true story,</v>

<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrote these really interesting tweets </v>

2174
01:42:13.681 --> 01:42:13.990
<v Speaker 6>from jails.</v>

2292
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:27.081
<v Speaker 4>but it knew the floor was there so the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pixels would kind of ride the floor and </v>

2293
01:47:27.081 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cool man.</v>

2294
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:31.050
<v Speaker 4>That well it seems like that's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all going to go right now.</v>

2295
01:47:31.051 --> 01:47:33.360
<v Speaker 4>It's going to the fucking oculus rift </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2296
01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:35.380
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck the projectors.</v>

2297
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the OCULUS rift?</v>

2298
01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.170
<v Speaker 4>What does that have you seen videos of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with the OCULUS rift off?</v>

2299
01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:45.220
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this like consumer based virtual </v>

2300
01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:47.781
<v Speaker 4>reality helmet that's coming out that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently so insane that when people </v>

2301
01:47:47.781 --> 01:47:51.060
<v Speaker 4>wear it and they hear someone talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>near them while the rift is on,</v>

2302
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:56.300
<v Speaker 4>it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like you sitting here right now </v>

2303
01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:58.431
<v Speaker 4>and suddenly a disembodied voice starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to you because it like fully </v>

2304
01:47:58.431 --> 01:47:59.550
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like apparently incredible.</v>

2305
01:47:59.551 --> 01:48:04.551
<v Speaker 4>There's videos of it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've seen those red band got to </v>

2306
01:48:04.551 --> 01:48:07.880
<v Speaker 4>show people putting it on the lenses </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit.</v>

2307
01:48:07.930 --> 01:48:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Fisheye effect I got to do is give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>the headset.</v>

2308
01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:19.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's going to where you're standing.</v>

2309
01:48:19.371 --> 01:48:24.371
<v Speaker 7>You would have your body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your brain just naturally just telling </v>

2310
01:48:24.371 --> 01:48:26.330
<v Speaker 7>you to start walking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2311
01:48:26.331 --> 01:48:30.890
<v Speaker 7>it'd be a really good way to put this on</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone's head and they're like,</v>

2312
01:48:30.891 --> 01:48:33.920
<v Speaker 7>inside of like a train tunnel and have </v>
<v Speaker 7>them walk towards the light,</v>

2313
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:35.000
<v Speaker 7>come out into the world</v>

2314
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:39.720
<v Speaker 4>right when he puts it on,</v>

2315
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:42.130
<v Speaker 7>walk up to like one of these buildings </v>
<v Speaker 7>basically.</v>

2316
01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:45.100
<v Speaker 4>And we can't see what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2317
01:48:45.101 --> 01:48:46.510
<v Speaker 4>We just see a guy with some crazy</v>

2318
01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.980
<v Speaker 7>good to see for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That candidate Anthony.</v>

2319
01:48:56.090 --> 01:49:01.090
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he's going to put it off for the </v>

2320
01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:01.090
<v Speaker 7>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Taking the red or the blue pill.</v>

2321
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.800
<v Speaker 7>Just adjust a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone that's pretty good.</v>

2322
01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:11.850
<v Speaker 7>Looks pretty good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So before you take off running through </v>

2323
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:12.400
<v Speaker 7>the streets of this village,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2324
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:16.030
<v Speaker 7>I want you to look left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look right,</v>

2325
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:21.500
<v Speaker 7>look up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look down shit,</v>

2326
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.960
<v Speaker 7>and actually look at 180 degrees of turn</v>
<v Speaker 7>your body and look at me.</v>

2327
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:29.700
<v Speaker 7>Basically Ryan would be phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you do have all three 60 head track.</v>

2328
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:33.540
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So first just take a look at some of the</v>

2329
01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:35.140
<v Speaker 7>snow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The snow is,</v>

2330
01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:40.240
<v Speaker 7>it's all stared at.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you should see some nice depth to </v>

2331
01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:40.240
<v Speaker 7>that snow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You feel like it's falling on,</v>

2332
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:41.500
<v Speaker 7>you're going to kitchen.</v>

2333
01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:46.800
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they finally figured it out.</v>

2334
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 4>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2335
01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:53.341
<v Speaker 4>they've had it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just haven't been consumer based </v>

2336
01:49:53.341 --> 01:49:55.801
<v Speaker 4>when you know and they've got to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other interesting thing and one of </v>

2337
01:49:55.801 --> 01:49:58.561
<v Speaker 4>the other interviews I saw as they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about when there are wasting it </v>

2338
01:49:58.561 --> 01:50:01.951
<v Speaker 4>and they say obviously they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>release it until people designed games </v>

2339
01:50:01.951 --> 01:50:04.681
<v Speaker 4>for it and that it's not as simple as </v>
<v Speaker 4>just plugging it into a game because the</v>

2340
01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.200
<v Speaker 4>size ratios are off in a game and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the characters running around in the </v>

2341
01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.740
<v Speaker 4>game are either bigger than a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be,</v>

2342
01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:13.660
<v Speaker 4>are generally smaller than a human would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2343
01:50:13.661 --> 01:50:18.661
<v Speaker 4>So for it to really work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to design a thing around an </v>

2344
01:50:18.661 --> 01:50:20.080
<v Speaker 4>actual human size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's really,</v>

2345
01:50:20.081 --> 01:50:25.081
<v Speaker 4>it's a really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got to go through and redesign </v>

2346
01:50:25.081 --> 01:50:25.300
<v Speaker 4>games based on this fucking thing.</v>

2347
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:28.640
<v Speaker 6>Nobody works harder and longer hours </v>
<v Speaker 6>than game designers.</v>

2348
01:50:28.670 --> 01:50:33.190
<v Speaker 6>God Damn drives work some crazy hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember when we were hanging out</v>

2349
01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:38.191
<v Speaker 6>with cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he beat and it was getting close to the </v>

2350
01:50:38.191 --> 01:50:40.680
<v Speaker 6>release,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of their games and they said they </v>

2351
01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.241
<v Speaker 6>would just sleep in the office,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we just sleep in the office and </v>

2352
01:50:42.241 --> 01:50:45.481
<v Speaker 6>worked for weeks at a time and like </v>
<v Speaker 6>loved ones would come and visit them at </v>

2353
01:50:45.481 --> 01:50:45.481
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would just be gone.</v>

2354
01:50:45.481 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 6>You've worked forever and just to to to </v>
<v Speaker 6>meet a deadline to get a game out.</v>

2355
01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:54.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a crazy world of video game </v>

2356
01:50:54.610 --> 01:50:56.971
<v Speaker 6>development.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a lot of hours and that's a </v>

2357
01:50:56.971 --> 01:50:56.971
<v Speaker 6>difficult</v>

2358
01:50:56.971 --> 01:51:00.380
<v Speaker 4>and so weird that like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that those guys don't have like an </v>

2359
01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Oscars that's going to be in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like now we get these guys.</v>

2360
01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 4>You like regurgitate wind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody wrote and we're like,</v>

2361
01:51:04.361 --> 01:51:09.361
<v Speaker 4>oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about these people who are God's </v>

2362
01:51:09.361 --> 01:51:10.410
<v Speaker 4>creating virtual universities that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can run around inside of?</v>

2363
01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's no joke.</v>

2364
01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:14.520
<v Speaker 4>That's no with code,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with code,</v>

2365
01:51:14.530 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 4>with fucking code.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not even.</v>

2366
01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:20.620
<v Speaker 4>They have to type lines of code to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>invoke virtual reality.</v>

2367
01:51:20.621 --> 01:51:24.310
<v Speaker 4>There's so many alternate dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 4>with code.</v>

2368
01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane,</v>

2369
01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:31.020
<v Speaker 4>and then you're going to be able to pop </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and fucking oculus rift and suddenly </v>

2370
01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:34.411
<v Speaker 4>be existing inside of world of warcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call that my last day on earth.</v>

2371
01:51:36.370 --> 01:51:38.290
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be that in the hamster </v>
<v Speaker 6>wheel.</v>

2372
01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:44.920
<v Speaker 4>That's the one fucking problem and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be the final thing is </v>

2373
01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:44.920
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

2374
01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.920
<v Speaker 6>I think they'll just create a warehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2375
01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:51.080
<v Speaker 6>they'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All you need is a gigantic warehouse </v>

2376
01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.811
<v Speaker 6>space,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you have a warehouse space and you </v>

2377
01:51:53.811 --> 01:51:54.090
<v Speaker 6>designed the virtual reality game for </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the space is like.</v>

2378
01:51:54.091 --> 01:51:58.350
<v Speaker 6>Say It's a airplane hangar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>giant fucking Costco sized building with</v>

2379
01:51:58.620 --> 01:51:59.820
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no trees,</v>

2380
01:51:59.821 --> 01:52:04.821
<v Speaker 6>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where aware we're pole is replace it </v>

2381
01:52:04.821 --> 01:52:07.581
<v Speaker 6>with a tree and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're off to the races and so you stay </v>

2382
01:52:07.581 --> 01:52:10.971
<v Speaker 6>inside this building and you live in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality totally created for this </v>

2383
01:52:10.971 --> 01:52:10.971
<v Speaker 6>building.</v>

2384
01:52:10.971 --> 01:52:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Or are you just plug some shit into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>back of your brain stem that makes you </v>

2385
01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.790
<v Speaker 4>feel like you're moving and gradually </v>
<v Speaker 4>just transformed a big fat wow.</v>

2386
01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:20.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the other problem was if you had a a</v>

2387
01:52:20.341 --> 01:52:25.341
<v Speaker 6>warehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the real problem would be the only </v>

2388
01:52:25.341 --> 01:52:27.981
<v Speaker 6>things that you would come in contact </v>
<v Speaker 6>with or things that are touching the </v>

2389
01:52:27.981 --> 01:52:31.971
<v Speaker 6>floor couldn't really come in contact </v>
<v Speaker 6>with anything physical and the virtual </v>

2390
01:52:31.971 --> 01:52:36.351
<v Speaker 6>reality sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless you're dealing with some sort of </v>

2391
01:52:36.351 --> 01:52:37.320
<v Speaker 6>recreated neural impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2392
01:52:37.321 --> 01:52:40.320
<v Speaker 6>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a fake touch of fake.</v>

2393
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2394
01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.630
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be a fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can't,</v>

2395
01:52:42.631 --> 01:52:47.631
<v Speaker 4>you either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would either have to have someone </v>

2396
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:49.431
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a ball of virtual reality ball </v>

2397
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:49.431
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can roll in.</v>

2398
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:52.661
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you either have to have something </v>

2399
01:52:52.661 --> 01:52:54.671
<v Speaker 4>like that or you would have to simulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you'd have to have your brain </v>

2400
01:52:54.671 --> 01:52:54.671
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

2401
01:52:54.671 --> 01:52:56.610
<v Speaker 6>Your body convinced this actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>touching the tree.</v>

2402
01:52:56.611 --> 01:52:58.410
<v Speaker 6>So it feels a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:52:58.411 --> 01:53:03.411
<v Speaker 6>Maybe if it was so convincing that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>or your fingers responded to it.</v>

2404
01:53:05.010 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gloved.</v>

2405
01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:11.100
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make sense though because </v>
<v Speaker 6>would be some went to touch a tree and </v>

2406
01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:11.100
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your fingers would just go right through</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like you would have to.</v>

2408
01:53:11.730 --> 01:53:12.780
<v Speaker 6>It would have to stop it.</v>

2409
01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It have to be a magnetic field that </v>
<v Speaker 4>conform to some kind of shape.</v>

2410
01:53:16.501 --> 01:53:21.501
<v Speaker 4>It would have to be some way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you're wearing responds to a </v>

2411
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:24.600
<v Speaker 4>magnetic field and it creates the sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a shape being there.</v>

2412
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:26.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

01:54:49.901 --> 01:54:50.960
<v Speaker 6>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Her wealth of Orgasms,</v>

2443
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:56.080

<v Speaker 6>She's like existing amongst the common </v>

2444
01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:56.950
<v Speaker 6>poverished women who never come and </v>
<v Speaker 6>she's older ages.</v>

2445
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:59.810
<v Speaker 6>That's what women want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to come.</v>

2446
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.240
<v Speaker 6>If you could come all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would come all day.</v>

2447
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:07.480
<v Speaker 6>If you can come with the same feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same like release that you do when </v>

2448
01:55:09.231 --> 01:55:14.231
<v Speaker 6>you haven't jerked off for like a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that when you jerk off with </v>

2449
01:55:14.231 --> 01:55:15.230
<v Speaker 6>like bullying comes power and out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2450
01:55:15.231 --> 01:55:18.350
<v Speaker 6>it's like there's a lot of force behind </v>
<v Speaker 6>it and get you get some distance.</v>

2451
01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 6>If you could do that three or four times</v>
<v Speaker 6>a day,</v>

2452
01:55:20.181 --> 01:55:22.160
<v Speaker 6>you would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd be doing it constantly.</v>

2453
01:55:22.161 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 6>If you have the same room.</v>

2454
01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:25.930
<v Speaker 4>This is something I always thought is of</v>
<v Speaker 4>course,</v>

01:55:25.931 --> 01:55:26.680
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>are you taking.</v>

2457
01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:33.660
<v Speaker 4>You have a nine hour orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this woman made me think that maybe </v>

2458
01:55:33.881 --> 01:55:34.780
<v Speaker 4>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Would it be too intense?</v>

2461
01:55:37.570 --> 01:55:40.450
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she's one of those chicks just </v>
<v Speaker 4>complains about everything.</v>

2462
01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Can you mention just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't it be cool just to pee though?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I like based on the.</v>

2476
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Maybe somebody out there in the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 4>can help us figure this out,</v>

2477
01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:26.130
<v Speaker 4>but based on the size of a individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>sperm,</v>

2478
01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:31.370
<v Speaker 4>how big would a giant have to beat as </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot a load where you could see the </v>

2479
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 4>sperm swimming inside of it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Who knows if that's true.</v>

2484
01:56:41.170 --> 01:56:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Somebody could have just made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does it kill you?</v>

2485
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:46.050
<v Speaker 3>How does he like jerking off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what killed them.</v>

2486
01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably didn't eat already.</v>

2487
01:56:47.890 --> 01:56:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Starved to death or he fucking fell and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit his head because he was tired.</v>

2488
01:56:51.710 --> 01:56:53.770
<v Speaker 3>The jerking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jerking off going to kill you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2490
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you had like the abrasions caused </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to bleed out.</v>

2491
01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

2492
01:57:01.151 --> 01:57:06.151
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go back to that aspartame </v>

2493
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:06.610
<v Speaker 3>thing because I'm looking at and </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspartame and uh,</v>

2494
01:57:06.611 --> 01:57:09.100
<v Speaker 3>when you look on the Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2495
01:57:09.190 --> 01:57:11.140
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like it's that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

2496
01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it was slightly dangerous,</v>

2497
01:57:14.321 --> 01:57:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I doubt would be in coke zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

2498
01:57:16.901 --> 01:57:21.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta wonder like how many fucking </v>

2499
01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:23.080
<v Speaker 3>people are taking it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just like the science.</v>

2500
01:57:23.850 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Tammy Faye Bakker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late stage cancer videos.</v>

2501
01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Is that from diet coke?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was addicted to diet coke and there's</v>

2502
01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:31.950
<v Speaker 4>no correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No connection.</v>

2503
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean except for the fact that she </v>
<v Speaker 4>drank.</v>

2504
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:39.470
<v Speaker 4>She was one of those people who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to diet coke and drink </v>

2505
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.470
<v Speaker 4>boatloads of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2506
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:40.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying there's a correlation </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I.</v>

2507
01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.440
<v Speaker 3>It could have been super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super unhealthy and all sorts of ways.</v>

2508
01:57:43.441 --> 01:57:43.860
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

2509
01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:45.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just something.</v>

2510
01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.600
<v Speaker 4>It's never been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never been proven.</v>

2511
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:50.090
<v Speaker 4>But there is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a,</v>

2512
01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:54.140
<v Speaker 4>I think there is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people do think that diet coke,</v>

2513
01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.870
<v Speaker 4>like you just said causes cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2514
01:57:56.871 --> 01:57:59.030
<v Speaker 4>and she drank a fuck load.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like her.</v>

2515
01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:01.460
<v Speaker 4>She would have like something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some ridiculous amount,</v>

2516
01:58:01.461 --> 01:58:06.461
<v Speaker 4>like 15 a day or 20 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like more than you should ever have.</v>

2517
01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2518
01:58:08.361 --> 01:58:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>

2546
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:17.310
<v Speaker 6>things you could see a person doing </v>

2547
01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:20.940
<v Speaker 6>it sort of inoculates you to insincerity</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he gets a look at it.</v>

2550
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:29.990
<v Speaker 6>no emotional connection to their words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no connection to me as the person </v>

2551
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.240
<v Speaker 6>receiving these words.</v>

2552
01:59:30.450 --> 01:59:32.910

02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 6>this just deep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>deep,</v>

2586
02:01:40.281 --> 02:01:44.090
<v Speaker 6>deep desire to believe that someone has </v>
<v Speaker 6>answers.</v>

2587
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.610
<v Speaker 6>Leadership Addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2588
02:01:46.230 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 6>What's a chimpanzee shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leftover Championship.</v>

2590

<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2591
02:01:50.471 --> 02:01:51.970
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the guy.</v>

2592
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:53.380
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2593
02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:57.850
<v Speaker 4>there is a underneath everything there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2594
02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I think this is what makes me different </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a lot of people.</v>

2595
02:02:01.121 --> 02:02:03.490
<v Speaker 4>I think some people don't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think underneath everything,</v>

2596
02:02:03.491 --> 02:02:05.920
<v Speaker 4>there's an intelligence that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2597
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:11.890
<v Speaker 4>that's filled with love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just love that thing when you were </v>

2598
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:11.890
<v Speaker 4>on Dmt and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you,</v>

2599
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:11.890
<v Speaker 4>I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>

2600
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:13.180
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that thing is real.</v>

2601
02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:16.450
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need a leader.</v>

2602
02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:18.970
<v Speaker 4>You don't need someone to tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing is saying to you.</v>

2603
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.000
<v Speaker 4>It's your own relationship with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and how closely you can </v>

2604
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.590
<v Speaker 4>approximate what that thing is saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that defines your level of happiness.</v>

2605
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this incarnation.</v>

2606
02:02:29.230 --> 02:02:34.230
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people like that who falsely </v>

2607
02:02:34.230 --> 02:02:35.170
<v Speaker 4>represent that thing who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>never really experienced it.</v>

2608
02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:36.760
<v Speaker 4>And that's why it seems like bullshit.</v>

2609
02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:42.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like bullshit to everybody who </v>

2610
02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:44.741
<v Speaker 6>hasn't experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you run into extremely angry </v>

2611
02:02:44.741 --> 02:02:48.071
<v Speaker 6>people that just have pitfall after </v>
<v Speaker 6>pitfall in their life and the miserable </v>

2612
02:02:48.071 --> 02:02:50.060
<v Speaker 6>experience after miserable experience </v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2613
02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:55.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you realize that they're just so </v>

2614
02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:55.120
<v Speaker 6>separate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

2615
02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 6>so far separated from the frequency of </v>
<v Speaker 6>happiness,</v>

2616
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:00.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it sounds like some hippie bullshit,</v>

2617
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:02.630
<v Speaker 6>the frequency of happiness really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey man,</v>

2618
02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.720
<v Speaker 6>some people just live in an economic </v>
<v Speaker 6>downturn where there's a shitty economy </v>

2619
02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:10.850
<v Speaker 6>where they live and there's no jobs and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they were born ugly.</v>

2620
02:03:10.851 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 6>So they're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2621
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:17.440

<v Speaker 6>But there's also people that live like </v>

2622
02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:20.021
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are happy as fuck in that same </v>

2623
02:03:20.021 --> 02:03:22.211
<v Speaker 6>environment and they have great friends </v>
<v Speaker 6>and wonderful experiences with their </v>

2624
02:03:22.211 --> 02:03:25.571
<v Speaker 6>loved ones and they're not constantly </v>
<v Speaker 6>embroiled in bullshit because they </v>

2625
02:03:25.571 --> 02:03:26.630
<v Speaker 6>figured out a way to orchestrate their </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment.</v>

2626
02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.280
<v Speaker 6>And that's one thing that we somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 6>another are sort of responsible for.</v>

2630
02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.930
<v Speaker 4>that's the most important point is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2631
02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:39.550
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Everyone asked catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean you're bad,</v>

2634
02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:47.080
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean you're wrong or that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've or you're cursed or anything.</v>

2635
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:52.350
<v Speaker 4>All that matters is how you react to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and all that in the only way that </v>

2636
02:03:52.661 --> 02:03:57.661
<v Speaker 4>you're going to react to that in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of way that's not terrified is if,</v>

2637
02:03:59.581 --> 02:04:04.581
<v Speaker 4>if you found a way to feel grateful is </v>
<v Speaker 4>something Tom Green set about getting </v>

2638
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:05.710
<v Speaker 4>cancer as this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2639
02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:10.900
<v Speaker 4>a description of the feeling that comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have cancer.</v>

2640
02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:14.830
<v Speaker 4>He said it's a combination of terror and</v>
<v Speaker 4>gratitude,</v>

2641
02:04:15.370 --> 02:04:16.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

2642
02:04:16.450 --> 02:04:18.640
<v Speaker 4>because once you get it and you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>passing on a fuck,</v>

2643
02:04:18.641 --> 02:04:19.270
<v Speaker 4>I get to live.</v>

2644
02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:21.400
<v Speaker 4>It really is this sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>

2645
02:04:21.401 --> 02:04:26.401
<v Speaker 4>what a beautiful thing this is exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The terror things never going to go </v>

2646
02:04:26.401 --> 02:04:27.190
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as you're living in space,</v>

2647
02:04:27.191 --> 02:04:29.230
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a fucking void,</v>

2648
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:31.570
<v Speaker 4>meteorite hit as etc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Etc.</v>

2649
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 4>But thEre is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you find that,</v>

2650
02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:35.170
<v Speaker 4>that plate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real gratitude,</v>

2651
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:36.920
<v Speaker 4>not gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where people shake their finger at you,</v>

2652
02:04:36.921 --> 02:04:41.921
<v Speaker 4>that you should be grateful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you really plug into that </v>

2653
02:04:41.921 --> 02:04:41.921
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god damn it,</v>

2654
02:04:41.921 --> 02:04:42.420
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything lights up.</v>

2655
02:04:42.690 --> 02:04:45.390
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what the thing is,</v>

2656
02:04:45.391 --> 02:04:50.391
<v Speaker 4>it's happening to you lose your joB,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your wife's cheating on and you're </v>

2657
02:04:50.391 --> 02:04:51.120
<v Speaker 4>cheating on your whatever the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you plug into that underlying thing,</v>

2658
02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:53.640
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a beautiful,</v>

2659
02:04:53.641 --> 02:04:56.880
<v Speaker 4>beautiful place and it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>subversive idea.</v>

2660
02:04:57.270 --> 02:05:02.270
<v Speaker 4>The idea that everything is okay and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that behind everything is just this </v>

2661
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:05.310
<v Speaker 4>field of just the happiness frequency </v>
<v Speaker 4>does that stuff</v>

2662
02:05:05.470 --> 02:05:10.470
<v Speaker 6>feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the hardest thing to overcome in </v>

2663
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.960
<v Speaker 6>life when you started out in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>direction,</v>

2664
02:05:10.961 --> 02:05:15.820
<v Speaker 6>if you'd gotten fairly far in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're really miserable and you have</v>

2665
02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 6>a lot of obligations and you have lots </v>
<v Speaker 6>of expectations and bills and a lot of </v>

2666
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:23.800
<v Speaker 6>issues that keep you in the certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>shitty environment and people don't know</v>

2667
02:05:23.801 --> 02:05:28.801
<v Speaker 6>how to manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think that's why one of the most </v>

2668
02:05:28.801 --> 02:05:32.881
<v Speaker 6>important things to stress is get off on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the right track as quickly as you can </v>

2669
02:05:34.511 --> 02:05:36.730
<v Speaker 6>with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean by the right track,</v>

2670
02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:38.950
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the right track is for you.</v>

2671
02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:44.760
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to say don't listen to your</v>
<v Speaker 6>parents because you might be an idiot </v>

2672
02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:44.760
<v Speaker 6>and your parents might be dead,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

2673
02:05:45.370 --> 02:05:50.370
<v Speaker 6>but you might have an idea that your </v>
<v Speaker 6>parents can't wrap their fucking puny </v>

2674
02:05:50.370 --> 02:05:53.710
<v Speaker 6>brains around to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might be talented in one way,</v>

2675
02:05:53.711 --> 02:05:56.200
<v Speaker 6>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or form that your father doesn't want to</v>

2676
02:05:56.201 --> 02:05:58.470
<v Speaker 6>see his creation go off to be.</v>

2677
02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:00.750
<v Speaker 6>And ultimately you are your own person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

2678
02:06:00.751 --> 02:06:05.751
<v Speaker 6>you really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many people that have lived </v>

2679
02:06:05.751 --> 02:06:05.751
<v Speaker 6>their life for other people and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>miserable.</v>

2680
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:10.830
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never met an ecstatic son of the </v>

2681
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:12.250
<v Speaker 6>owner of a business who runs the </v>
<v Speaker 6>business with his father.</v>

2682
02:06:12.490 --> 02:06:17.490
<v Speaker 6>I always see a man who probably would </v>
<v Speaker 6>rather have carved his own path in life </v>

2683
02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:21.511
<v Speaker 6>and it's just caught up in the wake of </v>
<v Speaker 6>another man because that other man </v>

2684
02:06:21.511 --> 02:06:21.511
<v Speaker 6>raised him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 6>Like the ability to do it correctly once</v>
<v Speaker 6>achieved doesn't really go away unless </v>

2747
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:08.360
<v Speaker 6>you lose the fucking plot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2748
02:09:08.361 --> 02:09:11.300
<v Speaker 6>you lose the frequency in life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you're a comic,</v>

2749
02:09:11.301 --> 02:09:13.910
<v Speaker 6>I expect to expect to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2750
02:09:13.911 --> 02:09:18.911
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I've had better sets like </v>
<v Speaker 6>these last couple of months than I've </v>

2751
02:09:18.911 --> 02:09:23.741
<v Speaker 6>ever had in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had better moments I think on my </v>

2752
02:09:23.741 --> 02:09:23.741
<v Speaker 6>moments are better.</v>

2753
02:09:23.741 --> 02:09:26.270
<v Speaker 6>I think like the like new bits are </v>
<v Speaker 6>coming together in a better way.</v>

2754
02:09:26.271 --> 02:09:31.271
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm super super pleased with things</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm concentrating on it because </v>

2755
02:09:31.271 --> 02:09:35.291
<v Speaker 6>I've worked at it for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>decades and I think that as long as you </v>

2756
02:09:35.291 --> 02:09:39.971
<v Speaker 6>recognize that that's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that as long as you live your life the </v>

2757
02:09:39.971 --> 02:09:44.591
<v Speaker 6>way we were talking earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the right way without too much bullshit </v>

2758
02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:48.431
<v Speaker 6>and distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>too many negative karmic moments that </v>

2759
02:09:48.431 --> 02:09:49.640
<v Speaker 6>flood you with regret and fuck with your</v>
<v Speaker 6>creativity.</v>

2760
02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:52.940
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the most important things </v>
<v Speaker 6>about being creative.</v>

2761
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:56.000
<v Speaker 6>One of the most important things for me </v>
<v Speaker 6>is being nice when I'm,</v>

2762
02:09:56.060 --> 02:10:00.060
<v Speaker 6>when I'm like as nice as manY people as </v>
<v Speaker 6>I can and I'm as,</v>

2763
02:10:00.061 --> 02:10:04.160
<v Speaker 6>as easygoing as possible and as </v>
<v Speaker 6>forgiving as possible.</v>

2764
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:09.370
<v Speaker 6>I am the most happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm my most happiest when I'm dealing </v>

2765
02:10:09.370 --> 02:10:10.000
<v Speaker 6>with people and like being forgiving </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2766
02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:15.020
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and being friendly and then I have less </v>

2767
02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:15.020
<v Speaker 6>shit on my mind.</v>

2768
02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:18.970
<v Speaker 6>And then I can tune into creativity </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I don't understand exactly where</v>

2769
02:10:20.181 --> 02:10:22.460
<v Speaker 6>my creativity comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but as in,</v>

2770
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:27.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lifetime of trying to figure out what,</v>

2771
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:31.190
<v Speaker 6>what frequency I tune into when I do my </v>
<v Speaker 6>best,</v>

2772
02:10:31.191 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 6>whether it's drawing or whether writing </v>
<v Speaker 6>or anything creative for me,</v>

2773
02:10:35.931 --> 02:10:40.931
<v Speaker 6>I have to have all these ducks in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the big duck is my own psychic </v>

2774
02:10:44.090 --> 02:10:46.160
<v Speaker 6>psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but my own consciousness,</v>

2775
02:10:46.170 --> 02:10:46.650
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

2776
02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:50.180
<v Speaker 6>my appraisal of my own consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How am I,</v>

2777
02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:53.720
<v Speaker 6>how am I interacting with this world </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I'm finding myself in?</v>

2778
02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:57.320
<v Speaker 6>Am I out of control and my fucking too </v>
<v Speaker 6>much gas on a break.</v>

2779
02:10:57.321 --> 02:10:59.830
<v Speaker 6>So my too much breaks down enough gas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2780
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:01.760
<v Speaker 6>what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what am I holding myself back?</v>

2781
02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:05.870
<v Speaker 6>Am I limiting myself with my diet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Am I limiting myself with my actions?</v>

2782
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:08.960
<v Speaker 6>Am I limiting myself with my.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What am I doing in Missouri?</v>

2783
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:10.220
<v Speaker 6>Is everything cool?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2784
02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 6>Now if everything is cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I can go to work.</v>

2785
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.760
<v Speaker 6>But if everything's not cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to figure out what the fuck is </v>

2786
02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:19.040
<v Speaker 6>not cool and fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if I don't fix that,</v>

2787
02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:24.340
<v Speaker 6>it'll be bumpy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll be the whole thing will be me </v>

2788
02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:26.891
<v Speaker 6>trying to duct tape this fucking ship </v>
<v Speaker 6>together while it reenters orbit and </v>

2789
02:11:26.891 --> 02:11:27.800
<v Speaker 6>fucking keep everything from falling </v>
<v Speaker 6>apart,</v>

2790
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:33.070
<v Speaker 6>but as long as you give yourself an </v>
<v Speaker 6>honest assessment of how you're thinking</v>

2791
02:11:34.821 --> 02:11:36.350
<v Speaker 6>and how you're interacting with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

2792
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:41.770
<v Speaker 6>that's where it gets fucking hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to take that first step and </v>

2793
02:11:41.770 --> 02:11:43.820
<v Speaker 6>give yourself an honest look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself,</v>

2794
02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:45.830
<v Speaker 6>give yourself an.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then once you do that,</v>

2795
02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:48.380
<v Speaker 6>then it has to sort of become an ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2796
02:11:48.381 --> 02:11:50.240
<v Speaker 6>and you've got a welcome and when other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people do it too.</v>

2797
02:11:50.241 --> 02:11:53.480
<v Speaker 6>Even haters when haters like point </v>
<v Speaker 6>something out about you.</v>

2798
02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.270
<v Speaker 6>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2799
02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.140
<v Speaker 6>you got to like accept that like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2800
02:11:57.141 --> 02:11:59.690
<v Speaker 6>sometimes they get ya.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes they're right,</v>

2801
02:11:59.691 --> 02:12:00.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2802
02:12:00.161 --> 02:12:05.161
<v Speaker 6>you did something douchey or you were a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little weird there or you could have </v>

2803
02:12:05.161 --> 02:12:07.070
<v Speaker 6>reacted a different way and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>even necessarily mean you're meant to.</v>

2804
02:12:07.071 --> 02:12:10.370
<v Speaker 6>Like sometimes you just get picked door </v>
<v Speaker 6>number two and it's like,</v>

2805
02:12:10.371 --> 02:12:13.030
<v Speaker 6>what am I even saying this for?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You start saying something,</v>

2806
02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:16.610
<v Speaker 6>it's not even doesn't even represent </v>
<v Speaker 6>necessarily how you feel.</v>

2807
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:21.611
<v Speaker 6>it's just a possibility of how to react </v>
<v Speaker 6>and all of a sudden you're off to the </v>

2808
02:12:21.611 --> 02:12:22.800
<v Speaker 6>races and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nah,</v>

2809
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:23.420
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2810
02:12:23.421 --> 02:12:25.130
<v Speaker 6>how many times have we said that in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation as well?</v>

2811
02:12:25.131 --> 02:12:26.930
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2812
02:12:26.931 --> 02:12:29.180
<v Speaker 6>It's like you don't even know sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're saying things,</v>

2813
02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:34.250
<v Speaker 6>but when someone calls you out on that </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they they put it's probably good for</v>

2814
02:12:34.251 --> 02:12:34.310
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

2815
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:39.310
<v Speaker 6>It's not good for them because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>times haters get fucking completely </v>

2816
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:42.491
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You figured to hope you sucked full of </v>

2817
02:12:42.491 --> 02:12:43.250
<v Speaker 6>million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Duke's you drone world of semen and aids</v>

2818
02:12:43.251 --> 02:12:48.251
<v Speaker 6>and this is the people that get </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely ridiculous with their hate </v>

2819
02:12:48.251 --> 02:12:51.230
<v Speaker 6>and almost all of them are losers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a real problem.</v>

2820
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:54.590
<v Speaker 6>When you look at like what a hater is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is no successful haters.</v>

2821
02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:59.620
<v Speaker 6>There's no like bill clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop fucking commenting on youtube </v>

2822
02:12:59.620 --> 02:12:59.620
<v Speaker 6>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking queer,</v>

2823
02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:03.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like no one who actually </v>

2824
02:13:03.971 --> 02:13:05.981
<v Speaker 6>accomplished anything is a hater,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but being a hater is important for </v>

2825
02:13:07.041 --> 02:13:12.041
<v Speaker 6>people that are trying to accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 6>things like having critics and hate can </v>

2826
02:13:12.041 --> 02:13:16.181
<v Speaker 6>actually help you and fuel you and make </v>
<v Speaker 6>you aware of the broad spectrum of human</v>

2827
02:13:17.571 --> 02:13:22.571
<v Speaker 6>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially like in a void of love and </v>

2828
02:13:22.571 --> 02:13:24.980
<v Speaker 6>absence of the correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't lash out like that unless</v>

2829
02:13:24.981 --> 02:13:29.981
<v Speaker 6>you are in an absence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's see you an absence of love and </v>

2830
02:13:29.981 --> 02:13:31.440
<v Speaker 6>absence of personal pride and </v>
<v Speaker 6>accomplishment of absence,</v>

2831
02:13:31.441 --> 02:13:34.410
<v Speaker 6>of feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you don't feel good so you lash out</v>

2832
02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.040
<v Speaker 6>because if you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could find something everyday that </v>

2833
02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:41.520
<v Speaker 6>you hated and just fill your day with </v>
<v Speaker 6>hate all day,</v>

2834
02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:43.770
<v Speaker 6>anger and hate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could just do that.</v>

2835
02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 6>You could just do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you only do that if you're an idiot.</v>

2836
02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:50.530
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:53.860
<v Speaker 4>You're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not idiot,</v>

2838
02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:55.010
<v Speaker 4>idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2839
02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:56.800
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're stuck in a terrible path.</v>

2840
02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:58.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're stuck in a pattern.</v>

2841
02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:00.640
<v Speaker 6>Terrible pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is.</v>

2842
02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:04.180
<v Speaker 6>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't help you in any way,</v>

2843
02:14:04.181 --> 02:14:07.450
<v Speaker 6>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in fact it limits you by keeping you</v>

2844
02:14:07.451 --> 02:14:08.740
<v Speaker 6>in this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2845
02:14:08.741 --> 02:14:12.820
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this negative mindset.</v>

2846
02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:15.460
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for me to relate to those </v>
<v Speaker 4>haters.</v>

2847
02:14:15.490 --> 02:14:15.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2848
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:21.230
<v Speaker 4>the new internet breed of haters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't have that when I was </v>

2849
02:14:21.230 --> 02:14:23.620
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of douche bags I can relate </v>
<v Speaker 4>to because I can think,</v>

2850
02:14:23.621 --> 02:14:25.150
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was that kind of douche bag.</v>

2851
02:14:25.151 --> 02:14:30.151
<v Speaker 4>I know what that kind of douche bag is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but internet haters is more difficult,</v>

2852
02:14:30.161 --> 02:14:31.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a tweet,</v>

2853
02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:36.660
<v Speaker 4>tweet haters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've noticed that if you get hate </v>

2854
02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:37.360
<v Speaker 4>tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go to their timeline.</v>

2855
02:14:37.361 --> 02:14:39.570
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they're all hate and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>hate.</v>

2856
02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:41.920
<v Speaker 4>You scan down and it's just one vial </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2857
02:14:41.921 --> 02:14:46.921
<v Speaker 4>There's many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they've got a list of people </v>

2858
02:14:46.921 --> 02:14:47.920
<v Speaker 4>and they just are like launching </v>
<v Speaker 4>vileness it as many people as they can.</v>

2859
02:14:48.190 --> 02:14:51.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just like one every five.</v>

2860
02:14:51.221 --> 02:14:54.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you have 40 hate tweets in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a row,</v>

2861
02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:57.700

<v Speaker 4>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like now you're just some weird lunatic </v>

2863
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:04.420
<v Speaker 4>firing missiles into the void for no </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

2864
02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:05.950
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2865
02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:06.720
<v Speaker 4>but other than</v>

2866
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:11.770
<v Speaker 3>you're and you're choosing to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're choosing to try to reach out and </v>

2867
02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:15.440
<v Speaker 3>affect someone in a negative way instead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of concentrating on your own life</v>

2868
02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:19.870
<v Speaker 6>like you have made it more important to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do that.</v>

2869
02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:23.710
<v Speaker 6>Then anything else you were doing right </v>
<v Speaker 6>then because you chose it,</v>

2870
02:15:23.711 --> 02:15:25.780
<v Speaker 6>you chose it as your writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those things.</v>

2871
02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.340
<v Speaker 6>You chose it above any self improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were doing any creative work.</v>

2872
02:15:30.341 --> 02:15:33.370
<v Speaker 6>You are doing any business work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were doing,</v>

2873
02:15:33.550 --> 02:15:35.900
<v Speaker 6>any personal emails you've got to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

2874
02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:36.310
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2875
02:15:36.311 --> 02:15:41.311
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You chose to call someone you know a </v>

2876
02:15:41.311 --> 02:15:42.280
<v Speaker 6>terrible name on twitter like you chose </v>
<v Speaker 6>to say,</v>

2877
02:15:42.281 --> 02:15:45.820
<v Speaker 6>I hope this a dumb cunt drowned in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>river of aids.</v>

2878
02:15:45.970 --> 02:15:47.890
<v Speaker 6>You decided to put that onto dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your.</v>

2879
02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:50.830
<v Speaker 6>That was your choice at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unless it's really funny.</v>

2880
02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:53.020
<v Speaker 6>If it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it's different.</v>

2881
02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:55.010
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to 50.</v>

2882
02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:56.540
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's funny,</v>

2883
02:15:56.541 --> 02:16:01.541
<v Speaker 4>you want to have 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like when you go and look and </v>

2884
02:16:01.541 --> 02:16:01.541
<v Speaker 4>like not only is the person just </v>
<v Speaker 4>insulted you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've seen these,</v>

2887
02:16:07.221 --> 02:16:07.350

2888
02:16:07.410 --> 02:16:12.410
<v Speaker 3>texts,</v>

2889
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.960
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask idiots.</v>

2890
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.250
<v Speaker 3>Mma fighters are constantly dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2895
02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:26.761
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them that I thought was really </v>

2896
02:16:26.761 --> 02:16:26.761
<v Speaker 3>hilarious was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a woman who's a,</v>

2897
02:16:26.761 --> 02:16:29.840
<v Speaker 3>a comedy writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she got into online twitter with a</v>

2898
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.160
<v Speaker 6>chris brown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2899
02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:32.980

<v Speaker 6>Jenny was her name.</v>

2900
02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:35.890
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember if I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's a,</v>

2901
02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:37.990

<v Speaker 6>what I go.</v>

2903
02:16:40.931 --> 02:16:43.550
<v Speaker 6>Why would he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then I read it and he's like,</v>

2904
02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:45.400
<v Speaker 6>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking to old.</v>

<v Speaker 6>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she goes,</v>

<v Speaker 6>shit as a human being tends to age you?</v>

2908
02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:53.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm paraphrasing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know exactly how she said it,</v>

2909
02:16:54.130 --> 02:16:59.130
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then he went at her and this and </v>

2910
02:16:59.130 --> 02:17:01.841
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she started it like he didn't beat </v>

2911
02:17:01.841 --> 02:17:01.841
<v Speaker 6>her up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2912
02:17:01.841 --> 02:17:04.870
<v Speaker 6>And this is like years later to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone sniping at you constantly.</v>

2913
02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:08.260
<v Speaker 6>It's got to be annoying and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 6>sticking up for chris brown in any way,</v>

2914
02:17:08.261 --> 02:17:10.600
<v Speaker 6>shape or form or anybody that beats up </v>
<v Speaker 6>the girlfriend.</v>

2915
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:12.700
<v Speaker 6>But she started it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>

2916
02:17:12.710 --> 02:17:16.080
<v Speaker 6>she decided to tag him in that and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2917
02:17:16.081 --> 02:17:19.210
<v Speaker 6>and tweet him and fuck with him and get </v>
<v Speaker 6>him to react to her.</v>

2918
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:20.620
<v Speaker 6>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>don't want to get bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>what are you doing by stirring it up </v>

2925
02:17:33.550 --> 02:17:33.550
<v Speaker 6>with him?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2926
02:17:33.550 --> 02:17:33.700
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

2927
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 4>She instigated a dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dummy reacted.</v>

2928
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:42.001
<v Speaker 4>She analyzed his psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows this is a man who will swing </v>

2929
02:17:42.001 --> 02:17:42.001
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lady,</v>

2930
02:17:42.001 --> 02:17:44.890
<v Speaker 4>she came out and won some sassy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2931
02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:49.900
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like throwing salmon in front of a </v>

2932
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:49.900
<v Speaker 4>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clearly.</v>

2933
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:49.900
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2934
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:50.680
<v Speaker 6>that's not how they reported it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

2935
02:17:50.681 --> 02:17:54.320
<v Speaker 6>He viciously went after her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>viciously attacked her.</v>

2936
02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:56.680
<v Speaker 6>When she started it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was dancing.</v>

2937
02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The moment that dumbed down were </v>

2938
02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:02.600
<v Speaker 4>responded to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She must've done a fucking tap dance.</v>

2939
02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:06.880
<v Speaker 6>I wonder because I would think that if </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a guy who's like really violent </v>

2940
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:10.661
<v Speaker 6>and you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think just the fact that that </v>

2941
02:18:10.661 --> 02:18:12.941
<v Speaker 6>guy knows who you are and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>defend yourself if you ever ran into </v>

2942
02:18:12.941 --> 02:18:12.941
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chris thought,</v>

2943
02:18:12.941 --> 02:18:14.960
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely you don't think of crispr.</v>

2944
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.510
<v Speaker 6>She said a bunch of mean shit about him </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he,</v>

2945
02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:21.530
<v Speaker 6>he saw somewhere he might palm her face </v>
<v Speaker 6>inspire mansion.</v>

2946
02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:26.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying if no one was around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one was around in her mind.</v>

2947
02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:30.050
<v Speaker 6>She has to realize that if she ran into </v>
<v Speaker 6>that guy and no one was there to protect</v>

2948
02:18:30.051 --> 02:18:32.270
<v Speaker 6>her and there was no security cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was no witnesses.</v>

2949
02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:35.300
<v Speaker 6>He might do something to her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's reality.</v>

2950
02:18:35.330 --> 02:18:38.930
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that feeling is why it's dangerous.</v>

2951
02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:41.840
<v Speaker 6>That feeling is what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That has to be in her head.</v>

2952
02:18:42.170 --> 02:18:43.640
<v Speaker 6>You start fucking with a guy like that.</v>

2953
02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 6>The beat up his girlfriend in her head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she has to know that if her husband </v>

2954

<v Speaker 6>isn't there or some know maybe her </v>
<v Speaker 6>husband isn't there.</v>

2955
02:18:49.731 --> 02:18:51.860
<v Speaker 6>I don't know who her husband is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Her husband might be kind of a pussy.</v>

2956
02:18:51.861 --> 02:18:56.861
<v Speaker 6>You might fold under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you might run into a situation </v>

2957
02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:57.770

<v Speaker 6>What are you going to.</v>

2959
02:18:58.991 --> 02:19:02.010

<v Speaker 6>get to that place now,</v>

2960
